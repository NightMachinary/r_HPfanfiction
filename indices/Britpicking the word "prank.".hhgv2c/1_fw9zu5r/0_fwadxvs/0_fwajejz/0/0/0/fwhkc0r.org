I worry a bit about the author who write such pranks.

They also like to write "banters" that are really mean-spirited. To me, it often more mean mockery and insults than teasing and taking the piss of your friend.

I feel like they have been victim of such humiliations and insults and mockery but they internalized that it was "just jokes" and "not a big deal", ignoring how hurt they actually were by it.

And that rarely turn good later in life.
