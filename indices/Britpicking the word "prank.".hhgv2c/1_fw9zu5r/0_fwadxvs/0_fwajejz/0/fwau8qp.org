There a difference between a last day of school prank war, and what we see in fanfictions.

I work at a school. Usually, the friday closest to June 21th, last year students comes in disguises,, we have a talent show, and they play pranks to each others.

We know about it. We let it go, we let them blow off some steam. HOWEVER we keep an extra eyes on everything, we're on high alert to make sure that nothing got out of hand.

We might act oblivious and surprised and all, but we know. Most of the time, we let them do whatever they planned, as long as it's safe and doesn't humiliate anyone.
