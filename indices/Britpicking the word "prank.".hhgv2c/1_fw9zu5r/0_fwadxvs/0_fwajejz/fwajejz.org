I had a prank war in my boarding school against another 'house' (we called them groups). And prank day on our last day of school as graduates. Part of the prank was to somehow steal the keys from the headmaster and then decorate the school overnight. so yes, prank wars exist. Of course, for us under a different name and different language, but they exist.
