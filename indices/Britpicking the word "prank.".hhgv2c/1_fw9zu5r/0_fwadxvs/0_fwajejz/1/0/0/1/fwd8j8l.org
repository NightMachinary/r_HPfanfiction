I follow what your putting down here, but I think if the teachers are expecting to stop major disruptions, and in general act more as we'd expect professionals to act at a highly rated school, then making Umbridge's life hell would be stopped pretty quick. They may hate her, but I doubt they'd let her spend a week being turned into a toad. Instead, if she acted just like in book 5, then I would expect these better teachers to get rid of her through proper channels, like the board of governors, or even Dumbledore just firing her and then using 100 years of life experience to give proper evidence of her crimes and piss poor teaching.
