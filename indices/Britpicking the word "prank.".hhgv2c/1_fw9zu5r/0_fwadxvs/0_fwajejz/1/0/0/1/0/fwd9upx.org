They couldn't though. That's the point. The ministry had them between a rock and a hard place - Umbridge was unsackable. That's why they allowed stuff like the swamp and encouraged Peeves to go after her - they're stuck with her and if she's going to make their lives hell, they will make her stay as uncomfortable as possible. That's explained in canon.

Basically, the reason the staff saw Umbridge as different is that she was. She isn't on "their team," she's literally there to catch them out. She's as bad for the staff as she is for the students, and they have no higher authority to complain about her to - the ministry have decreed she stays. That is now the law.

But the teachers reacting the same way in fics when, for example, Snape, gets pranked just isn't realistic. Snape is a git, but he's still "team Hogwarts" so his colleagues will protect him.

Plus the stuff with Umbridge, they just pretend there's nothing they can do to help in canon (and she's made a rod for her own back in many ways, with the rules like "teachers can only speak to students about their lessons" - "oh I'm sorry Delores, I would be able to fix this but I'm /simply not allowed/ to ask Fred and George which spells they used, oh dearie me" exit Flitwick...) They don't /give points directly for the prank./ That's what bothers me, fics where Dumbledore literally stands up and rewards students for disruption of the school or for attacking a teacher.
