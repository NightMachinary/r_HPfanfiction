The vast majority of instances I've seen like that in fanfics that resulted in points were either completely harmless or easily reversable by the teachers. Sure there will still be some outliers, but why is it so hard to believe that a character like Dumbledore would play along with or reward a harmless joke that provides entertainment rather than hurting people? I agree with you on Mcgonagall, but that's only because her rewarding points for something like that is so out of character, not because her position at the school makes it unbelievable.
