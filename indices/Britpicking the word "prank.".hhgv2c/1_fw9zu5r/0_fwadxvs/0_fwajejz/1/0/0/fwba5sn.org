Yeah I agree with all that, but there's fics where something will happen in the Great Hall such as everyone's hair turns pink, or the plates of food disappear every time someone tries to eat, or the candles turn into birds and fly around crapping on everything and this also affects the teachers. And Dumbledores reaction is to /laugh and award points for "creativity"./ That's the point where I think it gets ridiculous.

I can absolutely see Snape ignoring or quietly encouraging Draco to sabotage Hermione's work, for example. He is a mean mean man and shouldn't be a teacher. But the idea that these kind of jokes and pranks, done in front of the whole school, would win points from Dumbledore or even in some cases McGonagall is just laughable.

Teachers in general are more likely to be upset by something that causes disruption than they are by one or two people's feelings being hurt, and that's why the fics when Fred and George (or the Marauders, depending on era) are /rewarded/ for disruption of the whole school day just really set my teeth on edge.

The obvious exception is for fics where everyone is trying to make Umbridge's life hell. McGonagall would 100% have supported that shit.
