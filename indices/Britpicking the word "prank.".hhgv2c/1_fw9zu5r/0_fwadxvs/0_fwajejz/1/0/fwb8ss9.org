Yeah, but then isn't that true to cannon still? While in a perfect world you're right, hogwarts was far from perfect. Maliciousness went unpunished to a large degree and was at times perpetrated by the very professors you're saying would have shut it down. And if that holds true for canon, which it certainly does even though you could argue the degree to which it was present, I don't see why it shouldn't be extrapolated in fanfiction. There's also the fact that it is a boarding school, which means aspects of life that are usually separated from school in more conventional education settings become interwoven into the school experience.
