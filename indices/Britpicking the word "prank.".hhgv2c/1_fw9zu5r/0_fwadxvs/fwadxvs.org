Yes, absolutely agree with this.

Schools irl do not escalate into prank wars (or trick or joke wars, whatever you want to call it). The teachers don't let it, because they do not have time for that shit. They just want to do their jobs and go home. The fics where the Marauders do horrible things that affect all of Slytherin, like turning their hair into slime or whatever, and /Dumbledore gives them house points for "making us all laugh"/ absolutely grind my gears.

It's a school. Yes it's a school of magic, but the basic rules of being there to learn not to be a jackass still apply.
