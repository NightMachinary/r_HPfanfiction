This is the reason that I dislike when the fic focuses on the prank stuff too much. Because lets face it, any kind of disagreement between someone who has lost a family member and someone who is the child of the guilty person, would be deadly within moments. We are talking about hormone raging teenagers all holding deadly weapons in their hands. The prank war stuff isn't something anyone in their rational mind would think of for even more than a few minutes in a situation of real war.
