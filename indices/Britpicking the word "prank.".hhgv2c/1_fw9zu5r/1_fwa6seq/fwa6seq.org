Given that half of Slytherin are the children of Death Eaters and a good chunk of the school has lost family in the last war, IMO any prank war would escalate into physical violence pretty quickly because there is a lot of bad blood. And that's not mentioning that a lot of fanon pranks are nothing short of sexual assault, or that what the twins did to Montague in canon would have been grievous bodily harm if he had not been working for a woman who tortured children (making it self defense).
