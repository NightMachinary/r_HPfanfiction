You see, we did all this at our school as well (I started secondary school in 1997, so exactly when the books were being written) but nobody called them "pranks." Big jokes like that were called "tricks," but low level mischief was known as, well, mischief. Or "ragging." Or "a practical joke."

The first time I ever remember hearing the term prank or prankster was in the Offsprings song, Original Prankster. And I had to see the video to understand that the song was about a kid who played tricks on people.
