Really? Huh. I wonder if it's a regional/generational thing, as I've never had anything like that in any of my schools at any year level - small town in the North for Primary/Secondary, and Big Northern Cities for Sixth Form and Uni, from early 2000s through to this year, in case you were wondering. The closest I've ever seen/heard of happening was a few kids turning up blind drunk to a General Studies exam at A-Level.
