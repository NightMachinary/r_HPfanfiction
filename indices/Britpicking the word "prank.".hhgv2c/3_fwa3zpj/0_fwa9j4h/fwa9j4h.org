If it is an Americanism, it has penetrated British culture fairly thoroughly. At a lot of British schools people talk about "leavers' pranks", i.e. acts of vandalism performed by the Upper Sixth overnight before the final day of school.

In my year we had:

- Washing machine on the roof of the sports centre.

- Giant penis burnt into the grass of the front lawn.

- Door to the staff room bricked up. A decent job of it too.

- A message in red paint on the wall of the science building: THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.
