Honestly, the number of "pranks" Fred and George do through the entire series can be counted on one hand.

They're unruly students and cause headaches for their teachers - they break curfew, they sneak away from school, they sneak into the forest, they get a lot of detentions, they backtalk to teachers (probably), and they pick fights with Slytherins - all of this can be called troublemaking. None of that is "pranking" though.

But nope, Fred and George are "pranksters". Smh
