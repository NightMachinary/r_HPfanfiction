Ah, yes. Poor Montague, kissing up to Umbridge who was making students write lines in their own blood. How dare his peers not take kindly to that?!

Yeah, no. Being a blood supremacist and kissing up to a toady like Umbridge...in real life, where I come from, you'd get the living daylights thrashed out of you if you do shit like that. And IMO, you'd deserve it too.

I don't consider it "bullying" or pranking. You kiss up to someone like Umbridge, well you better believe that you're going to get your teeth punched in.
