British person, and whilst I agree that when HP was set the term â€˜prank' wouldn't be used, and especially not in Marauders' era, I actually don't have a problem with this word too much because it's a commonly used word in the U.K. now. It's a US import, but it is definitely used amongst young people particularly now (and was even being used when I was in secondary school during the noughties) and so for Next Gen kind of era would kind of expect this phrase to get used.

I use the term prank in my own fics, but I use it interchangeably with joke and practical joke. I actually like prank better than joke because it encapsulates some of the nastier elements of practical jokes that I feel the term joke downplays.
