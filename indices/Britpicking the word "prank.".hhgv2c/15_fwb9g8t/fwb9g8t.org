Interestingly, I've lived in the UK most of my life, and I never picked up on this one! I think 'playing pranks' does fit in alright with British English, although to my ear it does sound a bit old-fashioned and perhaps fitting in /with/ Marauder-era better than main canon era! (fitting in with other similar sounding words like 'japes')

I wonder whether perhaps some of those terms /were/ changed into 'prank' in the US editions of the books and as such FF writers have been simply continuing the terminology, rather than replacing it actively. I know we found that in discussion on this sub before re the likes of Mrs Weasley's annual Christmas sweaters (jumpers in the original British English, which iirc in US English is some kind of a pinafore dress, correct?)
