Out of the Night by Raining Ink - After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

One of the best Dark does not mean Evil fics I have read.

Raining Ink pulled it around 2012 as they want to write their own books. It has since been reposted to [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] by RememberFics, with full credit going to the original author.

This is what RememberFics posted about this story.

This author only had one main story but what a story it was! One of the most popular fanfiction of the *Harry Potter* fandom on this site, the worldbuilding this writer did was phenominal. The way magical society is broadened and deepened is often very similar between different stories but that is a trap this author didn't fall into and the writing just felt magical. In fact, I often wished, as I read this story, that this was canon. In the end however, the author decided that the amazing universe that they let us peek into would take too much time to finish as they instead want to dedicate more this time to Original work.
