My favorite story that's no longer available is Harry Potter and the Transfer Student, which was a fairly long one-shot by Enterprise1701-d. The author removed it, removed all the HP elements, and made it into the core of a larger work that he's selling commercially called The Magic Warped. The author has a link to the ebook on Amazon on his page.

It made sense to me to have it become a standalone non-HP story, because it had centered around a couple of visitors to Hogwarts from a very stratified and hierarchical society, presumably elsewhere in Europe, that seemed to ignore the existence of the Statute of Secrecy. The aristocrats were those most capable with magic, with lower social ranks based on ability down to the peasants who were non-magical.

They had a different system of magic and rigidly-observed niceties of social interaction.

The major thrust of the story was Harry's interaction with, learning from, and growing relationship with the senior visitor, and the problems she had with her magic and protecting Harry. In the climax, the senior visitor learns what form her magic would have taken had it not been damaged by a traumatic experience when she was younger, but she dies in the process. The story ends with Harry withdrawing from Hogwarts so that he and Sirius can join this other society.
