Slight spoilers ahead:

I was going to guess it could be [[http://heckyeahdrarry.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/reparations-and-foundations.html][Reparations and it's sequel Foundations by Sara's Girl.]] In the sequel, Harry becomes responsible for Romilda Vane's young son, whom he places with Narcissa Malfoy and visits.

But there are too many differences on reflection unless you think you could be remembering a mash-up of fictions. There is no secrecy about the child, Harry is a doctor, not an auror, and Draco, who works in a drug rehab ward, is his love interest. Still, it's a good read.
