  Slapping someone is excusable if that someone decided to do something really stupid and immoral (for example, being unfaithful).

That sounds like a big blank check for a spouse to use physical violence anytime they dissaprove of anything. Who gets to decide what's stupid? Who gets to decide what's immoral? There are groups throughout history who have defined those words whatever way they wanted in order to justify abuse.
