Oof. I recently read an NCIS fic where the director of NCIS actually took Gibbs (the team leader) to task for repeated head slaps of his teammate, and also the woman on the team, because she kept telling the slapped guy that he deserved it. It was really refreshing. The fic itself wasn't that great, but it was nice to see people get called out on their shit.
