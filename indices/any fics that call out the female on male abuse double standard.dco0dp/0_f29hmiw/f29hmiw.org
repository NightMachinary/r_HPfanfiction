I know I read something a while back that flipped the usual fandom conception of the Malfoys, so that Lucius was in over his head and Narcissa was a psychopathic monster with a cheery public face and a hair trigger in private. I think it was a non-slash friendly Draco. Maybe someone else remembers it.
