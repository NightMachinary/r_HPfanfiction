I've got a well-known pro-Hermione bias, but I am liking this fic, in the way that actions have consequences and how these consequences propagate, and it doesn't go overboard with any given character.

One bit that I didn't like is that the author kind of just assumes that there were better ways of keeping DA secret available to Hermione than the jinx that she actually used, which is a very uncharitable reading of Hermione's character. (In particular, the birds were an impulsive action, whereas the jinx was premeditated, so her being excessively violent in the latter is a bigger stain on her character than in the former.)
