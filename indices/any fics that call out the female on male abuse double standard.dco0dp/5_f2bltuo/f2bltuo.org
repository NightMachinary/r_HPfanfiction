[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569][Golden Bullets]] (still in progress) is a point-of-departure fic where the people around Ron actually take the "bird-assault" incident seriously. It also addresses other instances where Hermione's actions seriously harmed other people, such as the "sneak" incident.

I wasn't a great fan of the rather stream-of-consciousness writing style, but I'm pretty picky about that sort of thing and found it an interesting read nonetheless. linkao3(18935341)
