Yeah, the narrative painted Merope as a victim, which she of course was, but it was made pretty clear that Riddle, Sr. was not at all in the wrong for leaving her.

We're meant to pity Merope, hate Morfin and Marvolo, and feel bad about T.R. (Sr.). Merope gets more of a spotlight because she's one with agency.
