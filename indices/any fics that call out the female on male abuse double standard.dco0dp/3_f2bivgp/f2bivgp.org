In canon, this double standard is quite obvious:

- Hermione magically assaulted Ron with conjured birds and physically beat him up with fists. No consequences at all, and JKR wrote in such a way that it was all Ron's fault anyway (in the second case, Hermione did have a somewhat valid reason).
- Ginny magically assaulted Zach Smith with Bat Bogey Hex and physically ran him over with a broomstick, just for some minor transgressions. In the first instance, she was rewarded with an invitation to the Slug Club. The second time, she was rewarded with her House's support and Harry's admiration.

With the original author taking such a stance toward female-on-male violence, it's no surprise that fanfics generally continue this pattern.
