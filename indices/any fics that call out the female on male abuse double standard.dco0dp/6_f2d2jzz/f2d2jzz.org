“We have nothing---NOTHING---to say to one another.”

“I think we have plenty to say to one another,” Neville hissed, careful to keep his voice down to keep Harry and Graham, who kept their distance, from hearing.

“We don't! We're not friends, Longbottom. And you most certainly are not my boyfriend, so stop acting like it! Leave. Me. Alone!” She turned to leave, but Neville circled around stopping her.

“You meet me tonight to talk,” he whispered, practically shaking with rage.

“No way in hell,” Graces growled. “Draco offered you his friendship?” Neville took a step back as the blonde shoved him. “And you turned it down? You insulted him like that?” Another shove. “You insulted me like that?” Neville grunted as Graces pushed him again. “If you're not a friend of my brother, you sure as hell aren't a friend of mine.”

She went to shove him again, but Neville caught her wrists, holding them tightly above her elbows.

“Graces,” he started slowly, honing his own temper in. “We are a mess of dysfunction. A serious mess,” Neville repeated, meeting the blonde squarely in the eyes. “But one thing we do not do---one thing I will not tolerate---is you touching me in anger.”

Graces had a flash of defiance to her face before she yanked her arms away, defeated by his words. She stared at him for a long moment before trying to push past him. Neville held her back, his hand catching her arm, as he leaned in close to her ear.

“I'm a good man,” he whispered. “Slow to anger, quick to forgive. Maybe not the smartest, but hardworking. And maybe not the strongest, but courageous. And I love you, Graces. I love you.”

“I'm a good man,” Neville repeated. “And I'm sorry that's not enough for you. I'm sorry that the only way you can accept my love is if my arm bears the cost of my soul. I hope you will meet me tonight. That you will calm down and see what a mistake you're making and choose to talk to me rather than end something that has been so good.”
