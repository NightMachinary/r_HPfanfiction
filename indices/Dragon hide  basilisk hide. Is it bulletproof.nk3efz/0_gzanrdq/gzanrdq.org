We don't see any guns in Harry Potter so we don't know. HP dragons are very resistant to spells and even in folklore or other universes (think Smaug) they can only be killed through a chink in their armor. They also seem to be very resistant to burns and poisonous spikes. We don't know much about the basilisk but you could do whatever you want without defying canon as Harry kills it by stabbing it in the mouth.
