Surely it would depend on the bullet.\\
Given that the goblins keep their guard dragon in line by poking it with sticks and the tanned hide is canonically treated a lot like leather, dragon hide is unlikely to be effective against bullets of any significant size.\\
That being said, given that a dragon is a really big animal, you definitely need something with a tremendous amount of stopping power to take one down.

I'd say the same would be true for a basilisk.

When trying to determine the effectiveness of guns in a story apply the following test:

If a given creature is vulnerable to a wizard banishing a sword at it or a giant animated chess piece or troll hitting it with a club then said target is going to be equally inconvenienced by being shot in the face with a really big gun.

Or to put it another way, if a werewolf or a large animagus form is a legitimate threat, then so is a gunslinger.
