I'd like to think that dragons are impervious to everything except from other dragon's teeth and claws.

As for basilisks, my headcanon is spell resistant skin, and thick weapon resistant skin, but not impossible to penetrate with the right wespons. The membrane in the mouth is poison and spell resistant, but is not stab proof.
