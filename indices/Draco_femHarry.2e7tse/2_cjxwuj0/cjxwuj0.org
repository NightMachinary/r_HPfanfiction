[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War]] by astridfire. "Who says you can't fight evil and be pretty? A Girl!Harry AU, starting with Rose Potter's first year at Hogwarts."

It's a WIP but was very recently updated. Also, there is some George Weasley/fem!Harry and Cedric Diggory/fem!Harry but it's pretty clear that it will end up Draco/fem!Harry.
