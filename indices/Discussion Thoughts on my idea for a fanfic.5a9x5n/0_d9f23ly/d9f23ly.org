Just keep asking yourself so what? What differences would it make? How does that snowball? If you can keep justifying things then fine but it has the potential to get iffy. If Harry isn't friends with Ron then he isn't there when Sirius goes after him meaning nobody stops him killing Peter who then doesn't flee to Voldemort who helps crouch Jr, who then enters Harry into the triwizard, which leads to Voldemorts resurrection which leads to Umbridge etc. Are you looking to rewrite cannon with Draco or something more interesting?
