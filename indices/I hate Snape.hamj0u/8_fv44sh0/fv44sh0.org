I hate him and can't see how it's even possible for him to be a 'hero'. Correct me if I'm wrong about this bit as it's been a while since I read canon, but didn't Dumbledore say in a public trial that Snape turned traitor? What, did all the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself just forget about that? Surely Voldemort isn't going to tell a known spy anything he doesn't actually want him/the Order to know? That means that, as far as fanfiction goes, it's likely that he would either be unknowingly feeding the Order false information/leading them into ambushes, or he was actually spying on the order for Voldemort.

That went on a bit of a tangent from why I hate him but the point stands. It questions all the heroic sacrifice, brave man claims.

As for why he actually is a bastard, there's a long list of different incidents where he actively bullies children. Harry, Neville, Hermione, even seemingly random students. I seem to recall a time when he made a Hufflepuff student cry in class but I may be misremembering. Then there's all the things he presumably did as a Death Eater (a skilled duelist like Snape isn't going to be wasted only brewing potions) and the fact he was creating his own dark magic as a teenager, but the biggest one is Lily.

In the book when he tells Dumbledore that Voldemort is targeting the Potters he doesn't say protect them, he says protect /her/. He doesn't care about James or baby Harry, just the object of his obsession. If Harry had been born a day later and the Potters therefore weren't targeted, Snape would have never gone to Dumbledore. Children being murdered wouldn't have mattered.
