I remember a story where it was pointed out that Harry wasn't believed after the third task, since every time Dumbledore said "I trust Snape" he reduced the value of his word and opinion. So when Dumbledore said "believe Harry", that actually became a negative and was a large reason why people didn't think Voldemort was back.
