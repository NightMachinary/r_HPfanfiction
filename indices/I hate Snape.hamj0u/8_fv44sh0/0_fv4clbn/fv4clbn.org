  What, did all the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself just forget about that? Surely Voldemort isn't going to tell a known spy anything he doesn't actually want him/the Order to know?

Snape's semi-public status as an informant for Dumbledore is a huge issue with anyones motivation to keep him around. What use is an informant reporting to a serious mind reader on each side of the conflict, besides acting as a mailbox for deliberate misinformation.

Worse, Dumbledore actually gains less than his counterpart from keeping Snape around. To Voldemort, a master potion maker who can be discreet about his purchases is a valuable and rare resource for a recovering dark lord that can't just walk into an apothecary himself.

To Dumbledore, Snape is mostly a political liability. He has to pretend to protect Snape from his former death eater pals, keeping him nearby, at hogwarts. He also has to let Snape pretend to be a bad enough dude to still make friends /with/ his former death eater pals, encouraging Snape's behaviour towards students.
