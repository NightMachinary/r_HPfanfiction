Snape is a hero because, in essence, he saved the world. But he is not a good person. There are plenty of doctors and those types of people in history who have invented something that has saved millions, but have also killed thousands in the process of creating it. So yes, he was a 'hero', but he will never be a good person unless some other very important infomation comes out, because liking a girl is not an excuse.
