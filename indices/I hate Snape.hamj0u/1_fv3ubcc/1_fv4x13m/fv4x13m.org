  Where was his courage in school when his housemates treated his best friend like shit

While I mostly agree with your sentient overall, I'm a bit confused by this point. At what point does his friends treat Lily badly that we know of in canon? We can obviously make educated guesses (she's a muggleborn and is basically the only thing standing between Snape and DE recruitment, so it can be assumed that they try to drive her away from Snape as a result), but we don't actually /know/ anything about it, do we? For all we know, she might even be "protected" from them as a result of housemates trying to appease Snape, with the premise that he better stay in line, or she will get treated the same as every other Muggleborn.
