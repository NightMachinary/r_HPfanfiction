I hate Snape too. He literally ties to get Sirius's soul sucked out. Outs Remus out of spite. Is cruel to students. He's a shit teacher. The Prince's book shows he's literally a better teacher if he writes the instructions down and has no contact whatsoever with the student.

And some of the things he does just doesn't make any damn sense. Snape legitimately tries to get Harry expelled at least once (flying car in CoS). And then what? What's his plan to protect Harry then? Throw a 12 year out out into muggleland with the Dursleys to protect him from a reborn Voldemort?

Snape's only redeeming quality is possibly his courage and even that's suspect. Where was his courage in school when his housemates treated his best friend like shit. Hell, even his motivation is tainted. It's downright creepy. He doesn't oppose Voldemort because it's the right thing to do, he does it because his girl (who wanted nothing to do with him because he's a racist asshole) was targeted. If the prophesy might of referred to Neville or... Ron, Snape would still be licking Voldemort's boots.
