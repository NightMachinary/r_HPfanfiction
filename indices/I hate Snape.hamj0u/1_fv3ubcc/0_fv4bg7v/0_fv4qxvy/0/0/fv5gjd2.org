  He threatens to feed Neville's potion to the toad. Tactical advantage would be to have Neville be careful with the potion.

He says he will give Neville's toad /poison/, and then Neville, the guy who he terrorizes and is bad at potions has to brew the /antidote/ in a lesson that's said to be hard unless you are Hermione, then it's only complicated.

To Neville, he basically said, "I am going to kill your pet and make you watch, while you hopelessly try to save him."

He doesn't do this to teach Neville, he's just terrorizing him, he doesn't expect him to succeed.

  Embarrassing Hermione in class - tactical advantage would be to have her stop trying to answer questions he asks of others.

I am talking about the time Snape /saw/ a student cursing another, making her teeth large, she asked for help and he said "I see no difference." and left, making her cry, that completely invalidated whatever other interactions he has with her.

  Harry got off on the wrong foot that first day when he was screwing around with Ron
#+end_quote

Snape began the lesson by taking the muggle raised student who barely knew about magic and quizzed him in front of the whole class, then making fun of him and bullying him without the boy even knowing why.

Then, every time he could and for stupid reasons Snape made things difficult for Harry.

He only saved Harry because he used to be obsessed with his mother, that's it.

When he should've thought him Occlumency, he did something akin to telepathic "mindraping".

Canon Snape is just a broody guy who uses his authority to bully children and make the orphan son of his school rival suffer because his parents aren't there to protect him(because Snape himself got them killed).

He terrorizes the other boy whose parents also can't help him, just because he can.

He ruined Lupin, just because he could, no other reason.

He's not a good person, he only helps Dumbledore because Dumbledore guilt-tripped him over the death of Lily.

Honestly, people only like him so much because Alan Rickman was likable and talented and so made the character more charismatic.

People have headcanon about him protecting children during DH, but apart from that scene in the movie, we have no confirmation of that IIRC. In the Book, it didn't even happen that way.
