    I am talking about the time...

For the record, I said there was no excuse for this comment at the very first.

No, Snape only lit into Harry after he was screwing around with Ron. Harry not knowing was the point. Harry needing to be quiet and listen was the other point.

True, the movie alters this and makes Snape's attack out of nowhere. But I stopped watching the movies half way through Goblet of Fire.

    He only saved Harry because he used to be obsessed with his mother, that's it.

Head canon. The books show a childhood friendship, not obsession.

Don't know the quote, but Snape told Harry that countering legilmancy was somewhat like countering Imperius. And acknowledged Harry had done that. How did Harry learn to resist Imperius?

    He ruined Lupin just because he could, no other reason.

Are you talking about the Lupin that put students in danger by forgetting to take his potion? The Lupin that knew Black was an Animagus and had various ways in the castle but choose to keep everyone in danger rather than inform Dumbledore? Because at that time, Lupin was convinced that Black was a murderer and out to kill Harry.

But obviously there wasn't a real reason to get him fired.

    He's not a good person, he only helps Dumbledore because Dumbledore guilt-tripped him over the death of Lily.

Yes. That was the beginning of his redemption arc.

    Honestly, people only like him so much because Alan Rickman ...

Nothing against Rickman. I can enjoy his Snape, but he's not Snape.

    People have headcanon about him protecting children during DH,
  #+end_quote

I didn't see the movie. But I would say sending Neville and Ginny to have detention with Hagrid would be protecting them.

ETA; I got the Neville thing back around the wrong way, but the tactical advantage was still to get Neville to focus on what he was doing. Wouldn't have worked, and Snape should not be teaching children. But it still doesn't rise beyond that generation's acceptable level of teacher vindictiveness. It doesn't push him beyond redemption.
