I don't excuse, “I see no difference.” That was horrible.

He doesn't threaten to kill Neville's toad. He threatens to feed Neville's potion to the toad. Tactical advantage would be to have Neville be careful with the potion.

Embarrassing Hermione in class - tactical advantage would be to have her stop trying to answer questions he asks of others.

I don't agree that he actually does persecute Harry like a madman. We are meant to think that, because we always need to doubt his motivations.

Harry got off on the wrong foot that first day when he was screwing around with Ron and giving lip to Snape (Why don't you ask Hermione). Harry is always giving cheek. We like this about Harry. But Snape's reaction was not out of line for the time. I don't recall any of Snape's punishments to be out of line with the other teachers. Other than Umbrage. But she's kind of the gold standard for mercilessly persecuting Harry. Snape's bad, but he's no Umbrage.

Regardless of the time he taught and how that sort of thing was accepted, his actions are enough for me to dislike him as a teacher. I would've hated him as my teacher. But it's not enough for me to HATE HATE HATE him as a character and deny him his redemption arc.
