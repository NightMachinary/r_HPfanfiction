Except Snape bullies children for fun and out of spite, there's no practical application or tactical advantage, he threatens to kill Nevilles's Toad, bullies Hermione("I see no difference") all because he /could./ He literally allows sabotage in his class, /sabotage,/ when dealing with unstable chemicals that could seriously hurt a kid, or even worse.

I doubt Draco and Lucius would've cared that much if Snape just acted like a normal strict teacher who favored Slytherin, instead of persecuting Harry like a madman.
