He threatens the soul sucking, yes. Snape thought, along with everybody else, that Black was guilty. Snape took Black to the castle, on a stretcher, for the Ministry to deal with. Compare that with Lupin wanting to murder Pettigrew in front of the kids.

He outs Lupin. Lupin who kept delaying taking his potion when it was brought to him and let himself be a danger that night. Lupin who never spoke to Dumbledore about how Black could possibly be getting into the castle even though at that time he also thought Black was guilty and a danger to the kids.

I can't say he was a completely shit teacher since OOP mentions OWLS/NEWTS got better during his tenure. His behavior, when compared to current teacher behavior expectations, is shit. Unfortunately for the time, he wasn't that out of place.

He betrayed Voldemort because a childhood former friend was in danger. Don't see a problem with that. I can't see how, at that time, he could justify a concern with James or Harry and not be dead (Voldemort) or not believed (Dumbledore). Part of his story is that this grew from ‘just Lily' to ‘only those I can't save.' The point with his courage is that it grew.

Snape, Potter, Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew all behave horribly at various times. I can't give a pass to some and not give a pass to others. Except Pettigrew. He just doubled down on the Death Eater stuff.
