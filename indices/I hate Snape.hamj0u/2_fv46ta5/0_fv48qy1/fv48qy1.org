Agree. I love reading Snape-centric fics, but canon Snape takes it too far to be glorified as a hero at the end. Sure, he had to keep up the act of hating Gryffindors to the children of Death Eaters, but he could have terrorized them as a group. That's less traumatizing than focusing on attacking one kid specifically (like Neville or Hermione in GoF)

He has a lot of flaws as a person, but as a character, it's pretty cool to see how divided opinions of him are.
