Well, I don't like the person Snape but the character it's very interesting. I think that a lot of people want to redeem him or likes him because they could identify themselves with his childhood, and it was already mentioned that the movies softened him a lot. The same thing goes with Hermione, in the movies she got more lines and phrases than in the books and many of them were taken from Ron.
