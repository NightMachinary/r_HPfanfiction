That statement actually made me laugh. He's not real. He's a character in a story. He's mean, nasty, holds grudges, is petty and emotionally stunted. And that's on his good days! That is precisely why he is such a wonderful character to read about.

Would I like him as a teacher? Oh good God, no absolutely not. Is he someone I like read about? Hell yes!
