The problem in my opinion is firstly: Alan Rickman, who was a really charming guy + that whole 'always' scene that teenage girls like to focus in on. They made the character of Snape way more likeable in the movies than in the books and Alan Rickman played him on top of it xD.

There's a scene in the movie where Snape admits to Dumbledore that he told the prophecy to Voldemort. And then he asked Dumbledore to "hide them, hide them all". In the books, he only asked to protect Lily at first. Not even thinking about her husband and child. To which Dumbledore responded with: "you disgust me" and Snape backtracked.

Secondly, there's also the preferred argument of him acting that way because he has to be a convincing double agent. No. He's just a dick. That wants to use every little excuse he can to use his power in the unfair teacher/student power dynamic.

Others like to point towards his childhood before Hogwarts but, as proven, a horrible childhood does not make you a horrible person.

Also, he drove Lily away on his own. Hanging out with 'friends' who considered her to be the lowest class of witch imaginable and then topping it off by calling her a mudblood. Imagine if Harry did that to Hermione if he started becoming friends with Malfoy. Yeah... doesn't paint a pretty picture, does it?

Ultimately, I think Dumbledore only tolerated him because he was so valuable in the war. The ends justify the means type of thing. Similar with Umbridge. Dumbledore is the type to use soft and calculated power over Voldemort who uses hard power.

There are no truly good/flawless characters in the Harry Potter series, just like in real life.

But I guess you could make the argument that Voldemort is as psychotically evil as one can get. Since he took joy out of hurting others from a very young age.

Hating Snape is kind of an unpopular opinion in the fandom. People love this super dynamic character and you can do a lot with him. And a number of people may even subconsciously associate hating Snape with hating Alan Rickman.

The character of Snape proves that not only 'good' people oppose Voldemort. And that war isn't black and white.
