I love indulging in an outrageous concept now and then, like those stuck-on-a-desert-island, masquerade or Bachelor/Bachelorette plot fics. Something fun about the predictability and obligatory close contact, I suppose? I haven't actually read any that I thought were well-written, but they're pretty entertaining to turn a mind off to!

One of my fics is a total guilty pleasure to write; I write whatever I feel like at the moment into it and it's somehow morphed into this absurd trashing of fandom and fangirls. It's great fun :D
