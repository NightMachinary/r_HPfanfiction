Oh, and I really do like the idea of Dramione, though Draco is a horrible, hateful, bigoted troll. There is something about their chemistry--their opposite natures--that promise a very compelling opportunity for character development. Granted, fic execution is often very poor.

But I swear the promise is there. I wouldn't ever root for them as a long term couple, but unrequited Draco!crush or some other kind of way of bringing them together could really create a great story.
