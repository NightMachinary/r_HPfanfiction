Superpowered!Harry fics. I know he's really just at best a slightly-above-average wizard, but I can't help but love the fics where he outsmarts the Dursleys, befriends the goblins, reads the whole Black library in one weekend, works out every morning, kicks serious ass, and drinks Death Eater tears with breakfast.
