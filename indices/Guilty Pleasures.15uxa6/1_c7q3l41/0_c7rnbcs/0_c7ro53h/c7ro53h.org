Best complete one that I can think of is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][Bonds of Blood]]. Basically it's that the two people share a super deep link. In this case it's Harry/Ginny. I don't know how to best describe it, but it's enjoyable to read. Especially this one. There are some others, but they're not finished/abandoned.

That makes me sad.
