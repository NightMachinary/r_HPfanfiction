I have to say, I didn't think Chaos Theory was very good. There has to be other For Want of a Nail fics that are higher quality, right?

I think the backstory for Bryce was unnecessarily melodramatic. /Of course/ his father was a soldier who died a heroic death, /of course/ Frank was a loner until he met a beautiful girl in a contrived way, and then PS they loved to dance. /Of course/ the love of his life dies tragically as well. I'm not really sure why the Frank Bryce backstory was necessary for the fic to do what it needed to do. I guess you can say they were just fleshing out a character for character's sake, but the backstory was so cheesy I didn't think it was worth it.

Then we move to Amelia Bones' visit to Harry. I don't understand the portrayal of Vernon as so stupid that he would think beating his nephew in from of other adults would ever be a good idea. And then of course you have Amelia discover the cupboard under the stairs and she gets righteously angry at Vernon. That trope is so worn out at this point.

The premise of the Ministry catching Voldemort in his weakened state is cool, and having Frank Bryce run to the cops rather than investigate is a smart enough point of divergence, but already through two chapters there was way too much cheesy tropes for me.
