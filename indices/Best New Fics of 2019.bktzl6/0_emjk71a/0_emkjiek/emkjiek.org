Nice suggestions!

I read through Chaos Theory and it's an above-average For Want of A Nail fic. It actually has a single, small point of divergence, but follows through on sweeping consequences instead of still railroading to canon events. I like the switching of character perspectives a lot - the author does a good job of making the characters think and speak in distinct voices. The prose is serviceable, but not on the level of the best fics in the fandom, imo. Overall though, definitely a recommend.

I'm less interested in The Advantages of Being Sane. I read through the first five chapters or so and it's well-written and relatively consistent, but the overall premise is hard for me to believe and I'm really squicked out by any fic that pairs a resurrected Voldemort (i.e. 65 year old Voldemort) with school-age Harry. Probably just not my cup of tea, but if you enjoyed Limpeiza de Sangre, you'll probably like this? (Never read that one either :) Also, props to the author for a, frankly, ridiculous writing rate - they've churned through 30,000 words in under a month and it doesn't feel rushed or shoddy.

The Bond of the Veela just doesn't sound up my alley, so I can't comment on it at all.

Thanks for the recommendations!
