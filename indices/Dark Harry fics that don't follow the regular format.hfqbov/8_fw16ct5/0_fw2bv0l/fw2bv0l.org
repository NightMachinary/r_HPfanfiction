Now, I've seen this a few times but never read it because I assumed they'd changed Harry's name to Connor. Is that a misconception?

I can't abide fics where they change his name (mainly because I read one once where Sirius and Remus change his name to Phoenix so they can "hide inconspicuously" and wtf Harry is a much more inconspicuous name than Phoenix!!)
