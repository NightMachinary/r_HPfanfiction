The Sacrifices Ark should be up there with HPMOR as one of the great fanfics. 2.7 million words published over roughly 2 years of highly inventive original takes on the characters and setting (it does borrow from Lackey style fantasy and does seem a little rushed toward the end).

I will also note that some of it is very upsetting to read. Great, but upsetting.

I read while it was coming out. So, very, very good.

(also Prince of Slytherin is also quite good, and oops accidentally deleted this. Now it's back. )
