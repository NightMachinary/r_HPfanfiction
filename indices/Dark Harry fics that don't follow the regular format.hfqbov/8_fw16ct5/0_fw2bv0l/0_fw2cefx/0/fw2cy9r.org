Aaaah that sounds better than what I assumed it to be.

I've always turned my nose up at WBWL, mainly because the few I've read (other than Prince of Slytherin, which I started earlier due to a host of recs on this thread, that does it in an Amusing And Ironic way) all have Lily and James somehow surviving (hahaha how, if there is to be a BWL, can Lily survive?) and abandoning Harry because he's not magic enough compared to his assumed-vanquisher twin and it just degenerates into bashing.

But, this thread has not led me wrong so far AND this one is rated highly on the sites, so I will try this. Thank you!
