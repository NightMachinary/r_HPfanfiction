Hmm well hes not dark per se but hes definitely not the iconic golden boy huzzah in it either. The overall story is incredibly dark and macabre, I absolutely love it.

Have you read the Sacrifices arc? By Lightning on the wave? It's a pretty dark series over all and they rewrite all seven books to fit in their universe. It honestly probably the most in depth, well written, and emotionally jarring/shocking fanfiction I've ever read. And I've been reading fanfiction for almost 18 years now.

I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.

The first fic(book one) is called: Saving Conner

I can almost guarantee you won't regret reading it!
