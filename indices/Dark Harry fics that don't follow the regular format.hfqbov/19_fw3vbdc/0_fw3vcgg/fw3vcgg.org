  Albus Dumbledore declared Daniel Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. This act changed the whole Magical World. Thinking that Harry might be neglected he sent him to his Aunt and Uncle on the assumption that they no longer hated magic and Harry would grow up and rejoin his parents. He did not take into consideration a meddling Death Eater that decided to mess with the Potter family. Years past and Harry is not only thrown to the streets at the small age of five but he has grown up broken and alone. Now he comes to Hogwarts bent on making a name for himself. On the train he meets Ron and Hermione, and they make something far more powerful than people thought. They don't fight for Voldemort nor do they fight for the Light they only fight for themselves. Together they make the Dark Trio Welcome to a new Hogwarts. A/N: Some events have been shifted and moved around, something that happened later in the canon book might have happened earlier in my Fan fiction. This all needed to make the story move as I wish it to move.
