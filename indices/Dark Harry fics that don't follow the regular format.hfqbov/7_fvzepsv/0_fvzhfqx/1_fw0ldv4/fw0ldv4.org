Can I ask if Harry ever breaks away from Voldemort and finds his own way in this fic? I've reached the chapter with Ginny's funeral and I'm not sure if I want to bother with the rest. I've read too many 'Harry goes dark with Voldemort and stays that way, the end' type fics lately I need a break from that, lol.
