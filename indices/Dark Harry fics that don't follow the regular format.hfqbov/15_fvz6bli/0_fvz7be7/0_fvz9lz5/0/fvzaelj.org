It's not the age gap itself, I don't think 7 or 8 years is even weird if they're both adults. It's the timing.

I think a grown woman (especially one who works in law enforcement) dating a schoolboy is creepy. I think them having a friendship and Harry thinking she's hot (because he's a teenage boy and of course he's gonna fancy the cool older woman) is fine and developing that into something that can turn into a relationship /once he graduates is fine/. But having /her/ pursue /him/ or have her reciprocating his affection while he's still a schoolboy is icky to me.
