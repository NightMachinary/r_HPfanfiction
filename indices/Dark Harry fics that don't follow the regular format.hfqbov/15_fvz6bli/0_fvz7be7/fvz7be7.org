I'm always a bit uncomfortable about shipping Harry with Tonks because she's eight years older than him and for the majority of HP fics he's still at school. A 24 year old woman dating a 16 year old schoolboy is pretty creepy however you look at it.

In a fic that's set in a post Hogwarts world, I can see that exploring the Harry and Tonks possiblity would be interesting - if the 13 year age gap between Tonks and Remus is ok (which it is between two adults) then the age gap with Harry and Tonks is fine if they're both over 18 at the time. I think they'd be an interesting couple, she doesn't idolise him, they have a ton in common, Tonks could show Harry how to /have a damned life/. Yknow, listen to some music, drink some beer. Do what people normally do at the age of 18.

And I do love that this ship is called Honks. HONKS ðŸ˜‚
