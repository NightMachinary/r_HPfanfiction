You might enjoy this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] I will rec this fic until I die, it's one of my all-time favorites and the author is writing squeals. Harry starts using dark magic cus he wants to stop Voldemort and thinks it will help him. The dark magic is shown in such a beautiful way, I think it's based off the author's paganesc religion. It's very well written and doesn't follow many tropes.
