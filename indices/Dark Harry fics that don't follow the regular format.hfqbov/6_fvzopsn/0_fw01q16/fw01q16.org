Ok, I'm hooked. This is hilarious and brilliant. I don't normally like WBWL stories but I am so glad you recommended this. It doesn't take itself seriously at all and it's all the better for it.

"There were also potions for literacy that taught wizarding children to read and write at the level of an 8th Year Muggle secondary student, but the vocabulary and syntax hadn't been updated in over a century, which was why Pureblood children who didn't socialize much had such oddly formal speech patterns."

This passage is so funny to me. The idea that purebloods are too busy being Very Rich And Important to even teach their children to write and don't notice how weird their speech patterns are. Absolutely subverts the usual tropes in this sort of fic

Thank you so much for putting me on to this.
