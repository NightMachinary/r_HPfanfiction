I've just had to come back to this thread to thank you /again/ for putting me on to this, as I've just found a part where one of the characters comes from the same town as me! My home town almost never gets mentioned in fic because it's neither a dump nor an interesting cultural or economic hub. It just, is. So I was so pleased to see it mentioned for once!
