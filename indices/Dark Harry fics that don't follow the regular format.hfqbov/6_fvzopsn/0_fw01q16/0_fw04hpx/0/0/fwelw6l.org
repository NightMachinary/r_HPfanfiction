Haha that's great. Our discussion led to me reading it again, and I discovered that a lot more has been written since I caught up last time, so I'm excited to get to that. Some of the filler material between the trope reconstructions is pretty average for a HP story, but it's definitely still worth reading. I'm also always interested in competent!Lockhart, so I'm enjoying the second book immensely.
