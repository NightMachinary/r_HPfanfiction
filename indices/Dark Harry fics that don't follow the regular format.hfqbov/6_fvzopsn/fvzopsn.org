HP and the Prince of Slytherin is the exact opposite of your request. It has all those tropes and many more, but it gives all of them a fascinating new twist. Basically, it's a reconstruction that takes all the dumb stuff that doesn't make sense and gives really satisfying Watsonian explanations for it. I highly recommend it!
