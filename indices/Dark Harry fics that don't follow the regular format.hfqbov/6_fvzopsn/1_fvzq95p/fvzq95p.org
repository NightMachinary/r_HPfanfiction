I've heard of this, but I've always been put off by the title as I assumed it was just all the tropes that I have a love-hate relationship with (they're hilarious, but I spend so much of the time thinking "lol really?" that it takes me out of the world, if yknow what I mean) but if it's sort of subverting the tropes by giving them actual explanations I may give it a go.
