I mean Harry Potter and the boy who lived is exactly this. It's a twin Harry story without all the nonsense that comes with that trope and a dark Harry fic without the other nonsense that comes with that. Basically Harry wants to learn dark magic because dark magic is still magic and he's a big nerd.
