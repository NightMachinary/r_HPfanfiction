Hermione and Ron, Harry and Ginny took things slow after the war. Rose Weasley was born in 2006 and James Sirius Potter in 2004. Perhaps they took relationship breaks or only actually got together years after the war and inbetween they could have tried to heal, concentrate on their careers or have been with other people.
