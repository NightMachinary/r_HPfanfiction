Nitwick possibly being a british(?) version of nitwit or scatterbrained (Ravenclaw) Blubber - cry baby (gryffindor when they don't get their way) Oddment - remnant / left over of fabric (Hufflepuff letting people maintain them being duffers) Tweak - twist, pull or adjustment (Slytherin traditionalists wanting to go back to the old ways)
