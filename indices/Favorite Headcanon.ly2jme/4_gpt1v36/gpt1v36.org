Wizard Britain and to a lesser extent, Europe, is the equivalent of a muggle third world country. It's subsequently mocked my other areas like India, Africa, China, Australia, and the Americas. Their population is so low because most people just leave once they find out how much better other places are.

The only reason they are on the map is for their many dark lords.
