Draco and Ginny had a fling during the 6th book. He needed comforting during his during trying to fix the cabinet and Ginny was looking to feel something during the Carrows reign of the school. Ginny wanted Draco to join the order but he couldn't because of fear of his parents being killed. Ginny then moved on and returned to Harry (even though i wish Ginny and Draco was a real thing)
