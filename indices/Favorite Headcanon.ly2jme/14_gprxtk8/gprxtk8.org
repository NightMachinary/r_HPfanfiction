This will annoy people, but mine is that Harry Potter and Smallville are the same universe. (HP and DC are both Warner Bros.) There is no evidence they are not, as the meteor shower that brings Kal El to earth happens while Harry is nine, so is not mentioned in HP, and the entire series (minus epilogue) happens before the Smallville series starts, so would be old, foreign news to Smallville teens, so is not mentioned. This has no effect on either series, I just think it's funny that they could be, and no one would know.

Also, if anyone knows of any fanfics that take use of this, or want to write one, please let me know. I want to read them. Post Hogwarts Harry could move to Smallville seeking "A quiet life where nobody knows who The-Boy-Who-Lived is"

Or since Lionel Luthor was semi active in Smallville when Kal El arrived, the Dursleys (and Harry) could have taken a trip there to try and sell him some drills. LuthorCorp made farming equipment (among other things) so could need drill bits for cnc machines, or maybe they add a construction subdivision. Kents adopt two kids instead of one. Clark doesn't really show powers till post Hogwarts, so wouldn't change things much, but Harry would have a happy home life and be a somewhat different person. Things wouldn't really change until Harry interferes with the events of Smallville.
