Wizards are very attached to their wands, and here is my reason why. You can only be bonded to/paired with one wand/magical foci, at one time. So long as your foci is whole, that's it.

However, you can use a wand bound to a direct blood relative, but only to a veri limited success.

And another one. Almost all magical beasts/animals are extremely resistant to magic.
