Nagini is great-grandmother/grandmother to the Greengrass girls and her maledictus curse is the same 'blood curse' that eventually kills Astoria, as mentioned in CC

To go slightly darker, Astoria is alive but trapped as a snake during CC and Draco found it easier/more respectable to say she had died instead
