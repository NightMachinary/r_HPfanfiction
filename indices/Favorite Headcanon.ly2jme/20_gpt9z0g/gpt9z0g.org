I have quite a few. Harry and Ginny got married fairly quickly, while Ron and Hermione waited a few years. Harry and Draco get over their childhood hatred, and learn to at least be acquaintances. Harry and Ginny do the bulk of raising Teddy. Scorpius ends up with Lily Luna rather than Rose.

Plus ive made up a few in my head over the years that no one can convince me didnt happen lol
