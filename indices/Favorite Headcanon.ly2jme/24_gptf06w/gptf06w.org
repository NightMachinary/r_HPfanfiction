I've had a few non logical ones including Hermione or Katie being daughters of Sirius/Regulus one night stands.

Marius Black and the other disowned Blacks formed their own family in the muggle world considering Grimmauld place was surrounded by muggles.

Molly at least was instructed to be outside the barrier to let Harry know how to get in.

Oliver had a reason for being quidditch obsessed other than being an athlete wanting to go pro.

Harry wasn't being awkward because Albus Severus and Scorpius could end up being a thing or the whole sorting thing. I think that there just was not a lot of good family dynamics and it's easy to pile it all on The character with the twisted upbringing

Hufflepuff outlived the other founders to become the first “headmaster” with Slytherin leaving, Ravenclaw likely dying of grief and Gryffindor being brash and short fused.

The golden trio were put into Gryffindor not because they represent another house but they are tied for the other three

Hermione: Ambitious, Intelligent, Hardworking

Ron: ambition to outshine brothers, excels in specific fields of knowledge and activities only if motivated

Harry: wants to escape the Dursley's and blend in socially and intellectually (Slytherin) is loyal to his friends and holds strong values of fair play (Hufflepuff) he sets his mind to what he wants to learn not what he's told to learn and was also smart enough to survive all that time with the Dursley's and his witty comebacks (Ravenclaw)
