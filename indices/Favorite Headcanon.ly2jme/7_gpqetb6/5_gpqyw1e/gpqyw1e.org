Just technical comment: if Hogwarts were found around the year 1000 in order to protect magical kids from Muggle attacks, some serious divination had to be involved. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt][Witch-hunts]] started in Europe seriously in the middle of *fifteenth* century, so *four hundred and fifty years later* (that's the time distance like from us to the middle sixteenth century!). The official position of the Church until at least fourteenth century was that witches don't exist and magic is just superstition. Even Joan of Arc (‚úù 1431) wasn't burnt at stake strictly speaking as a witch, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Joan_of_Arc#Abjuration][for the voices she heard and for wearing male clothes]] (hey, she could become the patron saint of transsexuals! Except, she most likely wear male clothes for practical purposes, I don't think there is any evidence she felt like a male locked in a female body).
