James Sirius is the real name of Harry and Ginnys firstborn. After he was born the wizarding media went a bit nuts, so Harry and Ginny kept themselves out of the spotlight for a few years.

"Albus Severus Potter" didn't have a birth announcement or anything, they just showed up with a kid in public. The whole family refers to the kid as Al. Rita Skeeter, desperate for anything to save her failing career comes up with the bullshit name. In actuality, the kid is Arthur Lupin Potter, after Ginnys father and the lupins. Al for short, so at weasley gatherings he's not confused with his grandfather.
