Hermione and Ron date for a bit, but break up and remain friends. She focuses more on her career while Ron meets another girl who's more compatible with him.

I don't care what anyone says, but Harry would never name his kid after the man who abused him for 6 years.

And as much as I love Dumbledore, I really feel like Harry would hold some resentment towards him at the end.
