Draco and Astoria married shortly after the war. They had three children (screw CC) being Asteria Polaris (b. 2004) and the twins Antares Hekates Arakne and Scorpius Hyperion (b. 2006). Asteria and her friend Demetra Nott found the Ford Anglia in the Forbidden Forest. Antares eventually married Albus Potter (her best friend) and Scorpius married Rose Granger-Weasley. Asteria remained lifelong maiden since her true love, Dominique Weasley, never returned her.

Lily Luna Potter became a Slytherin just like her elder brother Albus. She met both Slughorn, who she didn't really like, and Snape via their respective portraits. Snape told her how to reach his old house in Spinners' End (I assume it's put under the Fidelius Charm) and how to find the missing part of the photo and the ending of the letter he stole from Grimmauld Place decades before.

Also, decades after the Epilogue, Luna Lovegood became Hogwarts' Headmistress.
