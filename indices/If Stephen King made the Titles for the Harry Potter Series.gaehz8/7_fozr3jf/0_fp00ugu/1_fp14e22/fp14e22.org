This was always my complaint about the Goblet of Fire. Every other title has a presence throughout the book and something to do with the climax. The Goblet is kind of just there for a few chapters, does it's thing and never comes up again. I think they should have either made the goblet the trophy or at least just the goal you have to touch to win (And thus the portkey which is there for the climax) or named the book "The Triwizard Cup"
