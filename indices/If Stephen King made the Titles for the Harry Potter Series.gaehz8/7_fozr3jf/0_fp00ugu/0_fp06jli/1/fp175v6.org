I guess with the afterknowledge it just seems less important; Harry never develops any potions skill to be used in DH, Snape's most significant action all book was actually just fulfilling Dumbledore's orders, Draco's completely fine after the Sectumsempra incident, and doesn't appear to have changed for the better in DH in any way....

I'm really unsure why it isn't widely recognized as the worst book of the series
