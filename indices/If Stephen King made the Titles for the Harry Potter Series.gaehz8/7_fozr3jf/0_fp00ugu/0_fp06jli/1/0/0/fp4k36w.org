In surveys it's pretty evenly split. On the main HP subreddit it seems to be CoS but they think Draco had a redemption arc and Dumbledore did nothing wrong so I have very little respect for their opinions.

I'd basically rank them in descending order, JKR is an excellent children's book writer but the more adult it gets the more it invites critical thinking and the weaker they get. I'd rank HBP far far below DH, the second worst, though.
