I agree. I think a lot of what happens is due to the HBP. Expanding on your list, Harry couldn't have tricked Ron before the quidditch match, Lavender and Ron may have never gotten together, Harry wouldn't have known about & then used sectumsempra meaning that him and Ginny may have gotten together in a different way, etc. The plot point seems small but HBP comes up, in one way or another, continuously.
