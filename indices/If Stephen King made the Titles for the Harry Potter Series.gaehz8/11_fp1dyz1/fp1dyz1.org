A few parallels to The Shining for those who care:

A group of three people travel from far away to arrive at an old but grand structure with ghosts inhabiting it. Located, of course, in seclusion within the mountains. They are forced to spend a long period of time here regardless of the mounting dangers.

The main characters have a deep connection to their respective enemies, which goes so far that the lines between the two blur.

Supporting characters, such as Hermione and the redrum kid, have knowledge which ostracized them from their peers.

Other supporting characters, such as Ron and the wife end up having a falling out with the main characters.

Old guy who has previous experience and knowledge with the evil bad guys, dies in the end trying to rescue good guys. Like Snape and that guy who had the shining ability but got axed immediately.

Castle and hotel change appearance constantly due to supernatural forces. Such as the Room of Requirement being powered by, and the ballroom in The Shining powered by... Well, dead guys.
