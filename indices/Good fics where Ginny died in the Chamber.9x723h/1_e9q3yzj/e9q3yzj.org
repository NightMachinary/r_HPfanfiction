That's a common plot element in fics that focus on the Diary Horcrux. Here are a few that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10785698/1/Transcendence][Transcendence]] - The Diary wins in the Chamber of Secrets then departs to Malfoy Manor with the intention of picking up where his original self left off. linkffn(10785698)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]] - The Diary wins in the Chamber and abducts Harry. Over the following months Harry must adapt to survive living with his captor. linkffn(7932144)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15873207/chapters/36982095][Ink]] - The Diary won in the Chamber and abducted Harry Potter. This fic takes place three years later when they return to Hogwarts together. linkao3(15873207)

And here's a frequently recommended WBWL dark!Harry fic in which Ginny dies.
