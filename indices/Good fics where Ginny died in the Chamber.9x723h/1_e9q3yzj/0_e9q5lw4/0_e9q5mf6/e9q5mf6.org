#+begin_quote
  Things go differently, down in the Chamber. Instead of pouring herself into the diary, Ginny opened her heart to it, her heart and her mind, and that means a different path for Tom Riddle to take. No message saying Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever; instead Tom takes Ginny down to the Chamber one empty afternoon and waits for the last of her to die. When it is all over Tom flicks long red hair over her shoulders, picks up Ginny's wand (not a perfect match, but better than nothing, better than fifty years without a wand) and leaves the Chamber. Saunters out of Myrtle's bathroom looking like nothing more than a little eleven year old girl.
