  There is no canon evidence for physical abuse

Ah yes, watching your sister set a dog on the child in your custody is just good manners. There is a bit in canon where Vernon hits Dudley and Harry does not find it remarkable, implying that at least the occasional punch happened. And the "diets" Harry gets in CoS and GoF are way below what you got in the bombed out ruins of postwar Germany. Also, the bit where Petunia swings a frying pan after Harry's head, well that can quite easily be called attempted manslaughter because good luck convincing her majesty's judges that your nephew is magically resistant to blunt-force trauma.

It is not "Harry gets beaten black and blue every day, but physical abuse is canonical.
