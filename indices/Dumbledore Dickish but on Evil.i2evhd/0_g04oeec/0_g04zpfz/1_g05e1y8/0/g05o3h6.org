More or less the same as he ignored my 20 or so points in the article and just focused on "There is no canon evidence for physical abuse"

So some points:

- Where does it say that Vernon or Petunia watched the dog doing this? Marge could have been easily left in care of the kids while Vernon and Petunia were away. So no chance of "Don't bother with the boy Marge, leave him alone"

- We don't know how hard she swung that pan, it could have been more a slow swing to put him away than an attempt at manslaughter.

- For a kid even missing a meal is a big deal... and he is an unreliable narrator to some extend. When Harry says "periods of near-starvation"... it could have been exaggerated. It surely was more than going to bed without dinner one night (which many have experienced in childhood) but I don't see the Dursleys actually trying to starve him. He is scrawny, though fanfic writers like to forget that his father was too to some degree, might as well be hereditary. No mention of denutrition symptoms in the book, always had pretty of energy to run away from Dudley for example. Which points more to the food removal being a temporary punishment than something the Dursleys did on a regular basis.

And the fact that Vernon hit Dudley then it adds more to it being Vernon's style of discipline than a tendency to hit Harry without reason. I would say Vernon is closer to a hard discipline guy overdoing it, than the maniac hitting Harry with tubes and logs for no reason at all that appears in some fics.
