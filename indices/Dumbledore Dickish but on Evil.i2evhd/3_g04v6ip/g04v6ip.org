"‘OUT!' roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall,"

"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall."

"As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan."

"While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re-painted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck."

"And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs."

"He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."

"The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of tinned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray."

"He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup."

"‘You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?' roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised."

"To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's."

"The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks,"

"Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat."

"Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling."

"Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible."

"Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."

Nope. No evidence for physical abuse there at all.

  The cupboard. Yeah, it makes Harry feel so much less than Dudley. But then again, it was a space to live, he had his bed and his things. Lots of people live in worse conditions. He used hand-down clothes, so do many people. Harry is not living in the backyard. The Dursleys could easily justify this with "there was no space left in the house". And I don't think the Dursleys did this to punish Harry for anything, I do think they have Dudley so spoiled that they just thought Dudley's toys were more important than Harry. I think if they had had a third room, it could have been Harry's.

Generally when people live in worse conditions their entire family lives in those worse conditions as well because of systemic poverty. When one child and only one child is singled out to live in worse conditions, we call that abuse.

Even if they were living in only a two bedroom house, you cannot justify 'there was no space left in the house' because children sharing a bedroom is not uncommon.

More importantly. They bloody did have room. In fact, they had /four/ of them.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.

  Lockhart was not his fault. He was running out of options, it is stated. No one wanted to teach a cursed position. He didn't want Lockhart there.

While I don't like using JKR's extracanonical statements, I think this is relevant.

  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that ‘there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.

As for this

  I don't think Dumbledore wanted Harry to confront Quirrell, much less on 1-1. No indication on the text for that.

You mean like this indication

  ‘No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully. ‘He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the Mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could ...'
