There actually is a law in Virginia about bedrooms for children having "adequate square footage" among other requirements. Additionally, I believe there is a law about bedrooms being required to have a functioning window/exit in case of fire and a closet of a specified dimension. I shared a room with my sisters even though we had a basement because it had no opening windows which made it a fire hazard. Incidentally, the house actually burned down later on (luckily no one was in the basement at the time). I can't say I know what the UK laws in the 90s looked like though.

As far as everything else, I agree that Dumbledore wasn't evil and was probably not even as manipulative as he comes across. I dislike how you downplayed the abuse, emotional abuse can actually be more insidious than physical abuse and while Harry might be an unreliable narrator he's the only one we've got. However, I don't think it was some grand evil scheme by Dumbledore either. I think what bothers me about him in canon is how willing other characters are to ignore his flaws and how he doesn't seem to listen to the good opinion of others. Like McGonagall not liking the Dursleys perhaps should have led to him checking in on Harry. Hermione states several times that they should trust the staff because Dumbledore hired them even though he has a habit of hiring incompetent or dangerous individuals. Maybe that was simply because he was scraping the bottom of the barrel, but the point still stands about other characters reactions to it.

For me the villanization of Dumbledore is actually more of the same, we assume everything that happened was due to some grand plan. In reality, I think Dumbledore's greatest flaw is his hubris, his belief that he alone can be trusted with the truth and he alone can make the right decisions. His influence barely wanes even with his own death.

Not trying to start any arguments, just wanted to leave my two cents.
