Okay, so let's go over this. Which is bad, but is obviously inflated by the text and by having a boy as an unreliable narrator here:

#+begin_quote
  "‘OUT!' roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall,"
#+end_quote

He took them out of a room forcibly. Harry and Dudley in an equal way. Neither complains afterwards as if was a particularly serious bruising or anything. Pretty much the equivalent of dragging someone out of a room pulling from an arm. This after telling them, as Guardian, that they should leave and they ignoring him.

#+begin_quote
  "Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall."
#+end_quote

Against dragged forcibly out of a section of Vernon's own house where he doesn't want Harry at the moment. Notice throw into hall, as in just out of the room, not as in slammed against the walls.

#+begin_quote
  "As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan."
#+end_quote

SO Harry, our unreliable narrator is telling us what Petunia feels and sees. How is he certain that from Petunia's point of view the woman is sure Dudley is unharmed or that he wasn't put at risk. Harry is supposing here. This is clearly a hot-headed reaction and not planned action to do harm to Harry out of nowhere. He didn't actually hit him as well, for all we know it could have been a slow swing more intended in scaring the boy away and Harry feels it differently. There is no indication that says Harry has actually been hit a pan before.

#+begin_quote
  "While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re-painted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck."
#+end_quote

These are chores. As I pointed, Dumbledore doesn't really have power over which chores Harry is assigned. It is bad because Dudley is not doing anything, but this is hard is abuse. But abuse is not defined in base of what others get or not get to do. I could do all these things as a kid on a weekend but because there was no Dudley they really didn't look bad. The burns could be just the usual stuff from working outside, no further complains other days that his neck ached or anything. This is just working. And if those were really unbearable burns... we don't see Harry telling anyone he is hurting.

#+begin_quote
  "And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs."
#+end_quote

Laughing as a maniac is no crime. Against dragging forcibly. Which is hardly abuse if it's not followed by "he beat me up when we arrived upstairs".

#+begin_quote
  "He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."
#+end_quote

He was grounded. Unjustified or whatever, but they didn't do this on a daily basis, Harry was free of going out of his cupboard regularly. Even out of the house for he was familiar with Dudley's friends. Still he got food. Small if you like it, but three times a day, which points at the Dursleys not wanting to starve him.

#+begin_quote
  "He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup."
#+end_quote

This is an expression. Obviously the food did go in his system. Many children are sent to their rooms without dinner after a punishment, or get blocked from bread and desserts on following meals. The Dursleys are more intense and horrible persons, but they are still feeding Harry.

#+begin_quote
  "‘You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?' roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised."
#+end_quote

No evidence of physical violence. This kind of stuff is said by people who don't actually hit people all the time. This is a threat. More an emotional abuse than physical.

#+begin_quote
  "To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's."
#+end_quote

Yes the Durlseys are not impartial and have a clear favorite. They are willing to do the "all the same" for Dudley but not for Harry. Still this is hardly an abuse as well. They are all in diet. They are guardians, they get to decide what's to eat each day. They are not even being mean to Harry in particular here, Vernon and Petunia also share the diet. It could be that it's just Harry's perspective that makes him think his slice is smaller, but it could be that they are the same. Even if his is smaller, it could just be that he just got the smaller fruit by sheer luck. In a way, Harry could be predisposed to only notice the things that are worse for him and not the rest, maybe he got a larger apple the next day, but he doesn't mention that. And, at the end of the day. How much difference in size can there really be between a quarter of 2 regular grapefruits?

#+begin_quote
  "The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks,"
#+end_quote

Again it's an expression that you chose to quote partially. This is part of the family diet, no punishment on Harry. And Harry is exaggerating, they just had a grapefruit it's obviously not only carrots what he is going to be eating. It's just a diet based on fruits on vegetables. Which a vegetarian wouldn't see bad at all. ANd either way Harry is quick to get sweets from his friends. Which he doesn't share with Dudley btw, so Harry is vengeful about the favoritism he has experienced.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat."
#+end_quote

Text makes it seem as he is strangling him, which he is not. Vernon is holding him from the neck, only that from the other side after he sees Harry pulling his wand (which he knows is dangerous) for what seems like no reason at all. Harry gets dialogues after this before released, which points to Vernon not putting strength enough to cut air, which he could totally could do if he wanted at this point. SO Vernon's intention is not harm, it is to stop Harry from doing whatever he is planning to do next. Which he does have reason to suspect, remember by this point Dudley's tongue has been enlarged and Harry has made Marge a living balloon.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling."
#+end_quote

Again, expression. He did not strangle him, he held him. It is just an expression of distance, as Harry didn't want to be held again.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible."
#+end_quote

This could mean that he doesn't want to be dragged or held, as I said there was no strangling before.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."
#+end_quote

This could pretty much be an exaggeration over the diet. No direct abuse against Harry in putting the family in diet.

So, in summary. I concede some level of physicality here, but more on the lines of a harsh discipline Vernon who is misguided and overreacts than a real attempt at causing physical harm to Harry just for harm's sake or they hate him or anything. Again don't disagree that they are horrible people, but there is no indication of these things being reported to Dumbledore as nothing more than:

"Harry hasn't gone out of the house in days, it seems that he is grounded." "The whole family is in diet now" "Dursley has rude manners, he boasts of being a heavy disciplined. Though, I haven't seen bruises on the boy."

#+begin_quote
  Generally when people live in worse conditions their entire family lives in those worse conditions as well because of systemic poverty. When one child and only one child is singled out to live in worse conditions, we call that abuse.
#+end_quote

You can call that emotional abuse if you want because of Dudley, which I already covered. But the cupboard does not represent bad living conditions at all. And it is not illegal. He is not sleeping on the floor in a corner. Are there any laws saying people can't live in rooms not conceived as rooms by the contractor? Because if so many people living in conditioned garages and basements are breaking the law.

#+begin_quote
  ‘No, it isn't,' said Harry thoughtfully. ‘He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the Mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could ...'
#+end_quote

Wanting to know about the mirror, and wanting to learn of the stone does not mean that Dumbledore wanted Harry to face Quirrell face to face. First, these are all Harry's suppositions, not Dumbledore's statements. And we do know that Dumbledore was tricked out of the school the day Quirrell tried to take the stone and hurried at once. Hurried into the trap door and got to Harry just as he defeated Quirrell. So it would point more to Dumbledore wanting Harry to learn in a controlled environment (which fits his mo).
