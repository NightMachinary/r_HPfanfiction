  What about the ministry intercepting letters saying that they are indeed in hiding and that there is indeed something to hide?

The Ministry refused to believe Voldemort's return. Ron and Hermione were of no importance to them, should they create the wrong kind of attention they could always be dealt with later.

He could simply fast forward the Goblet's tournament within a few hours, dismiss Harry and then do the proper tournament. It would have been in favour of both other schools and I do not think that they would object such a solution.
