Again, tell that to Crouch or Bagman. Dumbledore was not responsible for the tournament, the fact that it was carried on as it was is not an example of Dumbledore being evil. For all we know Dumbledore could have argued for something like that but Bagman wanted to enforce Harry there.

How do you know? And more importantly how is Dumbledore sure of it? Harry is just mounting drama honestly. He can't wait a few weeks to ask personally? Ron and Hermione did tell him that they would tell him everything when they saw him.

What was Harry going to do with info on Voldemort's movements either way? Go after him? That info is for Order members. People complain that Dumbledore gave the Horcrux mission to Harry instead of to some aurors, yet they still want Harry to be informed of the Order secret movements as if he was really doing something useful at the moment.
