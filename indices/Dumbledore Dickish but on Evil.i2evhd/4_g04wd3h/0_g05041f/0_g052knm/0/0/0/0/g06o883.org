Dont remember the start of ootp entirely, but isnt it possible that they could have communicated, asked for his well being an whatnot?

Like you have a 14 yeaf old kid whos just seen a friend die right in front of him, feels guilty about it and basically goes to a place where he has no emotional support and pepole eho activly despise him?

Get the kid some psycological help, keep him informed of the ministry stance on Voldemort and show that they are activly combating the DE. Give vague info that voldy cant use
