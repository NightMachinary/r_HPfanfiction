Have you ever climbed into a storage space under the stairs? Most you can't even stand up in and that area is only towards the "top of the stairs". It's about 8 foot long with 2 feet not being usuable due to the height of the stairs at that section. They are also less than 3 foot wide. If we housed prisoners in spaces like that we would be charged with cruel and unusual punishment. And you actually think that it is an appropriate place for a child? A storage space is not a room.

Here i have an idea. Especially if you have kids. Why don't you put your child in a cupboard under the stairs and then have social services come out to check on your new room for your child. I'm sure you would be in lockup in about 15 minutes.
