Correct I assuming the dimensions (though based on the movie scenes when the cupboard door and stairs are shown I'm most likely being generous). 2. The width is based on the width of standard stairs. Which means the inside dimensions of the space is smaller. My first question though is why you insist on calling a storage space a room it is not.

Two. What conditioned? There is nothing to suggest that anything was done to improve the cupboard. And I would be surprised if a small single mattress would fit in there though a bed with frame wouldn't due to the restricted height.

Your basement and garage counters are nonsensical as they are actually full size spaces that can be improved eg a large garage in the uk is 10 x 20 feet. A small is still roughly 8 x 16. Those spaces at a minimum are at least 5 times larger than a space under the stairs.

You obviously have never dealt with social services. Vernon would be charged with neglect/abuse. The fact that he has a child living under the stairs when he has two spare rooms (one of which is his son's second bedroom for all his broken toys). The fact that the child doesn't have a single item of clothing that fits him. The fact that not a single photo of him exists in the house which show they don't consider him part of the family. Then after talking with both boys the fact that Harry has all those chores while Dudley has virtually none and the fact that he gets scraps from the table and food is often withheld from him as punishment. That he has never received a single gift while Dudley receives dozens and the fact that he is often forced to stay in the cupboard. The fact that he hasn't had his eyes checked nor seen a doctor regularly (implied in the story) whereas there is tons of evidence that Dudley has.

Adding all those things together with the fact that the Dursleys are not poor would see Vernon and Petunia charged and locked up for a very long time.
