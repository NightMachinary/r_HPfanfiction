1. You are assuming the cupboard's dimensions, which are never stated.
2. A bed fits there.
3. Harry moved out at 11. It was not a grown man there.
4. As I mentioned, Vernon is a guardian and he has sons of his own. There is nothing Ilegal if conditioned.
5. A basement is not initially a room. A garage is not initially a room. People live in places lie those, just moves beds there.

If social services arrived, they would surely be hard on Vernon for it. But I mean what are they going to charge him for? You have a toy room? He lives in a small space? Yeah, and so, Vernon can verify he provides clothes, roof, food for Harry. He can verify that Harry is not a prisoner. He can verify he goes to school. He can verify he goes out. Social Services just verifies all those things are provided accordingly. Not your house arrangement. He can totally get away with "We conditioned this room for him to live here, he has enough space"
