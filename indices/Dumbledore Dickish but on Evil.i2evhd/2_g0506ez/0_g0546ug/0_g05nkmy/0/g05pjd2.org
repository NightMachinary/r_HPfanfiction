They had a legal obligation to provide roof, food, shelter, clothes, education. Which they did. There is no legal obligation to let him use Dudley's toys or videogames. There is no legal obligation to give them the house's room the boy wants.

The fact that the cupboard was designed as storage does not make it a dungeon just by having the label "cupboard".

Harry was not in chains. Harry could go in and out of the cupboard on a regular basis. Harry was not a slave, he was not in chains. Harry had a roof and a bed and blankets. He had privacy as well. A place he could call his own. There is absolutely nothing illegal.

The wrong part is obviously that there was another room in the house. But it is not illegal to provide a smaller room even if they had another available. The Dursleys just have to provide something adequate, which they did.

The outrage of the fandom at the cupboard is more symbolic. Because "how can poor Harry can live in a cupboard when he is rich and should live in a massive room with all of the luxuries available?"
