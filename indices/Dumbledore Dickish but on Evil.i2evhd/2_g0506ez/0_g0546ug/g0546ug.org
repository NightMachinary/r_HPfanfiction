It is a crappy person action, but people really overreact with. Harry was not Vernon's son, he took him but he was not legally obligated to provide him exactly the same as what he gave Dudley. There were 4 walls and a roof, a bed, sheets, Harry didn't suffer cold. It was way better than some people suffering abuse get. It fulfilled Harry's needs, no matter if the contractor said it was or not a room.
