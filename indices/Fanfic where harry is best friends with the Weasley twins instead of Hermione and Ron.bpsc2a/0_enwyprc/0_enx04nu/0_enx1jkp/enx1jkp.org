Thanks! I plan to continue it through them giving away the map, but filling this huge story up with pranks worthy of the twins is hard. Here's an excerpt just for you:

“Impedimenta.” Turquoise light stopped both twins in their tracks. A strong hand grabbed each twin and yanked them into the Defense office. Professor Lupin closed the door behind them before those quietly running cat feet turned the corner. “Sit down, Messrs Weasley,” he said, but they were still clumsy from the impediment jinx. “Relax,” he added, pushing their awkward forms into a couple of chairs. Then he listened at the door.

“Professor, we can explain,” said Fred.

“Quiet. Minnie might double back,” Professor Lupin whispered. That silenced them, except for the panting of their lungs and the pounding of their hearts. He listened at the door for a bit longer, then sat behind his desk. “I'm glad I happened to run into you two. I've been meaning to have a talk with you about your homework, or rather your lack thereof. I know that you've been very busy recently---“

The twins exchanged a look of barely-suppressed panic.

“---studying for your OWLs,” continued Lupin without skipping a beat.
