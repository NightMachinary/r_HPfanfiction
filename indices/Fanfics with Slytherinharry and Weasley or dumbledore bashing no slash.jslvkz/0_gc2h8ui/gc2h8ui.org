I wouldn't have recommended Prince of Slytherin or Ashes of Chaos anyway, since there isn't really any character bashing there.

Character bashing fanfics aren't really my thing to be honest. The only one I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a Snake]].
