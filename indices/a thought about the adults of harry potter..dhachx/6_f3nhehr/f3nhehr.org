The basis of your hypothesis makes sense. An unreliable narrator...especially a child... could realistically skew the perspective of actual events. That perspective could be a valid defense for those that say that all Slytherins are not evil. The ones Harry doesn't mention (Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, most of the other years) could simply be students keeping their head down and going to school. You could even...maybe...use such a justification to say Snape wasn't nearly as awful and biased to the students as Harry believes.

But there is no ambiguity in Fudge's character. Every adult on Harry's 'side' has the same opinion Harry has of the man. Honestly we don't need to know Harry's opinion on Fudge and his actions as the real life ramifications for his incompetence, corruption and cowardice are obvious from Book 3 on.

tl:dr While calling into question Harry's perspective on some characters is a reasonable basis for discussion you picked the absolute worst example in Fudge as he is clearly the incompetent, cowardly person Harry thinks he is.
