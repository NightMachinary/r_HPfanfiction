You make it sound like Fudge was some low level government employee just trying to provide for his family that got caught up by the circumstances. He aspired to be Minister of Magic. He willingly wanted to run the magical community in Britain and then ignored all of the atrocities that were taking place. Literally every decision he made was based on fear and self preservation.

I honestly can't think of anything worse than a leader in a post terrorist regime sticking their head in the sand to any potential terrorist threat. He tried to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts for underage magic after he used arguably the lightest spell in existence. To say Harry was wrong in his perspective of Fudge's actions is ridiculous.
