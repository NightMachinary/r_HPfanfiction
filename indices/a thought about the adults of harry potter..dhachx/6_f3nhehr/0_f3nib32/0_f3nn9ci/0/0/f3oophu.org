That is a mistake. You're shooting your point in the foot by using a character that doesn't support it just because he's the "worst". Being a Devils advocate doesn't mean you have to blindly support something with no evidence backing it up. It makes your point seem ridiculous even though you do have a pretty good one. Trust me I'm a big fan of Worm, protagonist centered morality and point of view distorting the audiences perception of characters, motivations and events is something I've given a lot of thought to.

Fudge isn't as bad as the worst of fanon, but he is actually pretty accurately portrayed in the books, and his character traits are displayed at several points in ways that Harry's childish PoV wouldn't be able to distort. This man is in charge of magical Britain, he very likely does have something going on in the background that Harry didn't cotton on to, but the major strokes of his character don't change no matter what you make up as a background for his actions.

Someone like Snape is a good example with actual depth behind it, use him instead.

The idea that Harry's childish point of view distorts how useful adults can be and their motivations does have some merit. Like with reporting the quill. But I think at the end of the day Rowling was writing YA fiction and Adults are useless is a useful trope for YA fiction writers, so if that plot demanded it thats how they were written in most instances. I do not think that Harry Potter is intended to be read through the viewpoint of a unreliable protagonist, it's YA.
