I think that the most unrealistic thing about DADA is that a large portion of the student body isn't working to counter that, somehow, similar to how it was done in the anime Another.

Just off the top of my head:

1. Don't teach inside of Hogwarts. Seriously, Floo powder, brooms, vanishing cabinets, and apparition all exist, so a teacher might as well teach in the United States, somewhere in the depths of the Antarctic Ocean, or in a nuclear bomb shelter.

2. Change the name of the class. Change it to Dumbledore's Army for all it matters, I am pretty sure that Harry's group didn't get nailed by the curse, as there was nothing stopping the group from reorganizing in the following books.

3. Change the name of what the teacher does. For example, Instructor, Sensei, Master, Tutor, Mentor, and Professor are all perfectly viable for this.

4. While having an actual DADA teacher under these preceding rules, have a Ghost "teach" DADA to either other ghosts or something else that is relatively disposable.
