I have one point to make about no non order members turning up to the battle. I think it's a fairly safe assumption to make that defense against the dark arts has been sub standardly taught for years at Hogwarts, so from that I always assumed that a large portion of the population simply didn't have the skills necessary for any kind of resistance. If I'm remembering correctly, the Weasley twins had good sales in shield hats because so much of the population couldn't cast a shield charm.
