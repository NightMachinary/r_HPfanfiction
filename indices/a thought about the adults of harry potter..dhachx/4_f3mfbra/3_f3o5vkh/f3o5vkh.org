You actually make a good point about the possibility of Hogwarts being a corrective Institution. I don't know how much other countries teach about American history, but it is very true that the American government forcibly displaced the children of Native Americans and brought them to corrective institutions in which they were forced to dress like the white folk. They were forced to learn white culture, the English language, Christianity, and were raised to view their Heritage as barbaric. When they were sent back to their tribes they would look at their parents and their culture with this disdain. If you look at how Hogwarts operates, how it's a boarding school and muggle-borns are pretty much pressured into attending, it is easy to say that it is a corrective institution.
