  For example - James Potter and Lily Evans as head boy and head girl? Absurd. Even ignoring the issues between Snape and the rest of the Marauders, it stinks of pro- Gryffindor favouritism and isolates the other three houses. I mean surely there was another candidate - a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw student if the headmaster didn't want to give the authority to a Slytherin student.

I think there was more to it. They were at war. He used them as role models for the views of his side of the war. Everyone knew they were against Voldemort. They were quite popular. They were a Pureblood and a Muggleborn. They were two of the best students in their year. Ergo, everyone who wasn't pro Voldemort or Bloodpurism looked up to them or at least respected them. By peer pressure/ the tendency to adapt the views of the majority they would have the support of most of the school if they were Headstudents which is an effective weapon against the enemy's propaganda.
