  Speaking of which, why do only Order members turn up to the Battle? There's people who want to take action surely? Parents whose kids have been trapped under the Carrows, whose Muggleborn classmates have been arrested. Why aren't they at the battle?

They /do/ show up. It's just not until morning when Slughorn comes back with the cavalry. The real question is why did it take so long?

(Not to mention there was zero narrative setup for the cavalry to arrive at all. It's not even a /Deus ex machina/. Harry was already playing his endgame. They were all just late to the party.)
