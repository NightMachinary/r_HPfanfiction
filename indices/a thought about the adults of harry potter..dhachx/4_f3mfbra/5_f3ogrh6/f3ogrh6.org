  For the DADA position has he tried offering single year contracts? I mean if he's so revered wouldn't a reference from him mean that you would get people from theoretically across the world could see it as an opportunity. Especially as there is supposedly such a small number of ancient schools of Hogwarts level

Being arrogant doesn't make one a terrible person and we see him turn Snape upside down and show his underwear. A bully yes, but I'm not calling it morally dubious.
