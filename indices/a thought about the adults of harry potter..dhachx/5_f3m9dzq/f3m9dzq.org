I think this is true to an extent though I also agree with the other people saying that the adults are written to be useless in order to facilitate the child heroes concept.

As adults we understand that there are external pressures that affect how an adult can act, I think this is shown to Harry a bit in OotP, Mcgonagall can't help against umbridge because she has no power in the situation and trying would only lead to more ministry restrictions or her dismissal. Harry understands a bit but he also thinks â€˜I can't go to her with anything about umbridge even if it gets worse' (I believe he only speaks to Mcgonagall before the blood quill) whereas an adult would realise Mcgonagall is picking her battles.

Also a key one is where Snape pretends not to understand Harry's warning about Voldemort having Sirius but we find out later he went and checked on him. As a child Harry doesn't understand that Snape can't answer him properly in front of all these witnesses and thinks he's just being deliberately unhelpful but we as adults know that Snape is under pressure to maintain his role as spy and that affects his actions.
