Yeah sorry that's what I was trying to get at, I wasn't very clear. Harry talks to Mcgonagall about how unfair it is that umbridge gave him detention for telling the truth and Mcgonagall doesn't act because she can't stop her without making a huge fuss and it's not worth it. But then Harry thinks that means it's not worth telling Mcgonagall about what's happening /in/ the detentions even though Mcgonagall might have had a far stronger reaction to that and done something about it. Mcgonagall comes across as useless to a child but as an adult you realise there could be more to this
