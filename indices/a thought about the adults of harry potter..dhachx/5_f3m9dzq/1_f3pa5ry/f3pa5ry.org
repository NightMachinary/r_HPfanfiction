  Also a key one is where Snape pretends not to understand Harry's warning about Voldemort having Sirius but we find out later he went and checked on him.

Did he do that in time though? I'm assuming he sent a Patronus message which was apparently outpaced by six thestrals to London?

The teens first had the confrontation with the centaurs and Grawp, flew to London from Scotland which should take a couple of hours, then had a running battle with Death Eaters. The Order arrived at the very end which I find very suspicious. The Patronus should have arrived in London well ahead of the teens and the Order should've cut them off at the Ministry Atrium. So I'm putting my money on Snape delaying in sending the message.
