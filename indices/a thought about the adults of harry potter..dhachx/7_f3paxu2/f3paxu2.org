I think people here should take the time to read linkffn(Stages of Hope), if they haven't already, for a perspective on the true nature and consequences of a civil war and child soldiers.

Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna from a canon-like universe, where the Death Eater takeover was an actual civil war with consequences, are transported to an alternate dimension where things are different. And the adults in the new dimension, upon learning of the lives of the four teens, keep asking themselves, /"What the fuck were the adults in that world doing?"/
