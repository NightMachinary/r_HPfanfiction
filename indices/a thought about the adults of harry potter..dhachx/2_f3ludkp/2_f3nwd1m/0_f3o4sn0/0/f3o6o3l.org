Not... sure what you expect him to do under that situation? It's not like he's ever shown to be able to produce a Patronus. All he can do is try to order it around, and dementors have been shown to not be great listeners.

As to it being suspicious, you can make a reasonable interpretation of the text in that direction, but it's still ultimately a personal interpretation i.e. fanon. As the canon facts go, there's no direct proof that he sicced the dementor on Crouch, just things that suggest that if seen in a certain light.
