That does raise the question of why Fudge had a dementor accompanying him in the first place, as opposed to, say, an Auror.\\
I mean, it was only last book that the dementors broke ranks twice, once to attend a Quidditch match (excusable?), the other to try and capital-K Kiss Harry Potter (not excusable).\\
That, and it's reasonable to assume that a) as Minister, he has a normal Auror/DMLE protection detail, and b) he doesn't have any particular obligation to bear witness to the arrest of Barty Crouch Jr.

So, because he 'felt his personal safety was in question', Fudge had a dementor brought all the way from Azkaban, /personally/ brought it into the castle (apparently leaving his Aurors behind, if he had them), /personally/ brought the dementor straight to the already subdued and restrained Death Eater, then stood aside and let the dementor do its thing. Kind of suspicious.
