Claiming Fudge's behavior was defensible is one of my pet peeves. He literally ordered Barty Crouch Jr. to be Kissed without an interrogation because he knew perfectly well what that interrogation would reveal. His attempt to snap Harry's wand was completely insane. These are the kind of hard facts that would require not that Harry has a kid's perspective but that he is literally lying to us about the events of the story, and at that point, maybe magic isn't real and the whole story is a series of interviews at Harry's inpatient psych ward.
