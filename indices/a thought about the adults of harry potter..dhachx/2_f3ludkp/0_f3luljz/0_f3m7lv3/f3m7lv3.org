We obviously don't. Hence all the bashing fics. We might understand his motivations better. Obviously, the whole of magical world has the sort of population that prefers the appearance of peace rather than actual peace. It's a stagnant world where people don't much like new ideas and thoughts. The major media outlets are all sources of state propaganda that does not even pretend otherwise. The justice system is insanely punitive and again crippled by the fact that the people prefer the appearance of justice to the fact of it. And Fudge, a man who keeps his power by virtue of using literal soul-sucking demons as his attack dogs to silence anybody who threatens his narrative of "carry on, nothing to see here", is but the pustule on top of an abscess that's rapidly turning necrotic.

But understanding these motivations only makes the actions of most of these adults worse because we can see what such actions stem from and what they lead to. They do not in any way mitigate them or excuse them.
