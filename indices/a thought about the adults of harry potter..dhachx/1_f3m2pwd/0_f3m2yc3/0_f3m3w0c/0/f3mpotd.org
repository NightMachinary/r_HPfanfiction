The adults dropped the ball on Halloween in book 1 and never picked it up again. No wait, they dropped it when they sent the "hero of the wizarding world" to live with a family of muggles without ever checking up on him, not even considering the possibility that someone who grew up with muggles might perhaps qualify for the same treatment as a muggleborn regarding their introduction to the wizarding world and not thousands of letters delivered to his house. And no, "why whould Dumbledore concern himself personally with Harry's upbringing, he has better things to do" does /not/ count. Dumbledore brought Harry to the Dursleys, probably against Wizarding laws regarding orphaned children, and thus was responsible for him. And disregarding that, Harry is a national treasure of the wizarding world and he is prophesied to be the only one who could defeat Voldemort, a prophecy that Dumbledore puts at least some stock in, and Dumbledore is not just the Headmaster of a school, he is also the leader of Wizarding Britain (responsible for Harry as he is something of a national treasure) and he is the leader of the resitance movement that Harry's parents were part of and for which they gave their life (responsible for Harry on a personal level).

I am not a fan of Manipulative Evil Dumbledore nor of Old Fool Dumbledore so the only interpretation of the character that I can get behind is a Utilitarian who will sacrifice a single child in order to save the Wizarding World. Which is not something I could judge him for, there is no question in my mind that the well-being of a single person (or a bunch of people) is less important than the survival of the whole society. And that he makes some mistakes along the way is just human.

Sorry for the rant, and I think I am not disagreeing with you except that I think it started way earlier.

Also, yes I know that the tone changed between the first and last book etc but there is just no way to not interpret what happens in the first books within the context of the rest of the series without some serious SoD-breaking disconnect.
