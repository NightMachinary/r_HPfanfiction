It does get tedious to read (sometimes good, sometimes ridiculous) justifications for canon adult actions in every other fic, but on the other hand it annoys me when fanfics introduce themselves as "what if X happened" or "what if Harry was dark/independent/whatever" and then it turns out they actually mean "... and also the entire world is completely different and everyone acts differently than their canon personality could ever predict but I will insist that it is not AU". I don't think you're guilty of that though, just wanted to say it.
