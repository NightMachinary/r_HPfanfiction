Yes there are instances of adults being occasionally useful to move the plot along. But there are far more instances of adults holding the idiot ball for the same reason, or even worse as the sole reason that there is a plot at all.

And perhaps from their own perspectives, the adults aren't completely useless, perhaps they just have ulterior motives that we are not privy to, but that actually seems kinda worse, at least for most of those adults.

But that's fine, the series is enjoyable even when you can't help but wonder if adults in the wizarding world have any justification to exist.
