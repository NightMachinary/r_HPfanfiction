You could also add in how a horcrux affects people. The Diary was essentially a leach, the locket was a bit of a mental terrorizer; we don't know enough about the other horcruxes effect on people to know if it was just these two, but why would it only be those two? I get the Diary, it was the biggest piece of Tom's soul. But the locket?

Taking that into account in this whole argument, how would a horcrux effect those around it if it was a part of something organic, something alive and with a complex mind? Nagini is the only other possible source for information on this and she wasn't one right from the start of the series. Not like Harry.

So, on top of the Dursley's negative emotions towards Harry, how much of it was aggrivated and made worse by the horcrux in Harry's scar?

How far would they have gone with their abuse if it wasn't there in the first place?

(And I'm fully aware of how this line of thinking could be completely wrong, but I had to point it out here.)
