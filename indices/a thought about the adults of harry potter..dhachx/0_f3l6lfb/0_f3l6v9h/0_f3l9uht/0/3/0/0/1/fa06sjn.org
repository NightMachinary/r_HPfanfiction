But the other horcruxes, specifically the locket, showed signs of self preservation, so i dont think the horcrux would allow anything to harm its host. And also also, in canon, only three things can harm a horcrux: basilisk venom, fiendfire and the killing curse. So by your logic, if the horcrux was strong enough to be affecting the people around it-therfore being the source of their hatred-wouldnt Harry be invulnerable to everything except the aforementioned weaknesses? Their treatment and all the injuries that Harry suffered as time went on wouldnt have affected him (except CoS and the killing curse at BoH).
