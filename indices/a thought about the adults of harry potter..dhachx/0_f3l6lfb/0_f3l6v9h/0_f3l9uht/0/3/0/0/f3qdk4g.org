I wasnt saying against itself. Just negetively affect people. And while i agree we havent seen anything with Nagini, we hardly saw her at all altogether. So how would we know? Yeah Harry could see through her eyes. Yeah she showed us Voldemort could posses her, and Harry, because of the horcrux. But the actual horcrux on people other than the host or Voldemort? We dont see her enough to be able to tell.

And Nagini wasnt one as long as Harry. She had his soul piece after she was fully grown, not when she was baby like Harry. How does that change Harry's situation in comparison to Nagini's similarities as a horcrix host?

As i also said, i could be completely wrong. I was just pointing out the possibility. The horcrux was important but how it affected people other than Voldemort brutalizing his own soul was a very vague concept Rowling didnt really explain to the readers.
