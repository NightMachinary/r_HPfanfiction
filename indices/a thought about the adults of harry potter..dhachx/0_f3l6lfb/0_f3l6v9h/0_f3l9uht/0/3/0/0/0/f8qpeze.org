Don't forget about Harry's Mother's protection... it probably encapsulated the horcrux and prevented any bleed-over to him.

But once Voldemort came back in some sense form, perhaps that was enough to erode the protection until he was having pain, visions, etc.

And once Voldiemort had Harry's blood, well... game on. He almost was able to possess Harry in the MoM atrium scene, if that didn't cause Voldemort quite a bit of caution.
