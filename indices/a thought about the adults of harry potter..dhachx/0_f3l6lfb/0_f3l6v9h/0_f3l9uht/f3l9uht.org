The thing about fanon is that it's usually based on canon, at least very loosely. The Evil Dumbledore trope came from years of manipulating everyone, keeping secrets, and never lost all traces of the "greater good" ideology that had inflamed him as a youth.

Vernon put bars on Harry's window, locked him in his room with limited bathroom breaks, and Petunia fed him through a catflap.

What changed was the power dynamic between Harry and the Dursleys. Harry went from being a burden on the Dursley family before Hogwarts, able to be kept quiet with a "Don't ask questions!" scolding, to after learning he had magic, being a source of fear. The Dursleys /did/ give Harry his own bedroom and started providing for his physical necessities after learning that Sirius Black, killer convict, was his godfather, and the Order members came around to check on him, but emotionally, they became more bitter and resentful with having him in their house.
