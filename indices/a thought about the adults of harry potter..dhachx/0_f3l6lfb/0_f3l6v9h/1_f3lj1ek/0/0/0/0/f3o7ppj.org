In real life, I would guess that people become evil because their circumstances teach them that evil works. I feel like that works in analyzing voldemort's actions, but doesn't seem to with harry. Of course, harry never quite learned to actively use his "accidental magic" (I hate that it's called that even when it's purposefully used, btw.) in the way that Voldemort did, so maybe he didn't have a chance to try out being evil to the dursleys.

When he first went to Hogwarts Ron and Hermione were generally nice to him, as well the other gryffindorgryffindors Iirc.

Till he threatened Dudley his first summer back, of course. And then soon after that a house elf ruined that for him.

Or maybe he was just born with a big heaping pile of love because reasons, and I'm overanalyzing the whole series and real life.
