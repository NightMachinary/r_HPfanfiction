It was, actually! It wasn't great, but it was good, and an interesting read. Idk if I can use ffnet bot on mobile but it's Harry Potter and the Champion of Yeshua by duskglow. As they say in the A.N. right at the beginning they try real hard to make Jesus just a character rather than some denominational interpretation. I won't spoil anything but it's worth the read if you have the time
