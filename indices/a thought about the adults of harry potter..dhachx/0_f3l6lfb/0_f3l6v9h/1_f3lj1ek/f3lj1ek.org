Unless goodness is some sort of predetermined magic thing, rather than a result of upbringing. It's possible that he was always going to come out as good as he did regardless of what the Dursley family did to him. We can't just assume that the rules of our world apply to the magical world. In fact, they probably don't! This is a world where fate and souls literally exist, after all.
