I kind of want to see a fic like that, without the clich√© "Tommy lives inside his head and slowly becomes not so evil but still evil because his character went past redemption into Evil at mach 7", but with a Harry whose Horcrux sort of functions as a protection, perhaps even layered into Lily's, so its evil influence can't poison harry's mind.

And make it really fucked up too, like instead of just repelling some death eater murderer the horcrux does a legilimency mindfuck and just annihilates the attacker's mind, or swaps their conscious with their subconscious or something equally disturbing
