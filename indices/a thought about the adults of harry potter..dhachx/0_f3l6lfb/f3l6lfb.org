  But other adult character's, how much of their story did we miss, how much did we take in from a child's eyes, and our own younger eyes.

â€‹Harry views the Dursleys from a child's eyes, for sure. He's been so acculturated to his life with them that he never relates the concept of "child abuse" toward his own upbringing, let alone acknowledges himself as a victim of abuse, even though what he describes of his childhood with them ticks off the checklist.

However, he does wise up a bit over the years, or maybe this was the result of JKR darkening the tone of the series to fit the audience.

Book 1 Harry:

  "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the humbugs and began to eat. It was all delicious."

Book 7 Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.

  This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."

The strange thing is how Harry undersells his mistreatment, but fanon takes it from the other side and amps it to eleven, where Fanon Dursleys will beat Harry black and blue every day and twice on Sundays, force him to get lower test scores than Dudley at school, and throw dinner scraps on the floor and make Harry eat them while laughing at him.
