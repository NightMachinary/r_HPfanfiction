Well, actual periods of near-starvation occur in between those two points. One year, Harry has to sneak out at night to get food. When Dudley goes on an apparently highly restrictive diet, they give Harry even less than Dudley so that at least Harry has it worse. Harry survives by eating cake Ron sends him (I think it was Ron, anyway).
