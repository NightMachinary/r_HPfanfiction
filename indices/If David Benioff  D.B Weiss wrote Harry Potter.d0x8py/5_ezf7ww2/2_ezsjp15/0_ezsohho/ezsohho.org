Just the season before she burned the food the Lannisters where taking from the Reach. She preaches that she cares about the people, yet because of that a lot of them would likely starve to death.

Every season she takes a step away from the innocent girl we met in Season 1 episode 1. Season 1, uncaring that her brother was killed. And I don't mean the fact that he was killed but how. She was detached.

Season 2, locked 2 people in a vault to die. Yes they were not the most innocent people in the world, but again a horrifying way to die.

Season 3, the sack of Astapor leaves a power vacuum.

Season 4, Killing Masters who do not even necessarily have anything to do with the killing of slaves. Confiscating wealth from all Masters.

Season 5, death without trail x2, attempts to kill the remaining masters but is ultimately talked out of it. Season 6, Nothing too major here, but she does demand that the Iron Born stop their historical activities without doing that herself.

Season 7, executes both Tarlys and does it by fire (The worst way to be killed even in medieval times), burns the baggage train of grains and food.

Season 8, disregard of the strain her forces and dragons will put on Winterfell's food supplies which would already be rather low after 5 years of wars. Tells Sam she killed her father and brother without much of a care. The "Who is manipulating whom here" scene, by aiding the North Daenerys is solidifying her claim by actually helping the people she claims to rule. Refuses to let her army rest before they go back south, leading to the devastation of her forces. (You can see the same with Harold's forced marches in the Norman Conquest.) Then after she executed Varys again by fire, she laments to Jon how she doesn't have the love of the people only fear. And after Jon refuses to kiss her more she states "Fear it is". Not seeing that her actions leads to fear.

And the finally renegades on her deal with Tyrion to halt the attack when the city bells rings. And instead set the entire city ablaze. And after she says they will go on and liberate people from their rulers everywhere. Then Jon questions her about how she knows what good is, and what about other people's perception of what is good. Her answers leaves a lot to be desired.

Each of these could be ignored on it's own, but put together it paints a picture of worsening morals.

"Breaking the wheel" would mean the destruction of the entire societal structure of the world. If that were to happen overnight it'd be chaos. Any pre-modern society that didn't operate on the concept of local strongmen were not likely to last long. And yet, that is what she proposed with that. At best she'd replace the nobles with maesters, and considering the maesters worked against magic, dragons and the Targaryen family in particular. I don't think she'd last all too long in that world.
