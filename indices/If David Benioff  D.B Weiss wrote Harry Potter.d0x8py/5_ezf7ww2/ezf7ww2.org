OMFG is every subreddit going to be invaded by "Hurr durr GOT didn't end the way I wanted it to so any foreshadowing people point to is nonexistent. Hurr durr"

You can divide screenwriting into 3 classifications: 1 Writing OC, 2 Writing an adaptation and 3 writing OC that fit with an adaptation.

Further, most issues that GOT got they got because they started with 1 book = 1 season. Partly because of the actors ageing. But as we know with hindsight, would not be that necessary. Now if they had doubled the seasons per book it might've become a lot better. They might've had something more than the basics of the story to work with in the last few seasons. But again hindsight allows people to see what should've been done, but it doesn't exist when it happens.

So if you're going to make this comparison, think that each book will be limited in size to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. So go ahead and try to re-write all Harry Potter books to 77K words.
