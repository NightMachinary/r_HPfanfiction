Cursed Child didn't ruin the trio for me, but they did ruin next gen fanfics, because I didn't have a solid impression of their personalities and character of the kids until I read the script. I can easily replace CC Ron, Harry, and Hermione with their book character in my mind, but not so much for Albus, Scorpius, and Rose.

I hate that Rose is a dick that bullies her own cousin for being in Slytherin. I dislike her end ship with Scorpius. I also hate that Hermione and Ron would raise a kid like her. Ugh.
