I could even live with the underwhelming ending to NK if it was the only problem. But every other plotline and character arc were ruined just as much. Every dumbest decision they could make, they did, and then some. And to be fair, season 7 sucked as well (Euron Greyjoy, why), we just had too much goodwill from the earlier seasons to notice the full extent of it.

Imagine the big showdown with Voldemort where Harry fails to kill him because "they just forgot about the +Iron Fleet+ locket Horcrux"
