Spot on.

If you came out of the +last episode+ epilogue thinking it was a stupid asspull that came out of nowhere, you just weren't paying attention. It was foreshadowed several books ago! Anyone upset about the ending only feels that way because they're mad that their theories didn't come true.

What did you expect, Harry would marry Hermione and pop out a half dozen green-orbed babies, then live happily ever after, all is well???
