Voldemort gets killed in the middle of DH by Luna Lovegood, after which Harry snaps and unleashes Fiendfyre on London to teach the wizards who let Voldemort happen a lesson. It's all foreshadowed when he tried to Crucio Bellatrix and used Sectumsempra on Malfoy. Hermione kills Harry for the greater good and leaves magic to live in the muggle world. Professor Binns is the new Minister for Magic, with Mundungus Fletcher in charge of the economy.

Edit: Snape gives up any attempts of redemption and rejoins Death Eaters just because.
