Then the last book would be even worse! The hero would fully be Hermione, who transfered the horcrux to herself and who then kept the hollows in order to tear down the ministry (Dany-Style with a dragon or something) and give muggleborns their place in society...and she would then be killed by Dobby who would then tell them to vote for a new leader (maybe Harry) while Dobby returns to servitude (his version of the Wall) :(
