Personally i always liked "the well groomed minds" take on Hermione's life. Her parents are upper middle class dentist who spend almost all their time on work. Their intelligent daughter is raised by the nanny/au pair and the private tutors. The only time her parents spend with her is on the obligatory vacation in France.
