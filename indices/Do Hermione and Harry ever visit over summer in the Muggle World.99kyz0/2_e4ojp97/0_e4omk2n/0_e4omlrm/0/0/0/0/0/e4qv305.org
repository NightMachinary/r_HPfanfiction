Meh. I think even that is too "odd" --- I mean, I know it happens a lot in real life, but it's still a situation that has narrative weight, to an extent; there's tension, drama. Not much of it, but "rich parents not spending time with kid" is something that a /lot/ of movies have milked, so it can clearly be spun into a story. I prefer them to be absolutely what they appear to be at face value: nice, ordinary parents raising their daughter ordinarily.

(Also, if Hermione really was raised by a nanny, how odd that she wouldn't send /her/ to Australia for protection too...)
