I think the idea with that is that unlike Harry and Ron, she has an /ordinary/ home life. She has generally nice, supportive parents doing an ordinary job and living an ordinary life. They have no particular quirks or interesting features. The Grangers (Hermione's magic aside) are people you could bump into on the street, as opposed to characters you could see in a movie as are the Dursleys and the Weasleys.

Bottom line, showing more of their home life would be /boring/.
