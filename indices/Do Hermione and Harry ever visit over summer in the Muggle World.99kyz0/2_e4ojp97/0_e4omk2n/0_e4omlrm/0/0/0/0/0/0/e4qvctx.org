True but there is a narrative with Hermione's parents. That is the total lack of them. If she had a good relationship they would be mentioned.

Regarding the australia thing for me fits more with a girl that loves her parents as parents but not much more and has therefore no trouble with turning them basically in totally different people.

But i get where you are coming from.
