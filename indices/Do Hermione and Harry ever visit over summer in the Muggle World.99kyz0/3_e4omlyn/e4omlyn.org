Like [[/r/DZCreeper]] said, Harry was in no state to be visited when he was stuck with a household of drill-making cartoon blaggards. It's not absurd to think Hermione might have occasionally visited the /Burrow/, however, though I don't think she'd ever sleep over there (because unlike Harry, she /likes/ her family, and thus would want to make the most of the few months she can spend with them).
