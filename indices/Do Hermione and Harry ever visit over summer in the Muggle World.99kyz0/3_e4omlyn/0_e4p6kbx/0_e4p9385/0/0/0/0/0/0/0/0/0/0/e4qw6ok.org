Yep i know about that.

I simply dont buy into the narrative tbh it doesnt make sense. To me it always seemed like Rowling wanted some dickensian childhood where the kids get rescued. That went wrong when she started sending him back every year for more abuse.

It went even more wrong when it didn't get any place in the story. Nobody ever notices or brings it up in any way. Neither at hogwarts nor before that: the weasley's, Hermione, any of the teachers, the school nurse, his primary school teachers, not any of the nosey neighbours nobody.\\
Not only that he is indeed starved according to the books that didnt seem to have any impact on his ability to play physically heavy sports or activities. He barely seems to hold a grudge and goes to the efforts of saving them in book 7. According to rowling his and dudley's children play togheter. It basically is a non issue except for the fact that it is happening. You could bascially just cut it out which for me makes it rather a weird part of the books.
