One of my fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] linkao3(14392005) half meets your request - it's about Harry's feelings regarding Dumbledore's death, but the premise is that Dumbledore tells him about the curse before he dies, so there aren't any outside observers. Unfortunately, I can't think of any other fics that come closer, and I've looked pretty damn hard for (non-slash) fics about Harry and Dumbledore over the years.

However, I have a suspicion that this idea may not leave me alone now that it's in my head, so - while I'm loathe to make any promises - maybe I'll write it. If I do, is there anything in particular you imagine happening?
