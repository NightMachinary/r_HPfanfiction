  at the end of the day he told a notorious, mass murdering psychopath who had entire families killed off that a baby could beat him. Snape's basically an accessory to murder---someone once compared him to the getaway driver of a bank robbery where the bank robbers end up unexpectedly killing someone.

Actually, it is worse. The getaway driver didn't expect killing of somebody during the bank robbery to happen. Snape did know (or at least a reasonable person in his place would know) that the murder most likely will happen. And yes, the fandom's excuse that he didn't know it was Potters is the lamest excuse possible. If some other family was killed, it would be OK? So, yes, whitewashing of his crime(s) (you are not a Death Eater by being a law abiding citizen) is something which started with JKR herself somewhere in the middle of the books (Snape started as completely disgusting person, who was Neville's boggart, and only in later books he turned into that sophisticated sarcastic dark intellectual most fanfic authors writing about him prefer). Putting such person into a position where he could affect eleven-year old kids is truly questionable.

On the other hand, Snape being a horrible person, potentially a criminal guilty of many crimes, corresponds pretty much with the real life. Most double agents are quite suspicious persons, they wouldn't do it otherwise. Actually, most people dealing with spies are not very nice people, that goes with the profession. And yet, such horrible persons, are sometime extremely valuable for the war effort. Life is sometimes not nice.

Which doesn't change anything, that it is not correct to whitewash his crimes, or that Dumbledore must be bashed for employing him under blackmail (most spies are to some extent blackmailed into their effort). It of course also doesn't mean anything that having him unsupervised as a teacher is highly questionable (there are many ways how he can be persuasive teacher and even show his partiality for the Slytherin house, and not being so nasty to Neville and Hermione, he would be boggart for the former). Life is sometimes very complicated.
