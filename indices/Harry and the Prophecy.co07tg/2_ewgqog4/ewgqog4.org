I think Harry's relationship to Snape's crimes is just a symptom of a larger problem with Rowling's writing: she gets an idea of how things are/should in her head, can't move past it, and doesn't really think it through.

Voldemort was an insanely magically powerful mass murderer, and Snape knowingly and intentionally told him how to find the one person (a baby, at the time) who could stop his rise to power. Even if you ignore the wider impact of that, he's still condemning a random, innocent family to death. Dumbledore says that he "made a mistake," but that simply /is not true./ What he /actually/ did was make a conscious choice that didn't pan out how he wanted (and we see in Deathly Hallows how things would have gone if it had). But, despite all of that, Rowling had decided that Snape was redeemable, so she had Harry forgive the man who indirectly orphaned him and spent six years disparaging the memory of a man he got killed /after James saved his life./

I mean think about that. James saved Snape's life, Snape got James and his wife killed, leaving their son orphaned and condemning him to ten years of abuse and neglect, then met that son ten years later in a situation where Snape was in an explicit position of authority over him. He then spent the next six years abusing that authority to insult James (who, and I know I keep saying this, but it's impossible to overstate, /is only dead because of him/) to Harry (who has suffered his entire life because Snape got his parents killed and put him in Voldemort's crosshairs) and bully Harry with impunity.

Harry choosing to forgive this isn't indicative of his character so much as of Rowling having decided that Snape was "morally complex" and either failing to notice or refusing to accept that the character she'd written was actually a villain who happened to be on the heroes' side by coincidence.

Edit: aaaand I just realised that this was a recommendation post, not a discussion, so my whole comment is kinda completely irrelevant. Oops.
