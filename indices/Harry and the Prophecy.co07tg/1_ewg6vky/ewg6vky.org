  Snape's basically an accessory to murder
#+end_quote

There's basically no possibility that he was a part of the Death Eaters for any length of time without torturing a few Muggleborns to death, so accessory is basically small potatoes in the grand scheme.

James: My friends are going to get you possibly attacked by a werewolf? I'll rescue you at great personal risk to myself. I hate you, but I couldn't possibly stand by and see you hurt or killed.

Snape: I accidentally sicced the Dark Lord Voldemort, the most powerful and most sadistic Dark wizard in history on you, your wife, and your year-old child? Uh... don't kill his wife, if possible, my master. I'd really like to bang her after he's dead.
