Yes, Snape was a spy that was feeding information to both sides. I cannot help but think what kind of information about the light side or the order, Snape used to give to Voldemort to stay in his good side. I mean Snape had to feed good and correct information to Voldemort right??? Did Snape knew about the plan on Amelia Bones's assassination plan and did nothing or withheld information on purpose. Could Snape have saved some lives if he tried???? Could Snape have forgotten his childhood rivalries and saw Harry for who he truly was????.
