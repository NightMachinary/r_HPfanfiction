I'm a big fan of writing xovers specifically with various game franchises and whenever I write I always put together a playlist of songs made for that game (so miracleofsound, jt machinima, dan bull, defmatch etc) or I listen to soundtracks or both like I have with the hp bloodborne xover I'm putting together.
