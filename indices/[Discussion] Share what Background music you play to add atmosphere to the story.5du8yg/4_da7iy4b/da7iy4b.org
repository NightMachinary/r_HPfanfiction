I don't generally listen to music while I'm reading, or at least don't specifically relate it to what I'm reading (I just have it on in the background). However, I do pretty much consider [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jFVPsTEfM][Won't Go Home Without You]] by Maroon 5 to be the unofficial theme song of linkffn(The Unwinding of Percy Weasley). It fits the climax of that story so perfectly.
