I don't buy this in this context. While it's generally true that creativity tends to be (for want of a better term) cooler in a system with clear limitations, Nen in HxH is incredible open in what it allows for many of its characters to do.

Sure HP is a lot broader but the creativity is more in how the spells are used as opposed to the spell itself being the product of creation. See a lot of Hermione's spellcasting. Also this:

  but in an arguably detrimental manner, as well as not well-defined and consisting of poorly translated Latin canon and fanon spells

When is there poorly translated Latin in series? A lot of people seem to think JKR was stupid or something for not simply pasting in complete, real Latin words instead of mashing together bits of them. But what they fail to note is she's going for style, ease of speech, etymological comprehension and memorability. /Expelliarmus/ is used because it's really easy, even for young people, to read the word and have an immediate idea about the effect ("Ah, I bet that expels, or rather, removes, the target's weapons or what have you", as an example).
