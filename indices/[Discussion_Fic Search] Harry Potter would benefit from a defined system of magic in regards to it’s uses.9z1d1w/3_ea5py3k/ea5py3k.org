Well, with regards to combat, the thing is that any system can and usually is "gamed" - both by authors and by the characters using it. If you're risking your life in combat, you generally go for what works best when fighting. I encounter this often when writing battle scenes. Sure exotic spells would add colour - but few of my characters would use exotic spells when a simpler spell they know by heart would work as well or better, and few would learn a lot of exotic spells when there are simpler spells who work in more situations. The Stunner is a staple for very good reasons, for example, and superiour to most spells in many situations. Many fanon spells are basically useless from a tactical perspective because they need to hit the target, but then don't take it out at once or even need a second spell to "complete the combo". You can see that in games: If there are spells who take out a target in one hit, then debuffing the target is only viable if that's easier than hitting with the kill spell and makes hitting them with a kill spell easier.

So, even if you add a rich, creative range of combat spells, odds are most characters will use the same select few if they were staying in character.
