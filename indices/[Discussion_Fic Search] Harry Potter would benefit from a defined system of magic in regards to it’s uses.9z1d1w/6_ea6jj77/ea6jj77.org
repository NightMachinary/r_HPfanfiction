I'm reading a Harry Potter story, not watching a Dota/League game.

I don't want to be able to do a calculation of how many hitpoints a character will take and what set of debuffs and DoTs apply to them.

I want combat that shows the strengths, weaknesses and personalities of the participants in a creative way.

Take, for example, linkffn(A Black Comedy).

ABC has amazing fights which showcase the personality of Harry, Sirius and James pretty darn well, and are a pleasure to read. You don't need to know the pig latin spells, the scenes work anyways, because nonjon is a good author.

And those scenes are that great because of the freedom of the looseness of canon. Sure, nonjon would probably also be able to write an impressive scene with a hero with four Dota-style abilities, but the creativity of both the spells he uses and how he uses the established magic arms is nothing short of amazing.

And in canon, regarding the new films: It is an amazing way to differentiate normal-skilled characters that treat wands as guns from the high-skilled amazing characters that use magic creatively and seem to be less affected and restricted by "point-and-shoot"-spells.

The magic system in HP works pretty well imo, and allows for creative fanfiction without being as soft as the LOTR-system.
