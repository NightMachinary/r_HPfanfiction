I would think the ambiguity of canon is more help than hindrance. It gives writers freedom to interpret and portray things how they like, as you wrote. They can invent whatever they want for their story and have it plausible for canon.

That being said, in my opinion having (and explaining in detail) a complex 'system' is pretty boring to read, no matter how well conceived. You don't need any of that to write a decent battle scene.
