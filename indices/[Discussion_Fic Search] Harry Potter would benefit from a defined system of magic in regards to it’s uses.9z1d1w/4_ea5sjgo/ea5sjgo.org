I'm not a fan of battle sequences, but I would have also liked to see JKR develop a 'harder' magic system for HP. I mean, Care of Magical Creatures (Hagrid went overboard but it usually covers safer and more common creatures) is an optional course starting in year 3 but Astronomy is so important that it is mandatory for 5 years - why? Unfortunately JKR sucks at world building - I feel like her writing process was "here's a plot, now let's see what interesting characters and random magical elements I can shoehorn in?"
