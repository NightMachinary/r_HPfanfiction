I think too many people forget that using magic is not the same thing as magic itself.

Magic is as it always was. What people do is the thing that changes.

How do people end up doing what they do? A hypothetical example:

Ancient wizard caveman can make fire without sticks. Holding wood staff makes fire better. Many generations later, tying feather from some birds to some sticks makes fire much better. Generations later and wizard staffs are a thing some guy accidentally teleports and loses his foot. He remembers what teleporting felt like and learns how to do that and tells his clan what he did.

Rinse and repeat until you have wizard enclaves with their own internal knowledge. Various wars and power struggles result in lost knowledge and one way of using magic starts being used instead of another for purely political reasons. Eventually wands happen, a sort of informal government happens, etc...

Just knowledge and events building on previous knowledge and events until you have the modern wizarding world. Lots of lost and suppressed knowledge. Always more to discover or invent.
