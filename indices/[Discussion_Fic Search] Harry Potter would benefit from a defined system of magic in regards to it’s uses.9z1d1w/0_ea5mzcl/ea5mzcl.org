I would argue that the open nature is a great boon independent of what you are writing. It gives you the freedom to make magic exactly what you need for your story, from some well researched Norse runes up to "enchanted AK-47s".

Even with well-defined canon magic you would often run out into situations where you need to be creative, but you have to keep the whole thing in mind instead of inventing magical spikes which shoot out of the ground and impale people. And if your ideas are incompatible, you have to make up your own thing either way.
