A curse that affects the victims emotions. They are cursed to feel the opposite emotion that they're feeling at any and all moments. So they're happy when someone close to then dies, they can only feel anguish when their child is born, they're sad when they're eating their favourite food. You can push this further with people finding enjoyment in hurting others or something like that. Having to deal with logically knowing that what they're doing is wrong but still doing it because they don't want to live a life filled with sadness and anger. And when they finally come to accept and actually enjoy the horrible things they do, have the emotion switch up again and have them feel the disgust towards the things they're doing again, and hating theirselves for it.

Maybe some curse that makes the victim feel like worms are crawling underneath their skin. The victim could become more and more insistent that they can feel the worms crawling inside them, with medical staff saying that there are no actual worms inside them. Till it becomes to much and the victim starts cutting in their own skin where they feel the worms in order to get them out.

A curse that reverses the effect of medical magic. Healers would use more and more magic to heal the randomly appearing wounds on the victim, not knowing that they're at fault.
