I was thinking along the line of your brain getting kicked into overdrive. Your mind is highly alert, ready to interpret and react to any sensation, only there is nothing for it to work with. Combine that with an already panicked state from the sensual deprivation and you start to imagine worse and worse scenarios, start to haluscinate as your thoughts are your only reality right now. Your only escape would be to fall asleep, but you can't because you are full of adrenaline.

It doesn't have to be a literal sugar rush. Just a similar effect.
