Reminds me of a story I heard from my old OM who was in the army. They used to carry essentially really powerful epi-pens, designed to give you a surge of adrenaline that could keep you going if you were severely injured/dying and were trying to get to safety. From what I heard if someone in their quarters really pissed everyone off they stick them with one of the pens before they went to be so they wouldn't be able to sleep due to all the adrenaline.
