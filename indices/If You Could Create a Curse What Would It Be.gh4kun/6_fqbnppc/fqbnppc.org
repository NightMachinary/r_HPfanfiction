It doesn't really fit into the theme but a curse I've been thinking about for a while is a microwave pulse charm. Invisible, causes severe internal burns and fries electronics, needs a very obscure shield charm to block it because the normal one only stops magic and physical damage like shockwaves, but not EM radiation. Goes straight through conjured stone barriers, but can be blocked and even reflected back with metal. Because it's invisible it needs a lot of practice to aim properly. Most of the power of it is that the first targets won't know what they got attacked with, once the enemy knows that you're using it they'll be able to defend against it. I'd imagined it as something a dark Hermione would create, since Herpo probably wouldn't know about electromagnetic waves. It could be something he stumbled across and didn't know how it worked and when it's used in the modern day someone realizes what it's doing and comes up with the conjure a sheet of metal defense.
