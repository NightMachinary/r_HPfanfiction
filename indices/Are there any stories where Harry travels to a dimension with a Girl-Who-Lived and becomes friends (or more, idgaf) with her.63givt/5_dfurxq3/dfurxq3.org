It only happens pretty later, but there is something like that in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][/Core Theads/]], which is awesome anyway. For bonus points, the alternate dimension the GWL is from also has a Manipulative Dumbledore and super-helpful-Goblin-inheritance-laws and things like that; bottom line being, it's a "clich√© fanfic" universe, which is a source of great fun for Harry.
