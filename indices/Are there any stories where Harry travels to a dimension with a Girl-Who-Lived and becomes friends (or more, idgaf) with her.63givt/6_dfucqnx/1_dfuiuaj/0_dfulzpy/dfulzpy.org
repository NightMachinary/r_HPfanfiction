Not really. The author has this thing about well-written stories that get philosophical. Absurdism is the main theme here. I am actually rereading it right now, and I can confirm that it is one of those fics whose quality transcends tropes. I normally hate fem!Harry, but the writing and plot are so good that this is the exception.
