Obviously, she has flaws. That's what good writing is. But consider that she's very helpful (especially with studies), loyal and brave. Ron ditched Harry multiple times. But Hermione was by his side throughout. She figured out that Sirius being tortured was a trap. Yet, she followed her friend knowing that they were being led to possible death at the hands of the Dark Lord. I think that shows extreme loyalty to one's freinds and great courage.

As Dumbledore would say, she does what is right instead of what is easy. When the Firebolt arrived, she could've let Harry keep it. But she did the right thing out of concern for her friend, even though she knew they would be angry with her. And she was actually right about the broom --- it really /was/ sent by Sirius. Of course, he was innocent but no one knew that so she can't be faulted for it. Considering this, Harry's and Ron's behavior to her seems really petulant. That they were more concerned about having fun with the broom than protecting themselves form an escaped mass murderer shows how immature they are compared to Hermione.

All the faults that she has (arrogance, etc), Harry and Ron have ten fold. Anyway, would you really want her to not be bossy or arrogant? That would just make her a complete Mary Sue --- Intelligent, modest, powerful, loyal and brave.

Ultimately, we can't convince each other obviously. To each his (or her) own. I will point out that she is the favorite (or close to favorite) character of almost every Potter fan I've met.
