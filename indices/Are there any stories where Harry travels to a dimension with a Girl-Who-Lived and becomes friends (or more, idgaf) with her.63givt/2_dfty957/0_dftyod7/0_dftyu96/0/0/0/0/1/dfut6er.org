I agree that everyone have flaws, even real human being and that's normal. Why do you like A but dislike B? Because of his flaws. If I met a Hermione in real life. I wouldn't become his friend because his flaw are unbearable for me and outweight his quality. And what if she is the most favortie character of almort every Potter fan you met? Does that mean that if most people think that the earth is flat then it is true? Majority doesn't mean truth.
