Definitely possible. But she /does/ feature near the top in pretty much all online favourite character polls and such that I've seen. I believe [[http://m.imgur.com/yuqeZXx][she was second in this sub's survey]] at 33%. Harry was first at 35%. And after these two, there was a large drop off for Luna at 23%, indicating that Harry and Hermione are head and shoulders above others in this sub --- something I've noticed in most places. Curiously, the usually popular Snape doesn't seem that well like here.
