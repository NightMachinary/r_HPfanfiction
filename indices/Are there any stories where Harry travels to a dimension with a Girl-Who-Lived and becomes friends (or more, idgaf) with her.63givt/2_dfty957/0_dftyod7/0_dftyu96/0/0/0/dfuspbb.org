She is bossy (Do I really have to proove it?) , annoying (All I remember from her is her bossing Ron and Harry around and wanting them to do everything she want.), intelligent but not clever (I admit she is intellignet, after all she manage to learn all her books but she lack a lot of deduction and street smart. Like for example, Malfoy.), arrogant (If someone else try to be clever she will ignore him. Again, like when Harry guessed that Malfoy wanted to kill Dumbledore. She just ignored him.) Jealous and selfish. (Remember her reaction when Harry bested her in potion? OR even better, her reaction when Ron date Lavender?)

That's 10% of why I hate Hermione, and I'm really not limiting myself considering that for me all Hermione centric fic are really bad. I read a lot where she is bashed and ignored and to be honest I really love them.

I know I tend do sound rash when I speak about Hermione so I'm going to drop this smiley to light my text. :p
