I think you're really exaggerating the universal Hermione love that you've experienced, or maybe you've chanced into being surrounded by mostly her fans. Shes definitely not universally hated by any means but plenty of people dislike it her. She was a top fav of mine for a long time but ive become increasingly ambivalent towards her at least from a ff point of view.

I do think Quoba is limiting himself by seeming to universally disregard any fic with her involvement but the consumption of Fanfictions definitely a highly personal thing and i have found myself disregarding certain fics for specific criteria like that too. Fanfictions both great and terrible cause the authors can impose so much of their own will onto a character that it can change you're view of said character in the long term.
