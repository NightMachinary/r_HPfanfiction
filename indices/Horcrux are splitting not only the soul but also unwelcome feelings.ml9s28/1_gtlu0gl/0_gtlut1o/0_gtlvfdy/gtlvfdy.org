FMA spoilers The big bad removes his unwanted feelings (aka the seven deadly sins) and made them into homunculi who embody that sin. For example, greed is greedy, sloth is lazy, etc. They're not exactly horcrux-like but they are fueled by philosophers stones and can live as long as the stone is fueled. The big bad is also like that, ie immortal as long as his philosophers stone is fueled. He can also reabsorb their philosophers stones so they're basically horcruxes. One of the homunculi also eats another for more energy (or maybe just for their powers. I don't remember exactly)
