I'm not sure about the horcruxes embodying certain feelings or attitudes, but I do feel that the obvious implications of the diary and locket are that there could in fact be MULTIPLE Voldemorts running around at the same time, and I honestly don't feel like anybody has ever tried to run with that or do the concept justice. If Ginny had died in the chamber, there would be a Tom Riddle AND a Lord Voldemort running around. Strictly speaking, this potential exists for every single soul fragment Voldemort split off.

This is also my own personal fanon reason for why older Dark Lords never tried to do what Voldemort did. They were afraid of possibly creating copies of themselves that would try to usurp them. The more horcruxes you have, the greater the odds that one of them will possess somebody and then you have another version of yourself running around that you have to deal with.
