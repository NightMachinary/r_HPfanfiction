In this, I take my lead from canon.

There are, for example, a lot of "Uncle Sirius" fics, but Harry never calls him anything but Sirius, Snuffles or Padfoot to my recollection. This would probably follow through with Andromeda even though the relationship is different.

Another way you can approach this is how Harry and co. refer to older members of the Order. Unfortunately, right now, I can only recall Tonks, but Shacklebolt, Mundungus etc. etc. are worth thinking about. I think they're usually referred to by their surnames... presumably because there's something of a professional relationship.

It also depends on who you're looking at. Harry is always very insistent on calling Snape, Snape and everyone else is constantly going /Professor/ Snape. In contrast, Harry always thinks in terms of Mr and Mrs Weasley. I can definitely see Arthur and Molly asking to be referred by their first names (certainly after any marriage, but probably before as well)... but I also think Harry would sometimes lapse back to Mr and Mrs Weasley. (I can't remember, but I think Harry varies between Remus and Lupin.)

So... let's break it down:

- peers you like => first name (Ernie)
- peers you don't like => surname (Malfoy)
- teachers... either Professor Surname or Surname depending on person
- respected elders... Mr/Mrs (and presumably Ms and Miss) Surname
- elders whose relationship to subject is professional => surname
- elders whose relationship to subject is personal => first name
- elders you're disrespecting... first name (Tom)

with stickiness, i.e. occasionally reverting to an older form of address/how the subject originally referred to the person in question

So, I'm pretty confident Harry would call Andromeda, Andromeda and Teddy would call Harry, Harry (and Ron, Ron and so forth). Not so sure about your other questions.
