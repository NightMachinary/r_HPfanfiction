There's potentially a class factor, as well. It's more evident in Enid Blyton than in Harry Potter, but it's there. Mundungus and Tom the barman are only ever that - we dont know Tom's last name, and Dung is rarely called Fletcher or Mr Fletcher. Lower and middle classes are more likely to want informal first name.
