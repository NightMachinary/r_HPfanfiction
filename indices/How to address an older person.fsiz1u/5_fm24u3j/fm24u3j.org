Arthur and Molly would probably insist to be called like this pretty quickly, especially considering both Harry and Hermione relations as in law, hell Harry could even get to call they Dad and Mum (Hermione may too but a bit more difficult when your actual parents are still there).

For the teacher, depend of the context. A Ministry Ball (fanon loves it) where they are here because of their positions? Or a parent meeting at Hogwarts? "Professor" until asked to do otherwise.\\
Just meeting them in Diagon Alley? Mr and Mrs until asked to do otherwise (I would guess that McGonagall would give them a pass very quickly, but other teacher like Flitwick or Sprout would need more time as the heroes are not as close to them).

Pretty hard to guess for other characters, someone like Slughorn would probably insist to be called Horace by "heroes" like the Trio, but someone less well known like, let's say, Dean, may not be granted the right (though Slughorn would probably ignore someone who is neither a genius, a celebrity, or close to a celebrity).

Finally, for the Malfoys in a Dramione or Drarry situation, I think it doesn't matter. Since neither of these ships have any chance to happen with canon character.\\
They are Blood Purist so Hermione would never be accepted by them, so even if you fabricate a situation where they end up together, either "Reformed" Draco is estranged to his parents, or the parents or OOC enough that you can do anything you want.\\
Harry is a man, and while I don't think the Magical World would be as against homosexuality as the real world can be, 2 mans can't have a child together (except in the . . . mpreg fanon). And considering the importance given by Blood Purist to Blood (duh), not being able to sire a child is probably a deal breaker. So either they both have a "deep friendship" while doing their duties to their wife (at least Draco), or not accepted by parents. If "accepted", I guess that Harry statues as the man who killed Voldemort (again) would give him some leeways in how to call the Malfoys.
