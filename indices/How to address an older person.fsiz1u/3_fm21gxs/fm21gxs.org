I'd call everyone by first names after being invited too. Otherwise it's Mr or Mrs. In public I'd call the Professors Professor and first names in private. Anyone I don't have a good relationship with would be called by surname only. Like Snape or Malfoy's.

EDIT: I'm basing this on being an adult, I would never have called a teacher by first names as a pupil.
