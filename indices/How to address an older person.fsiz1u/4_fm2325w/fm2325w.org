Mr / Mrs [last name] would generally be used unless the adult gives permission to use their first name, or introduces themselves using their first name. For the teachers, it would be sir or miss, Mr [last name] or Mrs [last name]. A lot of Colleges / Sixth Forms and Universities involve students and teachers being on a first name basis, however this depends on said educational establishment. However, for Hogwarts, it would still be professor or professor [last name], or sometimes sir if it is a certain grumpy potions professor.

Essentially, it is formal titles unless said person lets you use their first name (although formal titles would still be used when necessary). However, this permission depends on the closeness of the two people, the situation they are in and their personalities.
