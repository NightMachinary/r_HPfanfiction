I am relatively of an age and place to Harry Potter the character. I do tend to be quite formal and aware of my 'place', so some characters might not do as I do. I'm pretty solidly middle class, which does affect my answer here.

I would call Molly and Arthur "Mr & Mrs Weasley" until they asked for something different. If they did not ask, I would quite possibly call them that forever, which would be very strange later in life. If they asked me to call them by their first names when I was still under about 16, I would just never use a name for them because I would feel uncomfortable doing so. After marriage, it would not be unusual for them to ask me to call them Mum and Dad.

It would be seen as extremely inappropriate to refer to a teacher by their first name, even in private. This includes Madam Pomfrey. Likely if the character stayed in touch after school they would eventually graduate to first names, but this would be instigated by the teacher.

Andromeda, it depends on how close a relationship we had but assuming that she would become like an aunt, it would probably be okay to call her by her first name. I'd probably call her Mrs Tonks and then she would immediately say 'No, call me Andromeda' and then I would.

Eh, it's hard to say whether Lucius and Narcissa would allow first names. I would think so, to be honest. I think either surnames and titles or first names wouldn't strike me as particularly strange.

Hope this is at least a bit helpful!
