I hope you like the story then. Next to tactics for "combined arms" (or my take on how to use both muggles and wizards together in combat), I tried to show how politics and logistics play a major role in a war, unlike skirmishes or individual fights, and how tactics adapt to those used by the enemy - though usually from the perspective of individual soldiers.
