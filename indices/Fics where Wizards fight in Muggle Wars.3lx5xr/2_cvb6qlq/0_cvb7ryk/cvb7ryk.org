Technically, "Old Soldiers Never die" only mentions squibs fighting in muggle wars, but has squibs fighting muggle-style in a wizard war.

Are you specifically looking for wizards fighting in muggle wars, or will any war where muggles and wizards fight side by side, and you have spells and machine guns mixing it up do? I've written linkffn(10595005), which for the most part (after chapter 10 or so) deals with such a war.
