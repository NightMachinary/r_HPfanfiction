In some of the old ones like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]] Ginny gets called Virginia. Aldo in some really ancient ones you'll get stuff like the Potters being older, weird explanations for Voldemort's immortality pre-horcrux reveal, and complete books written with the name of whatever book wasn't published yet.
