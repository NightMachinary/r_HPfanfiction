Agreed, I prefer Jane as well too. Despite the connection to Umbridge. I mean, I'm a woman born in the 80's in the US. Pretty much my entire generation has the middle name Marie. Not everyone, but over half my high school class, and lots of other people my age, haha. Middle names wax and wane in popularity just as much as first names.
