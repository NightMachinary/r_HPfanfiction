I believe it was founded in 1998. Before that idk about others but we used to have like, message boards we posted on, to be honest. Then upgraded to fic or fandom based geocities etc sites we made. Luckily [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and [[https://fandomination.net][fandomination.net]] came along because my angelfire sites weren't pretty.
