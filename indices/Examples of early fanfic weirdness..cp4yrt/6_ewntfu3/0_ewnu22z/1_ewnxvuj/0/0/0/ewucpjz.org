Pregnancy in general will kill a fic for me (unless they're adults and post-Hogwarts/war but I typically don't read those).

I actually read one that /was/ post-epilogue, and it was a Harry/Rose fic. Don't remember why I even started reading it, it just intrigued me I guess. Harry and Ginny were divorced, Rose had a huge crush on Harry and ended up going with it after she turned 17, Hermione knew and was okay with it because Rose had wanted it for a while and was an adult, Ron and Ginny didn't find out until later and were pretty pissed.

It was pretty fluffy and I enjoyed it, then maybe halfway through suddenly Rose has to confront her abusive ex bf who's now constantly trying to attack her, she suddenly has panic attacks and is emotionally/mentally unstable, and Harry knocked her up. Completely ruined it for me lol.
