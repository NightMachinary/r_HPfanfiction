People still fight tooth and nail to keep it as Charlus and Dorea. I guess it's nice to have a stronger connection to the Blacks, especially if it's a fic where magical genetics for strange abilities matter (e.g. metamorphmagus), or if it's a fic where there's a Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and Pureblood Politics matter. (And Pureblood princess Fem!Harry is my guilty pleasure)
