Arabella Figg is mentioned at the end of GoF. Dumbledore says to Sirius:

  "Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin's for a while, I will contact you there."

There were three years between the release of the books in the summers of 2000 and 2003 respectively, and it's not particularly difficult to guess that the Order of the Phoenix (the title was released well before the actual book release) would be some kind of anti-Voldemort group. Join the dots and you get Mrs Figg in the Order, and you don't know she's a squib.
