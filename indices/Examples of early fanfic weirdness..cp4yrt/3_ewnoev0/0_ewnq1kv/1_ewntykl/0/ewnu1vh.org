That seems like a stretch to me. The only time Arabella is even mentioned in the books pre-OotP is that she's a crazy cat lady who used to watch Harry when the Dursleys were off somewhere.

I know the fandom makes mountains out of molehills, sometimes, taking characters like Daphne into account, but Auror Figg just seems... like a hell of a stretch given what we knew about her before the books.
