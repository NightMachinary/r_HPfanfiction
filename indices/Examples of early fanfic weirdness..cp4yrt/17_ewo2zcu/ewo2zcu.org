Sirius/Remus was tacitly assumed to be canon by a /large/ portion of the early fanfic community & tbh JKR lost a lot of respect when she hard-nixed it. Sirius/Marlene McKinnon was Sirius's big straight pairing. And then even those who weren't sure on Wolfstar were pretty sure Lupin was a canonically queer man that JKR was just tacitly not mentioning for editorial reasons but was giving adult readers as many hints as she could about.

In fanfic I guess a lot of stuff that was seeded in the books we expected to come back around, e.g. Veelas, giants, acromantula and metamorphmagi. Given JK's propensity for Chekhov guns it seemed like a lot of that would come back.

I vaguely recall before we had Luna, Ginny/Neville was a strong secondary pairing in Harmony fics as a comic relief couple. And on that point, Harry/Luna never really hit its stride as a huge pairing until the OOTP movie.
