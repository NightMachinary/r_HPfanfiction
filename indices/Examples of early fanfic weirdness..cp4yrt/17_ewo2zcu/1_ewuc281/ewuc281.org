I remember I was /convinced/ of Harry/Luna after the OOTP book. That scene towards the end of the book of those two talking seemed to indicate a great connection from this point on, and her last name was "Lovegood", which I saw as a big sign.

I don't ever truly ship much, but I still was a bit miffled I turned out to be wrong.
