Wow, I haven't read OoTP in quite a few years..... I always thought it was a second jet of red light, which always meant “Stupefy” to me---obviously other curses can be red, but to my 13-year-old-self, red = stunner. I guess it just stuck.

But for real, the old AOL and Mugglenet forums had a lot of discussion about this. We all speculated he'd come back since the spell wasn't green. It was definitely collective wishful thinking at its finest..... but we were grasping at anything when it came to trying to figure out what could happen next.
