There is this really really good series on Wattpad (I know I know but give it a chance) called the Tightly Knit series. Long well written with multiple stories all in the same universe that center around different characters from HP and all tie into one another. The first book is called Tightly Knit and centers around an awesome OC. Sirius survives in this series and the entire premise of how is cool. Really cool actually. Give it a read.
