  If he was an aristocrat, it's probable he would care about his appearance significantly.

Nope. Aristos are people. We all know that there are people who don't care much about their appearance.

If you're thinking of the sort of aristo that dresses up in stupid clothes to go and grovel at royalty or debate in Parliament or be seen with The Right People around town - they're a small minority of the aristocracy. Most of them are younger sons or members of unimportant cadet lines and most aren't even very well off. They weren't even very well off a coupla hundred years ago.
