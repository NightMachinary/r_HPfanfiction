I kinda like the earlier fanfics where his loyalty is still up for debate and which don't have that creepy obsession with Lily. It's an interesting and fun alternative character interpretation. My favourite take on that Snape is probably in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/][Stronger Than Hope]].
