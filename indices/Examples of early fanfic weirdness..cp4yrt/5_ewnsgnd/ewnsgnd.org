I remember when OotP was announced but not released, there were a whole series of fics that tried to guess at what the order would be (much like many others did for the other books). My favourite was one where Harry is recruited into an insane secret spy agency where the members could change their appearance at will and had earpieces that would play situationally appropriate music when they weren't otherwise in use. It's what we would now call AU, but at the time was just an insane guess at the next book. I've never found it again because it was (if I remember right) names HP and the OotP.
