I stumbled on a old fic like this fairly recently. I wish I could remember the title, but it had Witch!Mrs. Figg, and the Order of the Phoenix was a global, centuries-old anti-dark magic society.

Edit: FFN search was no help, but I managed to find it through Google. It was Realizations: linkffn(1260679).
