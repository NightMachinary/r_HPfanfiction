Oh! I remember a fic like this, I think Harry gets some sort of wearable magical object like a crown or something, and when he puts it on he gets all these voices in his head, which are basically the ghosts of all the greatest witches and wizards throughout history. Harry is invited to join "The Order", which basically means he spends his summer becoming a Gary Stu and becomes the most badass wizard of his age because of all the special tutoring and powers getting bestowed.
