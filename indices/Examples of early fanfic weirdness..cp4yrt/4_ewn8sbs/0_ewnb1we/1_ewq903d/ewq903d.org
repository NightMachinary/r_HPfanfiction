I doubt I was reading fanfic before GoF came out, but I'm certain I read it while waiting for OotP. So this is this idea is totally plausible because We didn't know much about Sirius before book 5. I remember Sirius's death coming out of nowhere, partly because I'd read fics where Harry lived with him during the rest of his education.
