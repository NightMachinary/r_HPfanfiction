  Breaking canon or changing anything from the plot wasn't part of Percy Weasley's plan. He wants a normal life. Or as normal as a wizard-in-training's life could ever be. Was that too much to ask? Apparently it was, if Cedric fucking Diggory asking him to the TriWizard's Tournament's Ball was any indication. When in Merlin did that even happen?! Reincarnated!OC-Percy. AU.
