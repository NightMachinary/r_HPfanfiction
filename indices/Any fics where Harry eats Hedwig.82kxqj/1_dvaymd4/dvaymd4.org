There is. I don't recall the name of the fic but it's by an [[http://www.amanuensis1.com/mainfanficpage.html][author named amanuensis]]. All of her fics are dark. Like BLACK dark. Depression-inducing, sadness-filled, horror-type, NC-17 dark. They're proper writing though - not the stuff of moody teenagers, so maybe have some pictures of kittens a box of chocolates and a script for Zoloft if you're going to read them.
