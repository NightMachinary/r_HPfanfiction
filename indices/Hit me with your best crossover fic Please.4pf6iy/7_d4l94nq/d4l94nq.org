These are some of my favorite. I like the twice blessed challenge, but really I just like a demigod Harry. These are a fem Harry, so take that as you will. The author is quite good and I liked them. They are only the first part though. There are second parts being written.

This is a good one as well. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.
