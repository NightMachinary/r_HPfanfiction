I couldn't resist throwing in a huge list (sorry), but I mixed in different categories since I didn't know which you usually read.

*Lengthy fics:*

- linkffn(Forty One Times Dead by Ruskbyte) xbleach, longer oneshot, *no knowledge of Bleach needed*
- linkffn(Even if You Miss (You'll Land Among the Stars) by eternalchange) xavengers, incomplete.
- linkffn(Wanderer by cywsaphyre) xavengers, incomplete. This author has another long complete HPxAvengers but I like this one more.
- linkffn(Black Sky by Umei no Mai) xKatekyo Hitman Reborn, lengthy in-progress fic, *no knowledge of KHR needed*
- linkffn(Fork It Over by Barrel of Monkeys) xTwilight, in-progress
- linkffn(Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black by cywscross) xNaruto, incomplete, This author has plenty more very good crossovers
- linkffn(The Professor's Journey by AlphaEph19) xNaruto, incomplete, not Harry-centric but you don't really need knowledge of Naruto to read this.
- linkffn(Only a Boy by Riddell Lee) xMerlin, in-progress, Merlin-centric
- linkffn(A Study in Magic by Books of Change) xBBC Sherlock, complete

*(Mostly Crack) Oneshots:*

- linkffn(First Impressions by Kissy Fishy) xMerlin, crack.
- linkffn(Deus Ex Machina by The Plot Bunny Whisperer) xavengers
- linkffn(Well Worth Chronicling by Rachelea) xBBC Sherlock, not crack
