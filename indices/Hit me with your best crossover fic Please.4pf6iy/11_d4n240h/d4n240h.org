I don't know too many crossovers, but I loved 'The Lamentable Comedy of Severus, Half-Blood Prince of Denmark' - basically Snape gets sent to 16th century Denmark and ends up struggling to save the characters of Hamlet from themselves. It sounds weird, but it's AWESOME. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2725514/chapters/6105773]])

There's also my fic, in which BBC Sherlock attends Hogwarts and starts writing in Tom Riddle's diary. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11977774/1/The-Correspondent]])
