Linkffn(The Havoc side of the force), linkffn(11157943)

Those two are great star wars crossover fics and funny too. Next up I have a couple of LOTR crossover fics as well

linkffn(The Shadow of Agmar) is an out of the ordinary fic and enjoyable at first but it does get rather dull after a while

Linkffn(onto greener pastures and brighter skies)

Linkffn(11027086) is decent if I remember correctly

The best one I wanted to link you to tho I can't find yet but will link when I can. Its HP/LOTR, wierd, funny, and plain amazing.

Edit: If anyone can link the fic with Neville and Molly being contacted by the valar to replace Gandalf I'd be much obliged. I can't seem to find it and am now half convinced I might have dreamed it. I haven't been on enough drugs to think something like that up so I can't have dreamed it
