posting a comment here that i will edit later, does it need to focus on smut or is it okay if smut is just a side thing?

fic 1: overpowered harry, no smut but cool fic: linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches - revenge is best served raw by leadvone)

fic 2: decently powered harry, basically only smut fic: linkffn(harry potter's personal toy tester by kenriot1214)
