I'm just going to say this.

There has never been a fic with “co-writers” that was worth reading.

If you have a good idea, great! Start with an outline of the overall plot. Plan the overall main story start to finish. Then break that outline down into pieces, and each piece into a chapter. Flesh out the chapter outlines as needed, and bam, you're done.

If you need an editor or beta, those are available. However - write your own story!

Good luck.
