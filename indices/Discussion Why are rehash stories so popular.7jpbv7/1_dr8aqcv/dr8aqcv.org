A lot of writers enter fan fiction not aiming to write an original piece set in the Harry another world, they aim to write a better Harry Potter. They aim to 'fix' what they perceive as flaws in the series. Its a rehash because they don't want something new, they want Harry Potter done right. Some are just lazy, some are poor writes, some lack an original thought but I suspect the number of fix-it-fics that are rehashes suggests that they want a better Harry Potter, though I suspect very few know what it is they want.
