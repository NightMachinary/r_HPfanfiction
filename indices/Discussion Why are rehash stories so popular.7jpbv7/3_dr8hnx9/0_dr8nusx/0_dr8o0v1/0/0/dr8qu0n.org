Nobody ever referred to the Blacks as the "Most Ancient and Noble House" except Sirius that one time. It's possible that they might have referred to themselves by that, but there's no indication that it was ever an official title.

In fact, I'll argue that it isn't because if it HAD been an official title, you can bet that the Malfoys would have shared it, or had a title of equal pomposity. The Malfoys have been in Britain at least as long as the Blacks, they used to hobnob it with royalty and the Muggle gentry before the Statute of Secrecy, and they are definitely richer (despite what certain fanfics seem to think). The Malfoys are also part of the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" on the same level as the Blacks.

And yet the Malfoys have no title, nobody ever calls them "the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy" even though you KNOW that if that had been an official title and they had any claim to it, they would have used it at any given opportunity.

No... I really do not think it's an official title. It's just Sirius being sarcastic.
