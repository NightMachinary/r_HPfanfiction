Because rehash stories are easy and don't require a lot of thought or effort. It means that the writer doesn't have to worry about creating a new plot or make with new worldbuilding; they can just focus on the few changes they did make. Which is usually making Harry "better" in some way: Making him richer, more independent, more powerful, more or "better" friends, you name it. Pure wish-fulfillment stuff.
