Best fic with that pairing IMO is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Worth of the Soul) but it features a lot of Harry/Hermione to get there. Some fluffier, more direct options are linkffn(The Forgotten Contract), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Old Friend), and linkffn(The Potter Alliance). Linkffn(Not the only redhead) is pretty good, if you can get through the Hinny, as are the several Harry/Susan fics by old-crown on ffn
