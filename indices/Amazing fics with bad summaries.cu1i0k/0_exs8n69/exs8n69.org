There's an author on AO3 who puts like 5 words in their summary and NO tags, just the relationship. I refuse to read something without tags because I don't like being thrust into topics I don't like (death, BDSM, ABO, etc.) so I have zero idea if their work is any good, but it's the BIGGEST annoyance.
