It's not like they just throw him away and are horrible to him. Lily and James decide they need to go into hiding and they can't take Harry, because PLOT. But they legit think think that he'll be fine with Petunia, and they actually give him the option of going with Remus or Sirus instead. But he decides to go to the Dursley's because they're muggles and no one would think to find him there. He thinks that it's the best way to keep the rest of his family safe.
