Antithesis is one of the best fanfics I've ever read. The summary makes it seem like a cliche dark/edgy Harry, but it's so much more than that. The characterization of Harry (or Adrian as his name is changed) is so incredible. It's a WBWL fic where Harry is given away by Lily and James for “his own protection”. Harry ends up getting sent to an orphanage, and then “adopted” by very questionable characters. He grows up in an extremely unhealthy environment and that really affects him as a character. The narration is extremely unreliable because Harry is such a messed up kid, and he sees his brother and parents as enemies. But in general, this can't be considered a story that bashes. All the characters try their best to help him, and are at the most, misguided. I don't know how else to explain this beautiful story without spoilers. It's incredibly emotional, and I guarantee you, you will be crying. From what I remember, it's not a retelling of all 7 years, and it goes off on its own A LOT. Please, please, please give this a try!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed. If you can read up to the sorting chapter, you'll have a good idea of how the story is written and if you like the style or not. It's more than 400k words, and I think I managed it in like a day and a half because I was so invested. Happy reading!!
