The summary does not do it justice. As a whole, the story is fantastic and does a lot of unique things. I adore the characterization of Lupin in it.

In addition, I don't think it hits its stride for a bit. I'm admittedly picky and tend to quit fics if the writing is poor, but once the author picks up a whole squadron of betas partway through the story, you can see the writing thrive and develop. By end the end it was one of my favorites.
