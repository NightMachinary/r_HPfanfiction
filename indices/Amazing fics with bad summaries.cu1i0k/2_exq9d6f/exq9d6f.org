About half the fics in my favorites list....

Notable example:

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

This fic is about Sirius and Harry hiding from the entire wizarding world that tries to hunt down the Death Eater Sirius Black, kidnapper of the Boy-Who-Lived, all while trying to figure out what Kreacher's locket really is, and about Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Dumbledore, the Malfoys, etc who all play roles in the search.

The summary mostly talks about the Dursleys, which only appear at the very beginning.
