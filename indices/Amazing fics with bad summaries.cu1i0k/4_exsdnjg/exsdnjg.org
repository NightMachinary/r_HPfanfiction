Linkao3(common sense by Grohiik)

This fic is amazing and nuanced and has some of the best worldbuilding and characterisation I've read in the fandom. It's full of wit and intrigue. It's the kind of adventuresome hero's journey I wished I'd found in canon. The Harry of this story is as kind as he is clever. He uses his clear-sightedness as a way to help even those he doesn't like very much. He's easily the most likeable Harry I've read. He's not OP except through hard won wisdom. He's curious and cunning in ways that are not synonyms for cruelty the way so many Cunning!Harrys are.

The summary, however, makes it sound like some kind of zillion lord Harry fixing the wizarding world with the power of slash, privilege and "The Dark".
