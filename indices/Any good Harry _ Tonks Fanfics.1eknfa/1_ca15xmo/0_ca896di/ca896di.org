It was really good.....right up until the departure from canon plotlines at which point it gets really weird really quickly. I also really hated the vampire character inserted for no reason. And the fact that Tonks was Harry's age was bizarre, but tolerable.

I liked the beginning, so I just stopped reading when I couldn't tolerate it any longer and pretended it was unfinished.
