Hmm. There was a crackfic floating around where Harry married Ginny and the marriage bond prevented either one from cheating. Then Ginny got fat and Harry found a loophole in the bond where he was only forbidden from cheating with human women. So he gallivated around the world with Neville, banging every female half-breed he could find. There were mermaids, vampires, werewolves, veela, sphinxes and I wanna say a banshee but I can't really be sure.

Anyway I think I read it on Potter's Place 3 like twelve years ago.
