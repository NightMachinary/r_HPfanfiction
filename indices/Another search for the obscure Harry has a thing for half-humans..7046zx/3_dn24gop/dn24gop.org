...? Pretty sure lamias don't exist in the Potterverse (though they admittedly wouldn't look too out of place with Sphinxes and Manticores).

Anyway, looking for fanfics involving Sphinxes, I came across what is probably one of the worst fanfics of all times --- a horribly formatted lemon where a Dark!Harry ends up raping the Triwizard Maze's sphinx. I don't even want to do the thing the honor of linking it. But as far as your acamedical interest goes, then know it's out there. Lurking. Begging to be mercy-killed.
