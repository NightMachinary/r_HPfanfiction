Like others have said, you should write yourself, no matter how abysmal it is on your first go-around. However, the only feedback I would encourage you to receive is that on grammar as the rules are somewhat set in stone for it. Feedback on your writing style is more difficult to pinpoint as every author has a different tone on which his/her story takes place. For example, many people don't like how Stephen King writes yet many do (myself included). His stories each have a different voice, distinguishing one from his many others. Your story should have its own voice, and since FanFiction tends to cater to a younger audience, the use of different voices should fly right over their heads and they may leave comments like, "This sucks!" or "You should learn how to write"! etc, etc.
