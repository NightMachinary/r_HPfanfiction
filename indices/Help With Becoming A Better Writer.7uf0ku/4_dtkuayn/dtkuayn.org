Try and spend a bit of time planning out motivations and working out what is important. Working out what matters should help you know if you need to write a lot or if perhaps you need to move a section on. Working out character motivations early will allow you to weave your plot and check that they behave as expected. Little is so jarring as characters going against their own interests simply because the author needed to. Immersion means choices make sense in the world you're writing. The more you understand a character's motivation the more in character they'll stay and the easier your story will be to plan. Working out what matters and what is important means you know when to add weight and detail. Does anyone care about the walk from the dorms to breakfast on a tuesday 3 weeks into term? Nope, don't bother using a thousand words to describe it. It will kill the pacing. The walk your protagonist has to make alone, to fight the final fight, that matters, you can build that, reflect on that, describe more because you're making it important.
