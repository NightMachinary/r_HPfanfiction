Check out [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][Writing Excuses]]. It's a podcast by 3 published authors about anything involving writing. It's a great way to learn many of the dos and don'ts, or just general tips on writing.

Apart from that, as anyone else will tell you, just keep writing. Don't write anything too long at first, otherwise you'll hate going back and reading the beginning to remind yourself of something that happened early on (too long in my mind is something that takes you years to write).

Remember, don't compare yourself to the greats when you're just starting out. Once upon a time, they probably had the same opinion of their writing skills as you do of yours now. Don't give up, and you'll get there eventually.
