Write. A lot. Get responses on what people think you can do better. As you start out, imitation will be somewhat common (hard to avoid when starting out).

Try to make things sound natural (especially dialogue). It helps to read it out to yourself afterward to see if it sounds like an actual conversation people would have. I've seen so many fanfics where the characters speak in a way no one would ever speak. Or else they act in a strange manner (such as immediately agree with something the MC says, when IRL people are much harder to move). Don't make huge text walls; line breaks make reading it feel less daunting.

More can doubtless be said, but you're just starting out, so you probably don't need to get good enough to write an engrossing epic just yet.
