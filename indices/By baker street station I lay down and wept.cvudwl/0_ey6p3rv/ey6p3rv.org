I liked it when I started reading it, but the journal translations fell prey to a common fallacy. “It's about this” but a dozen pieces of translation later still haven't gotten to the point so how'd you know it'll get there eventually?

It's one of those stories that I stopped reading because I lost interest while waiting for the next installment. I don't do well with WIPs.
