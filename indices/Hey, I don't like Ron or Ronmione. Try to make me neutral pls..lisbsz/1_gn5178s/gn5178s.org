I mean if you don't like it, you don't like it. The thing is we don't see how they behave in a relationship other than the small scene during the battle of Hogwarts where they seem to be very supportive of one another with Ron allowing Hermione to destroy the Horcrux and Hermione excitedly giving Ron all the deserved credit when they meet Harry.

I don't think that their dynamic is that far fetched. I've personally had crushes which I knew were reciprocated in the past on which for whatever reason I chose not to act. The tension can make you behave strangely sometimes being downright mean to the other person. On the other hand, Ron is quite protective of Hermione defending her even against Harry, who on the other hand doesn't seem to care much for Hermione (he even thinks that he doesn't enjoy Hermione's company as much as Ron's when the two have the falling out in GoF).

But in the end they are just characters and they will behave as the author chooses to so you can just swap the names and there you go.
