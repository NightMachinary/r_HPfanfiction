I was never a fan of it to be honest, I'd like to think that Ron's casual approach to life, in spite of any chaos surrounding him, eventually mellows-out Hermione. Likewise, Hermione's studiousness motivates Ron to take /some/ steps to improve himself much as James Potter matured enough in later years finally attracting Lily's attention. But I don't think that is shown in the original books.

Some other things you might want to consider:

Hermione has a great intellect, but she's not famed for being ballsy enough to ask someone out, /except when she asked Cormac McLaggen to the Slug Club AFTER Ron had insulted her/. She says that Krum asked her out in the library, so he doesn't count.

I think that Ron is convenient for her. Familiar to her. I think Ron is a baseline or a rock to her that she can always turn to, who has had her back and forgiven her even when she's made mistakes and vice-versa. She doesn't have to go out of her way improving her social skills to get with Ron, they already had a deep bond that cannot really be replicated with any other partner she might meet. And I don't think she thinks very much about what kind of partner she wants. I guess she's touch starved and lonely and, even post-Hogwarts, she is likely pretty intimidating to most men. This makes it a bit difficult to find a partner. I would imagine that they take a break post-Hogwarts to get some space, and then months later get back together for good because vowing to reconcile their differences.

Source: have spoken with some "intimidatingly successful women" who stay with familiar partners in unequal on-and-off relationships because they can't find other partners, or they stay single because other men they consider "similar" are in rare supply on the dating market. This would be ~ women with six-figure jobs, high-stress jobs, top-level managers or executives -- women who literally just don't have time to spend dating over and over again finding Mr. Right. Men in a similar position on the dating market are essentially either married, widows, significantly older, or permanent bachelors who won't settle.
