I'm willing to give this a shot. Full disclosure, I am not a fan of Ron either, but I've come to realize it is because Rowling wrote him in a way that makes zero sense. Here's how I learned to write (and genuinely enjoy) Ron as a character.

Of all of Harry's friends (not just the Trio), Ron is the only one who understands what it was like for Harry to never have anything of his own. Harry was denied everything in his childhood, and his most prized possessions are heirlooms from his parents. *RON* was also denied his own things, forced to use 2nd/3rd (even 4th!)-hand items that his brothers used. This shared understanding of the importance of ownership is never explored by JKR.

Ron feels overshadowed by brothers he sees as larger than life. Everyone one of the Weasley children except Ginny (who is the only girl, so she's 'special') absolutely excels at their chosen professions. For Ron, the desire to be great is there, but more importantly he also recognizes the *futility* of that desire. How can he - ordinary Ron Weasley - ever match up to Bill, or Charlie, or the Twins, or even Percy (who - though a ponce, has a meteoric rise in the Ministry)? For Harry, he has to live in the shadow of his dead parents, who are hailed as legends, who died before any flaws or mistakes manifested. Again, a shared commonality that JKR was oblivious to.

I thought about these things, and I realized that canon!Ron is actually the OOC version of his character. canon!Ron is disloyal, a bad friend, constantly jealous and unable to appreciate what he has. It is pretty strange that Ron would ignore all of the things that he and Harry exclusively share, then turn on his best friend at Harry's darkest moments (TWT and Horcrux Hunt). Why? What would possess someone that should be able to empathize with his best friend like no one else to turn on them when they are at their lowest point?

Simple - it's because JKR wanted personal drama within the Trio, and wasn't a good enough writer to pull it off organically. So she made the 'Joe-Average' part of the Trio a dick just to stir things up. Once I realized that, I was able to write Ron the way he should have been - loyal, trustworthy, sometimes-insensitive but funny, comical, and emotionally mature (he has 6 siblings! How is Ron less well-adjusted than two 'only-childs' like H/Hr?!?!?).

So? Do you like Ron a little more now?
