I don't think anyone should be downvoting you for having an opinion. Sheesh.

I don't like them either. Although that's mostly because they remind me of my aunt and uncle and we've all been wondering for decades why they don't divorce. They tolerate each other on a good day.

But also it just seems unrealistic to me that Hermione would tie herself to someone who devalues the things she loves.
