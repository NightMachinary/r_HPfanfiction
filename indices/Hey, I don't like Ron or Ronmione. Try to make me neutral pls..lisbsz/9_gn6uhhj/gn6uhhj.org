It's okay not to like it, I don't like it either and don't even like Ron and Hermione in general. We can't all like the same thing. You can't ask people to make you neutral because that's just not possible, whether you like something or not depends on how you view it and not on how others do. They can point out some things that you may have not paid attention to but at the end it depends on what YOU think of it. If you want to reconsider your view of Ron / Romione I suggest rereading the books, because that's how JKR portrayed the characters. Fanfictions tend to be out of character or make them behave how the author wants them to, which brings me back to my 2nd point. While reading the books you have a small glimpse at Ron and Hermione's relationship and it's up to you to imagine the rest. That being said you shouldn't feel obliged to like a character/ ship just because the fandom does, feel free to dislike them, I do to. It's totally normal they are fictional characters after all. As long as you're not disrespectful to people who like them, just enjoy the books and fanfics and stick to your pov.
