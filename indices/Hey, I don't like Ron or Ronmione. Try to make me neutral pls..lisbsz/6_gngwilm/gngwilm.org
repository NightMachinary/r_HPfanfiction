I think that given her goals in life, Hermione could do much worse than Ron:

- Among the men close to her in age, the ambitious ones are either Slytherins (whose ambition is quite questionable in the first place) or Percy; so she doesn't really have anyone with whom to form a proverbial "power couple". This means that her husband will have to be someone who would work mainly as a prop.
- Ron is a pureblood, and she takes his name when they marry. That makes her less threatening to the proverbial old guard who, while not Voldemort supporters, likely harbour implicit anti-Muggleborn prejudice. (Think Slughorn.)
- Ron is a war hero, but not in a way that would overshadow her the way Harry would. No matter how illustrious her Ministry career, her achievements are unlikely to ever be as famous and popular as Voldemort's defeat, and Harry would get 80%+ of the credit for that.
- Ron is a known quantity, and we know that she finds him physically attractive. He is also a rather talented wizard, given that he does significantly above average while putting in the least amount of work she lets him get away with; as is his whole family. So, he clearly has good genes.
- She has few interests in common with Ron, but that's not necessarily a bad thing: it means relatively few demands from him on her time, so she can focus on her career.
