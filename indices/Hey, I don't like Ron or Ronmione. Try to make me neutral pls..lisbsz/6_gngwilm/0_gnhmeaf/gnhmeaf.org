The moment Ron gets over his toxic jealousy and poor communications skills, he would actually be quite good for Hermione. He sounds like the exact kind of guy who'd nag his wife to eat and sleep which Hermione certainly would need.

The better question is would /Hermione/ be good for Ron. Because Ron actually wants a good and proper relationship - something Hermione fails at even at the best of times.
