My headcanon on exchange rates: 1 galleon ~= 5 pounds, 1 sickle ~= 6 shillings, 1 knut ~= 2.5 pence. That's in pre-1970 money, obviously.\\
(If the 17 and 29 figures are rounded - not sure if they're ever implied to be exact - those conversions might actually be exact ones instead; the rates come out to 16.67 and 28.8 respectively.)\\
(Actually, letting 1 sickle = 6 shillings = 30 new pence, and assuming the 17 and 29 to be exact, gives a decent approximation for the canon galleon rate, which is a bit off from exactly 5 pounds; but, IIRC, 1 knut = 2.5 old pence is even closer.)

A related part of my headcanon (which I sniped from an old fic, but I forgot which one) is that Gringotts just didn't bother to change the Muggle currency exchange rates since the early 20th century (or even the 19th century), especially since before that it tended to be fairly stable anyway.\\
Back then, it made sense to have a five-sovereign gold galleon, three-florin silver sickle, or ten-farthing copper knut (IIRC, they actually end up roughly the same size that way - a little larger than an Eisenhower dollar; nowhere near hubcaps, obviously, but still huge to an unprepared 1990s Muggle).
