I'm just looking at [[http://iset.tsu.ge/files/wp_02-17_Levy_and_Snir_-_Potterian_Economics.pdf][This look at Potterian economics]] by an actual economist. Other than occasional words like Keynsian and a lot of footnotes, it's a clear read. You need to set time aside for it, but to me it's worth it. It discusses /lots/ of prices and how it all works - or doesn't. Everything is argued out very carefully because it's a real paper.

Terms are explained or given book examples and I think someone with little 'economic literacy' can still work through this, and it would be worth it if you, like me, have ever wondered how it all pulls together.
