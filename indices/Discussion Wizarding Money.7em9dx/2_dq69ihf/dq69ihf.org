I think people mostly tend to overcomplicate it, and apply muggle economic situations to the wizarding world, which should be completely different and mostly separate.

Some assumptions have to be made, such as there being some sort of mechanic to whereas wizards aren't just gaming the system by selling gold galleons in the muggle world (because clearly, indy!Harry is the first to ever come up with that idea).

Then, you have to wonder what exactly the buying power is of a galleon, and what exactly they're buying. Like, for all we know, Arthur Weasley makes decent money as a department head, except what is decent money for a guy and his wife might be woefully inadequate for a family with 7 children.

Lastly, you have to reconcile the fact that all because someone has a wand and magic doesn't mean they can literally do everything with it. Like, transfiguring your clothes every day, and living in a conjured/expanded hut, and creating infinite potions and living off whatever method you think is remotely plausible for near-infinite food... sure you can probably write that, it just won't be interesting. It's a lot for one person to do and maintain.
