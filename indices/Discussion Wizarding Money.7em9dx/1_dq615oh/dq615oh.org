A lot of handwaving and justifications. £5 to the galleon and there's indication in Quidditch Through the Ages that inflation exists iirc. Conjuring changes some prices, hence Harry's blowout at the sweets trolley being so cheap (even at 1991 prices).

Clothes are clearly expensive. Wands are not. Ollivander is somehow succeeding on a tiny, tiny amount of money while still renting an exclusive shop front /and/ he has competitors in Britain - one nearby and one in Hogsmeade. If people typically buy one or perhaps two wands and Hogwarts /does/ hold a thousand students, and not the 280 that might be indicated, and half of them get educated outside of Hogwarts, then he's still barely making enough to rent a tent.

I end up with low wages of around 100G a month, £500 a month, or £6000 a year - enough to survive. I start my lowest Ministry workers on this. Canonically a senior auror gets 1000G a month, that's around £60 000 a year at 1991 prices, pretty impressive. It's clearly a prestigious position.

Getting school robes etc works out in my head at about 75G and I give Harry a vault with 10 000 G, which is /enormous/ until you try to weild it for power. Absolutely pitiful for a full inheritence from a stinking rich family. Black's fortune is about 150 000G, Malfoy's slightly higher.

1000G didn't rent the Weasley twins their shop: they used it to buy raw material and built up from there by owl order. Except I never see how there are enough customers, or how the country isn't pranked sideways.

Malfoy invests in businesses. It's not even so much that he bribes Fudge (he does), as that he represents a fair chunk of wizarding jobs and businesses.

The Weasleys would be doing fine, but they spend money as soon as they get it and Molly is too lazy (or chronically ill and hiding it well) to actually work, even when all her kids are at school. She has a life she likes and no ambition whatsoever. Her kids, especially Ron, are left hanging. Their 'poverty' is largely self-imposed. School fees aren't an issue, a great many books can be handed down and wands are staggeringly cheap for a lifetime purchase. They go on holidays and to Quidditch matches and throw away a lot of leftover food and then wonder where it all went. Arthur is probably not at the lowest end of the scale (100G pm) if he's competent enough to be heading his own office by 1996 and to be pushing a law through in 1991. If he's pulling in even 400G pm and living on his own land, they should be pretty comfortable, especially given they may well know how to make a lot of food from a little (Ron mentions the fact that you can, as if it's well known and something he grew up with).

Lots of it won't make sense and I get some fun from imagining scenarios where it does, but those are the figures I ended up with.
