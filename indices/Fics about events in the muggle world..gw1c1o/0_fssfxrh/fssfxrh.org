One of many great things of linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) is how it manages to incorporate events of the external world into the story (particularly the genocide of Rwanda and the Great Storm of 1987 are fully incorporated into the story, but the fall of the Soviet Union and other world events are mentioned as well).
