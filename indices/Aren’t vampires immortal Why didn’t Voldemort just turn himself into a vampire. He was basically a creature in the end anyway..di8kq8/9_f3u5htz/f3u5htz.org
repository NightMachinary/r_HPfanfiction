Well, we don't know enough about vampirism in Harry Potter. Presumably there are some downsides to it - perhaps like lycanthropy, it has mental effects, or it's not guaranteed to happen, or you need a full soul for it to happen. If you're looking at it from a fanfic's perspective, you could justify either way.

From canon's perspective, it's mostly that vampires are there for worldbuilding - JKR likes to throw in references to fairy tales and stories in the world, a way to connect magic/the magical world to our real life stories. But they're only there for a light bit of background, really - nothing more.

Amusingly, one of my favorite stories has that exact same question you have - it's played more for laughs, but the protagonist's first thought is that Voldemort is /already/ a vampire.
