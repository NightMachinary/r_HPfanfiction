We don't know how vampires work in the Harry Potter universe (other than Sanguinis, a "half vampire" none are ever seen), but I would guess "control." In most vampire mythos, the siring vampire has domination over the fledgling; I can't see Voldemort conceding control to anyone else, even with insurance plans like having his minions kill his sure immediately.

Limitations like sunlight vulnerability would probably also be a factor.
