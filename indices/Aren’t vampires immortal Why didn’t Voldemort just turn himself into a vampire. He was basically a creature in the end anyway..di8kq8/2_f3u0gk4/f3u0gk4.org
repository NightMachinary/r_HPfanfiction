Well for that I think maybe it would be like how canon Dumbledore said Voldemort did not want to be dependent on the Elixir of Life - having to regularly drink it - so if he was a vampire he would have to regularly find people to blood suck! So I think he would hate that too. Even more because he would actually have to rely on PEOPLE!

  "While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes."
