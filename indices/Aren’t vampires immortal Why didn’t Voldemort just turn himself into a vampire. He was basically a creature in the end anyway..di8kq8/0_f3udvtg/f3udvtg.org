They seem to be their own race of being in Harry Potter, not just some curse that spreads to others like werewolves.

We know that they are classified as beings like goblins and hags are(unlike werewolves who still count as wizards unless they're transformed), Percy also mentions that hunting them is illegal under laws about the treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans. We also know that they seem to have their own culture considering the author in Slughorns party was writing a book about them. They also seem to be able to breed with humans, Rowling mentioned a wizard singer being part vampire on her old website.
