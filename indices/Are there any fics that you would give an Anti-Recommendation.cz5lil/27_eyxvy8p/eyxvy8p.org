If I ever see someone reccomend A Second Chance by Breanie, I will be very annoyed. Thay story drags soooo much. It's on about 190 chapters or something and the actual plot has only showed up in the last 20. There is so much time spent building an OC's extended family, a bunch of characters no one will really remember. Sirius as well is not really characterized correctly. For some reason, a bunch of authors write him as some sort of manwhore. I have idea where they got this from. Of all the marauders, the only one that was extroverted was James. The rest were totally introverts. Sirius especially didn't really care for any attention he got. There are so many plot threads that didn't add anything. Like Sirius' first girlfriend in the story. Later it turns out she is slightly relevant to the scarcrux. Chapters themselves drag on and on, with focus on so much that doesn't completely fit together.
