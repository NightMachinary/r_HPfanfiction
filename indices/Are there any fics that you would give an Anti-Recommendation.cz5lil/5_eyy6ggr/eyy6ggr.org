It gave Harry unbelievable godmode way too quickly. I had to stop reading at chapter 60 because there was simply no way Harry could possibly have any sort of real conflict with Voldemort that went beyond "Fuck you voldie you're dead now". Seriously, there's no reason for Harry to be as strong and skilled as fucking Merlin, master wandless magic, master oclomency to the point he made a mindscape to pull friends in and time dialate to give them time to practice magic, have mastery over mage sight, able to heal any wound, and able to alter his body however he wants, all before he even shows up for his first year at Hogwarts.
