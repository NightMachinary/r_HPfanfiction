It has by far the best mentor relationship I have ever seen in fanfic. Which is the part I would recommend the fic for, with a big disclaimer about its issues.

It would have been a lot better if it was a Harry/Hermione fic where they end up in a poly arrangement with Fleur and Tonks (who are a couple). Have them get shitfaced for Harry's 17th birthday and wake up in a pile of limbs or something.

BUT, more crucially, cut the pureblood culture part (aka Daphne). Harry can have a wife and another couple whom they get up to naughty times, there is no need to dump 100k of unnecessary words and see-through drama just to justify all relationships.
