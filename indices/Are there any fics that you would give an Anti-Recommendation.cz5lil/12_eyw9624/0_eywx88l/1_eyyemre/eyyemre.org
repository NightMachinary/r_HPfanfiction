It's presented in a video-gamey manner, like some feat you get at character creation. Harry's a Rune Savant so he's the cream of the crop genius. His mentor Shiva is "only" a prodigy so she'll always be behind him no matter how hard she works. His classmates are of course irrelevant and will never amount to anything.

It's like those stories where he's born with "Grand Sorcerer level" magical core and is automatically better than others.
