It's kinda disturbing how much "tell" the author invested into creating a term for it though. I mean, "Rune Savants", REALLY? Just call him a savant and be done with it. Also, the characterization of Harry suffers from not accurately portraying him as a savant. Harry as a 10 year old, having the patience to learn the meaning of the word "compendium" and being able to understand a textbook about a dead language but not understanding a text discussing a different topic is ridiculous. All the texts should be equally unreadable to him; instead he should be able to understand the runes themselves but be baffled by anything the texts discuss. This is just from the prologue mind you.
