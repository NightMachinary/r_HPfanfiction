Seconding "Methods of Rationality" soooo much.

The creepy bits that seem to sexualize underage characters (including, as noted in the OP, the subplot of Draco the aspiring rapist), the HARD MAN crap, the shear narcissism of the author, the bait and switch of selling it as a rationalist in the Harry Potter world and then the author completely rewriting the rules of that world to fit his story/biases, the author using the world and characters as his personal soapbox for a philosophy that runs almost exactly opposite to Rowlings' own on various points, the utterly preposterous power-fantasy ending, and probably a whole bunch of other stuff I'm missing. It practically personifies a lot of offensive Potter fanfic tropes, and the worst part is, if you can force yourself to read through the dreck, there are actually a few neat concepts and well-written bits, and you get these frustrating glimpses of the brilliant story that /could/ have been if its author was... well, see the above.

And because it was such a big, high-profile story, it had an outsize impact, to the point where I feel a lot of other fics just imitate it, and it has arguably /measurably reduced the quality of the entire fanfiction medium/ single-handedly.
