*A Marauder's Plan*: it's only occasionally recommended now, but I have a knee jerk reaction to it still. Far too many words and POVs. Harry is 13-14, but behaves like an emotionally needy 7 year old. Dumbledore teeters on incompetent, manipulative old coot. Somewhere near the end, Harry spends chapters on end agonizing over Hermione. And the family magic was one thing, but the supernatural fetus thing was the worst bit of fan fiction I've ever read and I wandered into a Harry/Hermione/Snape threesome once.

Anything by white squirrel. Everyone has had a personality transplant. Canon events are shoehorned in and in his Harry centric fics Hermione gets way too much attention.
