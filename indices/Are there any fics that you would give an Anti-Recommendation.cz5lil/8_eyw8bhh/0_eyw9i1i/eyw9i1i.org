That's intriguing . I didn't even consider those issues as one of the reasons his stories are not great, just good.

I don't agree, since I think it's a peripheral issue at best and Draco and Snape in his fics are usually consistent with canon and reasonable, at least for me. The redemption plots make sense and they avoid the Draco in Leather Pants cliche. There's a journey from point A to B for them, even if it's very short, but then again that's JacobApples.

Interesting perspective nonetheless.
