  Draco and Snape in his fics are usually consistent with canon

Even if you take away their membership in the magical Nazis and all the crimes they commit along the way, neither was a pleasant person. Snape was a petty dick to Harry (and Neville) and Draco was calling for racial purges at 12 and only got worse afterwards, just ask Hagrid. They were not someone you'd take on a pub crawl. And Jacob takes that away and implies that it was all avoidable if Harry put more effort into his relationship with them. Which is victim-blaming IMO.

If you want a decent Draco, have something that gets him thinking why that Mudblood aced all exams after the first year and go from there. Snape would be more difficult because he has plenty of opportunities to take a different path when Lily begs him to reconsider his shady friends and he rejects them all, so using that as divergence would be way OOC.
