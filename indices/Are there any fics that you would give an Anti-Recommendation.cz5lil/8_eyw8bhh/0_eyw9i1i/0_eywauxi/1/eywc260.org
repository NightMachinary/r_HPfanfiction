First of all, Snape was a dick, sure, but he wasn't evil. He should not be a teacher and should probably serve a prison sentence (just for his canon stuff, not for his off-screen crimes, that we have no idea of), but he's not irredeemable.

Draco was a 12 year old child. I also disagree with Jacob taking it all away. Draco usually behaves the same way he did in canon, but he starts to change as the story progresses. Haven't you ever seen anyone change their ways?

Also, I think you approach the issue from a bad angle. What if it's not "victim blaming" but "positive influence"? Nature vs Nurture and all that. A positive role-model etc.
