  First of all, Snape was a dick, sure, but he wasn't evil.

He defended whatever his shady friends did to Lily's friend, and did not even distance himself from them once they gave his best friend the creeps. Also, he voluntarily joined Voldemort, which is more than just dickish.

  A positive role-model etc

Yes, but why Draco and not let's say Colin or hang out with Justin FF or Padma Patil? Why waste time on the guy who nearly killed two of Harry's friends, including his best mate, and attempted to use the Cruciatus on Harry if he could be befriending all the people he didn't talk to much the first time around. Hell, Lavender was mauled by Greyback and most likely gave her life for the defence of Hogwarts, yet she gets a bad rep. Why not be a positive influence on her?
