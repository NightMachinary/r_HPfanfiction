  Yes, he did join Voldemort, but we don't know if he did anything apart from that (i.e. kill people).

  Simply joining the Death Eaters is treason, conspiracy to commit murder, assistance to murder and probably a whole lot more. I mean, their goals were incredibly obvious and they were not a bingo club for seniors.

  In canon it's not, since several Death Eaters escaped punishment, some for claiming the Imperius Curse, others by cooperating (Karkaroff).

I'm saying that they claimed to /not have joined the Death Eaters,/ and as such escaped punishment. In other words, if you join the Death Eaters, then you have actually done those things, and the only question is whether or not the prosecution can prove you're guilty, not whether or not you're actually guilty. Malfoy, Karkaroff, and Snape are guilty, but escaped punishment.

So we /do/ know that Snape did those things, because he was a Death Eater for some time before turning double agent.

  In canon the Death Eaters either claimed the Imperius, got off by selling out their comrades or were pardoned, for lack of the better word, by Dumbledore. Neither of those are applicable in a normal, muggle, court of law. This means that magical law must be different (the real reason was that JKR was lazy and just wanted to write a book about magic spells and children).

Not so. Naming names doesn't get you off (or, at least, it's not supposed to) but prosecutors are empowered to make deals for lesser charges or ask judges for lesser sentences. We see that Crouch is empowered to do the same in canon, as he takes the names Karkaroff gives (only one of which is useful) and orders him away so that they can consider lowering his sentence. At that point, Karkaroff names Crouch, Jr. as another Death Eater, and everything goes to shit. It's likely that this commuted a large portion of his sentence, and possibly fucked up everyone that Crouch had convicted to this point (as would happen if a prosecutor's close family member was found to be in the mob, for example).

Criminal informants (as Snape was) can sometimes receive similar deals, and undercover operatives (such as criminals who wear wires in sting operations) are given lighter sentences still in recognition of risking their lives to help the DA. Since Snape's arrangement was similar to the latter, it might have helped. It might have explained why he got off so lightly, especially if there wasn't any hard evidence linking him to a crime.
