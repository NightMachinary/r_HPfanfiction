I recommend: linkffn(4912291) The Best Revenge does it quite well. Everyone is as canon said. Snape hates James Potter with a passion, Lucius and Narcissa are still bigots and Draco is the same, but Draco is a child so he's malleable and he misunderstands something Narcissa says.

EDIT: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope][Stronger Than Hope]] also does that. It's basically canon Snape, even more evil perhaps. Draco is a pathetic kid in this one, very similar to canon.
