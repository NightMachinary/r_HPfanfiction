  Simply joining the Death Eaters is treason, conspiracy to commit murder

In canon it's not, since several Death Eaters escaped punishment, some for claiming the Imperius Curse, others by cooperating (Karkaroff).

  he probably did more damage to magical Britain than during his Death Eater days

That's pure fanon and speculation. Percy Weasley and several others got decent grades from Snape. Even Harry, who was pants at potions, got enough knowledge from him to earn an E on his OWLs. So the bad potion teaching thing is pure fanon.

Umm... Draco is the second or third most favourite character in the fandom. He's definitely there with Harry, Hermione and Snape. Simple metrics, man. Not saying he's MY favourite, but people seem to like him and to "redeem him from his evil ways" in their fics.
