  No. You're applying real world logic to a fictional scenario present in a young adult novel.

You literally just said "In canon the Death Eaters either claimed the Imperius, got off by selling out their comrades or were pardoned, for lack of the better word, by Dumbledore. Neither of those are applicable in a normal, muggle, court of law." I proved that it was applicable in a normal, IRL court of law.

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand that. What things? You're confusing.

The list of crimes we were discussing, provided by Hellstrike - "treason, conspiracy to commit murder, assistance to murder and probably a whole lot more."

#+begin_quote
  I don't get the point you're trying to make, since you're talking about your head-canon or something. Which is fine, but we can all make our own fanon AUs.

We see Karkaroff's trial in the book. Karkaroff names names, Crouch says he'll think about a lesser sentence as a result, then Karkaroff names a much higher-profile name. He tries to implicate Snape, but Dumbledore steps up and says that Snape had been acting as his criminal informant/double agent since before Voldemort was defeated.

#+begin_quote
  But it did. Karkaroff went from being an arrested Death Eater to a Headmaster respected in public by Dumbledore and English Ministry of Magic officials.

We don't have all the details there, but Crouch-acting-as-Moody, at least, treats him with the same suspicion he treats all suspected Death Eaters. It's possible, as I noted, that revealing that the son of the prosecutor was involved in the crime might interfere with their ability to charge him with the crime in question, but that actually is a headcanon. All we know in canon is that he was offered leniency in exchange for naming high-import names, and he names the highest-import name possible, which might have resulted in either a drastically reduced sentence or actual clemency. It's entirely possible that Bulgaria doesn't recognize Magical Britain's conviction. It's also possible that he has the magical equivalent of a tracking anklet and/or a parole officer.

  Snape was not a criminal informant. He was absolved because Dumbledore said he was innocent. It's in GoF. There was no official thing, as far as we know. Since even Moody was skeptical about Snape, and we know he was Auror.

Dumbledore, the Supreme Mugwump, told everyone that Snape had been acting as a double agent. In the trial in GoF, he notes that he'd previously said so to the Wizengamot. It WAS an official thing, we just don't see the part where he makes it official.
