  That's not how this works. You can do bad things without being convinced for them

It's how it worked in canon HP. Doesn't mean I have to agree with it, but that's how it was. How else a former terrorist, someone who would be reviled in any normal society, could become Headmaster of one of the most prestigious schools in Europe?

  No matter if you assume a normal or a linear distribution, limiting the amount of students who can get a higher education in a field reduces the amount of later applicants.

I agree with what you say, but I think you miss the point. In canon HP Snape didn't sabotage anyone's education (apart from Harry and Neville, dropped vial and testing the potion on Trevor, doesn't excuse him from being an all around douche though), he gave fair grades or Hermione wouldn't be able to get an O on her OWLs, or be considered very good at schoolwork if she didn't score high consistently on his exams. As to limiting the numbers of Healers and Aurors, well... that's fanon. It works well in Snape bashing fics, but if you twist it the other way, there's no reason why there wouldn't be independent examinations held away from Hogwarts. So the point is pretty much moot.
