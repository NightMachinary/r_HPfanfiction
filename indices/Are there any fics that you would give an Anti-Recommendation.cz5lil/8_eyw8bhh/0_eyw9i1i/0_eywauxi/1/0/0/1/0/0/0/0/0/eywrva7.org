  You are confusing a criminal conviction with being guilty of something.

No. You are confusing your own head-canon with what has actually happened in the books.

  Money, blackmail, extortion, or Durmstrang does not give a shit about such activities.
#+end_quote

Possible. But it's all speculation anyway. I can easily say that it's more possible that everyone thought he broke off his past and was a very talented wizard and that talent counts for more in the Wizarding World than being part of a terrorist organization. Both arguments are equally possible.

  By refusing half of the students Slughorn would have taken, yes he does, exactly through that act.
#+end_quote

He just has higher standards. By that logic anyone with an A or even a P should go into NEWT classes.

#+begin_quote
  He did not grade the OWLs.
#+end_quote

Yes, I know. My argument was that he taught them for the past 5 years. Their grades were in some way a reflection of his teaching, and they did fairly well. Both Harry and Ron got an E and Hermione an O.

  does that really sound like a solid judicial system?
#+end_quote

I don't get the point to the excerpt you quoted, but do you really want to look for logic in HP world? After all: Wizards don't have an ounce of logic.
