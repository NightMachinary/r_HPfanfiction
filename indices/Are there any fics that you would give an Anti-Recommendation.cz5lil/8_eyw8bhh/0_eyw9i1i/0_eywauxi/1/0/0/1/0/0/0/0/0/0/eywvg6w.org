  You are confusing your own head-canon with what has actually happened in the books.

You're the one confused here. Malfoy and the others got off by claiming to be Imperius'd. In other words, they argued that they were not part of the Death Eaters at any point, and were merely being controlled by the true Death Eaters. We know that this is false, but nobody was able to prove it in a court of law. We know that Snape also was not Imperius'd at any point, and joined of his own free will. He got off by becoming a double agent, but that was AFTER being a Death Eater in good faith and good standing for a period of time.
