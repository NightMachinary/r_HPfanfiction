No. You're applying real world logic to a fictional scenario present in a young adult novel.

  I'm saying that they claimed to not have joined the Death Eaters, and as such escaped punishment. In other words, if you join the Death Eaters, then you have actually done those things, and the only question is whether or not the prosecution can prove you're guilty, not whether or not you're actually guilty. Malfoy, Karkaroff, and Snape are guilty, but escaped punishment.

I don't understand that. What things? You're confusing. They were all part of an organization whose goal was to ensure a pure-blood future for the Wizarding World. Where the mudbloods are discriminated against and other magical races like house-elves suffer. They got off by all the reasons I mentioned earlier. I don't get the point you're trying to make, since you're talking about your head-canon or something. Which is fine, but we can all make our own fanon AUs.

  Not so. Naming names doesn't get you off (or, at least, it's not supposed to)

But it did. Karkaroff went from being an arrested Death Eater to a Headmaster respected in public by Dumbledore and English Ministry of Magic officials.

Snape was not a criminal informant. He was absolved because Dumbledore said he was innocent. It's in GoF. There was no official thing, as far as we know. Since even Moody was skeptical about Snape, and we know he was Auror.
