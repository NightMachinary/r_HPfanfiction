Yes and no. What you say is true, but it has no relevance on the discussion I had with Vonpelt. Our discussion was about canon. In canon the Death Eaters either claimed the Imperius, got off by selling out their comrades or were pardoned, for lack of the better word, by Dumbledore. Neither of those are applicable in a normal, muggle, court of law. This means that magical law must be different (the real reason was that JKR was lazy and just wanted to write a book about magic spells and children).
