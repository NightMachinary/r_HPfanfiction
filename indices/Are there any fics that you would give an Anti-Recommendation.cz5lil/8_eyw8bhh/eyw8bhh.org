Anything written by JacobApples. He has interesting outlines and generally decent writing, but he shoehorns a rather poor Draco and/or Snape redemption into all of his fics. I am the first to admit that I don't like those characters, but their "redemption" is not even done in the interesting way where something gets them to change on their own. Instead, it almost always seems as if Harry makes it his mission to fix them or is unreasonably nice to them for some reason and that suddenly makes all the difference (which I do not like because it implies the blame for their shitty behaviour on Harry).

It's like the chef brings you a nice steak and then takes a dump on it once you are halfway through it.
