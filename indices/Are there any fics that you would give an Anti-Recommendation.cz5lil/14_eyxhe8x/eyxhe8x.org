The Draco Trilogy by Cassandra Claire which you can still find if you know where to look/ask. Or read her first book, because it's just the same story.

All the best lines are from other, better written TV shows and books, straight up plagiarism and the basis for Draco in Leather Pants. No one acts anything like their canon counterparts.

It's still held up as something like the perfect characterisation of Draco.

It's just lazy and sloppy.
