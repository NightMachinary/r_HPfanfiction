What just boggled my mind was how Thanfiction turned Hogwarts into this total torture camp beyond all reasonable extrapolation from canon and then had the chutzpah to blithely state that it was an examination of what was missing from the DH book.

Never mind that in no way would Snape's actions in that fic fit with the epilogue of DH.
