Yeah. DAYD is a decent fic that leans too heavily on being grimdark and edgy to create drama and stakes, but overall is still enjoyable.

Now the sequel, Sluagh? That's a different story. Repeated, hypergraphic scenes of rape and gore, largely for no good reason as the plot makes them all un-happen.
