Another reason to anti-recommend, this fic also has Draco threatening Hermione or prepositioning her right? Also, when Harry recollects what happens to Hermione in future. Rape threats or assaults are one of my pet peeves in fanficiton, for some reason I always see this in Hermione fanfiction, more than fics with any other female protagonists..
