A few anti-recommendations I have:

"The Real Us" by Seel'vor: it takes what would have been some interesting plot premises and completely fucks them up. That's all I'll say, aside from noting there is some rather creepy writing involving Harry and Hermione's relationship.

I used to like "Backwards Compatible" by Ruskbyte, but then on one of my re-reads I really stopped to think about a segment in the fic, and it struck me that the scene where Harry nearly has Draco's limbs ripped from their sockets to coerce a confession - in public, to boot - was completely unnecessary and over the top.

Also, anything by bellerophon30. The problem is more mechanical than anything else: the author does not have a grasp on how to structure dialog and character interactions, so it works like this:

Character A said, "Speaking." Character B reacts in the same paragraph.

Also, b30 overuses epithets to the point where they're like sandpaper on your skin: "the bad man", "sports fans", et cetera, et cetera.
