Despite my having recently recommended it, I'd have to say Prince of Slytherin. Not because it's offensively bad, socially irresponsible, or anything of the sort, but because I believe that it has a bad case of Cart, Horse Syndrome and is teaching prospective writers some genuinely atrocious lessons.

In particular, its fans seem to be conflating its having a highly detailed world with good worldbuilding, and while it would of course be absurd to blame this solely on PoS, I've noticed a recent uptick in fanfic authors who seem to put more effort into thinking up and explaining to the audience the minutiae of their worlds than into things which I consider more important, like characterisations, internal consistency, or overarching plots.
