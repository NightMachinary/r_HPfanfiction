Ugg, what can I say about this one.

Well first, It is not actually completed. When the author's life got busy they just uploaded a chapter with future plot points and a epilogue and called it complete.

Two It feels mistagged, Adventure/Friendship it is not. Depressing things often happen like, Hermione gets locked in azkaban for 6 months because the petrifications in second year are blamed on snake Harry.

Three, It makes me understand why people hate fanon slytherin.

Four It doesn't get to the interesting part, The whole story the author is like "Hermione won't know about harry until 4th year" and then 1. does not write 4th year, and 2. Makes fourth year extremely depressing in the plot summary (Hermione Shuns Harry for a year.)

Five The future plots are full of angst. That person you thought betrayed Hermione? Yeah that was Hermione's only true friend... The rest of her "friends" convinced Hermione to kick her out of the group... And what does the once true friend do in retaliation? Irreversibly Binds Hermione's will and sells her into slavery...

All in all, it's a unfinished angst fest that pretends it is a finished adventure story.
