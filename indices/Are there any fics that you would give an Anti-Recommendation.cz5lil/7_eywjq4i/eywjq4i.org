"Dodging Priso " is really the only one I have in this fandom (probably says more about how little I interact withe the fandom than anything else)

But I do know what you're talking about and have quite a few in various other fandoms.

EDIT: Do crossovers count? Because fates gamble is a fic I noped out of for poor writing and the more I hear of it the worse it gets.
