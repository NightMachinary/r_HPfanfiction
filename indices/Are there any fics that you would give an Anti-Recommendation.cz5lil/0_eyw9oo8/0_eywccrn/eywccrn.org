I've tried three times to read it and always give up around 3 chapters in, when Harry negotiates with a father to arrange a marriage with the father's 11 year old, then the father lets Harry go off on his own with said 11 year old. It still boggles my mind that the author kept writing after that without it delving into creepy, weird smut.
