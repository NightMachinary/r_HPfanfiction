I enjoy DPaSW, but I enjoy it in spite of the harem elements rather than because of them. The worldbuilding is really interesting, and it plays with a lot of tropes in interesting ways. It's one of the only fics I've read with a manipulative/evil Dumbledore who isn't just bashed nonstop and is an actual, threatening antagonist. I like the deviation from standard time-travelling tropes by having the MC try and avoid "preserving the timeline" while at the same time, there's another time-traveller who wants to do just that.
