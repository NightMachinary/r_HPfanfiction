Ugh, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. I've seen this rec'ed so many times as a "good" harem that my curiosity won and I decided to check it out. Not that I'm going to read those anyway, but at least in your usual harem Harry is the same age as the girls. DPaSW is about an adult man grooming kids.
