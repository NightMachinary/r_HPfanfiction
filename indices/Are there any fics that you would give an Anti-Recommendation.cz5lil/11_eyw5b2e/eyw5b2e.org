This was way too long of a post, but here's one that I can't in good conscience recommend for ethical reasons, and hurts me when I see it recommended to others who don't know the truth behind the story.

*The Historical Importance of Runic Warding*, one of the most popular Fem!Harry/Voldemort fics on Ao3. Without the genderbend to liven up the premise, it's a bog-standard, circa-2005 Indy!Harry tropefest. Harry inherits the Black Lordship after the events of OotP, discovers she has a creature inheritance, and that she is the soulmate of Voldemort. Who is turned into a cardboard "villain" when he unironically explains that he murders people because the muggles are destroying the environment and muggleborns are diluting /"the olde ways"/.

This would not be out of the ordinary, except for the part when the author is a self-admitted plagiarizer, who gave credit retroactively, and only when called out for it by the author she plagiarized. [[https://i.imgur.com/o4P66Ur.png][Source.]]

Everything I purposefully reference or use as inspiration I credit and will continue to do so, so please feel free to tell me if there's ever anything lurking in the back of my head that ends up being posted which you take offense to."

Here were the plagiarized parts called out by the other author:

  “We were never scared of the dark,” she says, squinting a little, the late afternoon sun burning behind her. It means something, he thinks, though he's never given it much mind. “No, no, I suppose not.”

  "We're not scared of the dark though, are we?" "No. No we are not."

  "He thinks about God reaching into Adam's chest and pulling out a bloody, white rib; a consecrated voice not meant for mortal ears. She comes from you because she is for you. Did you think this would be painless?"

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  "If it was somehow possible to feel the jagged edges where she'd apparently been torn out of him like Adam's rib."
