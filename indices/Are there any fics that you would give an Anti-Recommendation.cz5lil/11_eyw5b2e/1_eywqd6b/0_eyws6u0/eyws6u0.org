honestly, if you like runic war warding, you will not like nocturnememory's, Runic stripped all of the depth and complicated parts out of the pairing to make it palatable and easy. Nocturne's fics were focused on the messed up, dark parts of the pairing and why it /shouldn't/ work. For all of the words/image/theme similarities, runic war warding is like the vanilla lite version of the harrymort pairing
