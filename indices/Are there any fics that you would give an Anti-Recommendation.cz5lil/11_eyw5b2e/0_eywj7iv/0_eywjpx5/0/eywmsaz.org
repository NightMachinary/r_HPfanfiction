I get what they're complaining about, but the similar nature of the stories leads to some common conclusions. It's obvious that Nocturne has a boatload more style in the prose and anyone reading both would see the artistry in comparison to the duller but more direct language of Runic Warding. It makes me think of all those plays retelling and remaking old Greek stories with their own spin. You can compare the works and call one superior, but they have equal merit as their authors' own work.
