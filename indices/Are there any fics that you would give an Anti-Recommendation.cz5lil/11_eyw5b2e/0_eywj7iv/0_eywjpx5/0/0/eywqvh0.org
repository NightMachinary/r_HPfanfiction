I'm biased because I also hate this work, I think it's bad on multiple levels, even ignoring how much inspiration I think is obvious she got from Nocturnememory's works. But the author also took a lot of inspiration from Ellory with her pureblood culture and didn't credit until Nocturnememory called her out for not crediting anyone at all, even when it's clear she was using other's ideas. There was another author as well, and the only one Samvelg ended up actually crediting properly, who wrote a story about runes and fabric witchcraft, which was clear to have been an inspiration point. (again, not until she was told to) I understand why people go, hey that's really not a big deal, it's just similar themes and word use etc... but Nocturnememory really had something different that wasn't seen in the fem!harry side of this pairing and a lot of people wrote things after she started posting that followed her style/prose and themes, and while a lot of people credited, samvelg did not. It's dishonest and just rude, especially because Nocturne attempted to actually write something new and complex, and Samvelg essentially stripped it down to crack!fic but kept all the really interesting allusions and themes and just...threw them into her weak writing.

But regardless, even without the copying aspects I 100% believe that Samvelg was 'inspired' by fics that they had literally bookmarked... this story is just really bad. Badly written, incredibly corny, absolutely nothing has happened and it's literally all tell and no show. How it's so popular is absolutely beyond me.
