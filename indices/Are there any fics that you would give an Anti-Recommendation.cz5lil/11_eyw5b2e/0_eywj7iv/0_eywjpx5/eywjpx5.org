Nope, there's a lot more than that, but I cropped it out because those two instances were the ones directly referenced in the screencap.

Here's the rest of them:

*Theme: The master soul being referred to as a "home" to the lesser portion belonging to Harry.*

From Nocturnememory:

  He wonders how she can place such importance on other people when she has his fucking soul in her chest. How much more of a home can one carve out in another person? How much more of himself---

  How infuriating it is to know the succession of her thoughts, the succession of affection she holds for other people when he---

  How much more of a home could that be?

From Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  /Now you need to accept us, all we are and are not, and accept that once you made a home in me. Open up your eyes and ears and your nose Harry, your heart and your mind and everything you are, so that I may in turn make a home in you as well./ He told her all this with solemn inevitability, holding the waiting dark in his red right hand.

*Theme: Harry feels safest in the dark.*

Nocturnememory:

#+begin_quote
  In the cupboard, in the welcoming dark, in the snick of a lock, Harrie presses a wet face into a musty pillow... Harrie learns early that darkness is often safest. That there's nothing to fear as long as that lock stays firmly in place.

Runic Warding:

  "I've always felt safest in the dark Headmaster, for as long as I can remember. Because when it was dark I was safe from the Dursleys."

  It was a sad but true fact that the only times in her childhood Harry could actually remember feeling truly safe was when she had been locked in that fucking cupboard.

.

*Theme: Voldemort uses the soul link to "phantom touch" Harry when she's sleeping.*

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  He scrapes a farewell pass of his teeth over the ticking of Harrie's pulse, wishes it were more than phantom canines against the rising tremor of it.

  Harrie wakes, a phantom brush of a movement, sliding over her hip.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  After the third time waking up sweaty and frustrated from the feel of phantom hands and teeth somehow the distinction didn't make her feel any better.
#+end_quote

.

*Theme: Innocent young fem!Harry compared to the empty monster Voldemort.* Voldemort is repeatedly described with metaphors and imagery using the terms /darkness, voids, vacuum,/ and /emptiness./

NocturneMemory:

#+begin_quote
  And of course, his little girl, that tiny little spot of uneven light and uneven hair; the first time he ever felt anything shift inside his chest, inside any chest at all; whether half full, half empty... Twelve years old and ruining pieces of a man who had been alive for decades, dove into darkness with no thought to his soul or humanity. A boy and a man and eventually a monster; soulless, empty.
#+end_quote

Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  The person who despite everything that had happened still couldn't really think of herself as anything other than Harry, who might once have sort of been a baby girl called Harriet Potter and an empty boy called Tom Riddle and a fully grown monster called Lord Voldemort.
