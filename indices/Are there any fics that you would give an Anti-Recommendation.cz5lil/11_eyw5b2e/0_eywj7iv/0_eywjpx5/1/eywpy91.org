Do you even know what plagiarism is? Because this os not plagiarism.

It would he plagiarism if he took whole fucking paragraphs and copied them without any changes whatsoever.

Taking inspiration from the story of another fic is not fucking plagiarism. I do not think you understand how serious of an accusation you are leveling against this (probably not so experienced author).

Plagiarism is one of the worst (if not the worst) offences one can commit as an author.
