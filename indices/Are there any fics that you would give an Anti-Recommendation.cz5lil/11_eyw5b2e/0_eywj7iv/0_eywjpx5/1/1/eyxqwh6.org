The definition of plagiarism is taken from [[https://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism][plagiarism.org]]

#+begin_quote
  *All of the following are considered plagiarism:*
#+end_quote

- turning in someone else's work as your own

- *copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit*

- failing to put a quotation in quotation marks

- giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation

- changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit

- copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on "fair use" rules)

.

Plagiarism isn't limited to writing songfics and quoting song lyrics wholesale, or writing "The cast reads" fics and copying excerpts from JKR's original books. If you take someone else's words and use them in your writing, certain turns of phrase, metaphors or motifs - that other people */can immediately recognize as having been derived from someone else/* without credit, that's plagiarism. It doesn't need to be a case where someone can profit monetarily (which the author of Runic Warding /did/ do, by starting a donation page and linking it to her fic, until Ao3 admins took it down for violating their T&C), or start a legal action to sue. And this whole deal could have been solved by /crediting/ the person whose ideas were used as inspiration.

Fanfic writers write for free. They put their time and creative ideas into producing content for us to enjoy. Outside of the ethical aspect of not crediting other creators, it's just basic courtesy and respect to give credit where it's due.

I do agree with you that plagiarism is a serious offence. Which is why I can't justify it with the reasoning, "Oh, this person is young and inexperienced", or "It's just fanfiction, not an academic paper".
