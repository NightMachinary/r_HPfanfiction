Plagirism does not have to be word for word. Not at all. If you submit an essay and you've taken too much from another source material without credit, that's plagiarism. And while plagiarism is a strong word to use, it's not entirely wrong, is it actionable plagiarism? no, but it's obvious where these ideas came from, and anyone who read both stories can see the overlap.

Even if the author isn't experienced, if another author comes to you and says, I think you're using a bit too much of other people's ideas with no credit, there are better ways to handle it than brushing off the whole thing. And itsn't it kind of telling the way she says, "tweak" words, like the problem isn't that there's an indentical line, just that she didn't tweak it enough it wasn't avoidable the first time.

Also, chill a little, there's no reason to come in cursing.
