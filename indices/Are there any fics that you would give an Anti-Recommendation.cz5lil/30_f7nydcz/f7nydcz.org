The Refiner's Fire/ Time to Destiny.

The plot I think is actually really good but it totally lacks tension. Apart from that it is totally unrealistic for brief periods like Harry being overly celebrated, contains some sexism (the females are either healers or irrelevant and in general don't seem to have anything resembling a mind or opinion) and the Epilogue is far too long.
