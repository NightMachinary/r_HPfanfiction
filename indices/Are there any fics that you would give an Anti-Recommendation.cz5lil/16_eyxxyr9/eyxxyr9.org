*A Butterfly Effect*.

It's a fem!Harry Harry/Ginny retelling of canon, and it makes Harry and Ginny unbelievably unlikable. Not only are they having obviously fetishized sex when they're 11/12 (or possibly 12/13, I refuse to check), but there is this constant cycle of fem!Harry 'losing her mind' and mindlessly hurting or even murdering a bunch of people, and then Harry feels sad about it and Ginny fiercely defends her girlfriend to all those mean grieving relatives of the people who died who dare be mad at Harry, and then fem!Harry threatens to murder the rest of their relatives for daring to argue with Ginny.

I couldn't finish it because I ended up loathing the two main characters. I actively wanted Ginny and Harry to die in a fire, and I don't understand why it's a go-to recc.
