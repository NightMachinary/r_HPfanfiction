I read Hail Odysseus by Brennus on a rec from here; it is a fic where Harry is raised by Grindelwald, which is generally well-written if a bit eye-rolly in its Dark!Indy!Badass!Harry way, but also had some content that meant that I had to stop reading the story partway through because it was enraging me.

First of all, there are exactly three male characters who are explicitly presented as gay/bi, and all three character happen also to be cackling, mustache-twirling, murderous villains. No non-evil dudes who are into dudes.

This wouldn't have stuck out to me so much except that Grindelwald also canonically had some kind of relationship with Dumbledore, but since he is a “good guy” by the standards of this fic, we never get a reference by him to his relationship with Dumbledore, and in fact we get his long backstory on how his TRUE love was a good heterosexual relationship later in life with a random Muggle woman. As far as I remember, the only mention we ever get of Gellert being in a relationship with Albus is Harry throwing it in Dumbledore's face as an insult during a fight, after Grindelwald has died, because haha men who give it up for other men is a great insult, amirite

So all the gays are evil, and the one good guy in the fic who canonically had a thing with a guy must have a random hetero “real” love interest introduced and his relationship - with one of the main villains of the fic - never referred to except to insult said villain.

(Of course, the gays may be ew icky but lesbians are HAWT and so there is lots of Harry's female friends teasing him about them making out with each other and how it makes him horny, so horny, etc.)

Speaking of horny Harry, this is less of a dealbreaker content issue for me but definitely a pet peeve: it goes to a very specific heterosexual relationship well that I see unfortunately often in fic where Harry and Ginny's relationship is “flirty,” by which I mean “he says explicitly rude and sexual things about how parts of her body get him hard, and she acts offended on the outside but secretly she's flattered, because having clearly unstable guys you barely know ‘banter' with you about how your tits give them a boner is the way to a woman's heart and into her panties.”

I have other issues with the fic - I don't love the way Harry's and Ginny's first time together is of dubious consent (and in animal form?), or the fact that it's explicitly set up that all the Slytherin girls are used sexually by the guys except that Ginny manages to stay a virgin because of course she is the main character's love interest and so must be properly untouched for Harry, and of course the other major female character who DIDN'T stay properly virginal has to die to motivate Harry and Ginny (and killed by two of those murderous gays!) - but in general it boils down to the fact that I have never read a fic before that was generally decently written but where I came away with such a clear distaste for it.

I know putting something in a story does not imply that you condone it, but this fic seems to be built on a series of assumptions that make me feel that if I knew the dude who wrote this in real life (and I have no doubt it is a dude, and a very particular type of straight dude at that), I wouldn't like him very much. (I hope I'm wrong, though, and that he is a perfectly lovely person who just happens to write terrible fic!)
