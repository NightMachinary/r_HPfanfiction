The many rape fantasies that populate fanfiction, especially when there isn't even any warning before hand like /"ok so there might be some smut/ */WOH OHKE HE JUST DRUGGED AND SMASHED HIS ENTIRE FAMILY TREE IN ONE NIGHT CAUSE REASONS/*/"/

I get that it's a fantasy, and whatever floats your boat is chill, but when it's EVERYWHERE (referring to amateur fanfiction in this instance) and there isn't even warnings to the audience before it really ruins your day.
