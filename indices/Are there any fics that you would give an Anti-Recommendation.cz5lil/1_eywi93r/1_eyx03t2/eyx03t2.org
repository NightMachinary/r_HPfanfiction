(in response to your other rant) Try antithesis, not exactly what you want, and at first it reads like another edgy wrong boy who lived fic, but after a few chapters it starts going deep into how psychologically FUCKED Adrian/Harry is, it sort of dives into dark magic addiction, while all the while Adrian who is relatively strong(above average) is so throughly convinced that he's weak and useless allowed himself to be convinced and manipulated. (SPOILERS) and the most absolutely fucked up part is, that literally all the pain and sadness he goes through could literally have been avoided if his parents noticed him more. It is genuinely the ONLY fic to nearly have brought me to tears
