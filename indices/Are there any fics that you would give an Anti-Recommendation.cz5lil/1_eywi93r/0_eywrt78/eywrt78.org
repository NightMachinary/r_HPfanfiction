All according to plan is the fic the Black Queen series wants to be instead of the edgy trainwreck it is. You still have a raped MC, but instead of "Oh hi Narcissa, remember when you bought me as child prosititute" it handles the subject reasonably well (the reason the MC made a pact with "the devil"). A significantly better "dark magic" approach as well, not just some grimdark shit for the sake of having that.

It is tagged Harry/Hermione, but as far as I have gotten (Chapter 33/35), it has Harry and Hermione crushing on people of their own sex.
