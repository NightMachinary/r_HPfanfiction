Always write for yourself :) I enjoy writing- it honestly makes me really happy. I have a lot of work that I never post or share, just the action and process makes me happy. I don't lose interest or abandon long stories because I'm always thinking about them, I don't have the chance to lose interest! Even when I haven't written in a while, I'm still consciously trying to figure out plot. Sometimes I try to think of how to trick the few very perceptive readers, or what new twist would excite people the most. Writing is never a chore or a job, if it is, then you're writing for someone else and not yourself.
