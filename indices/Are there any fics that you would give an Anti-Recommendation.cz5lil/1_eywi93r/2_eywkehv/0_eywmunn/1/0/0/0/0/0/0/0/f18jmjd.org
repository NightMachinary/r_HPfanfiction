Normally just standard grammatical Check, I tend to miss things since I write quickly. Rearranging sentence structure if they repeat, pointing out dialogue that appears odd or out of character. Unnecessary or redundant sentences, repeated accidental word usage. It's less...plot beta work, more of an editor!
