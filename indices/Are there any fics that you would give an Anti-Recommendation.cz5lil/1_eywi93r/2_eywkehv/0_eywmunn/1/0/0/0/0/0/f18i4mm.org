Having a beta is always super tricky for me, because I tend to write spur of the moment and post online nearly as fast. I've gone through quite a few betas; either my process is too difficult to follow or the work requires too much time, and I've lost them over the months. If you're up to giving it a shot, I'd love to chat more :)
