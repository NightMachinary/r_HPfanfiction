Right, so, look. I've complained about this series [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cmr198/lf_fem_harry_fics/ew4w89v/?context=3][at length]] before, and have brought up what about it irks me, but I'm just going to reinforce that here. It is a fic that, if it had been written with nuance or an understanding of its content (child sexual assault and child prostitution, to begin with) it would be, in my own opinion, a /good/ story. It has everything I wanted in a vent-fic for myself, I could relate to it, but it falls apart so fucking quickly. It fundamentally misunderstands what it's like to be a victim of childhood sexual abuse, it fundamentally misunderstands the circumstances in which kids become prostitutes (it's never voluntarily) and it fundamentally does not understand how to characterize a victim of this sort of abuse who has been using dark magic to feel safe, trained by an amoral witch.

It's just /wrong/ in so many ways, it misses how it could've been a gritty story about a girl coping in the worst ways and Dumbledore just /not/ understanding what she's gone through. Everyone heals differently, yes, but for the life of me I will never forgive the series for starting out with a character I could, potentially, relate to, only to then show me someone who is entirely at-odds with her past and has been wildly mischaracterized as a consequence of the author not doing their research about sexual abuse survivors.

It had everything going for it, had the chance to be what I think would be a great exploration of the darker side of healing, and throws it all away because, in the end, the author couldn't cope with having a genuinely weak or emotional character and had to make one that, instead, took the idiom "own your fears" literally and ended up with a childhood sexual assault victim owning a goddamn child brothel.

Ugh.
