  Now, the observation Harry makes in this situation is that draco is just a kid, spouting off things he's heard his dad's cool friends say without understanding the depth of his words at ALL.

Not quite. It's not that Harry doesn't think Draco is serious. He just doesn't think it's ultimately Draco's /fault/. Because if you look through history, you'll find that whenever there is an upper class of society that is largely immune to prosecution, it becomes /normal/ for members of that class to rape and otherwise pillage the other social classes. Harry doesn't condone it at all, he just recognises that Draco is a product of his environment - "exactly what you'd expect an 11-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father." And he makes plans to turn Draco to the light side.
