In HPMOR Draco and Harry are sitting on platform 9.75, trying to make friends, talking about wizarding society. Draco tries to show off how cool and powerful he is by talking about rape, violence, healing charms and obliviation (in that order).

Now, the observation /Harry/ makes in this situation is that draco is just a kid, spouting off things he's heard his dad's cool friends say without understanding the depth of his words at ALL.

Draco isn't a rapist in this story but brags that he could be one during his opening scene in the story.
