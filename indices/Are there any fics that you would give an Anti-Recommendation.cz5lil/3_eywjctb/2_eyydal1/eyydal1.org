HPMoR has rapist /pureblood society/. And the comments from several people, suggesting that Harry brushes it off, are deeply misleading and in flat contradiction to the chapter where it's brought up, as well as further developments in the story. He is stunned and /horrified/ to discover Draco's attitude, and immediately starts making plans to change things. I recommend actually reading [[http://HPMoR.com/chapter/7]] and seeing for yourself, but here's a summary:

- Harry's initial reaction to Draco's announcement of intent to rape is, he's so shocked that he chokes on his drink and spends several seconds coughing.
- When he recovers and realises that Draco is serious, he decides that this is the natural result of Draco having been raised by, basically, Darth Vader.
- Questioning Draco further, he learns that the purebloods basically own the court system, there's no DNA testing, and memories can be modified to support the case the purebloods want to make. This gives Harry a cold chill and he decides that he needs to overthrow the government as soon as possible (hyperbole, but also a bit serious).
- Draco confirms that if Harry spoke out, those same forces would turn on him and destroy him.
- Harry makes excuses for having started the conversation, while thinking "I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms."
- As a way of getting Luna off the hook, Harry indicates a desire to get revenge on her by someday marrying her, instead of Draco's rape plan. Draco thinks he's crazy, but agrees to back off.
- Harry reflects on how Draco's behaviour has actually been depressingly normal for far too much of human history; it doesn't take a psychopath, it just takes the wrong kind of social norms. He isn't sure whether the French Revolution approach of guillotining all the leaders could be made to work out better this time than it did in France, but he certainly intends to do /something/. And he starts by introducing Draco to the fact that Muggles aren't as backward as Draco had assumed.
