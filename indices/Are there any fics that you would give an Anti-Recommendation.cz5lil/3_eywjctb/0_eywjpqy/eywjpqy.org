/Draco snarled. "She has some sort of perverse obsession about the Malfoys, too, and her father is politically opposed to us so he prints every word. As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape her."/

As far as I know, that's the only mention of it. Can't remember though.

Hermione dies (?) and it's returned to life (?) with unicorn blood I think? It's almost at the end of the fic.
