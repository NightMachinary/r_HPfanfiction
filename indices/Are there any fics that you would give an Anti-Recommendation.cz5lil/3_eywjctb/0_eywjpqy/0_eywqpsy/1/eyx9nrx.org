Draco's eleven. He likely doesn't even know what rape is, he just heard his father say the word and repeated it. Besides, it's pretty normal for 11 year olds to sometimes say horrible things that they'd never really do and don't really mean. I do remember when I was around that old, a friend told me like "I hope you die", then I was mad at him for the rest of the day, and the next day it was like it never happened. Saying bad things is not a big deal at that age, and shouldn't be. Or else we'd all have to hate each other.
