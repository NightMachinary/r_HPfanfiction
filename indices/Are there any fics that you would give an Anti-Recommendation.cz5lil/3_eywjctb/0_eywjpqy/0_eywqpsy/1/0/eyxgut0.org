I think you've misunderstood my objection - I don't have a problem with that idea that Draco could become a better person. I /do/ have a problem with how HPMoR treats Draco's future potential as more important than Hermione's (and other female students') safety and comfort. This prioritization of male abusers over female victims is grossly sexist, and it's that kind of attitude that leads, for example, to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner][a man convicted of three counts of sexual assault having to serve only three months in prison]].
