I think HPMoR should've acknowledged that rape threats are a scary thing for someone to experience (especially when that someone is a 12 year old girl), and let Hermione be upset by it without Harry immediately lecturing her on moral relativism.

Or HPMoR could've just not had Draco make rape threats at all - it's not like they're central to the plot.
