What? That's horrible. And I always associated the US with long sentences and high prison population :O. Which, I guess serves to make your point more prominent.

Still, unlike that guy Draco is not YET a rapist - and most likely (but not 100% sure!), despite what he says, he wouldn't rape anybody even if he could. Treating him like it's a done deal will only push him down that road faster - which is very counterproductive for the students' safety.

How do you think HPMOR should have handles the situation?
