I think that the "bad social structures make evil acts become commonplace" theme was significant, and shaped Harry's future interactions with Draco, which are a big part of the plot.

There probably could have been better handling of Hermione's concerns. Remember, though, if all we saw was how Harry reacted - he could be wrong, and he absolutely could be missing things, as you say. That's just inherent in the attempt to write a consistent character; they have flaws. Given that Harry, in his social ineptitude, was probably never going to handle her fears sensitively, how would you propose that the story address them?
