Hermione's reaction was understandable and normal, and it's reasonable for her to stay away from Draco, but insofar as she thought Harry should do the same, it was also a product of narrow thinking. Based on her own upbringing, she was neatly categorising people into good and evil based on whether they do what she would do. And it's not that her moral compass was a bad one; she's quite possibly the most stalwart and incorruptible character in the whole story. It's just that she held everyone to the same standard, /even when their childhood experiences and education were the ethical polar opposite of hers/. As Harry pointed out, it would have required a supernatural intervention for Draco to have her morality, given his environment.

So, Hermione's view that Draco is irredeemably evil and not worth spending time on - that is bigoted. And Harry doesn't resent her view, but he finds it upsetting that she would write people off so easily. His own experience is that Draco responds very well in a setting where ethics are actually taught.
