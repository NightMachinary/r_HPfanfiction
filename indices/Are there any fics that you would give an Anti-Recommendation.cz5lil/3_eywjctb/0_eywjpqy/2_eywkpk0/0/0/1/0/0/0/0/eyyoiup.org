That quote may be more detailed, but it's thoroughly in keeping with Harry's initial reaction in chapter 7, which was to blame the system rather than the individual.

#+begin_quote
  Right. Because he /seemed/ like such a normal kid. And he /is/ a normal kid, he is just what you'd /expect/ a baseline male child to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

  A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with instructions to keep his voice and face normal. /Note to self: Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest convenience./

Eliezer definitely has his faults, but to suggest that his story condoned or ignored rape is to disregard what he actually wrote. Harry's stance is, rape is what "normal" people do /when normality is horribly off the rails/, stuck in the dark ages, etc.
