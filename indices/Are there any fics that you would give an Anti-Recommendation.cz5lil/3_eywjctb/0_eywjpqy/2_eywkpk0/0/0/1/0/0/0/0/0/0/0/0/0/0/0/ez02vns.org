  punishing Draco rather than reeducating him,
#+end_quote

He doesn't reeducate him. In fact, his 'breakthrough' is just proving Malfoy wrong about blood purity, shattering his notion that Muggleborns are less powerful. Now that I think about it, there's literally nothing Harry does that would impact Malfoy's understanding that raping and killing /Muggles/ is wrong, besides generally teach him Muggle science (with the understood and stated goal of taking over both worlds). Maybe he just absorbs morals by osmosis. Maybe that's just how Yudkowsky thinks people think. I don't hold with it.

  He spends the next several months meeting with Draco regularly, teaching him to weigh evidence, question his assumptions, seek and accept the truth.
#+end_quote

See above re: Muggles.

  He even gets himself tortured when Draco flips out on realising that Harry has given him evidence that magic talent is probably genetic
#+end_quote

He had no idea that was coming, in fact.

#+begin_quote
  Disagreeing with Harry's methods is fine, but his motivations are, from what I can see, very honorable.
#+end_quote

They're pragmatic, from a certain point of view. Honorable would be cutting ties to a rapist.
