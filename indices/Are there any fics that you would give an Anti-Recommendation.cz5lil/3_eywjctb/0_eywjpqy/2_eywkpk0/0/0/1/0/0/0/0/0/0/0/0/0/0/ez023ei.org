If you really think it would have been better for Harry to focus on punishing Draco rather than reeducating him, you're entitled to your opinion, of course. That's a larger discussion about the role of the justice system and imprisonment vs rehabilitation.

My primary objection is to the idea that Harry brushed things off. He spends the next several months meeting with Draco regularly, teaching him to weigh evidence, question his assumptions, seek and accept the truth. >! He even gets himself tortured when Draco flips out on realising that Harry has given him evidence that magic talent is probably genetic; Draco always intended to grow up like his father, and the rug has been pulled out from under him.!< Disagreeing with Harry's methods is fine, but his motivations are, from what I can see, very honorable.
