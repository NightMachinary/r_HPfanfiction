I think you could benefit from reading some of chapter 87, but I'll spoiler it.

"There's history books you haven't read," Harry said quietly. "There's books you haven't read yet, Hermione, and they might give you a sense of perspective. A few centuries earlier - I think it was definitely still around in the seventeenth century - it was a popular village entertainment to take a wicker basket, or a bundle, with a dozen live cats in it, and -"

"Stop," she said.

"- roast it over a bonfire. Just a regular celebration. Good clean fun. And I'll give them this, it was cleaner fun than burning women they thought were witches. Because the way people are built, Hermione, the way people are built to /feel/ inside -" Harry put a hand over his own heart, in the anatomically correct position, then paused and moved his hand up to point toward his head at around the ear level, "- is that they hurt when they see their /friends/ hurting. Someone inside their circle of concern, a member of their own tribe. That feeling has an off-switch, an off-switch labeled 'enemy' or 'foreigner' or sometimes just 'stranger'. That's how people are, if they don't /learn/ otherwise. So, no, it does /not/ indicate that Draco Malfoy was inhuman or even unusually evil, if he grew up believing that it was fun to hurt his enemies -"

"If you believe that," she said with her voice unsteady, "if you /can/ believe that, then you're evil. People are always responsible for what they do. It doesn't matter what anyone /tells/ you to do, you're the one who does it. Everyone knows that -"

"/No they don't!/ You grew up in a post-World-War-Two society where 'I vas only followink orders' is something /everyone knows/ the bad guys said. In the fifteenth century they would've called it honourable fealty." Harry's voice was rising. "Do you think you're, you're just /genetically/ better than everyone who lived back then? Like if you'd been transported back to fifteenth-century London as a baby, you'd realize /all on your own/ that burning cats was wrong, witch-burning was wrong, slavery was wrong, that every sentient being ought to be in your circle of concern? Do you think you'd /finish/ realizing all that by the first day you got to Hogwarts? Nobody ever /told/ Draco he was personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society he grew up in. And /despite that/, it only took him four months to get to the point where he'd grab a Muggleborn falling off a building." Harry's eyes were as fierce as she'd ever seen him. "I'm not /finished/ corrupting Draco Malfoy, but I think /he's done pretty well so far/."
