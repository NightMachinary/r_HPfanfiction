It's accurate to say that it treats it as not Malfoy's fault, which I take issue with. Harry repeatedly absolves Malfoy of the sickening lack of empathy he displays, chalking it up to society and/or his father. He even thinks (and I can't believe I went back to reread this trainwreck of a story) "I am going to tear apart your pathetic little magical remnant of the Dark Ages into pieces smaller than its constituent atoms."

This after Malfoy describes in detail exactly how much they could hurt Luna during the rape and get away with it.

No, Malfoy has a developed sense of right and wrong (he even notes that there's no chance someone would believe that Harry and Malfoy raped her together), and knows that Harry's parents would have told him that it was wrong, showing that he understands a value system where rape is wrong. He claims that you are either a Slytherin or a Hufflepuff, and that were Harry to give himself fully over to Malfoy's side, he could 'get away with' things even Malfoy himself couldn't.

Harry literally considers murdering every blood purist like the French Revolution, only deciding not to based off a vague recollection that something didn't work out so well in the end on that count. I guess RobesPotter will do anything including bend his own stated morals - chief of which is that life is sacred - to avoid assigning Malfoy any blame for his stated intent to rape a young girl.
