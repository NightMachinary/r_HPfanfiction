I don't see how it matters whether Harry knew up front that Draco could definitely be reformed. His motivations are pretty clearly laid out: he considers what he has just heard to be an abomination, a sign of a thoroughly corrupt system, and he intends to tear that system down. However you choose to apportion the blame for that system, surely not much of it belongs on the shoulders of an eleven-year-old with no broader life experience.

Incidentally, Harry's other motivation for claiming he wanted to marry Luna was so that Draco would back off from her. And he was pretending to be casual because he had just found out that a thoroughly corrupt court system could easily be aimed at him if he caused trouble.

You can dislike the character, the writing, and the author, but to suggest that the story shrugs its shoulders at rape is to grossly misrepresent it.
