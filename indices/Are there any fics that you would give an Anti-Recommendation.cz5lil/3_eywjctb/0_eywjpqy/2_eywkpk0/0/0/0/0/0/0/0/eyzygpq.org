  I just explained why this is not true.

No, you /asserted/ that it's not true. You said Draco is old enough to be responsible. Which is true from a certain point of view, but as Harry points out in chapter 87, that point of view is based on assumptions and conditions that are very different from the mediaeval-esque Wizarding world. "It would have required a supernatural intervention for him to have your morality given his environment."

This is an eleven year old raised by a /Death Eater/. Someone who sincerely believes that non-magical people are merely dirt-scratching apes, who considers torture and murder to be both recreational and morally praiseworthy, but who loves his wife and son. Draco has been taught that magic makes him special and superior, and he's lived in a mansion that would make such claims easy to believe. Surely the fault for his attitude lies mostly at his parents' feet rather than his own.

  This motivation was never considered in Harry's thought process.

May I respectfully suggest that you reread chapter 7 and reconsider that? For example:

#+begin_quote
  "Draco, please please /please/ don't take this the wrong way, my word is my bond, but like you said I could be in Slytherin and I really want to ask for informational purposes, so what would happen theoretically speaking if I /did/ testify that I'd heard you plan it?"

  "Then if I was anyone other than a Malfoy, I'd be in trouble," Draco answered smugly. "Since I am a Malfoy... Father has the votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess not easily, since you are the Boy-Who-Lived, but Father is pretty good at that sort of thing."
