  Yes. And Draco comes from one, and has not had noteworthy exposure to other lifestyles.

No, Harry specifically calls out magical society as a whole. If it were just the Death Eaters, then maybe. If it were just the Malfoy family that was screwed up, then that would be fine.

  Instead, he picked up a shovel and got to work fixing it.

Malfoy isn't the manure in this analogy, he's the shovel. Harry could have avoided this, called him out, did /anything/ to indicate that rape was wrong, even if you were doing it to someone weaker than you. I mean, shit, we /know/ he isn't cool with the strong doing what they like to their lesser enemies - witness the charred corpse of supposedly-Narcissa.

Malfoy advocating rape is his own fault and his own responsibility. It is a problem that comes solely from the mind of the author, just so he could wank himself silly about "muh subjective morality!" I personally feel that I have made an adequate account of my feelings on the matter, and I'm done responding. I will let my previous arguments stand for themselves, in large part because we are not the first ones to have this conversation, and after viewing both sides this particular sub has come down very firmly against Yudkowsky.
