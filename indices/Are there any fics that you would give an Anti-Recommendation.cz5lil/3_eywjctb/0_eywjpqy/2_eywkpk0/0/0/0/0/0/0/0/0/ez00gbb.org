  You said Draco is old enough to be responsible. Which is true from a certain point of view, but as Harry points out in chapter 87, that point of view is based on assumptions and conditions that are very different from the mediaeval-esque Wizarding world. "It would have required a supernatural intervention for him to have your morality given his environment."

SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, rape was actually illegal then, too. Rape has been considered one of the most awful and inhumane crimes possible to commit for all of recorded history. This hasn't prevented it from happening, because some people are horrible. Nevertheless, society as a whole condemns rape and always has. Yudkowsky conveniently pretends this is not the case.

  This is an eleven year old raised by a /Death Eater./ Someone who sincerely believes that non-magical people are merely dirt-scratching apes, who considers torture and murder to be both recreational and morally praiseworthy, but who loves his wife and son. Draco has been taught that magic makes him special and superior, and he's lived in a mansion that would make such claims easy to believe. Surely the fault for his attitude lies mostly at his parents' feet rather than his own.

I'll note as an aside here that Luna isn't a Muggleborn, nor is she even so much as a 'blood traitor' like the Weasleys. The only thing she's guilty of is printing an nonsense story in a nonsense paper. Also Malfoy doesn't feel this way in canon, so this is just Yudkowsky coming up with stuff to create a masturbatory scenario in which it's everyone else's fault that they're not as enlightened as his self-insert, so obviously they're all rapists waiting to be cured by his magical brain. Not that I can really blame him for not knowing that - it only really becomes relevant in the last two books, which Yudkowsky didn't read before crapping out his fanfic.

  May I respectfully suggest that you reread chapter 7 and reconsider that?

May I respectfully suggest you reread everything between "I'm going to rape her" and the section you quoted? You know, all the rationalizing he does before he learns about that? Also

  the obvious response would be to avoid interacting with Malfoy at all.

But he doesn't do that, does he?
