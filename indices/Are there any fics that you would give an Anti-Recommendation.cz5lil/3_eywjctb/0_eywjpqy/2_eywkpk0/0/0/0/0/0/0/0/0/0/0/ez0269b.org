  Do you think that rape has never been normalised among some sections of society who believed themselves to be above the law? Because that's where Draco comes from.

It has /always/ been condemned. It has /never/ been treated as something to aspire to or something that one is entitled to, at least society-wide. There were certainly shitheel families and at times even organizations that did indeed rape as a matter of course, but never a society.

  Hating the family's enemies is all part of the package.

The entire philosophy espoused is about thinking Muggles and Muggleborns are lesser, not fellow purebloods. If Malfoy is thinking of raping them, then that's just one more point against society being the problem, because pureblood culture and rhetoric has nothing against Luna, despite what the specific purebloods feel.

  No, he doesn't walk away from the terrible situation, he sets out to fix it. With gradual but substantial success.

No space after the exclamation point.

He could easily have done so without the kid who gleefully discusses the legal intricacies that come with avoiding rape to his new friends. In fact, I'd argue that he has a moral duty to do so.

Playing along with a rapist-in-training is a /bad/ thing to do.

Malfoy even gives him a graceful out! He says that he's sure that Harry's parents have taught him that rape is wrong. He's /suspicious/ that Harry might not be okay with casual rape. Harry /hastily reassures him that he's not./ He could easily have just said that he's not comfortable with that. Malfoy literally admits that the fact that Luna is a child means that Harry's assumed-to-be-serious death threat is much less appropriate. Harry could have ducked out there.
