Seconded, except that for the right kind of person it is a good intro to fanfiction - until I read it I was super strict on reading Canon compliant only, afterwards I started really appreciating AUs, also generally I don't get the hate just because Harry is a pretentious know it all, a recurring theme is that he is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is and despite everything he knows he is still just as prone as anyone else to make mistakes except for him the consequences tend to be proportionate to the chaos caused which is to say a lot. And honestly the author tract can be a bit much but it's nothing like the enormous mallet in "for the love of magic"
