I dispute your assertion that Harry's dialogue in /HPMoR/ isn't funny (maybe it isn't to /you/, but it's like /Seventh Horcrux/ or /A Black Comedy/, an example of a fic whose type of humor just does nothing for /some/ people while being uproariously funny to others), but I agree that it is at any rate not a good fic to /start/ with; it's much more of a fanfanfiction steeped in preexisting fanon than it is something for fans of the original books.
