HPMoR humor is mostly through completely unexpected and surprising events, such as "BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT" appearing with zero warning, and people joking about canon, like Moody telling them to check him for polyjuice if he ever teaches defense.

Seventh Horcrux humor is mostly by having SH!Voldemort being revealed as very different than expected, such as him actually believing Sirius to be his right hand.

ABC humor is mostly sexual jokes, like Remus calling his counterpart a pedophile.

All three achieve humor by surprising revelations about their AUs.
