Lords of Magic by Taure is an unfinished story which did not go into the tiers of power among the Lords, but the author intended to make Rowena Ravenclaw slightly better than both Dumbledore and Voldemort. Merlin was supposed to be on a whole other level than the rest.

Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian has Mab, who is much, much stronger than Dumbledore.

Other than that, the Phoenix and the Serpent has Dahlia. Dumbledore and Voldemort are just as powerful as they were in canon, but Dahlia would have ripped them a new one in any fair fight.
