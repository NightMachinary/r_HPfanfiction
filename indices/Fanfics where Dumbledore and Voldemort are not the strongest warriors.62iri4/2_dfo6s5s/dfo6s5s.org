Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) fits the bill.

It's part of an unfinished trilogy that at this point I've given up hope on it ever being completed, however it is worth mentioning that the Voldemort arc is finished and an enjoyable story in of itself.

(Quick note that the quality starts off high at the beginning of the Ch1 and then drops sharply until Harry arrives at school at which point it returns to the level of beginning. It's a bit of a slog through but I personally found it worth it.)
