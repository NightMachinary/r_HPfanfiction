Yeah, Kaleidoscope has Zelretch and Aozaki (but AD is slightly better). I was reading a fic where there was a mage council which had ranks: mage, sorcerer, grand sorceror, sorceror supreme, etc. AD was a grand sorcerer and Perenelle Flamel was a part vampire, part Veela hybrid who was the Sorcerer Supreme and stronger than them all.\\
Thanks for trying!
