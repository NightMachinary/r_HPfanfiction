Potential canon candidates:

- Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel - linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518), perhaps

- the Founders of Hogwarts

- Merlin

- Herpo the Foul - tragically underused, he's a brief threat in linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess) but the story stopped updating before we really got a full taste of it

and special honorable mention for Muirgen as seen in linkffn(A Long Journey Home)

Also you might consider Harry the hybrid Norse demi-god from Vanir's [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][HP and the Midnight Sun]]
