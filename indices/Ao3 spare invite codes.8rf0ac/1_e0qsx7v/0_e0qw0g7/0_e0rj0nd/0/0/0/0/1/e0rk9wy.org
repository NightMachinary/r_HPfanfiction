#+begin_quote
  The world is becoming out of joint. The cruel winds of winter are coming, but they come at a slow turn. It is the summer of plenty, of long laughs and even longer lives. But that summer is coming to a close. The Lord of Winterfell wants a better life for his bastard - a better life than even what his son would want. So Jon Snow travels across the Narrow Sea, where tales of an empire of horselords await him. A thousand roads he could travel, but he finds himself walking only the one, the one that brings him in conflict with a vicious dragon prince who will sell his sister for the Iron Throne. And so, begins a Song for Dragons.
