I don't. Usually I go for recommendations that are below 200k words. If I like it, I read it. However there are a lot these days and often time I forget them... few had made an impression on me and I remember those. For some reason I tend to remember better those that I read when the HP fanfiction community was in its early days (but then again I was like 10 so any cool idea made a big impression on me), many of them no longer exist and for many I can't remember the name but I can remember the plots quite accurately.
