I wish FFN had more options than follow and favorite. My personal categories are:

1. mark for later (A03 has this option)
2. actively reading / follow for updates
3. mark as read, but not a favorite. Don't want to accidentally waste my time in the future by re-reading one of these
4. favorite

On FFN, I wound up creating a community for the express purpose of accomplish #1 (mark for later) in order to clean up my follow list. I copied the idea of someone else (thank you to that mystery person) and it has worked pretty well.

Unfortunately, FFN only lets me create one community, meaning that #3 and 4 above can't be separated and I have to use my memory.
