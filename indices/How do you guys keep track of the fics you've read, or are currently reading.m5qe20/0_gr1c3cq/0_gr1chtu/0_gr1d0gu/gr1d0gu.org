Organized chaos i guess? I have a bunch of fics im waiting for updates on from ffn followed so if they update i get an email ao3 is harder cause update emails from there get spam foldered for some reason but i domt have many there.

Most tabs for fics ive had was around 35 at one point. After i lost that cause my phone went stupid i started bookmarking them all and if i decided to drop them id jist delete them from the folder.
