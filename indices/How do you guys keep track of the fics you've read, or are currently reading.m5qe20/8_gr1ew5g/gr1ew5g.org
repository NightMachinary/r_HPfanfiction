I have bookmarked about nearly 60 on my ao3 account. I have marked the ones that are WIPs so I can easily check in if any have been updated. I also have started to write a short summary into personal notes because it sucks when you see a deleted story in your bookmarks but you can't remember for the live of you what it was.

I don't read nearly as much on fanfiction.net but I usually bookmark them in my google account.
