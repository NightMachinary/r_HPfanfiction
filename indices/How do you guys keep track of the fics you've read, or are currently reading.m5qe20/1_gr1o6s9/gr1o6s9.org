I'm surprised it's not here yet: the AO3 subscription feature!

I subscribe to ongoing fics on AO3 and get an email update whenever the author publishes a new chapter. It's pretty reliable---emails come through within an hour of the new chapter going live---and I have a record of what I've read and not read yet. It saves me work, as I never have to think about which fics I've checked recently, and it's easier for me to manage than keeping a bunch of tabs open. The email also tells you the meta details of the fic, like title, summary, tags, author, etc., so it's easy enough to remember the context of the fic when I go to read the chapter.
