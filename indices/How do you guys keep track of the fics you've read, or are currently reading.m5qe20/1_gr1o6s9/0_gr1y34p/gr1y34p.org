Exactly, and the Follow feature on ffn and other sites. Then I just wait for the emails. When I get an update email I delete the previous one so my inbox isn't too cluttered. Stories I like I favourite on ffn or bookmark on AO3. If I need to I can go back through the alert/favourite lists on ffn, and bookmarks and subscriptions on AO3.

Plus I've got alerts set on the sites so I get emails if I get replies to my reviews or PMs.

No need to go looking for updates.
