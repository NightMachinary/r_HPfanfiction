I keep a spreadsheet for the stuff I've read, as well as downloading it onto my kindle. I use the “mark for later” button on AO3 to make a list of things I want to read and go to that when I want something new. I generally don't follow incomplete works, but the few I do I have the series bookmarked and I check in on them every now and then.
