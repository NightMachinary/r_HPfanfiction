So, the reason for both of my prompts today stems from real life - I personally have a mild case of sound-to-sight synesthesia in the form of waves (like the waves in a pond when you drop a rock in it) and severe hypersensitivity for sight, sound, hearing and touch. Changing these a bit and applying them to the HP universe is underdone IMO, so many fics has Harry being disabled through blindness, deafness etc but not a lot of them explore the opposite... I personally can't take public transport because everything is so goddamn LOUD and I can live with my sight being disturbed by deep bass tones, but imagine being hypersensitive to MAGIC in the HPverse... it's usually a case of mage-sight being overwhelming in Hogwarts or something similar, and the problem here could easily be said to be that. But what if there's a slight difference, where mage-sight allows you to see magic being cast, enchanted items etc but Harry sees ALL magic at all times and it's super distracting? The rest of the wizarding world goes "oh my god, Harry potter HAS MAGE-SIGHT" while he just goes "I wish this wasn't so goddamn distracting" or something along those lines. Could be a fun crackfic
