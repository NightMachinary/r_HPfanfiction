Can recommend jenorama's series of fics which she started before the bookd were finished, starts with canon Auror Harry and Ron, healer Ginny. Diverges to Ginny moving to SanFrancisco to study muggle healing, and Harry follows, becoming a teacher. California Dreamin' is a multi chap where he starts teaching, and there are several stories set after, and she is stlll wriitng this series, the current WIP is the Mona Lisa's smile. Great writing!
