  where Voldemort is just a murderous madman or a 2-dimensional, pure evil character.

But that is the basic premise of Voldemort? A childish anagram, a way to lash out, created by powerful, but unpolished mind of young Tom Riddle. Voldemort was never supposed to be a person, it was supposd to be a monster.

I agree that Tom could have done better, but Voldemort is his mangled, mutilated form. I'm all for adherence to EOL or even just basic competence in antagonists, even some moral fiber is welcome, but creation of Voldemort is a result, not a cause. A villain you seem to describe wouldn't, as far as I'm concerned, make the mistakes that resulted in the Ol' Snake Face. It just seems contradictory.
