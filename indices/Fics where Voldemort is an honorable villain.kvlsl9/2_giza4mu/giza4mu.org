If Voldemort were honorable, this is what should have happened:

Snape: My lord, please spare Lily!

Voldemort: Very well, Severus.

[Later]

Lily: No, no, please take me!

Voldemort flicked his wand and stunned Lily. He turned it toward Harry and killed the boy with an Avada Kedavra. Then he brought Lily to Snape, who went on to swear his undying loyalty.
