If you dont mind extremely long stories Vimesenthusiast has a particular good one, Linkffn(Magic of the Force)

you probably know the author from Third Path to the Future (HP/Marvel) and A Fate Touched in Middle Earth (HP/LotR)

There are also a few fics I re-read even though they are basically abandoned at this point

Linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

Linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force)

Those are some of the better ones, but I've also got alot of cliche op power-trip kind of fics I read when I just want to read about the main character kicking as. Quality isn't so good on those though, even if I enjoy them, can't really recommend them without knowing your tastes
