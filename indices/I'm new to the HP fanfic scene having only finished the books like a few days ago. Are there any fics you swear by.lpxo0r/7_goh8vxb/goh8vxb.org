My favorite is Against the Moon which is a Marauders fanfic and abandoned at one hundred thirty chapters. I also love Innocent, which has a lot of sequels. It's starts when Sirius escapes prison when Harry is eight and technically he kidnaps him, but asks if Harry wants to go home with him bc he's his godfather. Harry says yes and they're off
