the best mauraders fic going if you'd like to delve into that is all the young dudes. it's from lupins perspective and starts in mauraders year 1 and ends before OotP starts. i love this fic so much i had it printed and there's a great community around it. it sticks to canon in harry potter and has some of the best OCs every written. it's long (550k) but totally worth it, the foreshadowing it incredible, the sound track and their characterisation of all the characters are immaculate.
