tbh I'm not super deep into the fandom, but I've got a few I'd swear by:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts You Won't Find in “Hogwarts, A History”]] - canon compliant, “missing scenes”, fun and very sweet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447][the last son]] - AU where Ron Weasley is the Boy Who Lived. Fantastic, thoughtful, bittersweet at times. This is part of a series of unconnected “what if” AUs, and I whole-heartedly recommend checking out the rest of the series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/830080][Registration]] - Remus and Sirius wait in line to register their friend's soon-to-be-born baby as a future student of Hogwarts. Shenanigans ensue.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14906663/chapters/34527011][Regulus Black and the Way Things Changed: A Not!Fic]] - in which Regulus Black survives and becomes the potions master at Hogwarts. Basically an outline of a fic in the form of dot points. Funny and very clever.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5329223/1/][A Different Dursley Family]] - AU where a butterfly flaps its wings, and the Dursley family turns out pretty decent, all things considered.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11951/chapters/15262][In Between Days]] - AU of book 7, the war is a lot longer and messier than in canon. Percy Weasley-centric. I'm awed by how much this fic implies about the larger world by focusing on a single aspect of it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] - marauder's era fic. Listen. Listen. I consider this to be THE Harry Potter fic. The writing, the characters, the worldbuilding; you could not ask for anything better or more emotionally raw. That said it's 852k+ words long and unfinished, so. Read at your own risk. I've never actually reached the end, despite happily reading it from the start at least four times over.

I hope you enjoy these, or at least get a better sense of what you're looking to read in the fandom!
