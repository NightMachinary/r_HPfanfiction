Hogwarts felt sad these past feel days and Harry had no idea why.

The building always felt happy, saturated with magic and like a home he never had. But since the tournament began it felt such a strong longing that Harry himself felt affected. Maybe he should talk to the headmaster, he knew everything after all!

--------------

Sir?- said Harry as he tried to think on how to explain his feelings to Dumbledore

Yes, my boy?- the long nosed, ancient, wise, etc wizard responded

Don't you feel like Hogwarts feels different? Sadder.....like one would feel if they loved someone but was too far apart to be with them?

-Oh my boy, I didnt know you were an empath my boy!- Dumbledore exclaimed- that's like, the most powerful type of wizard, like, 10 times a Voldemort my boy!

Harry gasped in shock, so he was more powerful than Voldemort???

-But Headmaster what does that even have to do with anything?

Nothing of course! Do i ever make sense to you my boy? Nevertheless my boy of boys Hogwarts feels sad because it is in love with Durmstrang and the students here are remainding her of it!- Dumbledore clapped in delight, he loved LOVE stories after all

What?- Harry's green orbs widened- But that's not possible! Even if it was, how could we help the castke then?

-there is where you come in BOY - Dumbledore growled with an uncharacteristic deep and angry voice- USE YOUR POWERS AS AN EMPATH!

-.....What?- THE Hp asked confused

-oh my boy, your magic power is ginormous! You csn teleport durmstrang here and we can have the schools side by side again! Hogwarts will be able to be reunited with its long lost love!- Dumbledore waved the elder wand as he spoke taking them to Durmstrang

-It's ginormous even a word sir? Anyway i see durmstrang but where are we?- enquired politely the boy- who- lived

-No need for you to know my boy! Now i want you to use your magic powers to teleport us and durmstrang back to Hogwarts!- the old wizened man affirmed as he messed around with his beard.

-.....oh who gives a f***, ok here I go!

Harry Potter, the fourth triwizard champion, chosen one, main character and empath, took his wand and entoned

"AS MY POWER AS EMPATH AND PLOT DEVICE DETERMINE I DEMAND THAT DURMSTRANG IS TELEPORTED WITH ME AND THE HEADMASTER TO THE SIDE OF HOGWARTS"

With a great rumbling and thundering roar, it happened just as Harry comanded and all "three" of them (and everyone inside the building) were teleported to Scotland.

Unknown to our heroes screams were heard as durmstrang fell and crushed 2 unknown people.

-I did it sir! And already I can feel how Hogwarts is happier!- Harry jumped in excitement.

- Oh, yes you did my boy!- exclaimed Dumbledore appearing happy. Inside the man was in shock- i was just bullshitting the lad what the fu****

As Hogwarts and Durmstrang lived Happy ever after, the war was easier with the combined forces of both schools.

Victor Krum and Ron Weasley married.

Harry Potter became the most powerful wizard in the history of this reddit and married whoever you want him to marry.

And nobody asked why Snape disappeared and why Moody took 5 days to return to classes.

--------------

Hermione?- asked Harry in shock as he read the words on the page

-Yes?

-What the f did you just make me read?

-.......Just a fanfic i wrote for you, did you like it?

- Like it???? I LOVED IT HERMIONE! Will you marry me and keep writing this??- Harry begged

-Oh Harry of course i will!! Write this at least. Marrying depends on this reddit user on top of us.- Hermione rolled her eyes.
