linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) has Harry attend Durmstrang and has a relationship with a girl there. It's technically a WBWL story but I wouldn't let that put you off, it outright ignores the awful tropes that make others so bad. Unfortunately it dies not long after the relationship starts up and iirc the way the relationship's formation is written is a bit awkward. From what I remember her character is well done, clearly characterized and with genuine desires. I don't know if Harry attending Durmstrang is what you're looking for, though.

There are also a bunch of Harry/Krum stories on both ffn and ao3, I haven't read any of them though.
