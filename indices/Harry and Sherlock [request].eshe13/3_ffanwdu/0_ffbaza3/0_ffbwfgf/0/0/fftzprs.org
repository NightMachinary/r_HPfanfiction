[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]] is a web serial (also has a sequel) that has spawned its own fandom - there is a wiki you can check out. Tattletale is one of the characters and she has a psychic inference ability that is similar to what Sherlock does.

Edit: I'm not saying Sherlock is psychic, just saying that what he does due to his intellect, Tattletale kind of does due to her psychic ability.
