I guess that depends on your definitions of “truly” and “died.”

My take is that there is a core Voldemort splicing off pieces of himself. None of those pieces is Voldemort in the same way that if I cut off my nose and find some way to keep it alive, I could die and my nose could still live.

If the core of Voldemort dies in 1981, Voldemort is dead. If his soul shavings possess/merge with other people, we have new entities. This is especially true if the new entity ends up being a merge of the two or a warping of the person.

If you want to purge all references to Voldemort, your next best entity for him to conflict with is probably the Ministry. But since they won't conflict over Volds rising, it might have to be over the treatment of half-breeds, creatures of near-human intelligence, or muggleborns.

Outside of that, I assume you're making up a new big bad out of whole cloth.
