I could maybe see POA if I look sideways. But Goblet of Fire was directly a Voldemort plot, as was COS (as The Letter said, true death = no horcruxes) and HBP and DH. The entire series was built around Harry's tie to Voldemort. Remove that tie and you've removed the plot.

That said, if OP is writing fanfiction just come up with something else. It's fanfic. OP can do whatever they want.
