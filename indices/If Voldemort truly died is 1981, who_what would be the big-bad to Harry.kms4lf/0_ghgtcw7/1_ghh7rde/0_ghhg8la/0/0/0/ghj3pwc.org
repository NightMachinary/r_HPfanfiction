Would Peter be with Weasleys though? why would he stay in the country at all? it's assumed that Peter is hiding out as a rat in Britain to wait until Voldy comes back. He would like escape the country .. he has the perfect cover, he is widely known as dead.

The DE elements would like splinter without a leader .. Malfoy is clever, financially & politically powerful but he is not magically powerful enough to hold on to all the factions that likely exist.
