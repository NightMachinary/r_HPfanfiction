I know Snape mentioned his mark growing darker in GoF, but I'm pretty sure that's the only canon mention of it fading or darkening in canon.

But even if the mark did fully fade when he died, the Death Eaters would have no way to know that the first time around. Unless Voldemort told them beforehand, but the fact that they all seemed to have believed he died suggests that he didn't.
