Linka03(15430560) is pretty top tier, and updating regularly.

linkao3(19334905) is also decent, but it has been abandoned for years. However the author migrated to ao3 and said he's writing new chapters like last month, so we can hope.

linkao3(10643571) hasn't update in a year. I usually wait two before considering a fic abandoned, but you might not be so lenient with update frequency.
