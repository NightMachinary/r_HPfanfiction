I'm pretty sure Antithesis formats weirdly when you use the bot, but I'll try anyways lol. The summary isn't the greatest, but this fic is hands down THE BEST I've ever read. That characterization of Harry is incredible. It's a dark!Harry and a WBWL fic, but without the usual bashing that goes on. Although, it's mostly written from Harry view and he's an extremely unreliable narrator, so because of this it does seem like there's a little bit of bashing. Try to read it at least to the sorting ceremony, and by that point you'll know if you like the style/story or not. It's an absolutely beautiful fic and it deserves more reads. Linkao3(7322935)
