That's fair. I've enjoyed marathon-ing too many one-shot collections to bother skipping now though. It's fun seeing how ideas progress and authors grow.

But cool. 600,000-ish words of pre-Hogwarts stuff, huh? I think knowing that in advance will help set my expectations and keep me reading longer. Why not, I'll add it to the list. Thanks for the rec.
