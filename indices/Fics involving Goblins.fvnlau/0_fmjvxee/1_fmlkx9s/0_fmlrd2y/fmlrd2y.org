I'm not inclined toward picking and choosing, but there are some uploads where it's a reasonable idea. A collection of disconnected one-shots (with maybe the occasional sequel chapter). Or a story that's pulled in many directions, so the threads are all there, but they could be separate worlds for as much as they relate to each other. Or maybe there's a brief diversion where the main plot line is briefly related to the subject of your query.

If it makes you feel better, the current plot of the story /has/ gotten to Hogwarts by now.
