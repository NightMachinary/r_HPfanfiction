Yeah, I definitely don't skip stuff. All or nothing. The first chapter is interesting too, so I'll likely be reading the lot. I'm just worried that at 600,000 words and following many characters, it'll be as slow as the entire Wheel of Time series. Either way, it has an interesting start, so thanks for the rec!
