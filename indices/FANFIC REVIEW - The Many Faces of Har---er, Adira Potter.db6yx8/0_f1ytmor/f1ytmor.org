Bit too canon-rehashy for my tastes, really, but I like the concept and the writing's good. The multiple and trans situation is without a doubt the most interesting thing about the fic, so I don't mind that it gets a lot of attention... besides, the various peronalities and their often conflicting attitudes bring a certain... freshness to what often threatens to be a straight canon retelling. In the end, they were what kept me reading the story, and what kept things interesting. Also, I really like the name "Adira." I might not have liked it for a fem!Harry who was BORN a girl (doesn't quite seem like a name Lily and James would have picked for their daughter), but for a transitioning Harry it works. Especially since it was a name Harry came up with on the fly while in disguise, liked and adopted as her own.

I do wish the author had had the nerve to stray away from the beaten path a little more, plot-wise. There are SOME changes, and some of them are pretty neat, but the overall course of the story doesn't really change, even if Harry does. Maybe the sequel gets a little more original; I didn't get around to reading that yet. Planning to do it because I really like this incarnation of Harry... and that should count for something because I can count on one hand all the fics where the depiction of Harry was the highlight for me.
