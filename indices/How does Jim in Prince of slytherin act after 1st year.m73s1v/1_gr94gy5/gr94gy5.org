I haven't read it for a while, so don't quote me on anything. I also suspect I get quite a few of the plot points mixed up with DPaSW. From memory there is nobody in that story who 'sees the light' and suddenly becomes hugs all around. For Jim specifically there were external events which mean that his opinion of Harry changes quite a bit backwards and forwards, but I don't think it gets better than 'tolerates'. Also remember that reconciliation goes both ways, and Harry isn't going to forgive or forget any time soon (even if he may pretend in public for an advantage).
