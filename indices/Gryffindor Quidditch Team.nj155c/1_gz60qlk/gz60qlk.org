  I just realized how weird it is that in Harry's first year, the team consist of a first year (Harry), a second year (Katie), four third years, and a fifth year (Oliver Wood).

It's not that weird. Imagine Harry would have attended Hogwarts without Voldemort. The Team in his seventh year would probably have been:

Harry (7. year)

Ron (7. year)

Ginny (6. year)

Dean (7. year)

Demelza (4. year)

Jimmy (4. year)

Ritchie (prob. also 4. year, as he wasn't seen at the Battle of Hogwarts and the adult Gryffs stayed and Ritchie and Jimmy seem to be friends)

So after that year only Ginny would have been a seventh year - everyone else on the team would have been from younger years. If the situation was similar to this one the year before Harry came to Hogwarts it would made sense that the team is younger - then there is also the point they were utterly defeated by Slytherin the year before Harry arrived, so maybe there were older students in the team that were replaced like Jack Sloper and Andrew Kirke were in HBP.

  It seems kinda strange that there would be no sixth or seventh year students at all, but then again didn't Slytherin win the cup like back to back since Charlie Weasley left Hogwarts? Must've been a real shit generation for playing Quidditch in between!

Charlie Weasley left Hogwarts the year before Harry arrived. The only possibility for the six years without a cup for Gryffindor is that even with Charlie they didn't win the cup every year. Which would made sense. Even with Harry they didn't win every year: they didn't win in first and second year and only won in third, fifth and six year by points and not by winning every game.

  Also, in Harry's first year, how did Katie get a spot but they didn't get a seeker? Was there no one trying for the seeker position during tryouts?
#+end_quote

Katie was already reserve if I remember correct (one of the girls was).

And yes, nobody trying for seeker would made sense. Especially if Gryffindor-Team wasn't very popular at this time: we see that in later years. In fifth year Angelina has troubles filling the team after Harry, Fred and George got themselves kicked out. On the other hand in sixth year Harry has to sent away first years because the Harry was so popular.
