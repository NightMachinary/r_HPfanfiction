In Canon, Slytherin had been winning the /House Cup/ six time in a row, and would have a seventh time without the last minute points given by Dumbledore. As for the /Quidditch Cup/, it's a little bit complicated, mainly because Rowling suck at math.

In PS, there is a character (I think McGonnall, or maybe Wood) mentioning that Gryffindor didn't win the Quidditch Cup since Charlie Weasley left. But, it is also implied that Charlie is around 7 years older than Ron, and had just finished school when Ron started. Which means than in PS, Gryffindor should either be the reigning Champion or, (if you play with the dates a bit) had not won since 1 or 2 years (which is still totally acceptable).\\
I guess that can still be summed up by Wood being over dramatic.

Concerning the youth of the Quidditch Team, that's only because Rowling didn't want to bother updating the team, and so readers didn't have to learn the names of new (semi useless) characters. Everyone remember Harry's first team, but outside of Ginny and Ron, can someone give me the names of the new additions to the team in HBP (without looking it up)? Because I sure can't.

Also concerning the lack of seeker, the obvious (Doylish) explanation is that the position needed to be empty so Harry could take it. There are no Watsonian explanation for it, so everyone is free to decide why it happened. Personally, I think Wood found players he was satisfied with for the other posts, but all the Seeker were so lackluster that he decided to hold his decision for a bit.
