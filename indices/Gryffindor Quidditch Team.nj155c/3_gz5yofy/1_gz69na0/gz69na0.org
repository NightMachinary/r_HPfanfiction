  Everyone remember Harry's first team, but outside of Ginny and Ron, can someone give me the names of the new additions to the team in HBP (without looking it up)? Because I sure can't.

Demelza Robbins was a Chaser and particularly good at dodging Bludgers

Jimmy Peakes was a short and broad-chested boy. If memory serves, he was a third-year and tried to stay behind at the Battle of Hogwarts, despite being underaged.

Richie Coote looked weedy but has good aim.

Edit: I'm a doof. I got Coote and Peakes mixed up.
