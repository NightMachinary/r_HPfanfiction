  It seems kinda strange that there would be no sixth or seventh year students at all
#+end_quote

It is a bit odd, but not that unbelievable. There do not appear to be any second string or backup players at Hogwarts (which is what is actually strange, but it might also just be a side effect of Rowling making Quidditch intentionally stupid), so there are only seven players per team coming (usually) from six years. So it's probably pretty common to have one or two years unrepresented.

  but then again didn't Slytherin win the cup like back to back since Charlie Weasley left Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

Yes, but Rowling also said that Charlie graduated the year before Harry started. And even if we ignore that, he couldn't be more than a few years older than that anyway.

  Also, in Harry's first year, how did Katie get a spot but they didn't get a seeker? Was there no one trying for the seeker position during tryouts?
#+end_quote

Or the only people who tried out were really bad.
