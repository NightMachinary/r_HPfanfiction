Also talented Youth ensures long term Victories rather than a one and done program. We see it in NCAA basketball. The top programs recruit the best high school seniors, they play one season and leave. This can mean even though programs do well for long periods of time they can do decades without winning big because they can't build on the positives of the previous year save the guys you treated as Goobers to beginning with and are looking for more raw talent in their positions
