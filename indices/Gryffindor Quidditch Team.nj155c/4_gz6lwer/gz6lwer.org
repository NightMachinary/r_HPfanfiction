Wood has insanely high standards. This is a guy that makes the team wake up stupidly early for practice. The Seekers that tried out were probably god awful, and he was spoiled by having Charlie Weasley as a Seeker before Harry started at Hogwarts.

My issue is that Harry carried on playing Quidditch after they treated him like trash after the Dragon incident, and even Fred and George, the "Pranksters" were involved in it, and it was never brought up again.
