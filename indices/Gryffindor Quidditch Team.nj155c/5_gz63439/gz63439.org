You want to have the same players on the team for as long as possible, so you don't have to train a new team all the time. Preferably, you don't even hold tryouts some years, because you don't need any new players. And when you only change players every few years, and only have seven positions to fill with seven (or rather six) years, you're more likely than not to have only some years represented.

Also, in Harry's first year, two spots on the team were to be filled, which suggests two people left last year, and so were most likely seventh years.

As for Katie getting a spot but a seeker not being selected, what do you base that on? IIRC, Harry gets on the team in his second week or so, so it's entirely possible the tryouts haven't been held yet at that point. Or is it established somewhere that Katie got on the team before Harry?

McGonagall and Wood of course would know that in the upper years, there's no good seeker, could even have some idea about second years from their flying lessons and just generally being in school with them. Or McGonagall could simply have known the team needs a seeker and after seeing Harry, she didn't see the need to look further.
