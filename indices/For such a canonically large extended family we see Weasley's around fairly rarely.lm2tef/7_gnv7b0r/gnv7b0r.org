My headcanon is that same as Arthur and Molly had many boys and one girl in previous generations they used to have many girls and one boy. So genetically there are plenty of weasleys around but in surname they arent that many.

That or Arthurs cousins and siblings were all killed jn the two wars. I mean in Billy and Fleurs wedding you never met a single young weasley. So maybe most of them died.
