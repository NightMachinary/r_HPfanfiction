Lol, ok then :-)

linkffn(5706309) The Fifth Act, very cute fic, though the relationship moved a little fast, I felt. Still one of my favourites.

linkffn(4014370) Speechless, one of the, in my opinion, most realistic portrayals.

linkffn(2625870) The Cinderman's Kiss. It's been a while since I read this one, but I remember liking it. It's a bit different in that it doesn't take place immediately after the war, but several years later, but still the same premise.

linkao3(2457953) The Most Powerful Magic. Hope I got the link right, this one isn't on ffn. I love this fic. It's actually Epilogue Compliant, and the kids play a part, which I think really adds something to the fic. Basically, Severus is in a coma for like 20 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's a bit sappy, but in a canon sort of way? Power of love and all that rot. I'm not really describing it well, because it's kinda one of those fics that sounds really dumb when you try to describe it, but ends up being really good...

Anyways, these are my top four. I'd love to hear what you think, especially from a more academic standpoint. I may be totally biased because it's my favourite pairing, but I thought all of these (well, at least three, like I said, I don't remember much about the Cinderman's Kiss) were really well done. So, yeah, let me know :-)
