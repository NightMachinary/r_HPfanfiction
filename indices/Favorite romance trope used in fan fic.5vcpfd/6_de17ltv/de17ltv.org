My most favorite romance trope is the Bonnie and Clyde one; that is, two people notice each other, then do something bad together (or vice-versa). Then they grow even closer because (gasp!) they are criminals now and they only have each other to depend on! So that naturally leads to more crime and more closeness, until it's the two of them versus the world.

Two good examples are linkffn(renegade cause) and linkffn(hail odysseus).
