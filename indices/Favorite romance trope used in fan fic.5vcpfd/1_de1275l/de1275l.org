Oh boy. I'm a sucker for enemies who keep noticing that the other person is attractive but being like WHAT WHY DID I JUST THINK THAT - extra points if it's a slash or femslash pairing because then you get some good "ALSO THAT PERSON IS MY GENDER" panic as well (which I just relate real hard to).

I love fake dating tropes, especially if they have to kiss for some reason (to prove it's not "fake" even when it is??) and end up liking it way too much.

Forced bed sharing is another great one. Whatever the circumstances it's great.

Also, soulmate AUs. Ahhhh, I love a good soulmate au.
