I'm curious, what's there to like about the soulmate thing? To me it always just felt like very lazy writing that skips a ton of character/relationship development and just goes to "Huh, we are soulmates, guess we have to love/fuck each other now". I can sooort of tolerate it as a veela thing, but that's about it.
