I think this trope would be infinitely more interesting if it was subverted, and the couple that ended up together were not soulmates - the only one I've seen do that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8857564][this]] BBC Merlin (Merlin/Arthur) fic. I also don't usually like soulmate AUs because they place romance as the Most Important Relationship Ever - I've only seen one give as much focus to platonic relationships as romantic ones - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9237575/chapters/20949500][this]] Voltron fic.

Do you know of any fics that subvert the trope, or that have platonic soulmates as well?
