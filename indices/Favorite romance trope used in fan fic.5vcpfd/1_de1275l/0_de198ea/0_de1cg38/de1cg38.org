Hmm this is a big question!

My favourite soulmate fics are ones where a) the 'soulmate' thing is discovered in an interesting way (names or symbols or important words appearing on your body, one where anything that happened to your skin happened to theirs (bruises, drawing, etc), stuff like that), and then b) the characters are resistant to it - though I read a lot of Dramione and Flintwood and other rare pairs where they don't like each other.

Then it's kind of this process of, why is it you, why are we compatible, do we have to follow along with fate, can we ignore this, and THEN you get to the good character/relationship building stuff! I agree, it can definitely be a case of "oh okay well guess we're in love now" but I much prefer when it explores the situation more fully and develops the characters to a point where they DO like each other and ARE happy with it. Does that make sense?

Like, I like them for the same reason I like (some) marriage law fics or soul bond fics and stuff like that - I like the idea of two people who are determined by the "fates" or the powers that be to be together but they aren't necessarily buying it, and they have to learn about each other and then they realize it was good all along.

Not for everyone, for sure!
