I don't mind if the soul bond is basically the central part of the story. But I hate when I'm reading a story and they've well established the relationship and then the author throws in the soul bond when it wasn't needed at all. I sometimes check out here because it signifies there will be no relationship drama to come and the couple will be perfect here on out. I like when relationships have drama.
