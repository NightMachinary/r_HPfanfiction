Same here, I prefer when it's an accidental bond. I love Hermione paired with older guys, especially grey or dark characters, so it works especially well in those fics. I also don't care if it's very AU and if some characters are a bit OOC, so as long as the story is good and funny and has the characters I like, I'll read it. That one is good example of what I'm talking about :
