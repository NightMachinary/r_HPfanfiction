  Post-Avengers. Nick Fury gives back the Tesseract to Thor, claiming that humanity is not ready for that kind of power. In exchange, Odin banishes Loki on Earth until the Bifrost regenerates itself. He is to help S.H.I.E.L.D. repair the damage he has caused. If he does not comply, he will be stripped of his immortality. Meanwhile, Darcy Lewis is in desperate need of a job.

  Darcy Lewis never imagined she'd be living in a house trailer in the New Mexico desert with the God of Thunder and his sociopath brother, but she's making the best of the situation. Until a frozen corpse shows up on the front porch. Casting herself as amateur sleuth, she embarks on a journey that will challenge her definitions of good, evil, love and what it is to be human.
