Here's the one I was talking about : [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3928408/chapters/8798995]] (now that I have it open in a tab, I'll read it again... I seriously can't get enough of it)

From the same author I also liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/267259]] , it's mostly smut and funny situations.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2369780/chapters/5233052]] That one was great too, no magic/no avengers AU, with a rock star Loki.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1929780/chapters/4167267]] That one too !

Other author, [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/409695]] The second part is unfinished, unfortunately, but the first one is the best and I hoped the 2nd one would go in a different direction so it's not such a big loss for me (I read it when the second part wasn't out, IIRC).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2111391/chapters/4605813]] This one I only read about half, but I like the trope, it's basically "Loki is on probation on earth and Darcy has to teach him how to act human". I can't recall the titles of the others of that trope I read, but I like it, although I find that the fics are often too long (or more exactly, they get together too fast, and the rest is a bit boring).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3203834/chapters/6967478]] That one is great, the second part I didn't finish yet. AU no magic, very hot :)

You'll have realized that I don't care that much for the Marvel stories, just their characters. I'm not a huge fan of the MCU, I don't remember all the details from the movies and never read the comics, so it reflects in what I read. But I really love that pairing, I love Loki (when he's mostly good, but conflicted, perfect for nice hurt/comfort/mischief stories), and I hate to break already well established couples/don't want him to be paired with Sif or another asgardian, so Darcy's perfect for the job. Plus she can be hilarious and super bossy, great for that pairing !

(I also gave you more than just the one I was talking about, since you're interested :) )
