It's not HP, but if you like the MCU there's a short Darcy/Loki fake dating fic that you'll love, I can find it for you when I'm home if you want. It's seriously the hottest fic of that trop I have ever read, I read it every few months and I'm still in love with it.

Otherwise, excellent choice of tropes ! Especially the enemies things (but no slash for me).

I also have a Lucius/Hermione where he keeps noticing her, but he wants to make her date Snape (AU 20+ years post war). Hilarious and hot, IIRC.
