I know they mention social clubs like Gobstone Club and stuff, but my head canon has always expanded on that and added Latin, Deulling, Potions, etc Clubs for students to socialize and interact with others who are interested in their favorite subjects. It makes sense that so many extracurricular activities were cancelled bc of dangerous events, but I wish she would have mentioned them more. I can definitely see an emphasis on interhouse stuff like school dances being more important post-Voldemort.
