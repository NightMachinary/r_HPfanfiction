I guess my romantic trope is a couple in a long distance relationship who haven't seen each other in a long time finally meet again and run up to each other and kiss and aaaah

So... it's not really a trope, but more of my favorite romantic scenerio, you feel me?

This happens a lot in Older!Harry/Fleur stories where Harry and Fleur are dating pre- Goblet of Fire, so when Beubaxtons arrives at Hogwarts there's this big romantic scene between the two.
