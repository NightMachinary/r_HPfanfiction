Arranged marriage-- huge Dramione shipper and "A Dowry of a Single Galleon" by Bunney got me started. Not the greatest, but it was okay for my first Dramione fic. Then I read "Dragon's Bride" by Rizzle and that blew me away.

Sidenote: any other great Dramione fic recs? I feel like I've read them all tbh. I've also read some Hermione/Snape as well as Hermione/Harry.
