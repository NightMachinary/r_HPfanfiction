- Hurt/comfort - Just, supportive relationships?! With some romances I see, I get that you would kill for each other, but?? Are you?? Even friends??
- Accidental dating - "I /like/ you." "I'd hope so; we've been dating for nearly a month."
- Forced bed sharing/cuddling for warmth - Physical intimacy!
- Secret identities - When characters don't know who each other are, so they share information that they wouldn't typically share un-anonymously.
- Enemies to Friends to Lovers - But I don't usually like the characters being attracted to each other when they don't like each other [and especially when they don't respect each other] on an emotional level? I think it's a lot more interesting to see characters from complete disgust with each other to establishing an emotional connection to attraction. I mean, there's not one singular hot person in the world, so if you don't like this person emotionally, why don't you go make out with someone else?
