My fic explores this concept (sorry for the shameless self-promo). It is a Fifth Year fic (sorry if that's not exactly what you're looking for...I wasn't sure if you only wanted post-war fics). It's never explicitly stated, but Harry has a lot of symptoms of PTSD, both because of Voldemort's return and his generally terrible childhood.
