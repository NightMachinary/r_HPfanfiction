Well, it's an important element of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (hence the name). Unfortunately incomplete and FFN took it down, but really well written IMO, with a careful balance of Harry having foreknowledge vs the butterfly of doom keeping things unpredictable, and focused on the characters so it's not a power fantasy.
