There are mentions of it in "The Purpose of Wings." Post-War, Harry and Fleur are parents but Harry struggles with PTSD pretty believably. Like flashes of green flames from a cauldron causing him to lash out and have a panic attack. It isn't a major theme but woven into the romance, as in, Fleur - his wife - helping calm him.

I'd second the Inner Demon rec too.
