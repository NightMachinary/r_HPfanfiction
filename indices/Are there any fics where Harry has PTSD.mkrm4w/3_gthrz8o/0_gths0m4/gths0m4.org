  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1, 2 complete

  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.
