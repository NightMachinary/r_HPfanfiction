I think I'm in the extreme minority, but I really liked the way werewolves were portrayed in the Twilight movies (and probably the books, though I haven't read them). Minus any a/b/o aspects.

In general I like all creature fics (that don't include strong a/b/o apects); from a really young age I am fascinated by the thought of turning into an animal or another race.
