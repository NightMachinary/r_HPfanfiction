Twilight with mates O/A/B.

JK, I like them like in canon well enough, but I'd rather some more bonuses and more downsides as well. In canon it only seems as if he ages a lot faster (quite the heavy downside, but magicals have longer life, so idk. Dippet was 300+ yo)

I like the idea of a magical genetic infection. Because then it can mutate. And then shit happens.
