I like to think it depends of the werewold, and how he deal with his curse. From one side you would have people like Remus, who "fight" the curse and want to stay as human as possible, these werewold would be no different to other people (except the whole transformation into in a monster thing, and the fatigue it cause I guess). From the other you would have people like Greyback, who consider Lycanthropie as a gift, and do their best to "accept" the best. These one may have some difference like enhanced senses or strenght, though I think these upgrade should be barely noticeable (both because if not, people should want to become a werewold, and because Greyback was supposed to be the most powerfull werewold in Britain, who completely accepted his curse, yet he didn't seem to be that different from other wizards, hygiene aside).
