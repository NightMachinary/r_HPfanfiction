All curse, all side effects, no advantages. Any and all advantages seen in werewolves would be strictly due to the individual werewolfs' efforts to cope with their situation.

Werewolves are usually outcasts. Recall that Lupin was the only known werewolf student at Hogwarts. Werewolves that are bit as children are most likely denied an education, and wands. They would still have their magic, and they would have some idea that they are supposed to be able to make impossible things happen, but they wouldn't be able to intuit their way to a full education, not by themselves, and not without a wand. Children taken by Greyback are probably lucky to work out how to consistently make even a dozen spells happen for them, vs the thousands that a Hogwarts graduate knows.
