I would be hesitant in involving occlumency in anything involving the animagus transformation since it happens to be such a /human/ skill, what with all the emotional control and clear mind thingy. It seems kinda counterintuitive to an animal's natural /wildness/.

The cure shouldn't be simply becoming an animagus in the normal/standard way or it would've been discovered already. Have it be something that somehow settles the werewolf into a wolf animagus /only/.
