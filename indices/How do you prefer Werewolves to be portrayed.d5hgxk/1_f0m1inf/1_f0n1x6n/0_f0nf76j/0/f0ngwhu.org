you could also go for a "cure", or permanent wolfsbane;

Wolfsbane actually redirects the command-connection to the human him/herself, so the cure comes from creating a variation of the Wolfsbane that records this command-connection to an object (maybe as Thought/pensive-liquid)... which one then connects to a Artifact^{charmed, enchanted whatever} that automatically links the connection back to the human.

So there, a permanent wolfsbane... or slave collar.
