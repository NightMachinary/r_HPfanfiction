If I were to accept this headcannon, I would remove the "didn't work" part.

The curse itself was very effective, it bound the subjects sanity/will to the Dark Lord while transformed. (at least on a basic level, where the beast was happy&fine with taking (simple) orders from the Dark Lord)

The problem cropped up when the Dark Lord was defeated or died of old age... the curse's subjects no longer had anybody controlling them so they fell back on instincts which had been tampered with to remove that pesky human unwillingness to kill others.
