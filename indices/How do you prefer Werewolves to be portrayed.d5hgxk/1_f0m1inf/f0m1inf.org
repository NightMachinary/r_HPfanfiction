My headcanon if you'd like to have it:

Werewolves were initially created as a perversion of the animagus ritual by a dark wizard who wanted an army of powerful wolf animagi who were suborned to his will and who spread the curse through bites, thus growing the army under his control. The only thing that worked as he intended was the means of spreading the curse and their tendency to attack humans; the Werewolves could only transform on the full moon, they had no choice or control over the matter and were mindless murderous monsters during that time (until Wolfsbane came along). They are normal humans otherwise though the curse takes a toll on their health.
