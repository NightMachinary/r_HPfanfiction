Maybe this is just my weird interpretation of the thing, but how I see it is that the enhancement to the senses referred to in the opening post is only applicable to the transformed form.

So for one night a month, you have enhanced senses(ambivalent on strength enhancement, but I'm willing to accept it)...but the tradeoff is that for that entire night, you're basically a mindless, feral monster carrying what basically amounts to incurable magic rabies.
