So I've hella enjoyed a /lot/ of different ways to portray werewolves, but my personal favorite is as a chronic health condition that needs careful management, is a remarkable pain in the ass at times, but does come with a couple of unexpected benefits (if you can manage to leverage them, that is).

I generally prefer something along the lines of a pack dynamic making for a less painful lead up to the moon and a less painful transformation (see, Fenrir Greyback not demonstrating any of the chronic pain and fatigue that Remus does). I also personally headcanon that the more in shape and physically active the human side is, the less the transformation hurts because there is less need to create muscle from magic and because the human body is in better condition to be super active all night (ie, an athlete who spends all night running will be kinda sore and very tired, a couch potato will probably hurt themselves if they have to do that with no warmup).

The drawbacks are obvious - you have to adjust your whole life to accommodate for the curse, whether it's because you reject it and your body is thus constantly under strain or because you embrace it and therefore /have to/ keep up a heavy exercise routine, whether you like it or not, and lean into the connections with your pack in ways non-werewolves wouldn't. Extra sensitive senses aren't a pure bonus either - sensory overload is a thing in humans, so having sharper senses just exacerbates that and means you have to learn to handle things that most people wouldn't think twice about so you don't melt down from too much sensory input.
