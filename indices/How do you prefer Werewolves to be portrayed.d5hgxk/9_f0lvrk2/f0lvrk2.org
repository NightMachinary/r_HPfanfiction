Either can be well written, but I generally prefer both - werewolves having some sort of advantage over magical humans but it's also a curse. I think there are so many fun ideas that could come out of it.

For example, marginalized and non marginalized werewolf communities based on country/laws/culture.

Squibs becoming werewolves willingly so they can make something of their lives.

Fics with a strong werewolf/nonhuman faction - to this date I have yet to read a fic where a werewolf faction is truly strong. And i don't mean just as a part of Voldemort's army or whatever, but strong with real negotiating power and things.
