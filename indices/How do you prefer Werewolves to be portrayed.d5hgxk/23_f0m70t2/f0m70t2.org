As prefer them to act like the pack from Twilight. If you haven't seen the series then you should know that the pack are different from the typical werewolf. They are more like native american skin changers in the way that their wolf transforming ability is genetic controlled ability passed down by birth and not by the typical werewolf bite. They basically change into over sized wolves rather than the weird humanoid wolves seen in Harry Potter. They can change any time they want and aren't pulled by the full moon. They have a pack mentality and can talk through their connected minds even while transformed. They all have a temper but at the end of the day they are a pack and the pack protects each other.
