Personally, I want for werewolves, at least in HP stuff, to be perfectly normal human beings when they aren't transformed, who just happen to be in a lot of pain for a few days after each full moon. Honestly, and I couldn't for the life of me tell you why, people portraying werewolves as having enhanced strength or senses is one of the fastest ways to get me to nope out of a story, particularly if it's to the point where they can smell emotions.
