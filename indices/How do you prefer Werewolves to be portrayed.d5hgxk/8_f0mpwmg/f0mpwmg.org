  Do you like them to have enhanced senses and strength or do you prefer it to be an actual curse?
#+end_quote

I'd say both. It /is/, as I see it, an actual curse, but the nocturnal nature of it means that enhanced sight, smell, and hearing - particularly at night - come with the territory. Might seem like perks, except for the part about being a feral, basically mindless monster all night(unless the Wolfsbane Potion is taken).

It's been a while since I read /PoA/, but I seem to recall the same thing as well.
