Merciless killers, monsters to be hunted down who regularly attack innocent people (while transformed). Not cute and fluffy, horrible beasts with are one of the worst thing which could happen to a village/region. I even dig them plundering graves. Which is their most common representation in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf#Folk_beliefs][European folklore]]. Wolves used to be the worst natural enemy of humans and that fear manifested in the werewolf belief (what's worse than a wolf? One that can disguise itself as a human).

Lupin is the exception in canon, Greyback gets entire packs to join Voldemort in his fight. And given what else was on Voldemort's agenda, the willingness of the werewolves to make common cause says enough about what kind of people they were.
