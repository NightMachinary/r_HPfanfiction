Hate to call on Rowling's trend for Revisionist History, but I'm pretty sure she thought of the alligory way after she made Lupin. She said it was an alligory in 2016, when the last book came out in 2007... and PoA was still decidedly written for children, not young adults who would appreciate that direct reference. Remus Lupin (Wolf Wolf) was just a werewolf because that's interesting and cool, and he was marginalized because it makes sense and is interesting.
