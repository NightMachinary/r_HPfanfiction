I don't think enhanced strength is a good idea, it quickly would start breaking the world, just like a vastly enhanced sense of smell - Giving werewolfness redeeming or abusable traits runs counter to what I imagine it to be.

What I do like are little annoying quirks that remind the human of his affliction; like weird taste in food and odd judgement of smell in general. My dog hates the smell of lemon, thyme, coconut shampoo.. - But the rotting mouse she found? Oh yes, let me get all over that!

It adds a layer of otherness without going overboard.
