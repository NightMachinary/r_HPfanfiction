it hugely depends on the story itself. Give me an explanation and a fitting story and it doesnt matter how they are portrayed. As this tribe of wolfmen just giving in to their animalistic nature? Alphas, Betas and so on? Sure. If its portrayed well.

Basically superhuman who, with enough mindpower, can overpower the wolf and suffer no consequences? if you must... but only if you can explain why not all of the high ranking wizards go the wolf route.
