I don't remember the summary at all.

Other pieces I can remember: Severus, still wandless, had to fight off a hag (or maybe a banshee?). Dumbles threatened to expell H if she left the castle. H made some sort of tracking device to find Snape (blood or hair plus map, maybe?)

It was medium-length, for fanfiction.

I wish I could remember something unique to the story.
