I find the fic Harry Potter and The International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Casuality to be a well written, interesting, and original harem fic. 450k words long and still being updated. Has drama, suspense, a looming threat, and best of all a harem that doesn't fall into all of the harem troupes.

I would also really recommend it. I'd also recommend Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches- Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE as an outstanding fic even if you don't like harems or time travel. Nearing on 650k words and still being updated.

So there you go. Two harem fics I would recommend as some of the best Harry Potter fics out there.
