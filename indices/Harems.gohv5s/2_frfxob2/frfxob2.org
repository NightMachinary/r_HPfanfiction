  Will be there anybody admitting to like harem-based stories?
#+end_quote

Sure, I will admit to such thing.

But seriously, what kind of question is that? You formulated that as if people have problems admitting to something trivial and mild like that on the internet. And looking at the absolutely insane click/view counts harem themed fics get, I am probably not alone. I don't read them that often.

That said, I haven't found any harem stories I would recommend in a "Show me your favorite/best fics", they mostly spring from horny males that are writing for the fun of it, not because they are good writers. And that usually shows. But I mean, most harem fics are smut, and I usually don't expect high class prose when I am trawling Ao3 for some smut to read. Sure, it would be great to have well written smut, but it is very rare. Only one that instantly comes to mind now that I think about it is "It Could Only Happen to Harry" over on ffnet.

And the question you asked about there being anything interesting there, only you can answer that for yourself. If you don't like it by now, it sounds like you tried multiple times, just give up and avoid it. For example, I recently tried a fic with the mpreg trope again. But I had the same results as the last time I tried it, I really, really don't like it. So I simply decided to avoid that in the future.
