You know, I can only recall one harem fic I've read that I would call outright smut, but then I haven't read very many harem fics..

Of course, my definition of harem seems to be different from some others. Someone said /n/>1 girlfriends but I'd say a harem has to be at least /n/>2. To me, 2 girlfriends is a ménage à trois, not a harem...
