There is no such things as Harems. There's only a perfectly wholesome if somewhat kinky relationship with a metamorphmagus, who likes to take different shapes.

It might be difficult to catch unto it, I know, since the authors usually go to masterful lengths to make it very subtle.

You can however spot it by looking at how the 'harem' members act, instead of how they look. Once you look closely at their behavior you will notice, that it's the same woman every time.

Oh sure, sometimes the personas do have differences, but if you look even closer you'll see it's just the usual basic -dere archetypes.

This is called roleplaying.

"But how, dear Triflez, could that possibly be?" I could hear you ask. "I have seen two or more harem members in the same scene."

To which I say this and only this.
