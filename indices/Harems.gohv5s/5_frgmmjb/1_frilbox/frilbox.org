The ending was ok, even tho the "ironic" "have the bad guy be killed by a muggle accident" was nothing new, even back then.

It was more the inconsistent characterization and countless plotholes that made me dislike the story. But I guess it was pretty early in your writing, almost 11 years ago now, and it has gotten better over time.
