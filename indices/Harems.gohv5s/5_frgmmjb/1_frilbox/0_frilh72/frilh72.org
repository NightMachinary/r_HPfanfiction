That wasn't the complaint I got. Dumbledore actually being Flamel and Tom being 'forced' to be a bad guy was what everyone bitched about.

And no one liked Tom's Teeshirt, which amused the hell out of me.

There are a lot of things I would do differently. For example, it wasn't until I had posted the 3rd chapter that I realized I'd left out the section about Harry being obliviated multiple times before he signed the marriage contracts.

I've left it, because I hate live stories being 'rewritten', mostly because they rarely improve the story and usually open more plot holes than the rewrite closes.
