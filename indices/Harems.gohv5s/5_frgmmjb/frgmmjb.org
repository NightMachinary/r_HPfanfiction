A well-written smut story is a joy to behold, but when you start needing a scorecard to keep track of precisely who is currently worshiping Harry's massive dick, well, that's not a well-written story, now is it?

Now, I don't personally believe that a voluntary Harem could exist. The interpersonal bullshit that every person generates makes relationships with two people chancy at best, (well, maybe three with an especially accepting group) moving to multiples where everyone needs a nametag to keep track of who is who seems extremely unlikely.

So, I decided to make fun of them.

I dialed up the Old Manipulative Dumbledore to 11, picked 4 girls (one from each house, to 'Unite the Houses') trying to make sure that they were not the usual suspects... Other than Susan Bones, mostly because I like what others have done with her and wanted to play with my own version of her, and decided to make Tom Riddle out to be Not the Badguy.

It was fun. It was, for me amusing, and everyone hated my ending.

Ah well, as the great sage Ricky Nelson taught us, "You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself". Words to live by.
