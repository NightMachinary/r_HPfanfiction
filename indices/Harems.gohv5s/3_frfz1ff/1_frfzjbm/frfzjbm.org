  for a serious, plot driven story including a harem, I imagine you would either have to be understanding, or actually into polyamory yourself to not be put off by it.

Yeah, but really, how many people in TRW do that? And that Vanishing Cabinet has almost 4k reviews ... and I am not a great expert on smut, but I think in terms of porn it is pretty bad story, because there is too much actual story and character buildings (actually, so far there is no smut at all, and I've finished somewhere in the middle).
