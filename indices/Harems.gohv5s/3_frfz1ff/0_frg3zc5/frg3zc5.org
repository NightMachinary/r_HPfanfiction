I feel like most people who are into legitimate polyamory would be likely to hate harems the most. Healthy polyamory looks nothing like a harem fic. Harem fics are just about walking & talking blow up dolls, with different hair colors and slight variations on their unrealistic bust sizes, being obsessed with Harry.
