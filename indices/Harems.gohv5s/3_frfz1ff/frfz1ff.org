the way I see it, harems primarily exist for the purpose of smut with multiple girls.

for a serious, plot driven story including a harem, I imagine you would either have to be understanding, or actually into polyamory yourself to not be put off by it.

it would also require an author who is understanding of it too, so that the story isn't just plot with random sex scene with harem girl #7 stuck in the middle of the chapter.
