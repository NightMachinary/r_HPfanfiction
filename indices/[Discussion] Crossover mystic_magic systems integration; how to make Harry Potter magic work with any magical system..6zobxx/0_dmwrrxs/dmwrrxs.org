The main approach I use is to not overthink it. Usually it can be done quite simply if you simply adapt, rather than try and force it together.

Wen you overthink it, you end up with bad things like "true wizards" in the Denarian trilogy, which is one of my favorites, but the blending of the 2 systems was atrocious. Or, it ends up like Awaken Sleeper, where Harry dreams of all these magical things, wakes up and learns that it wasn't, only to find out like 5 minutes later that magic is actually real, just not the way he dreamed it.
