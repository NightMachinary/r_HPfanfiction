The issue with harry Potter isnt that its strong, but that its strong with little to do to balance that strength. The best magical system ive came across has been from Mistborn. That system works on a checks and balances system with exceptions to nearly every rule out there but even those must have conditions.

Harry potter its point, intent, done. The only system close to that is super powers from marvel and DC, both of which i havent found a crossover that is terrible due to story. (grammar is another thing).

Now if i must cross over, i utilize the disadvantages of hp magic. Distance is a factor. After 100 yards no curse does more than a nose bleed unless you are really good with a wand. 300 yards? No dice period. This gives a spgere of influence that most other magic systems don't have, and it can be considered a weakness.

Another idea is buffing other magics. For example, inheritance's magical systems only weakness is the direct tie between magic and life energy. (and knowledge) however, if you make a character an anomaly or find a way around this, much like how paloni did it in-universe, you have a compariable system. Say, intend, done.
