Magical resistance is one option, and so are having the occasional godlike entities to balance things out.

You'll also notice that magical combat in Harry Potter is limited, almost exclusively, to face-to-face magical combat. An excellent balancing act is to crossover with a magical system that doesn't need your opponent to look you in the eyes to kill you. In the Dresden Files, given enough time and preparation, there is very little to limit what a wizard can accomplish beyond the fetters of his own belief in what he can do. In the very first book of the series, someone manages to kill people by ripping the hearts out of their chest while an entire city or more away. Another wizard pulls a satellite down from orbit in order to kill some people that pissed him off. There isn't a lot Harry Potter wizards can do to stop that, apart from maaaybe holing up under a Fidelius and a lot of wards and hoping a turbocharged blood curse won't find you and kill your entire family. If your opponent is smart, (s)he won't give you enough warning to do that. And really, that situation doesn't change much in the 'Files; those wizards can kick ass from halfway around the planet, but most of them suffer from considerable disadvantages in direct combat, which is where HP wizards would shine. Each system has their own strength.

I think Steelbadger has done the best power-balancing act by simply /taking away Harry's wand/ when he ends up in Middle-Earth.
