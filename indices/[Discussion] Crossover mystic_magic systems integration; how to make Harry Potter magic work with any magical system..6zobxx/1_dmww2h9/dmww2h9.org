Your idea of HP magic reminds me of an idea I had a while back that had the magic system for HP basically work the same way as Ork technology from Warhammer 40k (it's all scrap basically, but it works because they all believe it does).

In truth, everyone on the planet generates a low-level psychic field, even the muggles, but it's too low-power for it to do anything. Witches and wizards generate a stronger field, and that power is partially split. Part of it goes into their own spellcasting, and part of it follows their subconscious. What this means is that people who have confidence, a drive to succeed and believe in themselves can generally cast magic easier because more of their own personal field is focused inwards on their own spellcasting. As other witches and wizards with less drive for success see these people growing stronger, casting more easily, more effortlessly and at a higher level, the small, subconscious part of their fields go into the target of their admiration's power, making them ever-so-slightly stronger. This works with negative connotations as well.

And this is how powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort arise to be stonkingly more powerful than anyone else in the series. They are believed to be strong, powerful wizards by the populace, so their subconscious belief makes it true. Powerful feats of magic such as wandless casting are believed to be the sole domain of strong spellcasters, so the more someone believes in them, the more of these feats they can replicate.

Dumbledore setting up as the Headmaster of Hogwarts was a masterstroke: it's why he declines the Minister of Magic position. He can make every single magical child in Britain believe in his power: not even the sheer amount of fear and horror Voldemort inspires can overcome Dumbledore's power, so that's why Dumbledore is still stronger. On the other hand, Voldemort had a genius idea of his own: the Death Eater mask and robes as a standard for his followers. People don't fear Avery, Lestrange, etc, most might not have even known the names until after the first wizarding war ended. However, everyone knew of and feared the black-robed men and women in the night, their silver masks glinting green from the onslaught of death they spewed from their wands. Voldemort's followers would have become much more powerful, but only when they were in their Death Eater regalia (and thus acting on his explicit instructions). Naturally, he lets them believe their increase in strength is from the Dark Mark (and thus his own power) to make him stronger off their belief.

This magic system does have a few holes in it. I can't think of a way to explain muggleborn, save as a cop-out-y answer of muggles whose psychic field was just strong enough to manifest magic of its own. Accidental magic would also be a problem, but one that could be solved by saying that working magic and spellcasting requires at a bare minimum internal belief to work. External belief is merely a bonus and can't prop someone up on its own. Because the subconscious field works to bring into reality what you believe (not necessarily make someone stronger), it can also stifle a magical person's own power (for example, if their parents didn't believe in them) and then you get squibs from high-pressure, high-society pureblood families, or from people who have too little self-worth to believe they are capable of anything. As a side note, this system would mean that wands, crystal balls and every magical aide are merely there as a crutch for people's magic: they believe they help, that they need a wand to use magic, and so they /do/. The system unfortunately doesn't satisfactorily explain extremely powerful yet (mostly) forgotten magical artifacts such as the Mirror of Erised, the Resurrection Stone or Gryffindor's Sword.

On the munchkinry side, this system can be easily exploited by anyone with a severe lack of morals. Simply kidnap, breed and raise a population of magical people, keep them brainwashed and indoctrinated from birth, using House Elves that will only feed them if they worship the Great Undying God Voldemort before each meal. Set this up in a magically expanded and warded space somewhere it won't be found/missed (in a desert in Africa or something) and you've got yourself a massive power farm that will keep you strong no matter what.

Come to think of it, that's what a Horcrux could be: the imprisoned soul of the person you murdered to create it, brainwashed into believing with all their (remaining being) for all eternity that you are immortal and cannot be killed.

Maybe I should write something about this one day.
