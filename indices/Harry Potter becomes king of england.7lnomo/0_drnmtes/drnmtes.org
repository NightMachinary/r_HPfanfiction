FYI the Kingdom of England ceased to exist in 1707 when England and Scotland merged to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, which in turn was replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, which was itself replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1922.

The 1707 date is interesting as it is also the date of the founding of the Ministry for Magic.
