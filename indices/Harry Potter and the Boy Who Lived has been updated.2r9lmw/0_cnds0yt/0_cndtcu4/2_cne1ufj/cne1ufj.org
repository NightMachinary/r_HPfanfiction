The author's work is posted in a private venue and you want someone to take it and make it public without his consent.

Further, the author already has a public version of the work, which he posts at his own timetable, implying that he makes a clear distinction between the two. By posting the work publicly before the author did so themselves you would be supplanting the official version with your own publication.

And you can't see how this would be a faux pas?
