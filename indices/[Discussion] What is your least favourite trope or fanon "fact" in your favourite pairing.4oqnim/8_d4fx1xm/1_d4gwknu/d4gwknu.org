You know I've never really enjoyed James/Lily fics, and I think you've super clearly pointed out why. I can't stand fanon Lily or James, but your canon characterizations sound normal and awesome. Let me know when you find a Marauders era fic that doesn't turn Lily into a Harpy or James into a socially oblivious stalker.
