That's a fair point, but most authors get caught up making a 67 chapter book 1 rewrite and burn themselves out. Then I've invested in all their character development for nothing. If an author managed to edit their story and progresses through the younger years at a good pace, that's fine... it's just very rare, and my compromise is to read fics where the characters start out at a readable age.

It's also personal preference to a point... I'm 26, and I hate poorly written fanfiction 11-17 year old kids. I'd rather read about the characters in their 20s because I'm in my 20s.
