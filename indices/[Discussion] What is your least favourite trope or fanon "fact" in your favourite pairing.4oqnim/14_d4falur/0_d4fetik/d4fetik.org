On Harry/Tonks, yeah. "I want you to look like your natural form, no changes" smacks a lot to me of "Take yer gurl swimmin on furst date heh heh gurls lie" shenanigans, and somehow this makes the most legitimately punk-rock woman in the Potterverse swoon? "Look however you want; I'll like you just the same" would be better.

I think, when I write Tonks into my ongoing fic, that she'll have a reputation for responding to people who demand she become her "natural self" by morphing into a psuedoprotoplasmic ooze beast, something like a [[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG126.jpg][Gibbering Mouther]] or a [[http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG33.jpg][Chaos Beast]], and chanting about the Black Goat of the Woods With A Thousand Young and the imminent cleansing of humanity's scourge from the earth.

Because that sounds more like Tonks to me than swooning.
