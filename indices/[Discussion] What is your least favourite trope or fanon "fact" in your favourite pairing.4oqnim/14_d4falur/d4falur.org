I have several pairings I like (some just for their potential), so here goes.

Harry / Tonks: Harry preferring her "actual" form. For starters, I dislike the notion that metamorphs /have/ a default form. But what I dislike most is that this is somehow the key to her heart. I can sometimes forgive this one if the rest of the fic is good, but some are just unbearable.

Harry / Hermione: 1) Harry dating his walking library, whom also took on the personality of a wooden bookshelf after becoming his girlfriend. 2) Dating Harry suddenly makes Hermione into the second coming of Merlin and Dumbledore. edit: Almost forgot: Harry and Hermione can only be together if the rest of the world is a cancerous cesspool of sloppy intrigue.

Harry / Fleur: "No reaction to allure = perfect soulmate forever" Its biology, dear reader. Veelas have no personality, desires or dreams next to them being Veelas.

Bellatrix / Hermione: Hardcore BDSM fantasies disguised as fics.

Harry / Bellatrix: The formula: Bellatrix = Hermione - Morals. If you write Bella, +give her at least a bit of crazy+ give her a lot of crazy.

Harry / Susan: Susan "I'm Amelia, but young" Bones. Seriously, if you make her a carbon copy of her aunt, let Harry date the aunt. Time Travel. Its not so far out there when it comes to FF tropes. I have another problem with this trope and its the "hyperfluffy" Susan. There are some fics out there where she reads like a human carebear, hell bent on snuggling all those baddy emotions out of Harry.

Harry / multi: Its an Ecchi. Tsundere, Yandere, Kuudere and Dandere included. "B-Baka, Harry-sama" she said blushing. Also: Harry gets a weekly supply of every porn tag imaginable, from Narcissa "the MILF" Malfoy, to Gabrielle "the jailbait" Delacour.
