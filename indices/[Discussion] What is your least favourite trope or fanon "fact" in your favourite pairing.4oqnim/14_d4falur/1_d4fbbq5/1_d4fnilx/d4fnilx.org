  Given she changes her hair color regularly, it seems to me to be no leap in logic to assume she might change her appearance in other ways. I don't know why people throw such a fit over it.

I get where they're coming from. Saying that you like a girl just the way she is, is pretty sweet, isn't it? So it /gotta/ be sweet to say to someone who can literally look however she wants. At least that is the logic I suspect behind it.

My personal bit of headcanon is that metamorphs literally don't have a default form. They come out of the womb, changing their appearance by the second. Their body forms with a image of self developing and eventually Tonks ends up looking like she does. I even wrote in one of my fics once that asking a metamorph for his or her true form is really offensive.
