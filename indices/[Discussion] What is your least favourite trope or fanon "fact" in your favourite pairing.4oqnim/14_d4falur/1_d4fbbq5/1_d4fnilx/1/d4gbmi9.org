I have to half-disagree. We see Tonks's hair turn a normal brown when she's depressed in HBP, and her heart-shaped face is pretty consistent. We don't know for sure if this is a default form, but I think it's implied. My headcanon is that metamorphs have an approximate default form, and it gets harder to maintain forms that are more and more different.

I feel like the whole "natural form" thing grew out of her portrayal in HBP, where she's much less punk-rock, but it does annoy me. I think OoTP!Tonks would more likely tolerate boys who ask for her natural form, walk out on boys who ask her to look like a specific person, and like it if they were actually creative.
