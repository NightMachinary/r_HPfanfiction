Drarry (especially in fics that take place "8th year" and on): Malfoy was nice all along/shows no part of him trying to reconcile for his wrongdoings or mental anguish. I believe he has the potential in him for good (as do most drarry shippers) but he was an awful bully in his Hogwarts days.

Wolfstar (during Hogwarts): Sirius and James friendship neglected for Sirius and Remus to be the closer friends (unless they are already together, or they are hiding the fact that they are close friends.)

While both of these can be done well, they are characterization issues that I see pop up a lot.
