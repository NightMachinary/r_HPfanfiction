  Drarry (especially in fics that take place "8th year" and on): Malfoy was nice all along/shows no part of him trying to reconcile for his wrongdoings or mental anguish

This is the worst. I think it's probably why I prefer my ship fics to be older characters in their 20s or 30s, especially for probably-not-realistic-pairings like HP/DM. Feasibly I could see character changes having taken place such that I can suspend my disbelief for those kinds of pairings if they're older and out of Hogwarts.

Probably also because I'm now in my mid-20s, and it's just weird for me to read about teen romance. Like [[/u/Taure]] is arguing, most teen romances do occur as written (immediately think they're in love, etc), but I just have no interest in reading about that...
