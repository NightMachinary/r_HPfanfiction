I think a lot of my issue with Remus pairings is that they tend to tone down his sarcasm, his ability to be a complete asshole, and also just his comfort with taking control of a situation and being the one in charge. Also, I feel that a lot of Wolfstar fics tend to imply that Sirius is the one with commitment issues, but from what we see in the series Remus is TERRIBLE at making commitments to... Well, anything.

I agree with [[/u/lazysloth1]] about graphic sex scenes with underage people - in my own fics, even though sex between characters is written in, I definitely don't go into the graphic details, and if characters aren't at least the legal age of 16 in a fic with smut I tend to get uncomfortable.
