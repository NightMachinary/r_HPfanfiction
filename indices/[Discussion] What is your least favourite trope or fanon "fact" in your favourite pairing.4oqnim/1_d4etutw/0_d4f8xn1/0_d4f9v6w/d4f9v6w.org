I actually don't mind 'feminization' as long as that female is awesome strong independent women. Liking 'girly' things like clothes or caring for others is fine. Being unable to use logic and fight back in any meaningful way is not. Really Harry, you don't want to even try and escape from that villain? You're just going to curl up in a corner and cry? Suddenly you can't even make snarky comments, you are just going angst and bemoan that everything is hopeless?
