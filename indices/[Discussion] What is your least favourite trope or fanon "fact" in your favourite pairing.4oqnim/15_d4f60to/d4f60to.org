Not referring to a specific pairing in particular, but reading graphic sex scenes that are happening in a story set during 4th or 5th year. Like, I know that there are some 14 and 15 year olds out there who are sexually active, but it makes for extremely uncomfortable reading for 21 year old me.

Oh, and for stories involving Hermione, I'm sick of authors white-washing her flaws and making her out to be super perfect. Hermione's bossy, a know-it-all, she can be domineering when she's convinced her way is right, which makes her such a good character; but I hate it when it's presented as something lovable and positive, thus turning her into a perfect person with zero flaws.
