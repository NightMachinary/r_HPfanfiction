Least favorite fact? That there's not enough of it. :{

I read a lot of Harry/Narcissa that has Narcissa exhibiting this super cunning epitome-of-slytherin attitude where she relentlessly takes advantage of poor, stupid, naive Harry. And that's all well and good, but now I want to read a fic where she's as in over her head as he is, even if she's had more time to come to terms with it.

Now that I think about it, I want to read about /Lucius/ being in over his head. He'd have his looks and his money, and be fairly business savvy, but not particularly cunning.
