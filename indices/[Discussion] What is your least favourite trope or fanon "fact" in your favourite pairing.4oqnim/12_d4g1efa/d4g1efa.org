I love Harry/Hermione, but I hate that there has to be something wrong with Ginny in order to get them together. She has to be evil potions Ginny, or she died in the chamber, or she's a slag whos lept with every boyfriend she had before Harry (and at least one while she was with Harry).

Why can't Hermione be good enough for Harry without sidelining Ginny somehow? She sidelines herself until 5th year, and even then she still barely says anything directly to Harry!

note: I also love Ginny and prefer H/G/Hr, or harems in general because I'm just that greedy and none of the other guys are good enough for any girl at Hogwarts... except maybe Mili and Lavender.
