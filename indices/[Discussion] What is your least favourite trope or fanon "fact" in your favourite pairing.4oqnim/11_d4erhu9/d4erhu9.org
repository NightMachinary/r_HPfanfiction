I don't have a favorite pairing, but I have read quite a few Lucius/Hermione one-shots and a few multi-chapters, and most of them featured a saucy but inexperienced Hermione and a sex god Lucius. Actually, come to think of it, Lucius and Draco both get portrayed as sex gods a lot. I don't know, it's probably just me, but I think super suave, smug sex god characters are boring.
