One thing that annoys me within the TMR/HP pairing is the time travel trope, where Harry will go back in time to kill Tom. Leading up to this, you usually see a determined person, with a plan, who's on a mission. When Harry arrives in whatever time period that just goes right out the window and he swoons for Tom's pretty eyes.

In the HP/LV pairing, they'll usually get together due to the horcrux in Harry's head which lead to them having some sort of super connection (/gasp/ sometimes they discover that it was a soul bond covered up by Dumbledore.)\\
Other times, Harry will catch Voldemort's attention because of how powerful he is. He'll learn a shit ton of magic in a very short period of time which will put him on the same level as Voldemort. This one really annoys me because I feel like it dismisses the years of learning and searching that Voldemort did and makes him less of a dangerous, knowledgable super power. Additionally, during the time that Harry is learning all of this dark magic, his whole belief system will shift, and he'll reveal his hidden Slytherin side.
