The first part reminds me of my favorite Harry Potter/ Tom Riddle fanfic called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1231228/chapters/2524342][Word's fail!]] by NeaMarika. I think it's one of the best hp/tr fics out there tbh but it takes on these cliches as realistically as possible while attempting to humanize TR.
