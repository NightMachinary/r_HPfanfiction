I hate it when Harry is written as more studious, smarter and wiser than Hermione, reducing her to his moral support/love interest (and damsel in distress so he can save her). Stories where he lectures her about book knowledge, knows far more about magic than the poor stupid girl trusting the teachers, and invents new magic tend to grate on my nerves.
