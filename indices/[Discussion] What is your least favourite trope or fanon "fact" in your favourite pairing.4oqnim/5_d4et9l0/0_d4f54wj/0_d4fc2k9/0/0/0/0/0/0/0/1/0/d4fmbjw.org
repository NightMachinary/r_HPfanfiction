There's a lot about Prince of Slytherin that reminds me of HPMoR, in regards to the Slytherin hierarchies, the plots within plots (and they're not stupid!), the research teams make me think of the army battles, and so on.

Plus I'm not sure it is a true wbwl. I think now that the anomaly with Harry is due to something that happened July 31st. There is some evidence to suggest that Jim has some of that boy who lived weirdness going on when he comes into contact with Voldemort.
