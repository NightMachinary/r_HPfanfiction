Since HPMoR /still/ has not been referenced in this thread, either for bashing or lauding, I shall do the deed.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), Harry does start off lecturing Hermione, but we realize that she actually has much more common sense than he does. All-in-all it makes for an interesting rivalry.
