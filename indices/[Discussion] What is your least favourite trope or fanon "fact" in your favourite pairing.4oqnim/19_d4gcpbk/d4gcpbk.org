I would say 'lack of romantic tension' in Fleur/Hermione. There are a lot of stories that don't really seem to have a plan for where they're going, so the romance progresses quickly and smoothly in an extremely predictable manner. And once it has progressed to them sharing a bed, often in an incredibly short period of time, the author obviously has no idea where to go from there. So you just get... smutty fluff, chapter by chapter, ad nauseum. Given the previous lack of conflict in them hooking up, often by Veela bond or other twu wuv tropes, this smuff doesn't really have much impact, either. It's one thing if they've struggled for 150k words to get past each others' flaws and had numerous setbacks, and them having sex is the climax to the preceding tension. Often, though, there was no tension beforehand, so there's no payoff. Then, for whatever reason, they double down on the lack of payoff, and add even more fluff. It's... some combination of boring and sickening I can't quantify.

It's not just a F/Hr thing, but it's the pairing where I see this the most.
