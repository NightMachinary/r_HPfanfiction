I don't know about the Falcones, but I love the idea of mob daughter Hermione:

- Why is she so careful to follow rules and procedures? Because where she comes from, failing to gets you caught and jailed at best and tortured and murdered at worst.
- Learning about the mind arts and Memory Charms makes her alternately giddy and paranoid.
- A few days after Draco turns them in during the Norberta escapade, he's found beaten to a bloody pulp. A note is found next to him, which reads "snitches get stitches". Naturally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron all have ironclad alibis.
- Assuming she is still in Gryffindor and Draco still challenges Harry to a duel:

  "He's conning you, Harry. I'm not gonna let you go meet him."

  "What're you gonna do? Tell a prefect?"

  "What kind of person do you think I am, Ronald?!"
