/Day 14: Have found someone else's rudimentary encampment, mostly sod blocks to form shelter. Seems abandoned, will use as my base camp as it's readily defendable from the skeletons that arrive in the night. Adding arrow wound to list of grievances against whoever sent me here. At least I know a good recipe for mutton./
