heh, I've been debating a minecraft/HP story off an on, thinking I'll do it like my Cookbook of Doom story, updating whenever I feel like writing an entry instead of following any sort of update schedule.

Basically a 1st POV with Harry sent to the Minecraft'verse, he finds Steve's journal which is useful as it helps him figure out this weird blocky world and he explores it, trying to figure out what he has to do to get back or at least survive long enough for his friends to get him back.
