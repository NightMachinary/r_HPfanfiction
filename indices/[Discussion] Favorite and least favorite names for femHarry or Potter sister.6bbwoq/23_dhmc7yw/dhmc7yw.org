I like Holly best myself. Especially since that's their wand wood. I like Jasmine too.

As mentioned, a made up pureblood pretentious name would make me drop it.

I personally believe James named his son after his grandfather tho JK has not confirmed it. We don't know his wife's name though, nor Lily's gran's. They would never name a daughter Euphemia. I could see Effie, and Emmie. Perhaps Ellie, but I think it's too similar to Lily for them to use it.

I nope away from emo names. Gryffindors wouldn't name their daughter Raven. Wizards wouldn't choose ebony, they'd use Nigellus. Oh wait, they do.
