One I haven't seen on here yet is Gloria. Another name I have in mind is Terra. Terra Potter. Earth/World Shaper. Get it? Ok I'll stop.

One name I'm planning to use in a fic is Daffodil "I'm-not-a-fucking-flower" Potter, who prefers to use the nickname Daphne.

Otherwise I like the usual flower names; Jasmine, Iris, Rose, Hyacinth, and Holly.
