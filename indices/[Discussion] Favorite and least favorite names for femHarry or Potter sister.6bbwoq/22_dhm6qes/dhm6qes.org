I like names that start with an "H" because I don't have to remember who the fuck the main character is supposed to be the next time that I pick up the story.

Harriett is a perfectly acceptable name for a British witch, but there are other alternatives, like Holly or Henrietta, that have a similar feel to "Harry Potter." Violet would be one of the exceptions I'd make since it's more memorable than others I've seen/read, and not completely unbelievable or out of character.
