I like the flower theme. My favorite is probably 'Iris'. 'Rose' is kinda boring but acceptable and i generally dislike names starting with H because it just seems forced. Most parents don't pick potential names by the first letter and there's no reason to assume that Lily and James would have named a girl Hazel or Harriet or whatever, simply because they liked 'Harry' for a boy.

But really, it doesn't matter all that much. if your story is good i won't care about the name and if it's shit a name won't change anything.
