Honestly for the most part it doesn't really matter to me. But if I had to choose I would rather it be something simpler (i rather doubt a family that names a son Harry would name their daughter Acacia).

Harry is pretty consistently a top 20 common baby name throughout the 90s in the UK so I would choose something like that. Hannah is probably the most likely name if you wanted to stick with H, but holly consistently comes in the top 35 and Harriet comes in the top 60 of girls names
