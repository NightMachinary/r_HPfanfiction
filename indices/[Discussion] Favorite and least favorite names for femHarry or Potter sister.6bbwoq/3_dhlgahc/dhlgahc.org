Based on the flower theme, here's a list of some names I came up with after like 30 seconds of Googling. Which ones do you like best? Flower names:

Common: Iris, Violet, Rose, Ivy(not really a flower name?), Jasmine

Less common: Acacia, Amaryllis, Azalea, Camellia, Linnaea (flowers look kinda lame, imo), Primrose, Senna, Zinnia
