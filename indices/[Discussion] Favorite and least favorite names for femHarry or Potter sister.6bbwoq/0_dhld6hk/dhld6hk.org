I don't mind most believable names, i.e. names that fit into canon without standing out like sore thumbs. Flower names work really well for this, because there are so many other female characters with flower names.

Personally, I don't like super-pureblood-y names, because James and Lily Potter naming their daughter "Lacerta Vulpecula" breaks my suspension of disbelief. They didn't care about "traditions" when naming Harry, so why would they care when naming a potential daughter?

On the other hand, for a genderbent Harry, I like names that can be shortened to Harry. I just like the idea of a female Harry still going by Harry, even if it's overused and somewhat lazy.
