I actually like Harriet for female Harry. If Harry has been literally just genderswapped (as in, its the same character and the only thing different is that they're not a girl) then it makes sense so we can make the connection (or take note of the disconnection) between cannon Harry and the new Harriet.

As for other names for female!Harry or a sister, I really like Willow, Holly, and Wisteria.
