Pretty much Potions-based transfiguration. In canon (as with historical alchemy), it's primarily concerned with creating a Philosopher's Stone, which can Transfigure any metal into gold (which normal transfiguration cannot, presumably because it's an exception to Gamp's Law of Fundamental Transfiguration) and create Elixir of life.
