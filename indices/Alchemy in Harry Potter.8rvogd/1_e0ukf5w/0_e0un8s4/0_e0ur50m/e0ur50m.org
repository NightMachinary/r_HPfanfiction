  This, as a description of real, historical alchemy, is approximately as accurate as describing biology as being primarily concerned with placing organisms, by twos, into jars and observing which devours the other.

Your response annoys me a bit, as entertaining and informative as it is. The other goals you mentioned (the alkahest, the "great work") are nearly always connected with the creation of the Philosopher's Stone in alchemic discussions in European history, which was my point, as that's what HP draws on. The religious and mystic connections aren't really connected to HP.
