This, as a description of real, historical alchemy, is approximately as accurate as describing biology as being primarily concerned with placing organisms, by twos, into jars and observing which devours the other.

Harry Potter alchemy uses the 'philosopher's stone lets you make gold and live forever' version, but that's what three eleven-year-olds learn from a school library.

Venturing into a mix of headcanon and the actual, attested work of alchemists from 300CE onward, alchemy is the study of the change of substances from one to another - /cheirokmeta/ - the nature of substances, and the reflections of the spiritual in the material.

(To do this they had to discover a lot of chemistry, and also invent a lot of lab equipment. If you've ever used a bain-marie, it's named after the alchemist credited with inventing it, the woman only referred to as Mary The Jewess or Mary The Prophet. Although she wasn't credited with it until about a thousand years after she died, so your mileage may vary. She's the oldest known alchemist, and the alchemists liked to attribute their stuff to the Wisdom Of The Ancients, so quite a lot gets credited to her. The distillation apparatuses she designed are attributed a lot closer to her lifetime.)

So alchemy with real magic involved is the study of the exoteric and esoteric properties of matter and the reactions of substance with substance, effecting transmutation and transfiguration using, and giving rise to, the inherent magic of the universe as expressed in matter, and the interactions of that magic with the alchemist's own spiritual and material self. Alchemists are careful to only speak of the ultimate goal in riddles, talking of the 'Great Work', the 'Elixir', the 'Philosopher's Stone' and 'Alkahest', implying that there is some danger in arriving at the knowledge at the heart of alchemy without discovering it personally.

On this basis, the stone in the mirror behind the teachers' defences was never the thing that Tom Riddle truly sought. He had learned the Dark Arts, but nothing of the Great Work, so he did not understand that there never really was A Stone, he could only seek, and create, his own stone. Whether or not he could do so without purifying himself of the foul transmutations he had worked upon himself, we cannot say, except to hope not. Fortunately, all he knew of the Great Work was the storybook version.

General footnote: magic and alchemy are some of the best bits of history and anthropology. I recommend the study of it to absolutely everyone, and people interested in the magic of Harry Potter in particular. The stories behind the folklore JKR used to create her world are generally at least interesting if not outright mind-expanding.
