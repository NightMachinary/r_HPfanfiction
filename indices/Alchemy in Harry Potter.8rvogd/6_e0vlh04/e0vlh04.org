My headcannon is that alchemy is doing microscopic transfigurations using charms.

You could easily transfigure yarn into cloth, but if you charm it into weaving itself into cloth, then you get utterly mundane cloth using magic.

So alchemy would be the same. Using charms to vanish protons and neutrons to turn lead into gold makes utterly non-magical gold.
