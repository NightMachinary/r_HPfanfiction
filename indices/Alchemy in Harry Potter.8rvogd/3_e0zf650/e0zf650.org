People are lazy. Lazy authors take the FMA concept and try to fit it into the HPU. Which doesnt work.

Imo: Alchemy in HPU is neither transfiguration nor potionswork nor science. It is a blend of all disciples that does not follow any already established rules. It does what it does. How it works is the job of the Alchemist to find out.

However from reaching conclusions based on what we know about Alchemy in HPU it can be said that Alchemy is not as useful overall, to the common wizard / witch.
