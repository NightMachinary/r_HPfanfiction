Huh. I didn't realise my personal headcanon about Alchemy was so different to the norm. I think of it as being very philosophical, and very much about the nature of things. In my AU I followed the Platonic model of Forms and Matter. Think of Matter as being the stuff it's made of, and Form being the object's inherent essence. So most of the time, Magic manipulates the Forms of an object, and the Matter changes to reflect this. But it can't alter the Form completely, only impress your Will upon it to twist and shape it. Alchemy looks at, among other things, the study and true manipulation of Form.

Here are some ideas for things which I think come under alchemy:

- The study of how physical and chemical transformation can affect Form
- The purification of Form; Idealising substances.
- Philosophy of where Concepts come from, and whether they can exist without Matter.
- The Nature of the Soul (it is in many ways the complex Form of a person)
