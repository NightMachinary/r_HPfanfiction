I see alchemy as the "better" counterpart to Transfiguration which produces permanent and true substance. Transfigured Gold is stable, but if anyone suspects that it's not real gold, they can just use an Untransfiguration spell and return it to whatever it was formerly; this is the reason you can't make true food with Transfiguration (because a wizard's magic has a built-in trigger response to Untransfigure anything it consumes) and that Transfigured gold is worthless.

With Alchemy, you make /real/ substance, which can never be reverted to its previous state; this enables creation of true gold with the Philosopher's Stone, and "human transfiguration" which perenially makes you younger and healthier (whereas, again, the body's magic rebels against Transfigured or Polyjuiced changes and you have to keep reapplying the magic every few hours).

As to how it's practiced... it's more akin to Potions than Transfiguration, I suppose, but it uses test tubes and glass phials and things, so to speak. I picture it as a child's idea of chemistry, you know, looking like [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/39/f4/5c39f4962481e7e04522cdbaeb16521a.jpg][that]], with all sorts of colorful liquids and funny items. Much as in potions the ingredients would, of course, be odd and often magical in nature. (Dragon's Blood, for instance...)
