Well my headcanon is that you /can/ theoretically (though the specific spell to do so has probably been long discarded for being useless, someone like Dumbledore could play it by ear and succeed), but any savvy buyer in the Wizarding World would cast some Untransfiguration charms on the stuff before accepting it, and then you'd be thrown in Azkaban for counterfeiting. So while theoretically possible transfiguring gold would not be an "option". From there, as I said, the general populace would sort of forget it was ever possible in the first place. Like how a random IRL kid wouldn't necessarily know that transmuting lead into gold /is/ possible if you've got a nuclear plant (because all projects to do so were abandoned when we realized it would be more expensive than the gold's worth).
