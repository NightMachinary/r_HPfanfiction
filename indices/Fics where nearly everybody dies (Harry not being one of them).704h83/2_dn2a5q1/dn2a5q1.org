Circular Reasoning is one of my all-time favorite fics linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian). Harry begins in a war-torn, post-apocolyptic-type world where everyone he has loved is dead. He gets thrown back to age thirteen? and struggles to shape a better future. Very dark, violent, and heart-wrenching.

Fair warning: it was abandoned for a couple years and is unfinished. However, it was updated in May and the author is still active on DLP, so I expect an update soon. Regardless of its incomplete status, it's truly a must read. I can't recommend it highly enough.
