I feel like this is quite a strange question, rooted rather in personal philosophy than any measurable sort of system. It's not nearly as simple as three very broad “powers”, as two of them are a societal thing whereas the other is a truly personal aspect.

My opinion is the opposite to how you've listed it, the power of a massive group of people is staggeringly larger than your individual ability to change the world around you. It's like comparing linear and exponential functions, one increases at a set rate - it can't expand past that limit; the other has an increasing rate of change - it goes beyond its limits as part of its nature.

Honestly I would say that political power, true political power, would have to involve all three of them. All of these powers require the others to function effectively, and I would argue that any piece of FanFiction should aim to include all of them fairly equally to keep the story interesting and engaging.
