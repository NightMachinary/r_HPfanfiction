Voldemort and Dumbledore were magical power. Everyone looked up at them in either admiration or fear.

Lucius Malfoy was monetary power. He bribed his way out of Azkaban, but was taken down once he ran into a situation he could not simply pay off.

Fudge and Umbridge were political power. They were able to cause a lot of trouble, but were mediocre at best when it came to magic. The former fell into a spiral of delusion that cost him everything he had worked for, while the latter got outsmarted by a sixteen-year old witch with a grudge.
