yep its pretty much a tier system Magical power will get you Money and political power threw followers example Voldemort stared off as a no name Orphan and threw his magical power because one of the most powerful people in The magical world , Money will allow you to get Political power and Increase your Magical power although if not used well will eventually fail you example Lucius Malfoy and Political power for those with out Magical or Monetary power turns you into a bottom feeder like Fudge who will horde what little power they can get and will be left with nothing when there usefulness runs out.
