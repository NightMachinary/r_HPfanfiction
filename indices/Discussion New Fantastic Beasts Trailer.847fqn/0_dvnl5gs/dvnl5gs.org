I'm sure Jude Law will be very good, but I'm a bit bothered by the grey suit, very "normal". I don't expect him to wear purple robes with little moons and stars this early in his career and at his age, but a bit more fantasy would have been a nice touch if it could have been made to work with his charisma. He doesn't feel like Dumbledore to me right now, but I'm sure the movie will change my opinion, or at least make me like this version of the character.
