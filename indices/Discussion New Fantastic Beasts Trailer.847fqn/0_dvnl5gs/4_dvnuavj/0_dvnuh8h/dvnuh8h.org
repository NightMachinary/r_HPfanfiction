Yeah I know, that's why I'm waiting for the movie to really judge his character. I hope they kept a few quirky wardrobe elements as a way to keep him in the role of the Dumbledore we know from HP. I've also read fics from this era and Dumbledore is always represented as a younger version of the one we know, twinkling eyes and fun robes, so it's sort of become head canon I guess, so it feels weird to see something different. I'm waiting for the movie to have a more definite opinion :)
