It was interesting. However after watching the trailer I just didn't ... feel any danger. Cool scenes, but no sense of anything dark or what is going on. Or why. In the last movie Grindelwald was captured and now? What? Trailer should have addressed this a bit better. Maybe started with how he has escaped and is planning something. You know to build the suspense.

And that's why in the end trailer failed for me. Very nice and cool, but no suspense. No sense of danger. No seeming reason. No adventure.
