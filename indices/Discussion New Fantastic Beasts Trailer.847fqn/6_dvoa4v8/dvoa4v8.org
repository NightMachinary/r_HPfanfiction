I'm disappointed that everyone looks so muggle.

I see some strange comments here that the first FB movie was book compliant, but the muggle clothing, look and sound of apparition, lack of pronouncing spells, all spells looking the same, etc. all fit way more with the movies than the books.

I'm really hope they're going to stick to book Dumbledore, rather than Gambon Dumbledore, as they are two completely different people.

I am excited for the movie though. I like Newt and I'm interested in all the new fantastic beasts in the trailer.
