Assorted thoughts:

- French Ministry looks cool.

- Grindeldepp looks much better than he did in Fantastic Beasts 1 and this is encouraging.

- Jude Law is a great Dumbledore.

- It's difficult to see how they're going to integrate the established book-incompatible movie canon with the book-canon compliant Fantastic Beasts 1. Probably they'll just ignore these difficulties and we'll end up with various different canons instead of one single canon (which arguably already started with Cursed Child).

- Though I greatly dislike how the Fantastic Beasts movies depict Aurors, both in terms of number (far too many of them) and in terms of lack of badassery, it tickles me that so many of them were brought along for a polite chat with Dumbledore. Looks like someone felt insecure XD

Edit: every time I watch the scene with Dumbledore in Hogwarts, I love it more. You can read so much into it. He's surrounded by Aurors and he's just relaxing, cool as a cucumber, hands in pockets, with his wand lying on the desk, not even in a position that he could pick it up quickly. It's just such an understated expression of casual dominance. So Dumbledore.

Dumbledore around that age actually has a really fascinating dynamic. The fact that he's just a regular professor rather than Headmaster, yet unquestionably the most powerful person there. The fact that figures of political authority are visiting him, a teacher in a remote location, because from that position of apparent powerlessness he nonetheless has global influence. It's an unexplored position, probably because the fandom is too busy turning him into a mustache twirling cartoon villain to do anything interesting with him.
