Ah... I see. But what exactly makes you fear /CoG/ won't have the same book-worthy feel as /FB1/?

(Also, do admit your original post did not lend itself to the interpretation you give here. You were talking about "having to resort to multiple canons", which... is going a bit too far for just the way a fight is staged. Just accept the facts themselves and see the specifics of the image and pacing as "story embellishments" akin to narration, perhaps?)
