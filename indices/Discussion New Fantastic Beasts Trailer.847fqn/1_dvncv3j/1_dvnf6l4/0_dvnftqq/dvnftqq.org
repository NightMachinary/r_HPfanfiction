I'm not so much thinking of factual contradictions as much as tonal inconsistency.

A good example of tonal inconsistency is how Cursed Child had events unfolding according to stage logic - the fights weren't fights, they were a pantomime, with each person waiting their turn to cast a spell so that the audience could appreciate the full effect of each spell in full. There's nothing factually inconsistent there, but nonetheless it sits badly with the books (and realistic behaviour). For this reason I consider Cursed Child to be a kind of divergent "stage only" canon.

The FB1 movie was factually consistent with both the HP books and movies. But in the sense that it brought alive the magic of the world much more than the HP movies did, I felt that it was much more in keeping with the spirit of the books. It had all the neat, clever touches that are characteristic of Rowling's writing and which were so often skipped over in the HP movies.
