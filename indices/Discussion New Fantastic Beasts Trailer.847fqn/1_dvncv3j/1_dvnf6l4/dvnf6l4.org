  It's difficult to see how they're going to integrate the established book-incompatible movie canon with the book-canon compliant Fantastic Beasts 1.

What issues do you have in mind, exactly? I don't really see what the problems are. I... I genuinely don't see what issues there might be that might come up in the /Fantastic Beasts/ films. What, Beauxb√¢tons as a female school?

Also, on the subject of the Aurors: as someone else already said, I don't think it improbable that there'd be a lot more Aurors in the United States of America because the United States of America are simply a lot /bigger/ than Britain. These thirty Aurors might have come from several different states, too, but been summoned immediately (thanks to Portkeys or Apparation) when news of the Obscurus reached them.
