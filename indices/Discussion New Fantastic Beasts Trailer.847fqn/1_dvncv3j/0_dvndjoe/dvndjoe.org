- Somebody on Youtube mentioned Beubaxton, but it being the French Ministry makes a load more sense.
- Didn't have anything to complain about on that, as he wasn't there for long enough to make a comment in either direction

- Well, Dumbledore was known to be close to Grindlewald so I assume that whoever went to talk with him had good reason to be weary. But one thing I noted was that they seemed to have spread around the room so as to be able to attack Dumbledore from any direction.
- The US likely have a higher magical population and thus need a larger amount of Aurors than the UK. And well, they could just as well primarily have been Magical Las Enforcement Officers. The Aurors younger, less badass cousins.
