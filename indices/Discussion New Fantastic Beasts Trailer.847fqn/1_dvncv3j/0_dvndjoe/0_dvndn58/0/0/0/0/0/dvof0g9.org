While that's all true, the Aurors are supposed to be Dark Wizard catchers. Which suggests that they don't need that many of them either. They are meant to be the elite of the Magical Law Enforcement. Which would mean that there are those with less education working there as regular officers of sorts.

There's also the potential in difference of population levels to consider as well. Isn't the UK magical population estimated to be 20 000 or something? Either way a low population level which wouldn't require a lot of Aurors during peace time and when war breaks out or is on the horizon, you train up some of your better MLEO's at that point.
