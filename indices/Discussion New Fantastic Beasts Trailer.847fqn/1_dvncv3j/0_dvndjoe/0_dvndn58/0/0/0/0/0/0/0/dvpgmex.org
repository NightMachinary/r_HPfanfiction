Couldn't find anything in general about them on Pottermore, but the Wiki says that they are indeed the elite. But that the US uses the term Auror for all MLEO's, or at least most of them.

But it is known that there is a Hit Wizard squad, and that there is an Magical Law Enforcement Patrol. The Hit Wizards being focused on Combat and not so much on the investigation and disguises like the Aurors. And then the MLEP has similar requirements as the Hit Wizards but probably is trained more generally as their task is to catch petty criminals like Mundungus Fletcher.
