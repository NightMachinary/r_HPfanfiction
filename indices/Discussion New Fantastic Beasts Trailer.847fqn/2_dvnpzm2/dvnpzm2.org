'If you'd ever had the pleasure to teach him, you'd know Newt is not a great follower of orders.'

Is a very Dumbledore-esque line to me. I'm not entirely sold on Jude Law but he did have the right charm and 'twinkle' in his eyes when he said it. Shame they couldn't have dressed him in brighter colours but time does change people.

Someone postulated something very interesting that I had not thought of. Considering the film is Fantastic Beasts are we perhaps going to see the origin of Fawkes and Dumbledore's friendship?

Speculating but perhaps Newt rescues Fawkes and Fawkes takes a liking to Dumbledore?

Credence looks to be out for revenge I would say, he looks bitter, darker and angrier. I can't see him joining Grindelwald considering, so it'll be interesting to see what he's up to.

Credence is also possibly related to Leta Lestrange based on writing on the wall that others were able to interpret. I wonder where that will lead?
