I will say this. I was never much in favor of Disney-like super vibrant magenta wizard robes. I actually very much like costume design in the movies. Yes, even when kids at school are wearing muggle clothes (seriously, shirt and pants are only reserved for muggles?). Even Malfoy's suit (nothing wrong with it).

Dumbledore looks fantastic in the trailer, though the hair is on the level of Harry's blue eyes.

As to why the DADA classroom. My theory is that teachers and subject perhaps move around--Slughorn got Professor Merrythought's old office when he came back in HBP. There are also considerations of fanservice (DADA classroom is a very characteristic location from the HP movies, so callback points) and production costs (easier to reuse/recreate a set that was extensively used for 10 years than design a new one).
