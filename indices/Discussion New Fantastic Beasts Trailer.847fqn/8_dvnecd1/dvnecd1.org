I thought the first part of the trailer was great. But the last 30 or so seconds, killed any enthusiasm I had for it. For some reason, the last half of the trailer gave of a Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief vibe and I honestly hated that movie. This doesn't look good. I'll probably see it anyway but this trailer didn't excite me. To be honest, the first trailer of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them didn't excite me either.
