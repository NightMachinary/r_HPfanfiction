TBH for me the Where to find them trailer seemed rather lackluster but turned out to be a good movie. And this trailer seems pretty good and hopefully the movie showcases a jump in overall quality as well.

And 1:36-1:41 seems like it'll expand upon some magic lore that's not been touched upon before.
