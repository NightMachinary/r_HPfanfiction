The ones where it's a primary focus have already been listed, but here are a few where runes are used in awesome ways but not the purpose of the fics:

Faerie Heroes has runes as a tool that's used a fair bit.

Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity has Harry using epic-level runic enchantment partway through.

Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon is largely based on a runic array (the beacon).
