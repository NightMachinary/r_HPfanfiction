Yeah, I definitely get that. I actually started reading it like 4 times and always stopped at a similiar point before I finally decided to push past that and pull through till the end. I think it was worth it in the end, especially for the fact that McGonagall is a rather prominent character, but I can see how and where most would be pretty put off by the story and its twists...
