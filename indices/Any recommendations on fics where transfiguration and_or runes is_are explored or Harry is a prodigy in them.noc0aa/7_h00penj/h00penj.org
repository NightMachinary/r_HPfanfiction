A Simple act of Vengeance and it's sequel, has a Harry with a fucked up magical core. He's pants at precise Magic's like charms and enchantments, but a true prodigy with transfiguration and wide area of effect spells. He is unable to use a wand and the battles are anime like and action packed in design, and he relies heavily on elemental magic and conjuration. It ends in an extremely powerful harry, but one who has actually worked for his power and has clear limits defined. Good plot, good romance, good action. A great story. Sorry I don't know how to link stories, but it should pop up easily.
