See, I'm the other way around. No clue what the other one was about, but this one had the flamels, the curse breakers and the floating castle and madam sp... Spurt? Spot? Something. Short lady, old as dirt, taught defense, name starts with Sp lol. Probably isn't spot.

I don't mind the lack of conflict either, tbh. To me, this is the most memorable one of their stories, and all I can say about the rest is that I liked them.
