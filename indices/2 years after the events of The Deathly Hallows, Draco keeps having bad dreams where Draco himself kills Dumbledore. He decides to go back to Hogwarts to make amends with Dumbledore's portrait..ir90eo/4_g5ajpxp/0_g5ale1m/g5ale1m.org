"You learn from the past, from the mistakes that both sides did and where they came from. People distanced themselve from Tom thats why they first called him fearfully Voldemort and later on You-Know-Who. To truly understand Tom or Gellert one has to open oneselve to the question:What would need to happen that I would be capable of these horrible things? The answer to that can be quite chilling, how little sometimes would need to happen so we feel justified in doing all sorts of horrible things. Darkness is in everyone of us but it is not in our interest to ignore it - when doing so often leads us into it - but the be aware of it. To integrate that which we do not wamt to acknowledge. Being able to do cruel things and yet never to indulge it takes strenght beyond measure."
