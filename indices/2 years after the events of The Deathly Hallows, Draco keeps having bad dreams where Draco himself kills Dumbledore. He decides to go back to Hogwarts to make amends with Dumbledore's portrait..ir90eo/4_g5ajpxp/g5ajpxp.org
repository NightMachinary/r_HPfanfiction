"Ah, there you are Mr.Malfoy." He looked up from the from floor immersed in his own thoughts and stood up from the small bench near the great hall. He bowed shortly to Headmistress McGonagall - that would need some getting used to. "Thank you Headmistress for allowing my request."

She eyed him like a cat would look at a rather interesting mouse - well some things would never change.

"Indeed, and what a strange request it is." Her eyes meet his and it seemed to him as if she was trying to discern a deeper reason for his request. It was an intense stare, yet he thought about this particular day for nigh a year so he did his best to keep eye contact without flinching - a more difficult task than he had thought.

Finally after what felt like an eternity she clicked her tounge and turned around "If you would follow me Mr.Malfoy, I do have a board meeting in 15 minutes so we best be on our way."

He followed her quickly his thoughts again turning again to the upcoming task. He thought about it for so long and now it was almost there, it seemed surreal. The regret, the shame, the realization it haunted him almost every minute and then seeped into his dreams like thick heavy tar suffocating him slowly but surely.

So caught up in his own train of thought he missed McGonagall's voice as he followed her up the stairs to the Headmistress office.

"I'm sorry Headmistress I must have been lost in thought."

"Quiet" She threw him a quick glance.

"I was saying that I nearly didn't accept your request if it weren't for Mr.Potter's insitance."

That did threw him of the loop so without really wanting to his suprise did escape him. "Potter's insitance?"

McGonagall threw a another ponited look a him "Yes, Mr.Potter was very much favorable of your request when I mentioned it to him recently."

She sniffed "He said few people get the chance to talk to those whose death lays like a heavy burden upon us and it is not our right to judge who is allowed that opportunity and who isn't"

He was suprised - no shocked would be the better word. He a had little contact with Potter unsuprisingly giving his family statues and history and Potter being - rightly - hailed as the defeater of the Dark Lord. He had always mocked his saving people thing, his rushing head first into the most dangerous situation but back then in that horrible fateful night he saved him from that room becoming his grave.

He had understood since than that Potter wasn't all that stupid, that he had known most of the time what kind of danger had layn in front of him yet he still did it not out of pride or false bravado but simply because it was the right thing to do instead of the essy one.

Again McGonagall's voice brought him out of his trance and just like that he was faced with a heavy oak door and a strict looking McGonagall. "As I was saying, you have until sunset as I expect the meeting with the board to last long."

With that she turned around and left him before the still closed door. He breathed in and out and steeled himself for whats to come.

He opened the door and went inside, marvelling in quite admiration at the office in front of him. He had never really been in here for long and at the times he was busy looking at the floor.

"Quite the sight isn't it." said a smooth voice behind the large desk and for a moment he almost expected Dumbledore to sit right there at his desk vut as he looked towards the source of the voice it was not so.

The potrait of Dumbledore.looked at him, his eyes still having the kind of mirth in them as in life. He swallowed - hard - no matter how much he had prepared himself for today nothing was like being here right now looking the man inthe eyes whose death you were responsible for.

He wanted to say something but his voice betrayed him and nothing but a croak escaped him.

Dumbledore seemed to ignore his guest discomfort and continued "I would offer you a lemon sherbet but Minerva does not seem to be as fond of them as I was - alas such is the passing of time."

He could do nothing but simply look at Dumbeldore, completly frozen. This was nothing as he expected or maybe the blow would only come when he didn't expect it. This was so much harder than he had thought.

Dumbledores expression softend "I know why you are here Mr.Malfoy, Harry mentioned your request the last time we were talking. To think of such a meeting is one thing but to see through it, is another."

"How you can you be so calm?" he suddenly shouted his emotions overtaking him.

Dumbledore simply eyed him calmly which enerved him even more. "How you can you just sit there and talk with me when it was I who...who...ho... " his voice broke the end clenching his fist to keep the tremors from shaking up his whole body.

When he was able to look up the only difference in Dumbledore was the slight sadness which had crept into his eyes.

"When it was you who killed me? I know you believe because of the promise Severus did you were the cause for my passing, yet my fate was decided long before you were marked as a punishment for your family, by ghost from my past nontheless. It was I who was responsible for my death and no one else."

Dumbeldore looked at Draco clenching and unclenching his hands, while small tremors shook him. How that reminded him of someone else in this office who had also believed to be the cause of someones passing even if it was not so.

"Yet you already heard something similar to this so what is it that you seek Mr.Malfoy?"

He didn't want to but the burning question which consumed him just burst out of him. "Then why does it still feel like I am the cause for your death for the death of all that people who died because you were felled. Why does it feel like this guilt is burning a hole in my heart and there is nothing to fill it and nothing to put it out. Why do I get to live while others don't"

It just all rambled out of him with all that desperation that had built up over all this time.

Now Dumbledores eyes were full of sadness but it was a far away look.

"I can not answer these questions for you my boy." and he almost wanted to challenge that before Dumbledore amodished him with a look "because these things take, they need journey and transformation. Your answers will not be clean cut, they will be the process of your life."

Dumbledore stoped shortly and looked at him with such an understanding that Draco would not have thought possible.

"You read the book about me as a lot of otgers I presume, so you know I was very close with Grindeleald. After I had defeated him the guilt and regret I felt were overwhelming. Even later in life I thought how horrible it is to feel such shame,regret and guilt for loving someone with all your heart who destroyed the lifes of so many. It took many,many years till I came to a certain kind of peace with myself although I've never really came over my regret of Adrianna. Yet it was also my driving force to do better, to do all that I could that others would not have to feel the pain I had felt.

And I did mistakes, many of them. The likes of which were Harry ever to tell them all would make Mrs.Skeeters book quite harmless in comparison."

Dumbledore's answer shook him right to the core, he would have never expected such a personal insight from him.

"But how do I do this, how can I be sure to do better?"
