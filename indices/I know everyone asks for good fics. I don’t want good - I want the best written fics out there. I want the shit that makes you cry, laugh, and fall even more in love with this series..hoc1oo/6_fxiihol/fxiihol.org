One shots: Linkffn(I know not and cannot know --- yet I live and I love) --- I recommend this wayyy to often, but I swear its the best oneshot I've ever read.

Linkffn(Minerva's Boys by alexannah) --- quite touching, not entirely sure about the characterization since I haven't read it properly in a while

Linkffn(The line by glespa) --- it portrayed the Slytherins really well

Linkffn(Evil be thou my good by ruskbyte) --- I can't explain why I like it so much

Linkao3(Overemotional: in defense of Cho Chang) --- the whole series is gold. It made me cry so much (I don't really cry much when reading)

Linkao3(Living on by wingdance) --- the concept of Lily adopting other children is quite cool, and I wish there was a sequel for this

Linkao3(to rise in perfect light) --- its sweet and sad and touching, and I don't know how to explain why I like it so much

Linkffn(Brother by eedwrites) --- kind of bittersweet??? but also somewhat funny

Linkffn(Constant vigilance by Kevin3) --- I wish there were more fics like this, it was hilarious ðŸ˜†

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the garden) --- it was all for that one pun xD

Linkffn(just a random tuesday) --- okay this isn't a one shot but its good. It's really amusing, how Professor McGonagall reacts to Umbridge's nonsense.

Longer fics: Linkao3(i won't just survive no you will see me thrive) --- I liked how the author wrote James' reaction to Harry being in Slytherin without give it me too much secondhand embarrassment but also not making him overly accepting of the idea.

Linkao3(Be the light in my lantern by starfishstar) --- I loved it so, so much. The characterization of Remus is on point, and I like how it depicts the werewolves. (its a series)

Linkoa3(The accidental animagus) --- haven't read it in a while, but I really liked it

Linkao3(Because why not by starspangledmeatball) --- again, its also been a while since I've read it, but I seem to remember that it was quite unique and written quite well.

Linkffn(the changeling by annerb) --- it was so good, the last few chapters made me cry and I almost never cry when reading.

Linkffn(Midnight by the Weasley watch by excessivelyperky) --- I like the characterization here, and really want more similar fics.

Linkffn(the house of potter rebuilt) --- this one doesn't have much conflict, but I really like the way harry solves the Voldemort horcruxes

Tightly Knit by KMbell92 on Wattpad --- this author has more than 6 books set in this AU, and each is over 100 chapters long. It's really worth it.
