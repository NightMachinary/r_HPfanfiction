  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

  Six months after escaping Crait, the tiny Resistance force has been hiding on the Outer Rim planet of Arisaig, trying to regroup and plan their next move. Rey and Ben have made no contact since the last moment on Crait. Rey is trying to continue her training, but is finding it more difficult to understand her place without a teacher. Her thoughts slip back to the throne room every so often and she wonders if she made the wrong decision for the right reason. Knowing she is putting the rebuilding Resistance in danger, Rey decides to leave and find the closure and answers she has been searching for. Little did she know, or maybe she knew it all along, they would lead her right back to him.

  In which Remus and Tonks fight battles, arrest criminals, befriend werewolves, overcome inner demons and, despite it all, find themselves a happy ending. A love story, and a story of the Order years. (At long last, my Remus/Tonks epic, which has been years in the making!)

  Hermione was just a scrappy autistic child with no parents and no past until she was adopted by a wonderful pair of dentists. The summer after she would make the best friend she would ever have from Ottery St. Catchpole. How much would her life change when she is told that the tingling sensation she felt in her very core is magic? STORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
