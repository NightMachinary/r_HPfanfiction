the only fic I made my sister (who doesn't read fics) read, is At your Service. not sure how good it is now, but I loved it when I read it some time ago. it feels just like an 8th book tbh. and has a good mystery. linkao3(319257) I really like all of her fics, Drarry fans must read.

and then The boy who died a lot. it's Snarry. I feel like everyone should read this fic at least once. linkao3(670548)
