If at all interested in Sirius Black and/or the Black family, my absolute favorite fic series with them is called the Black Sheep Dog (~500k WC so far). It has hands down the best Sirius + best Dumbledore characterization I've ever read in fanfic, excellent flowing dialogue, and a variety of very fleshed out characters that exist only as the barest sketches in canon.

The second series is still updating, but the author updates fairly regularly and there is a lot of writing to catch up with in the first place.
