Twenty-nine by Endrina ticked many boxes for me. She also has another fic, Twenty-six which is longer in the same 'universe' as it were. I strongly preferred Twenty-nine to Twenty-six but they are both good.

Chronologically, Twenty-six comes first but you can read them in either order and you'll get a different experience either way. I read Twenty-nine first and felt it was the 'better' order, but can't explain why because of spoilers. I'm told that people who read Twenty-six first were equally enamoured.

I'll admit that I have a tendency towards poor bookmarking and struggle to find my favourites again. There's a good fic where an older Harry, Hermione and Ron go back in time for a re-do but things keep getting messed up.

They are mysteriously helped by person known only as The Asp. Followed by a sequel from the perspective of the Asp which adds far more depth to the original fic.

Then another slash fic, All the Young Dudes. It's a slow burn though. I would say the character development, particularly of Remus is very good.

Text Talk is very good for a fic mainly based on Texting.

Unfortunately, all my other bests - the truly brilliant ones - are lost to the world, or unfinished. It's odd because I mostly read gen, yet apparently I bookmark slash very well...

The one unfinished fic I will offer is Blurred Reality which I can only describe as the Black Swan of Harry Potter. It's only got 6 chapters and clearly had much more lined up, but it also tells you just enough that you can infer an ending - even if the writer had intended more twists. I think I was drawn in by the psychological horror elements, but in truth I can't watch them at all so it's possible that anyone who can stomach them won't find it as good.
