linkffn(8346230) - This is the fanfic that makes me cry and fall in love with the series. It has grammatical and spelling errors, but it remains one of my favourites of all time. The relationship between Harry and Sirius makes me long for that time of parental relationship with my own parents. Their commitment and trust is so wholesome that I can almost imagine myself there.

linkffn(6243892) - I have my own issues with this fic [such as the ending], but I remember reading it and feeling the mystery of the original books. Few fics give me the sense of adventure of the original series; this one does.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) - This is the fic that made me fall in love with Remus Lupin. It's wolfstar and canonical and the characterization is some of the best I've ever seen. The fic is wolfstar and the lead up to it is so well done.
