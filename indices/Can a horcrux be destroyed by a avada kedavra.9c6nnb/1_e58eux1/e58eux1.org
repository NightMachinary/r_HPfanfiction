First, spoilers dude.

Second, technically we know it can a la Harry's little trip through the woods to camp Death Eater. Now, I think another way to ask this is can the curse work on non living objects?

My thought is probably not. The reasoning would be that the method itself makes little difference. What matters is that you have left the container incapable of holding the soul fragment anymore. Now that's a bit weird, since you would figure Harry would need to be ripped Harry apart or decapitate him him like Nagini, but there is little chance Voldemort placed any protections on his unknown Horcrux. Dumbledore seems pretty adamant about how dumb an idea a living Horcrux actually is, which might imply the necessities for destruction are lower.

Bottom line, with a non living Horcrux, probably not. With a living one, definitely.
