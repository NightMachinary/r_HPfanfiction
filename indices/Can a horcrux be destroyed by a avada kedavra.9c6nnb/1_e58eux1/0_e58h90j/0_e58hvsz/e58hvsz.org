I think you mean â€˜you three have...' from Dumbledore. And he was also referring to the connection by blood and the brother wands, only strengthening the weirdness.

When you word it like that, it makes it sound like Dumbledore was a Horcrux, or even weirder that he was actually Nagini. And while there is a theory about Dumbledore turning Fawkes into his own Horcrux using Ariana's death and then dying OotP, I doubt Dumbledore is that weird.
