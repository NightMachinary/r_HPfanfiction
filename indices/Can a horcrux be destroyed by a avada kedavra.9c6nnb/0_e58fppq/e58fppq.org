Horcruxes are very fragile. Its a soul fragmet in a vessel. Its the vessel itself that is normally protected. If you break the vessel the fragment is destroyed. If the killing curse will destroy the vessel then it will destroy the horcrux. In the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort we see that the killing curse can have destructive qualities to it even when it is intercepted. That's enough evidence for me to say it wouldn't be silly to use it in a story.
