  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.
