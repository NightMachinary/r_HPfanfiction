  When Sirius Black ran away from home, it was the result of five years of being tugged between his Dark family and Light friends. Contrary to what he told Harry, nothing about choosing sides had been easy. He was just an excellent liar, especially about his mixed loyalties, his Dark past, and his role as the Dark's most successful spy. (Sirius's early Hogwarts years.)
