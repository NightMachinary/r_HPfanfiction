linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9832189/1/Dead-Man-Walking]]) is a very good one, but doesn't focus on the family as a whole so much as Regulus, Kreacher, and Sirius.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith]]) is a Malfoy family SI, but has a good deal of involvement with the Blacks.

Both of the above are rather unfortunately abandoned.

Another that may fit the bill (but might not if you don't like crossovers) and is currently updating is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky]]). It also involves a fem!Harry like PotB, but one raised by the Black family rather than taken in by them later in life.
