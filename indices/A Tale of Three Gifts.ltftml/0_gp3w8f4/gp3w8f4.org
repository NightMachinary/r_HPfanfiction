Harry meets her when he is five, and gives her some pocket change and an old book, one he was brought to the Dursley's with and has a strange name and even stranger stories: The Tales of Beedle the Bard.

​

1) A watch that always tells the current moon phase, its hands made of pure silver.

​

2) A ring made of pure silver, with a strange spiked gem inset. Later, he finds it acts like a Goblin forged weapon, and absorbs the powers of his defeated foes.

​

3) An ever refilling box of cat treats. Potter makes friends with Mrs. Norris, and shenanigans ensue.
