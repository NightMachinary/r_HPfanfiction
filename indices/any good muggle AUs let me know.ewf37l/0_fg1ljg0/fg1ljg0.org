[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] and its sequel [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-33141/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Swiss+Tournament.htm][Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament]] are hands down my favorite non-magical AUs. However, that universe is not a Muggle one either because it contains other superpowers.

Otherwise, Muggle AUs tend to disappoint, and I have only very few fics to recommend:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(8941561), is a nice Harry/Ginny romance. Harry and Hermione are Americans in this fic though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738), happens mostly in a Muggle AU, but this Hermione is a witch from an almost canon dimension.
