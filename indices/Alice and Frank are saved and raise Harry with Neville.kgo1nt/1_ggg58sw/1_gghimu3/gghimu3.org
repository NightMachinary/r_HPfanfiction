I think Remus and Peter were(and then maybe Alice and Frank) the (only)options after Sirius(since James trusted his friends with his life), but Dumby didn't want to place a child with a person that has a hairy problem once a month(a newborn needs a lot of attention, and a family), and Peter was a traitor(and the Marauders thought either Peter or Remus was a traitor). Alice and Franks torture was in first two weeks of November/first week of December(the wiki says this, and I would say that Bellatrix and the others were caught red-handed, on the spot, or perhaps were in custody for a month, due to a lot of things happening in the world after Voldys downfall), or it could have lasted a whole month until they were caught. The timeline is not explained in the books and we don't know how many Crucio's you need to take in order to turn into that. Andromeda could have been a good option, but Dumbs being Dumby didn't want for Harry to grew up in the wizarding world. Also giving them Harry was a double-edged sword due to the fact that even Dumbs didn't know if Neville was maybe the child of the prophecy.
