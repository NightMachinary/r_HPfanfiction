  Sirius should of recived a trial though, so much shit would of come to light
#+end_quote

I agree. The one thing that was constantly bugging me(besides him not having a trial) is why they didn't use Pensieve to see trough his memories that he wasn't the Secret Keeper, and also the duel with Peter, they would have seen that he turned to a rat, and escaped after the explosion(I know that you can alter memories, but Dumbs would have seen if the memories were altered). Dumbs was a supreme warlock of Wizengamot.

  Imagine if Sirius raises him, no way would Harry be the one we see from canon, he would probably be able to handle his fame better than he ever did in canon, grow up with stories about both his parents and be able to choose friends of a wider variety

It would have been a great thing, I would like a realistic fanficiton about it. But even if he was raised by him, they would be constantly bothered cause Harry saved the world(cause he wouldn't have been isolated from it), and I think Harry would have been annoyed about it(reminding him constantly about the death of his parents and stuff like that, or perhaps fame going to his head, but I think that Remus and Sirius would have delt with that, but still he is James' kid, and James was obnoxious when he was a kid). But overall he would have been the happiest kid ever. He would also have Remus there included in his life to have more stability.

  would have a reliable guardian to protect him against the bs that happens at hogwarts as well as have his magical abilities be neglected from age 1-11.
#+end_quote

Well Sirius could be a reliable guardian(with the help of Remus ofc), but I think he would have been prone to encourage Harry's mischievous side(I can totally see him sending a Howler to Harry, when Ron and he went with the flying car to Hogwarts in their second year and praising them, his barking laugh echoing throughout the Great Hall, telling him that he is truly his father's son and that he is brilliant, switching to Lupin's scolding concerning voice that Lily would have their hides if he died, but still chuckling nevertheless). Sirius would have been also a good role model to Ron(I can totally imagine Sirius would been proud that Harry had a great friend like that who went followed him trough thick and thin), and could help Ron to overcome his confidence issues cause of his siblings.

  Albus knew that Neville wasnt the boy, due to Tom choosing Harry, now it dosent exclude Neville from being marked later, but Neville at the time of october 31st-november 1st was "free" from destiny
#+end_quote

I think Albus assumed he wasn't due to Harry being a halfblood like Voldemort. I mean due to prophecy, even the Longbottoms and the Potters went to hiding(having sons born at the end of July, and escaping him three times), and when they killed the Potters and vanished, he knew when Harry was marked. Maybe Longbottoms were already captured in November, we don't know the timeline, still he should have gone to Sirius.
