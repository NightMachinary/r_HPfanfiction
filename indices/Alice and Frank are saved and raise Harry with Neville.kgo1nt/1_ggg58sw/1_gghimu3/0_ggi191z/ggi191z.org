Andromeda and Ted is a hard to choose in the situation, it gives the ability for Lucius and Narcissa to be able to get Harry if something happens to them + Sirius was from all pepoles perspective a traitor.

Sirius should of recived a trial though, so much shit would of come to light i reckon if he had + Harry would of grown up around his parents best friend that actually loves him.

Imagine if Sirius raises him, no way would Harry be the one we see from canon, he would probably be able to handle his fame better than he ever did in canon, grow up with stories about both his parents and be able to choose friends of a wider variety + would have a reliable guardian to protect him against the bs that happens at hogwarts aswell as have his magical abilities be neglected from age 1-11.

Albus knew that Neville wasnt the boy, due to Tom choosing Harry, now it dosent exclude Neville from being marked later, but Neville at the time of october 31st-november 1st was "free" from destiny
