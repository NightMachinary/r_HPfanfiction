Oh wow, you wrote that?!

I just finished it! I don't use FFN that much, but the concept intrigued me and I was absolutely hooked. Your end of chapter omakes were always hilarious but the writing of every chapter was always excellent; I felt genuinely upset when Trelawney died which was really juxtaposed with, say, the cannons winning the league because people believed in Ron believing in them. Excellent work.
