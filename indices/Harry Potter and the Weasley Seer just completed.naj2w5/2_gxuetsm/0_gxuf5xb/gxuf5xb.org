Oh, almost forgot - love the killing curse idea! Always bothered me that the curse was sort of an easy out for any low-rank sadist. The idea that people actually need to be stronger than the person they hit makes using it as frequently as Voldemort does not only a show of power, but also his absolute certainty in his own strength.

It also doesn't make it so that people can just tank those hits, since you wouldn't really know if you could survive unless you did.. actually really looking forward to starting this.
