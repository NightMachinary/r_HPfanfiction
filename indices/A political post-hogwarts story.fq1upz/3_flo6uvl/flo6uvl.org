There is some Hinny in this but it's really background as the main character is Hermione and she's paired with George. Linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy). it's the third instalment of the Arithmancer series by White Squirrel, the first being Hermione's first to fourth year and the second fifth to seventh year and the premise is that Hermione is a maths genius instead of the traditional bookworm and because of her innate talent sharpened by years of practice she can start Arithmancy in first year instead of third year because its centred around mathematics. I highly recommend it.
