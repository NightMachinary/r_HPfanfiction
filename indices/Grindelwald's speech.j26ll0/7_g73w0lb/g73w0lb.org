I can't help but think that a world where the Wizards ended their secrecy would be alike a nightmare. Just as Grinderwald said in his speech, humans are foolish, arrogant creatures.

If they ended the Secrecy, would the wizard accept to live under the rule of their Muggle counterpart? Would the leaders of the world, accept to let these people, waving a power they cannot understand, outside of their control? Would their counselor accept this? Would the rest of the world?

Outside of their anonymat, Wizards would be attacked from all sides. The ambitious would try to gain their favour and help into some plots. The fanatics would hate them for being differents. The parents would hate them, for were not here when their children died.

Wizards would be feared, and the Muggleborns would become a target. Trained adult may be able to defend themselves, but children are not so lucky. People would be accused to be magical left and right, just because something strange happened near them, and for people with money, Muggleborns children would become an object of high value. A test subject in the hope to understand Magic for some, a perfect soldier, being trained to be loyal since his childhood for others, or just a sex slave to bear a magical heir.

Wizards would be forced to take power just to exist. To enslave the rest of the world just so they could live in peace. And even taking power would not end their troubles, as the difficulty in power is to keep it. Children would have to be protected at all cost, Renegade wizards to be captured or put down, and insurections destroyed before they could do too much damages.

And all these troubles for what end? What could the Muggle offer that the wizards do not already have? They do not care for land as they can multiply it, they do not care for goods as they can easily acquire it. All these troubles would just be to end the minor annoyance to live in secrecy, and for some to have the satisfaction to lord other Muggles. Would that be really worth it?

Also, I doubt that Grinderwald was totally honest during his speech. He probably believes more in his ideology than Voldemort did with Blood Supremacy, but he would probably still be ready to adapt his whole ideology depending of the situation.
