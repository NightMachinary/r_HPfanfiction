Unpopular hot take: Both Magneto and Grindelwald were right.

On a larger note, this has been a long time annoyance I have with such themes in fiction. I feel like the majority of allegories to racism in fiction fully miss the point about why racism is a bane that must be fought against. It's because it's *not true!* There is no superior race, heck, there is no race to begin with! We're all Homo sapiens, some regional adaptation to climate does not mean Humanity split off again. There is no blood superiority, skin color superiority, gender, sexuality, whatever, *we are all equal!*

And then come fictional allegories to racism, where... races are objectively *unequal.* Take the Potterverse. Wizards are as close to a god that you can get. Consider their capabilities alone and disregard all of Rowling's crappy worldbuilding and plot conveniences. Can you imagine how such a society would really function? How terrifying it would be? Humanity would have more chances at defeating a Type III alien civ than *one,* half competent wizard.

I don't understand how authors expect us all to be like yaaay! freedom! yaay! equality! yaay! cohabitation! when they create these horribly unbalanced and fully distinct races. Why would literal demigods bend the knee to someone that to them is like what Neanderthals are to us?
