It's what makes Grindelwald scarier to me than Voldemort. The fact that he could move so many people with his words is scary to me.

Voldemort seemed to have a smaller but more fanatical group. Grindelwald appealed to the masses. That's what made him scary. His message sounded a lot better to everybody than Voldemort's message ever did.
