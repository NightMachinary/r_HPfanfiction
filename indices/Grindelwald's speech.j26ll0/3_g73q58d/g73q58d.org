That's generally how they getcha. We even have a term for it - 'demagoguery'. If politicians, tyrants, and revolutionaries couldn't move people, they wouldn't get anywhere, and adding in script-writers on top of that would only make it more appealing. I imagine there were many people moved by that speech.
