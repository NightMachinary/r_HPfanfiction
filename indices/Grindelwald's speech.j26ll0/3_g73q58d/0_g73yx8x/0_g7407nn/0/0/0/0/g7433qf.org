Not at all. Being ignored requires a person or institution to ignore them. A need requires a lack. You can't be ignored by nothing, after all. A nitpicky difference, most definitely, but nitpicky differences are really important when you're looking at how people think about stuff and how to convince them to think in certain ways. And it's a lot easier to convince someone they're being ignored when they aren't than it is to convince them they don't have something they do.

And technically Hitler rose due to manipulating aggression and accusation. He came in right at the point of war payments (the Allies demanded a lot of very pricy things from the German goverment post-WWI) and turned the anger at the ruinous payments towards the government, then towards the various non-Aryan groups he wanted people to not like who he claimed were polluting the system and generally being the cause of all their problems (scapegoating). It wasn't that people felt ignored, it was people feeling angry and him manipulating that anger towards convenient targets that would get them following him.
