I mean, that's a vastly oversimplified explanation of a very complex causal network. There's no single reason a demagogue rises, it could even be a totally systemic thing where multiple reasons have created a situation in which a demagogue is greeted with open arms.

I'd say the most general explanation is because they want something they don't feel they're getting or they have a need they feel isn't met (or that they've been convinced they need). Demagogues can rise on the issues of faith, military, social issues, political issues, money, history, nationalism. And they can rise by meeting those needs or by redirecting the blame to people they persuaded the masses to hate.
