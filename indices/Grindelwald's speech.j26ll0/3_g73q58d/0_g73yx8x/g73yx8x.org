Look at hitler, hitler was able to get an entire country behind him with speechs

hitler was able to craft speechs that used the bitterness of said people in that country to achieve his ends.

I imagine if you took one of hitlers speechs and removed the fact it was from hitler and played it to a random crowd, I imagine they might be taken along with it as well
