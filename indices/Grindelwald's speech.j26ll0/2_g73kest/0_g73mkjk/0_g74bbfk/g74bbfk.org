That is actually used quite often, as is the "magic only works on earth" trope - both depend on the specific "magic system" of the fanfic setting, as this is VERY loosely defined (or, as it happens, not defined at all) in canon.

Along the same thought as the "space exploration/colonization" trope is the "alternate/sub/parallel/higher dimension" trope, which makes a bit more sense magically (as much as that ever makes sense) as we know that space expansion is a thing in canon and hasn't had any rules bound to it. You could write a story with the wizarding world all existing in a subspace behind the portal at 9Â¾ if you want to (AiW anyone?) and technically be canon-compliant with your magic use. The dimension-tropes is, in my experience, less used than the space-tropes - mainly because SW, "magic breaks ALL laws of physics/thermodynamics/relativity/quantum mechanics/life" and similar - I think I've said it somewhere on this subreddit before, but the systems put in place makes or breaks fiction, be that fighting, strategy, politics, magic or any other lore.

I'm still wondering how Fudge became Minister in Canon, how the voting system works, why Hogwarts isn't a day-school (seriously, they have several types of instant or near-instant travel available) and why anyone thought having a dead guy teach history (both past and current), a drunk teach how to predict the future and a known double agent teach ADVANCED CHEMISTRY WITH ADDED MAGICAL HIJINKS to teens and pre-teens was a good idea. Was there ever a class on the magical equivalent of gloves and safety goggles? Or the malleability/subjectivity of time? Even just a talk about why knowing the events of the past is so important for the future?

I went on a tangent, so very sorry about the wall of text, my rant is done
