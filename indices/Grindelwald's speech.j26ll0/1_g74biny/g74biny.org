It's a good speech. He starts by heaping praise and compliments on the attendees, something Voldemort could never have pulled off with sincerity. Then he cleverly twists the narrative about his Muggle views by saying he does /not/ hate them. "I say the Muggles are not lesser, but /other./"

This makes his views seem less extreme, and more appealing to those who might be hesitant to commit to a violent cause. It sounds like the "separate but equal" laws in the US prior to Brown v. Board of Education which were of course complete horse shit. Grindelwald insists Muggles are "not worthless, but of other value." This is purposely vague to allow his audience to fill in the gaps, and decide what their own ideas of "other value" consists of.

"Magic blooms only in rare souls." Again he is complimenting the attendees, building them up with visionary talk. He uses the words "freedom, truth, and love" to make his views seem righteous. Who is going to argue against those things?

Then he shows them visions of the next World War, pain, suffering, destruction, and says this will come to pass if we don't rise up. It's almost a threat veiled as a warning. Join me, or else. Finally he blames Muggles for having "power lust" as a diversion from his own desires.

He rarely shouts or uses vigorous hand motions like some crazed Fuhrer. Grindelwald comes across as calm and rational and that's what makes his honeyed words enticing. Good speech by a good actor, imo.
