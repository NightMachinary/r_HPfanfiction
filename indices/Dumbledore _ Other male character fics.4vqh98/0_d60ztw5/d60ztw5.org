You know, I've never read a Dumbledore/not-Grindelwald story. I suppose I haven't looked for Dumbledore pairings, but there seems to be a surprisingly asexual take on him. It does make sense- he's grandfatherly and there isn't anything obvious relationship-wise in canon. But the dude's all about the power of love. Yeah, I can see him being too burned to try for a bit after Grindelwald (it's too dangerous, I don't deserve it, etc). But I don't think he'd go the rest of his decades without at least a relationship or two. IIRC, Elphias Doge could be a possible candidate?
