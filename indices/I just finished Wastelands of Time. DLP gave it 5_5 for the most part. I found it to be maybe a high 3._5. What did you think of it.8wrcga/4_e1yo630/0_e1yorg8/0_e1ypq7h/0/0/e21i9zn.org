Yup. Got downvoted to hell in the survey thread when someone asked how people can consider the movies canon because there are some supposed contradictions and I answered that question with "I find the Weasleys boring and didn't mind Hermione getting some of their lines." Someone then asked why I hated the Weasleys and Ron in particular and I replied that I simply find them boring and unrelateble. You can guess how that went over.
