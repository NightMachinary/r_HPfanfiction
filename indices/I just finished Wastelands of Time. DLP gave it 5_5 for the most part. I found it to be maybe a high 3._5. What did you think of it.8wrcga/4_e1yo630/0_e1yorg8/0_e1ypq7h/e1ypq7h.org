Yes, and no. I mean, let's be honest here, most fanfics have glaring issues. I went through the first two pages of FFN sorted by "updated" and the only decent one there was "Lady Thief" by Starfox. I am not a huge fan of it, but it's alright and I'd rate it better than "Wastelands". About a third wasn't even properly tagged and the only way I'd click on any of the others would be by accident. All of those would simply be 0/5.

And I am a lot more forgiving for flaws if the plot is interesting, but Wastelands was not very enrapturing for me. The description was too esoteric IMO and it did not get better from there on.
