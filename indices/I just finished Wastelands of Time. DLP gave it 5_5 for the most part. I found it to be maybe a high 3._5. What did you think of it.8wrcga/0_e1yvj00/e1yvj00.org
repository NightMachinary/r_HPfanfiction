I remember when this story was still being actively updated, and it was a lot different than anything else that was out there. That being said, the first time I read the story, I couldn't even read all the published chapters. It has it's moments. It got some chapters I enjoy a ton (such as the vatican basement scene) while others just go on and on. My issue is kinda the issue I have with all of Joe's fics, where he doesn't really write the MC as Harry, he writes it as himself. No offense to him really, since it works out decently in a lot of his work, but after a point, it all feels the same. And it feels kinda outdated these days, since it follows the quintessentially ye olde DLP formula of massive fight scenes, epic magic, Harry getting the hot chick, a bad ass Dumbledore, questionable dark magic, and a more sinister Voldemort.
