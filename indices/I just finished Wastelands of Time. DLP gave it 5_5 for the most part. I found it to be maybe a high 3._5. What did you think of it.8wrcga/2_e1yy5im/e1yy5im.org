When I first came across it it took me on a rollercoaster binge-read session that I absolutely adored. Upon attempting to re-read more recently, it struggled to hold my interest in the same way. I'm unsure if that's due to myself or the writing, to be honest. If it /is/ the writing, my theory is that I got hooked on its breadcrumb trail of cool, new ideas the first time around enough to blind me to any flaws. Upon re-reading, the ideas are no longer new and more is needed to keep me going. This was definitely the case with JBern's work - I'm not actually particularly a fan of his writing style or his approach to social/relationship stuff, but the first time around I could happily ignore those things to bask in the action scenes and the cool cursebreaking stuff.

I do plan to give it another shot at some point, in case I just had an off day. But I suspect you might be right with your 3.*/5 rating.
