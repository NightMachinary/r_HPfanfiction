Hagrid. He is the biggest example of the fact that Rowling wanted HP to be a laid-back, sarcastic take on then-modern British lifestyle. He's a half-giant who was thrown out of school and had his wand snapped after being convicted of negligent homicide. He works with the most dangerous monsters in the world - and for all that the implications of Dark magic are often glossed over, the dangerous creatures in HP are /exactly/ as terrifying as you'd think they would be.

And for all that, his role in the story is to be a cheerful, emotionally upbeat center of calmness and support for Harry. He collects pictures of his parents, and gives him a whittled flute even though Harry has no idea what to do with it. He dates Dumbledore's female half-giant French counterpart. His relationship with the centaurs is to treat them like sitcom-esque irritating neighbors.

He tracks down Voldemort without even realizing it in Philosopher's Stone. He's always on Harry's side, and more often than you'd think, Harry finds himself looking forward to his visits when things get rough. Hermione confides in him when Harry and Ron are angry at her. He's literally the unsung hero that's present through the entire series. He takes Harry out of the Wizarding world, back in, and carries him back from the forest after he 'died,' too. He's not just comic relief, though he's got that in spades.

Best character. Plus, you'd best respect that beard - for several decades, people thought that was the Hair of Slytherin.
