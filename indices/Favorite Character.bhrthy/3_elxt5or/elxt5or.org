Oh boy, forgive me for making a list.

*- Dumbledore*, book-wise. His whimsiness and wise geniality combined with his complexity, is of a kind I had never read or felt before.

HP has for the most part a pretty whimsy tone that is failed to be recreated by 99% of fanfics, if not far more. It's difficult, I imagine. But I've still found far fewer fics where this tone is well-accomplished compared to fics that are 'just' well-written or have good character development. So often, when we originally learned something about the wizarding world -anything at all- it was just delightfully odd, except for the later parts ofcourse. And Dumbledore is perhaps the epitome of this.

Especially when you learn of him as a severely flawed but intrinsically good human being later.

- *Sirius* is a character of the tragic kind that I love, though me being a fan of Gary Oldman probably played a part in that. Dude had an unbelievably shitty life.Just do the count : unwelcome home life /possibly abused. School, which was mostly good, but still kicked out later. Few years of war, lose a lot of friends. Be 12 years in Azkaban, literal hell, because you're not even given a trial and everyone thinks you are exactly like the people you hate while your idea backfired and killed your best friends. And some 3 years on the run and hiding where the few bright sparks in several years are dealing with your godson's increasing despair before you're murdered by your cousin.

Not going to defend he was probably a bully in Hogwarts, but if you still manage to be a decent father-figure for Harry and overall decent person who was fucked in every possible way by society like that. And a much better person than Snape, who escaped Azkaban while ACTUALLY being a death eater and generally being a much viler person to everyone.

*- Arthur, Hagrid* and *Harry* are also characters I admire. The first two for the strong but gentle people they are, Harry for his compassion despite every reason he should not be so. Harry can be moody, sassy, stubborn, melodramatic and not seem the nicest at times, but his compassion outmatches even Dumbledore's. But it's done without it being overly obvious. He refuses to harm death eaters when they try to kill him early book seven, he forgives Snape and Dumbledore, he even tries to stop Pettigrew's hand from turning on himself, he returns the elder wand, he is obsessive about Malfoy being a death eater but when proven right sees in an instant that Malfoy is forced into a situation he pities him for, despite him nearly killing Ron. He goes back for Malfoy in the Room of Requirment. He makes peace with Dudley.

Honestly, for all that the fanfics like to portray Harry as the one that dares to be brutal against Death eaters and have Dumbledore going on about endless chances, the reverse is closer to the original. Only Harry succeeding in the crucio of Carrow is truly OOC. If he couldn't do it against Bellatrix, no way that Carrow insulting Minerva is enough to make him succeed.
