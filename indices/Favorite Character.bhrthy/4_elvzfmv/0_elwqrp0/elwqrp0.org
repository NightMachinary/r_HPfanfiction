I agree it's really hard for me to read Dumbledore bashing. Usually I just stop no matter how far I'm in if it gets bad. I would say my favorite fanfic character is Draco because he's kind of a clean slate. The writer can go so many directions with him, I find it enjoyable to read. Favorite canon characters are the twins. They invent new spells, they show Harry how to get around the school, they have an underground radio station. One of them looses an ear and doesn't even care.
