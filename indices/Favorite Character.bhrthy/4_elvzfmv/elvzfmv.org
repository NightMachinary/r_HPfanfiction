Going by your standard of "which character can I least stand being overlooked/mistreated by fic," I think my answer is Dumbledore, because bashing him will get me to nope out of a fic instantly, no matter how good it is otherwise. I love the wise, kindly, twinkly-eyed headmaster he is in the earlier books, but even more I love the lonely, guilt-ridden, flawed human that we later learn he is. He's an endlessly complex character - preaching the power of love while isolating himself, working towards "the greater good" but almost ruining his plans because he wanted to protect Harry, giving other second chances while never forgiving himself - and I dearly wish more fics would embrace that complexity, rather than reducing him to a one-note Machiavellian chessmaster.
