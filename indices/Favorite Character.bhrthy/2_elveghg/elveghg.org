The main problem of Hedwig in fanfic is how Harry got her. Hagrid bought her for Harry the day of his first visit to Diagon Alley which coincide with his birthday. But if you change anything about the scene (Harry makes his shopping with someone else or alone, or go another day), it makes the scene sound fake. I remember seing a fic where it is Snape that brings Harry there (and it was a disdainful Snape, pretty close to Canon), et yet Harry still left with Hedwig with him.

Canon Hedwig was great but I never saw a fic where she was as magical (except in a Crackfic where she was like a super agent et was teaching thing to Harry like how to torture someone to extract informations).

As for my favourite character, I'm torn between Ron and Tom Riddle. Ron is the great friend that is always there (or almost always there I guess). Noble and courageous (he sacrificied himself in PS, dug a tunnel in the CoS knowing that Harry was fighting a basilisk, put himself in front of the thought murderer Sirius Black and his target, telling him he would have to kill him first with an already broken leg, and his general willingness to follow Harry in troubles), and is even a tactician.\\
I'm still pretty annoyed of the way movies made him an complete idiot and is treatment in fanfics.\\
As for Riddle, he is just the perfect villain, intelligent, attractivie, being trusted by everyone but Dumbledore. Even his faillings are in character like his arrogance or tendency to put a show (you never monologue in front of your enemy, you just kill him).
