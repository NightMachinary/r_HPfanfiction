I mean in the books, Hedwig is cool and all. But in fics, she's either there to play with Harry's hairs/fingers or miraculously understanding whole conversations and eating bacon. (But to each their own, I have specific pet peeves too!) But I guess this explains why I tend to have different favorites when talking about books and fanfics.

I really love Neville and Ron (besides the episodes where he â€˜abandons' Harry) in the books. Ron truly seemed like the best friend one could have, almost as magical as their world is. And Neville is just so good and growing so brave.

But in fics, especially Ron, they both are pretty boring, I find. Even in Weasleys positive fics, Ron is just... meh. Even well written, he's never this great friend with this really great friendship with Harry.

And while in the books I disliked Voldemort/Tom (because, you know, I was absolutely immersed into the story), well written fics about Tom becoming Voldemort are just the absolute best (for me). And all the Tom at different times/universes. It's just fascinating. (I think it comes from the fact that Voldemort because rather dumb in the books for being this big evil vilain that everyone worldwide fears; so it's satisfying to see him makes more sense). So, yes, fanfics writers made Tom my favorite character.

Oh. And Sirius. He's probably the only character (if not counting Harry, of course) which is just fantastic both in fanfics and books. I'm still not over his death, to be honest. But fanfics are saving me, little by little. He's so tragic and dramatic, it speaks to my soul. He's really one of these few characters that have so much depth or potential for depth.
