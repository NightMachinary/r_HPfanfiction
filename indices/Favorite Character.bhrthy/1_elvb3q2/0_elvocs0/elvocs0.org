The two best Ron that I've ever read, where he's really similar to canon in his friendship with Harry are from Eclipse of the SKy and Grow Youn With Me.

I've rarely enjoyed Ron in fanfics because they, as you said, rarely portray him accurately, but in both of these, he really is, though in one he's much older, seeing its 12 years after DH, and while he's much more mature and responsible, he's still that laidback chill dude that just wants to hang out and drink a beer with his buddy while joking around.
