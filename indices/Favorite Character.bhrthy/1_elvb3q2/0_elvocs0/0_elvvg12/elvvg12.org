People always forget that in GoF Ron isn't upset that Harry allegedly put his name in the goblet- he's upset that Harry did it /without him/, because they're best friends. And he comes to his senses fairly quickly- the feud only drags on so long because Harry throws his apology (and a chess set, hard enough to draw blood) in his face when he tries. Harry isn't blameless here.

As for DH, Ron is under more stress than either Harry or Hermoine. Hermoine's family is safe and Harry has none- but Ron's whole family is on the front lines. Arther and Percy are in the Ministry, Bill and Charlie working for the Order, the Twins are on the run broadcasting an underground news station, and Ginny is living in a school run by Death Eaters. Every day the war goes on is another day where he might hear that someone he loves died, because they're all in harm's way. The locket no doubt fed on that, because Harry's obsession with hallows comes across as dicking around while his family is in danger from this perspective.
