One possibility is what [[/u/PsychoGeek][u/PsychoGeek]] wrote, that the secret became false when they died and thus it failed.

Another possibility is that it was Peter's betrayal that caused it to fail altogether. People tend to forget that for all it is used to hide things, the Fidelius charm is not a “hide stuff” thing but rather a “protect stuff [by hiding it/them] beneath a shield of loyalty” thing; this is why it is impossible to get the secret out of the secret keeper if it is not given willingly, and it might also be why the charm was not very effective with Peter throwing away what loyalty he had towards them and betraying them immediately and willingly.
