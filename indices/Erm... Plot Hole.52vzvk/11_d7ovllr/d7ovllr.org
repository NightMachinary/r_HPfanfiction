There's presumably a way to end the spell -- the Potters would want to come out of hiding when Voldemort died. If Pettigrew was faking his death, he had to end the spell somehow, or it would be a bit of a giveaway.

I don't see where Snape went to Godric's Hollow, but it is turned into a monument well before Pettigrew's death.
