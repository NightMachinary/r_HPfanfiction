  Why would Sirius fly his motorbike there instead of Apparating?

Magical travel (Apparating, Floo, maybe portkey) can be tracked/monitored is an underage wizard/witch is in the area according to /DH/ and as far as I can tell a baby Harry is definitely underage. And maybe they aren't safe for children that young/small, so if Sirius had to get Harry out of there, well, not many other options.
