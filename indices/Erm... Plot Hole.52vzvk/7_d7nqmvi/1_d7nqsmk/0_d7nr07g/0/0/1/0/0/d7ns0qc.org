I don't think so, because it doesn't seem like Dumbledore and Hagrid have met since Hagrid picked up Harry. For one, Hagrid tells Dumbledore that he got Harry out just as the Muggles were swarming the place, which I think is something Hagrid would have mentioned if he spoke to Dumbledore between getting Harry from Godric's Hollow and seeing Dumbledore at the Dursleys.

For another, Dumbledore asks Hagrid where he got the bike, and Hagrid got the bike upon arriving at Godric's Hollow and running into Sirius. So, Dumbledore didn't meet Hagrid after he got the bike until they see each other again at Surrey.
