Umm... there's the scene where Hagrid comes to get Harry from the hut in the middle of the ocean.

  “Sorry,” he said. “But it's that sad --- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find --- anyway . . .

There's also the photo album Hagrid gave Harry.

#+begin_quote
  “Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos . . . knew yeh didn' have any . . . d'yeh like it?”

This part implies Hagrid knew Lily and James at least well enough to still remember who they were friends with in school. Couldn't have been only Remus, and certainly couldn't have been Sirius as he was still in prison at the time.

These are all off the top of my head, but there may be more indicators in the books.
