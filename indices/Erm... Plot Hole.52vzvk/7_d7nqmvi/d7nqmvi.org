Honestly, there are some pretty big plot holes involving Halloween night 1981. If you try reconstructing the timeline of the night, you'll find it doesn't make sense either.

As for this one, I agree with Starfox 5, Hagrid probably already knew the secret. Snape, though... it's possible, I suppose, that Pettigrew told the secret to Voldemort while Snape was present, although seeing as Snape didn't know Pettigrew was the traitor, it's unlikely. Unless Pettigrew was under Death Eater mask and robes, as well as glamours so Snape couldn't recognise the Death Eater and assumed it was Sirius.

The truth probably is that JK just didn't think of it and it's a plot hole. Any explanation I can think of seems a little to convoluted to be plausible.
