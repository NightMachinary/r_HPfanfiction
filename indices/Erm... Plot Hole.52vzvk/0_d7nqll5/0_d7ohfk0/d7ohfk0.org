Upvoted because there are still people out there claiming such things as plotholes. There's a line in PoA that explains this very neatly imo. Approximate quote, because I can't be bothered to look for it.

"Voldemort could have pressed his nose against their window and wouldn't have been able to find them."

It's just one of those things that aren't explicitly spelled out. The Trace is not on the wand. The Potters' Fidelius hid the fact that /the Potters/ were hiding in the house in Godric's Hollow, not that the Potters were hiding /in this particular house in Godric's Hollow./
