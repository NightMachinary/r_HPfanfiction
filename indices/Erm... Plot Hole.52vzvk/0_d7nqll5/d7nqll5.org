My interpretation is this: the Fidelus Charm conceals not a place, but a secret. For example, in OOtP the secret is /the Headquarters of the Order is located at 12 Grimmauld Place/. The existence of the house itself wasn't the secret, because until the Fidelius was applied it /wasn't/ a secret.

So for the Potters, I'm assuming the secret was something along the lines of /James, Lily and Harry are hiding at Godric's Hollow/. But once James and Lily were killed, that was no longer true, and so the Fidelius fell.
