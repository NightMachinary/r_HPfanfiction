If the secret was "The Potter Family lives at Godrics Hollow" Then the secret was broken, because with just Harry left, there isn't a family anymore.

Or because the house was partially destroyed its not really a home anymore. Or Hagrid knew, since people who aren't the secret keeper can't exactly share that knowledge. I know Snape was only there in the movies, Nothing like that is mentioned in the books. I don't know if the Fidelius is ever explicitly mentioned in the movies though. Also since Dumbledore cast the spell in the first place it's entirely possible he just cancelled it. I assume he can do that as the original caster.
