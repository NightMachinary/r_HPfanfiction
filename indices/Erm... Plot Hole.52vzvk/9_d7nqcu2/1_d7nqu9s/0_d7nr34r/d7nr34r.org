  If Hagrid was told the secret then he would have known that it was Peter who was the secret keeper.

Not necessarily. We know from OoTP that the Secret can be written down and use that to induct someone into the Secret. One possibility: Sirius writes it down. Pettigrew traces. Bam, one paper that tells the Secret kept by Pettigrew in Black's handwriting. Another: Polyjuice Potion. Either in the Secret telling or the casting of the Fidelius (if Dumbledore is the caster).
