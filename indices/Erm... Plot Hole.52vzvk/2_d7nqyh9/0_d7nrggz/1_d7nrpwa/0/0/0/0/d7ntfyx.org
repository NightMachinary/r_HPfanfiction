I think they're banking on the assumption that if one of them dies, all of them are screwed anyway. I think it's very likely that the Potters barely left the house after they went into hiding. Probably just to get groceries or visit friends very rarely. The entire point of going into hiding, after all, was to avoid being killed by Voldemort who was targeting them specifically. It wouldn't really be safe or, really, smart to fight with the Order with that kind of target on your back.

So, it's probable they thought it wouldn't matter in the end. After all, if they were home all the time, the only way they could die is if they were betrayed and were attacked by Voldemort or his Death Eaters or both together. In such a scenario, it's clear that whether the Fidelius would continue to hold after one of their deaths is a rather pointless problem.

You'll also have to consider that they truly did not think Pettigrew would betray them. They wouldn't have made him Secret Keeper otherwise.
