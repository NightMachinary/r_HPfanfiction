That would depend on the way the secret was formulated. If the secret is something like "James and Lily and Harry live in Godric's Hollow", then any one of them dying would make the secret untrue. It's not as if they could anticipate James and Lily dying, but Harry somehow surviving.

Another plausible explanation is that infant Harry may not count as "magical" enough to be the subject of the fidelius all by himself. He wasn't old enough to have done any accidental magic, and there are instances of magical effects being different for different ages in the books, like the boat in the cave.

Whatever be the case, the Fidelius dying with Lily and James is canon, so we know that the secret was formulated in a way that Lily and James dying broke it.
