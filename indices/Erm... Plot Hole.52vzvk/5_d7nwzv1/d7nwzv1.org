I can see two interpretations that would apply, depending on your preference.

The first is the one I've been supporting for a while- the Fidelius is only ever used to protect the location of a building, so that must be the limits of its capabilities. Once Voldemort's body had exploded and thereby destroyed part of the house, it was no longer a shelter. The Fidelius falls.

Second version, probably more fitting: the essence of the Fidelius charm is the trust granted to the secret keeper to hold back the secret from any who would do harm to the subjects of the spell. Pettigrew broke the Fidelius when he chose to break their trust and inform their enemy of the secret.

In either case, given that Dumbledore didn't know who was the secret-keeper, he probably wasn't in on the secret. I'd see Dumbledore noting from some device in his office that he could tell where the Potters lived again, concluding that the protection had fallen, but to verify it while organizing other actions, he sent Hagrid to find out if it was true. Hagrid probably didn't know the secret and so sending him near to the location would be proof enough that the charm had been broken. In case a battle was still in progress, Hagrid would be most likely to survive falling into the middle of it, and there's reason to think the Potters would trust that it was him since Polyjuice might not have been able to work correctly with his half-giantness.

Meanwhile, Sirius could've been cruising around on his cycle and when he went to visit the Potters he'd found the wreckage and realized that he had a rat to hunt down, so he handed the cycle over to Hagrid so that Harry could be evacuated without traumatizing the possibly-injured toddler by Apparating.
