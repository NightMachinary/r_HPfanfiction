The fidelius doesn't so much hide but rather entrusts a secret. That's how it can be shared, because otherwise the first person brought into confidence would break the charm. This is not what happens, as we see with Grimmauld Place.

Instead, it's the /intent/ of the placed trust that is relevant. The Potters entrusted their safety from Voldemort, and their death at his hands is the betrayal of that trust.

The spell is called "Fidelius", not "Obscurus" or something. It's the charm of faith/trust, not secret.
