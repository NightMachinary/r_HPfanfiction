For the most part, no. The first book functions as sort of an overview of Harry's life with Sirius, as well as giving a view of how events at Hogwarts play out in Harry's absence. It will give you background on all of the main characters, and set the stage for what's to come, but it doesn't contain very much crucial plot information.
