I get where you're coming from. I'd very much like to read a story like this where Hermione is actually Hermione, even if she didn't end up making any good friends without Harry. It seems like a lot of authors take the crying in the bathroom episode in first year and extrapolate it out until Harry comes along.

In Feeling by Mister Barney, Hermione is getting along alright (if I remember correctly) and Harry is the 'loner', although she is unrealistically in awe of Neville because he vanquished Voldemort in 4th year, which felt OOC.
