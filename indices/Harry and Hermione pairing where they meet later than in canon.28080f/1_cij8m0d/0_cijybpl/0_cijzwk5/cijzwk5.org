I tried reading that one. It's not as egregious as most fics of this kind, but it really is more of the same.

Harry, as far as I can tell, has a fairly well thought out back story both before and during Hogwarts, complete with a fairly original reason for the enmity between him and Ron and Neville, and the author had given a lot of thought to how his personality had evolved. He has drive and ambition (for all that he is a Huffelpuff), and it's shown, not just told; and he was, apparently, secretly involved in many of the BWL!Neville's triumphs. Dumbledore is worried about him going Dark.

Hermione, on the other hand, has no real personality or agency (with pretty much the only initiative of any kind that she shows being towards Harry), positive or negative. What has Hermione been up to in her four years in Ravenclaw? I suspect that the author doesn't know or even care. Her accomplishments are limited to getting good marks.

Then, the story is contrived to put her into situations where she needs to be helped, rescued, or avenged; and she never does anything about anything, with powerful!Harry being the one to go out and fix her problems once he is in her life, often without her knowledge.

In Chapter 3, we find out that Harry is practicing Wandless Magic (tm). In Chapter 4, Neville and Ron, believing that Hermione has been mind-controlled by Harry, confront her, with the the confrontation becoming physical, with Ron (of course) grabbing Hermione's arm. Now, wouldn't it have been useful if Hermione could use wandless magic to escape his grip long enough to draw her wand?

But, alas, only Harry gets to do Wandless Magic (tm) in these fics, so Hermione has to pull away with physical force only, which results in her falling down conveniently placed stairs, so that she could be well and truly avenged.

TL;DR: It's not as bad as other examples, but no, this fic doesn't really break the pattern.
