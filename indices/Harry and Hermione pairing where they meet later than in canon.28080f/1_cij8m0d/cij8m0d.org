An annoying tendency I've found in these sorts of fics is that Hermione is invariably portrayed as basically useless and is not allowed to be happy or to achieve anything interesting until Harry enters her life (and, even after they meet, Harry usually does all the achieving anyway).

*BEGIN RANT*

Case in point, that /What We're Fighting For/ fic: while Harry is off growing his "magical core" and learning amazing wandless magic, Hermione has almost everybody in her year lining up to bully her, with the few that don't limiting themselves to merely ignoring and ostracizing her, all of which she passively accepts. (Correction: In the interests of accuracy, she did try to fight in some ill-defined past, but, unlike Harry, she wasn't allowed to actually win, so at the time the story begins, she does passively accept it.) She dates Krum in her fourth year, but he merely takes advantage of her and breaks her heart in the end, leaving her pining for a good man who would treat her right (which is where Harry comes in). Looking at what Krum does to her in some of the other fics linked in the thread, /she got off easy/.

Also, Ron is invariably Hermione's perennial bully, and is actually successful at it. Apparently, that time in canon that he made her cry once, early in their first year, with a remark that wasn't even directed at her or meant to be heard by her, after she had spent the prior two months thinking that he was her friend, means that his words have an Imperius-like power to make her wither any time he wants her to.

Oddly enough, in most of these fics, she is still excellent at magic, but, somehow, she never actually uses magic to actually improve her situation, at least until Harry shows up, at which point she still doesn't use it, because Harry fixes everything.

*END RANT*

With that rant out of the way, other than Kwan Li's work, are there any HP/HG fics where they don't meet and/or become friends until later, but where Hermione has agency, achievements, and dignity of her own before she meets Harry? (In other words, she doesn't have to be happy or fulfilled, but she isn't pitiful either, and if Harry had performed some badass feats in the meantime, her own feats should be comparable.)
