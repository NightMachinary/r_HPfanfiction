In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], Neville replaces Harry in the Golden Trio but the main pairing is HHr, with hints of a Neville/Hermione/Harry triangle. Warning: I personally found the ending extremely depressing. Multiple main character deaths. 250k+ words.

EDIT: Same deal with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]]. Harry's brother is the BWL, HHr pairing, Ravenclaw!Harry. The story was almost removed from portkey.org because of how depressing the ending was, but the author caved and added a time-traveling prologue to appease readers. 200k+ words.

For something a little more fluffy, there's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7325][Teacher's Pet]]. AU, Hermione signs up for Auror training. Her instructor turns out to be yesterday's one night stand. HHr, R/L, Lavender/Charlie.

EDIT2: Almost forgot about [[/u/KwanLi]]'s fantastic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]]. Not completed but recently and steadily updated. Probably the best characterization of a competitive relationship between Harry and Hermione. Slytherin!Harry
