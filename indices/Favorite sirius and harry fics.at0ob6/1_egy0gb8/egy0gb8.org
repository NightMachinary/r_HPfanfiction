I may not have much leg to stand on here, but I personally loved linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels (it's still ongoing up to the 4th year).

Another one that is entirely pre-Hogwarts is linkffn(The Letter by mango-melone). Kind of alike to Innocent, in a way. I think I even read them back to back once.
