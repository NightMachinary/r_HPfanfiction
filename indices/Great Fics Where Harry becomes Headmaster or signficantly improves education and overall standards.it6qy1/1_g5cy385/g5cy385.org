Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor

Though it is Dumbledore bash it is very interesting and Harry has the back of the ministry. He tries to change how the schools handle things but he gets attacked after only a week into the year but it is still in progress so we could see more with time. I love it!

Sorry no link, haven't figured out how to use it yet.
