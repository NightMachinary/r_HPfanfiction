  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

  5th Year AU - "There are those who believe that we should obey the 10 Commandments. But as our names suggest, Mr. Potter, Ms. Greengrass, we decide to follow an 11th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Speak. You have piqued our interest. We will be watching." The Dementors weren't the only ones to show up that day. NOTE: This story is not about religion or religious circumstances.
