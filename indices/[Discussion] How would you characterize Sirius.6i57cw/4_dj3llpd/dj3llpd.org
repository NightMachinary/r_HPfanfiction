I prefer the last one, with some added responsibility. This was a man who lived on rats in a cave an entire year fior the sake of his godson. That he propably walks down memory lane a couple of time isn't something I'd blame him for.

I think ShayaLonnie captures him well in Misplaced Moony, and I'm quite a fan of the "overprotective dad" Sirius (who's still got a sense of humour) in the Unknown Relations series.
