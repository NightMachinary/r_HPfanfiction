Clearly the best way to go with Sirius is to have him live up to his family name. Dude grew up with people like Walburga and Bellatrix, planned a murder by werewolf at fifteen (or thereabouts), went after Peter with murderous intent and came out of Azkaban after twelve years still harboring that murderous intent.

Sirius is my favourite canon character, but admittedly more for the potential than his actual portrayal.
