Deeply damaged by his ordeal in Azkaban, but holding it together for Harry. Quipping and joking and making lewd remarks, as well as pranking - all that's as much a facade as it is true. He's also quite cruel and brutal, though he tends to want an excuse to let that shine through. He's not as impulsive any more as he was, but he's brooding if he lets himself, and as reckless and foolhardy as he was as a teenager, possibly also subconsciously suicidal.
