I think slightly bipolar. He's a person who escaped an abusive insane family and had great friends. He escaped Azkaban and gets to see Harry and Remus again. Things to be hopeful and happy about. Sirius also fought in a war where his best friend died as did several other friends and one of his closest betrayed them, as a result he spent over a decade rotting in Azkaban and while the Dementors didn't affect him as badly as the others they still did get to him. He escaped only to be imprisoned within his former home with a portrait and a house elf for company both of which hate him.

Something to note about Sirius is he has a very odd sense of priorities and view on mortality. Look at Snape and Mooney, not saying he wouldn't hate Snape but that was too far and worst of all Remus would be the one to live with the consequences. Then there is the whole baby Harry vs Peter thing and how he tries to compensate for that in Harry's fourth year by living in a cave and eating rats. I don't know quite why he couldn't apparate around nor did he seem to use magic to improve his situation, maybe he couldn't or perhaps he felt he deserved to live like that after all that happened. Maybe he'd just gone round the bend.
