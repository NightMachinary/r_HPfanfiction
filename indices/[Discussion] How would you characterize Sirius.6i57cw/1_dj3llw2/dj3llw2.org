From what we see in OOTP, Sirius has always been a little on the moody side. He likes fun, for sure, but has a habit of taking it too far - perhaps speaking to his tendancy to be a little self-absorbed. He also seems to greatly admire James; there's suggestions that their humour played off each other a lot as a little comedy act. What they perceived as friendly banter may have been regarded by others as ganging up and bullying.

His characterisation is a major reason I find most Wolfstar fics unbearable. They often turn him into a sugar-high, effeminate, gushy stereotype with no basis whatsoever. Perhaps this is to highlight that Azkaban changed him, but honestly I don't think it did - I think it froze him in time and never let him grow up from the immature young man he was.
