As fr myself, I prefer the fifth, "Marauder" self, with just a hint of the second one. I don't like lewd humor in general, hence my dislike of Sirius #3, and while Sirius #4 could be an interesting character, I can't bring myself to like him at all, making it hard for me to feel particularly concerned about whether or not he escapes Azkaban.
