Sirius was never fully sane. No child would be growing up rebelling in the House of Black. He was a stubborn, impulsive, and dark humor driven child who lashed out at anyone he didnt think was kosher. He was a lazy, brilliant student who excelled at everything without trying. He was the pretty boy in the second row who would goof off during the lecture, and then preform the spell within the first ten tries. He was the idea man of the maruaders. He was the ambitious one, the wild card. Lupin was soft spoken, and a calming voice. Peter was the weaklink; the little brother that everyone found slightly annoying but loved anyway. James was the leader, the one who reigned in Sirius from crossing the line; by force if necessary. When I think of Sirius' decision making before Azkaban and Harry's birth it comes down to this line of thought: Is it funny? Will it harm my brothers? Does it benefit me or my brothers. It explains how he justified the attempted murder of Snape by werewolf. Snape would get cold feet before he even got close to Moony after all, and the look of fear would be priceless! No harm no foul right?... Then they graduated... and he had to grow up a bit... people were dying, disappearing, the War was on. He learned to love the fight... the /rush/ the /freedom/... the cheering with James, Lily, Peter and Remus after a good fight! Nothing compared.... then Harry was born... this little bundle of life... this beautiful child... as Sirius held him, something in him grew. By Merlin nothing in this world would Harm Harry Potter while he still breathed! And that was why he switched secret keepers.... he would protect Harry and James and Lily, and that was final.

When he saw James' body... I think something inside Sirius snapped. He only had two things running through his mind... secure Harry. Well Hagrid is here... and I fought with Hagrid, he's a bloody hard bloke to kill. If I put him on my bike, Hagrid will take Harry to Dumbledore where he will be safe... I have to exterminate the rat... the other threat to my godson...I must avenge James and Lily...

Those thoughts were what drove him to chase Peter, I bet. When Peter blew up the street, I honestly think that Sirius thought he killed himself. He started to laugh, knowing his world was crushed, his friends dead, the aurors surrounding him and then he was in *hell*.

Azkaban is not an easy place. It holds no remorse, pity or mercy in its stone walls... As Sirius sat in his cell for 12 years, his worst moments were replayed over, and over, and over. Every failure... he should have known Peter was the traitor...every flaw...if he had visited James and Lily earlier maybe they would be alive.... and most importantly... he abandoned Harry.

He breaks out... fuelled by the thought of protecting his godson from the threat of Pettigrew he some how powers through a mental and psychological trauma that has no true equal in the world of muggles. He finally sees Harry... most likely flying in the Quiddich match against hufflepuff... He most likely momentarily switches from Padfoot to Sirius to watch jam- no Harry... he's Harry... he just looks like James... fly... oh Merlin the boy can fly!

He would switch back abruptly... emotional overload, or maybe a lucid moment of understanding that he could not be seen there... not if he could save Harry.

this continues all through out Harry's third year. He becomes more and more lucid, and coherent. He mentally slowly applies Harry, oh he looks just like James, to James' place as his mental anchor.

It explains why there is always that vibe that Sirius is never healed... he never grieved. He was forced to relieve the death of James and Lily for 12 years. Remus we see has slowly moved on, as has the rest of the world... but not Sirius.

Azkaban, and his childhood, both left him with the pathological need to be free. He could have cleared his name if he really really wanted too. All it would take is some bribes from the Black fortune, and some Truth Serum after all. He remained a criminal because he was /free/ as a criminal. Until Order of the Phoenix, where Dumbledore ordered him to stay in his first prison...

Sirius is a guy who craves the rush, and never healed from the death and betrayal of his closest friends. He has a darker, wilder side than the other Marauders because he is a Black... each one has their obsession and Dark tendencies.

He did not look past his circle of personal friends... and Merlin help you if you harmed someone in that circle. That vendetta would never die.
