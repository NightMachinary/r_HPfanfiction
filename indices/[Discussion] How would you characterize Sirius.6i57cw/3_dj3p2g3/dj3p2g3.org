Sirius is actually a complex enough character, not to mention bipolar enough after living through Hell in Azkaban, that ALL of those characterisations might fit him to a bigger or lesser degree; they could be said to be five different sides of his character and which of them is in charge depends entirely on the mood he's in on that particular day, or who he's talking to.

If Harry or someone he cares about is feeling troubled and in need of support, Friendly Sirius is there to lend a sympathetic ear or treat them to a Butterbeer.

It the person he's talking to is Snape or Kreacher, or he gets antsy from being cooped up too long, Mean Sirius is front and center.

With the Weasley Twins, or if he just gets a case of the sillies, Marauder Sirius or Loony Sirius comes out to play.

And when time comes to action, Insane Sirius leaps into the fray with no thought for his own safety or for anything but the thrill of the battle.

All these sometimes self-contradictory moods are perfectly Sirius, and any fic portraying him as either has at least part of his canon characterisation down. It's just that these fics focus on one part of him to the exclusion of all the others.
