If there was a Sirius Black fandom I'd be there rather than here for sure. No other character in HP has caught my interest so much. I think he was pretty self destructive from early on, before Azkaban, even before he knew James -- and not a happy person. But this is part of what I wrote about him on my ffn profile.

  . . .. Haunted by the demons of grief and guilt, clever, impulsive, mercurial, charming, broken. And he's a dog. What's not to like?

Edit: And I kept looking but I was quite disappointed not to find any recs on the recent characterisations thread. Not surprised though, because when I asked for recs quite a while ago I didn't get any then either.
