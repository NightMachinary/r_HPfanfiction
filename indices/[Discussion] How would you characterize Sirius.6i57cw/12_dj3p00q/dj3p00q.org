I always found him to be stunted (with good reason) and immature, with poor self control. A compelling character in a lot of ways, but not an admirable one. He's a hothead; he goes after Peter for revenge immediately and gets himself locked up, doesn't think for a minute about how a drop of veritaserum or a touch of whatever flavour of mind reading would clear him to take care of the orphaned child he is now legal guardian of. He throws off responsibility in favour of revenge. Harry says that he doesn't think his dad would want his best friends to become murderers, but I personally think James wouldn't have been too impressed with Sirius anyway at that point. He and Lily entrusted their son to him and he blew it.
