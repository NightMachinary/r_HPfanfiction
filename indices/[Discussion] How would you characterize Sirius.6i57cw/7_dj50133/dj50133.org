I'm not going to go indepth on Sirius characterizations, except I will touch on one thing.

Sirius has an edge to him, both pre- and post-Azkaban. Pre-Azkaban he gave Snape just enough metaphorical rope to metaphorically hang himself via werewolf. Post-Azkaban, well, that should be obvious. Even if you have him joking or moody or whatever, there should be that dangerous edge of a dangerous man lying underneath.
