“Escape” is probably the best of them, not changing the personalities too much (and no super!characters), but even better is its sequel/prequel “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley” by SingularOddities linkffn(12373273), except it is Percy-centric, so there is not that much Hogwarts (well, there is not that much Hogwarts in “Escape” either, because HHr ... yes ... escaped).
