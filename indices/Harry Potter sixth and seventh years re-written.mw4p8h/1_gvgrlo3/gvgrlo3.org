[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]]: Harry befriends Daphne in Year 6 and she (and Astoria) helps him a lot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] is rewrite after Year 4, but Year 5 still has Umbridge at school. Year 6 then becomes utterly and completely different. Dumbledore is cast in a very good light though, and this Voldemort is dope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]]: Harry and Ginny gain super elemental powers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]]: Harry and Hermione run away from a marriage law (designed to screw them specifically) at beginning of Year 6, but they still direct war from behind the scene. Very helpful McGonagall, Snape, and the Grangers, but total bashing of Dumbledore. One of the best take on that marriage law atrocity.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]]: A little bit of crossover here, where super Hermione was activated during the DoM battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]]: A more forceful Harry bullied the truth out of Dumbledore during their first private lesson.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]]: Divergent after Year 6, UK military and allied Wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge, and Voldemort. The Trio helps with Horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Chaos ensue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]]: Alternate Year 7 written before DH, features super Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]: Year 7 becomes a total clusterfuck for the heroes until they get catapulted into another dimension.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]]: Another alternate Year 7 fic written before DH. This author got Harry's and Snape's status right. Not to be confused with the popular "Seventh Horcrux".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]]: After Dumbledore's death, Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia' in Britain.
