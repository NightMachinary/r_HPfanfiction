Hermione has been at the Order headquarters for a week and she's already starting to see Sirius as being a bit too rash and dangerous.

He keeps advocating to reach out to Harry, he doesn't mind the twins being involved. He isn't aggressive about it, but he makes his opinions known.

Slowly, going through the house she learns about Sirius's past and the person he used to be. He is nice to her following a hard conversation with Ron or her parents or something. She starts becoming more sympathetic.

Suddenly, Hermione finds herself falling for this older man.

Of course, nothing would happen but it could be one of those stories where the protagonists focus is in the wrong place cause she's dealing with a whole slew of issues.

Maybe the ordeal will teach her to be understanding and more accepting. It might cause her to confront insecurities she keeps suppressed under piles of books and good grades. Maybe the whole thing with Sirius would be the thing that nudges her to finally admit her feelings for Ron. Or notice him. Something like that.

This would probably have to be a pretty character studyish story and idk if you're into writing that kind of thing.

But the idea of Hermione doing something like falling for a totally inappropriate person and having to deal with underlying issues cause of that would be a great way to explore her character, IMO.
