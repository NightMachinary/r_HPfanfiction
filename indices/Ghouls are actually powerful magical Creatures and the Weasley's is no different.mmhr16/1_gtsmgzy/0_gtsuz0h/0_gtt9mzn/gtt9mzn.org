"Look, we were told 'go to the Weasley household and bring someone back."

"Yeah."

"And now they're all pissy because we did."

"Uh huh."

"I mean yeah, he looked like he was born out of the wrong orifice, but that's an occupational hazard when you share space with the Weasley twins. My niece had a lot to say about them at the last family reunion."

"Understandable."

"Also, a couple of raids ago, we didn't bring back that old guy who had dragon pox because hey, he had dragon pox! Nobody was going to touch that one, right?"

"Right."

"So there we were, in the Weasley house, nobody but ourselves and what looked like an unconscious ghoul for company and no Weasley hair in sight. Well, we had our orders, we had someone from the Weasley household in custody and nobody wanted another long-winded lecture followed by a crucios, so our raid coordinator goes 'fuck it, mission accomplished' and we left."

"Good call."

"We thought so too. But then we get to the Malfoys and Crabbe just grabs the ghoul and chucks it into the main holding cell. The leader tells him 'wait, no, bad idea' but that dumb bastard looks at us with that empty look on his face until we go grab some rest. We report to Malfoy, he says he'll handle it, we wash our hands of the whole thing and go on our merry way."

"Mission accomplished."

"Right, right? Except now we're on construction duty because Malfoy flubbed the transfer and Bellatrix was on the rag and looking for a victim to take the edge off. I swear that crazy bitch's sanity anchor is our Dark Lord's junk."

"It is."

"So yeah, I'm off the patrol schedule for a couple of weeks. Gonna be playing Bob the Builder until the actual construction team gets through customs, so there's a lark. Can't I, you know, defect or something now? Please? I need to detox after all that Dark Magic crap everyone's delving into like it's their favourite sweets shop and I just want a bloody vacation already."

"... No."

"No? Why bloody not?"

"Because if I'm stuck here as Headmaster, babysitting the Carrows and keeping the rest of the school from noticing that the Gryffindors are smuggling in enough high explosives, dubious potions ingredients and food to fight another bloody war, then you can tough it out until the end of the year whilst doing challenging work such as clearing some rubble and repainting the Flamingos or what have you. Just update me on the food schedule or whatever you can."

"Okay?"

"And the next time I ask for a report, I want a report. I hear enough bitching about the general competence of the Dark Lord's finest from the students. I don't need it from you as well. Now begone, I'm sure there's a wheelbarrow somewhere with your name on it."

"Funnily enough, Lucius did give me one of th-"

"OUT!"

"Alright, alright Mr Grumpy pants. Sheesh..."
