Hmm...I've reached chapter 6 and I'm feeling like dropping it. Instead of exploring what it was like to be in the nonmagical world for years, it's veered more into OP!Indy!Harry territory - less egregiously than some, but still, he's shaping up to be better off than canon. After spending three years, not in Hogwarts, but in conditions that could well be described as actual slavery, where he is compelled to work long hours while his uncle gets all his salary, he is nonetheless better adjusted than canon and quickly gathers quite a lot more assets.
