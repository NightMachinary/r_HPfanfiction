PONY!!! :) I love this story just for the premise! Yes I read it for the initial stuff about Harry not going to Hogwarts! I'd love to read like a FULL story of Harry just living a normal life like that maybe. Or maybe where he does get wrapped up in magic war stuff but as an adult! So it's like WAY later! :) Imagine trying to sell the whole prophecy chosen one stuff to middle management office worker Harry! :)

It'd be kind of like the Matrix. :o
