I managed to finish this but it was a struggle at times.

The initial setup is the usual over-the-top abused!Harry trope. It does give him a career, which is unusual, but apart from that it's pretty standard fare.

The big twist is obviously that he's not allowed to attend Hogwarts, and the story makes a big deal of how there's no way the magical world can override the will of the Dursleys because they're Harry's guardians. But of course that's exactly what happens with the standard emancipation gambit.

After that it's really just a slog through outrageous coincidences and luck until we get to the end. The friends he's made are pretty much tossed aside and he moves on. There's a sequel but after a couple of chapters I realised I didn't care what happened to this Harry at all.

Pros: It's written well enough that you're not stumbling over spelling and grammar errors ever sentence.

Cons: You've read it all before.
