Okay, so help me out here. I'd actually recently begun rereading this series, and I swear the sequel used to have more chapters. I remember that the British Ministry went so far as to attack the dragon reserve to try to get Harry back, and all the reserves banded together to remind them that they were in fact independent of magical governments. Am I confusing this with another story with a similar premise, or is this a rewrite (because I don't remember any of this speaker FOR dragons plotline)?
