I cannot remember the name of it but that is the basis of a rather good fanfiction. He winds up bring his soul back together and realizes his insanity was a side effect of the Horcrux's. He somehow winds up as Harry's guardian under his Tom Riddle name. He actually is rather likeable overall.

It is a great Mentor!Tom Riddle fic. Now I want to read it again actually lol.
