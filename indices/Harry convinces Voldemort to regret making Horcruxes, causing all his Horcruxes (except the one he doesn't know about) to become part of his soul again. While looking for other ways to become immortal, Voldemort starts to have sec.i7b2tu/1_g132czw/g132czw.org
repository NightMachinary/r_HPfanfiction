I'm reminded of GIJoe vs Transformers 3 where Serpentor is an advanced BAT who's programming has been influenced by Megatron. He takes control of the Decepticons and manages to beat down Optimus and rip the Matrix of Leadership out of him. He uses the Matrix and gains the ultimate wisdom of the universe... he's a dick. He realizes evil is bad and starts to give the Matrix back to Optimus. Decepticons are all, "Uh, boss... You ok?"
