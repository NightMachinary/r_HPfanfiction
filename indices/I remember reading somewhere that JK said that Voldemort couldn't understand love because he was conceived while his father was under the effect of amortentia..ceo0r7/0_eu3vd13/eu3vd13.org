  *Ravleen:* How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  *J.K. Rowling:* It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him... The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.

It's /symbolic/, not literal. Voldemort didn't understand or value love because he had never been loved, not because he was physically incapable of feeling love.
