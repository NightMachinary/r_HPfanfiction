Comes from misinterpretations of JKR statements, and fanon/fanfic running with it so people forget that it was never in the books. Like people thinking that Snape was Draco's godfather.

If you dig down far enough, there's usually an official source that bears a resemblance to the fanon. That "wizards shitting on the floor" meme, for example, came from a legit JKR Pottermore page.
