The Draco/Astoria relationship from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/aw0csj/draco_thinks_the_trio_are_his_best_friends/ehjhpku/?context=8&depth=9]] would be an interesting prompt, especially if Harry got with Daphne and has the same relationship as they do. Harry & Astoria telling the others off for their blood supremacy. Everyone else is just like; "Why don't you just swap? Why are you with Daphne/Astoria when Astoria/Daphne would be so much better for you?" And Harry & Draco just nod conspiratorially at each other...

Does that make any sense?
