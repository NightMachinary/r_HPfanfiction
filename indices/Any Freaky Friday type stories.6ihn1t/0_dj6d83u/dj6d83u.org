The only one I know of is this Snape/Hermione one: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html]] They accidently switch bodies in a potions accident.

Edit: Just remembered this one too: Witching Hour by LadyFlorentine [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12506007/1/]] where Dumbledore and Harry wake up to find they switched bodies. It only has one chapter so far but it's really funny.
