Not that you are recommending it, just linking it, but FWIW I thought the Curse of Truth kinda sucked. I cannot understand why it gets recommended so often. It is 200K words of stream of consciousness (for the most part) writing. The author even explains that he didn't know half the time what was coming up and just wrote each chapter as it came - which made for weird and unfulfilling plot. He even changes the name of the main character just one chapter in.

There is also a ton of weird stuff where he kisses Hermione and then makes Harry kiss her and it goes nowhere. The M rating also makes no sense - the most graphic thing is a kiss.
