Yes, of course! How did we ever forget that the trio are immune to torture and the truth potion? That was the entire reason they were chosen after all! Not plot induced stupidity! /s

Honestly, having a two or three (not all) capable and trustworthy Order members responsible for the horcrux hunt would be far more sensible. These were people who were trusted to provide security for Harry too; if they were to betray Harry as supposed here, the canon plot collapses.
