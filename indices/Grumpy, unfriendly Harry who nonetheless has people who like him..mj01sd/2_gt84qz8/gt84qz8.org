Try Fighting the Green linkao3(1955451). It has an unfriendly, rude and oversensitive Harry but it still shows him to be a caring and loyal friend.

I know you said no slash, but the fic looks abandoned and I'm pretty sure it cuts off before Harry and Draco get together. I'm on chapter 17 out off 20 and they can barely be considered friends and I don't think things will change too much in the last three chapters.

Edit: It definitely cuts off before slash comes into play. The author said that relationships will happen in the fourth year and the fic stops during Harry's second year.
