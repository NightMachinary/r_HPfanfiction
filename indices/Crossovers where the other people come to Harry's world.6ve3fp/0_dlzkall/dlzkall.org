linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) shows a /Dungeons & Dragons/ wizard called Milo teleported into the /Harry Potter/ world. It's a clever and often very funny story, and is totally within the reach of someone who doesn't even know anything about /Dungeons & Dragons/ beyond "It's a fantasy-themed RPG."

linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) starts with the cracky premise that since literally /anyone/ would have been better than Umbridge, none other than Darth Vader is hired as the D.A.D.A. teacher. Then it takes it dead-seriously and, despite a few narrative wonky moments, manages to mix the /Star Wars/ and /Harry Potter/ worlds better than anyone could imagine.
