  "What exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"

"Ah, well, you've heard about those? It's a ... toy. Just a toy."

"Some even have /batteries/, I think?"

"Yeees. Well, you see, it's an (whisper) /adult/ toy."

"Adult? How so?"

The kitchen gradually goes quiet as Harry visibly fidgets.

"Well, adults need to relax and have fun too, you know. So, weather's been nice lately..."

"But I don't understand, how am I supposed to play with a rubber duck?"

"Errr, it's mostly females. Could you please pass the..."

"But, but, how would a female play with this that a male wouldn't?"

The kitchen is silent. Nobody says a word, while eggs are dying a smoking death in the frying pan.

"Ah, heh, sometimes, when the husband ... errr ... and the wife still has ... unreleased tensions ... then the rubber duck relaxes tense muscles ... you're a married man, I'm sure I don't have to explain..."

"/Arthur!/ Perhaps..."

"But /children/ play with these!"

"Well, yeees..."

Mrs. Weasley faints while Mr. Weasley looks horrified.

Later Harry is cornered by Fred and George.

"Is that really true, that bit about rubber ducks? Mum's fainted three times now, and Dad hasn't said a word since breakfast. Ginny's been really weird, too. So, is that really true?"

"Don't be daft. I'd have thought you two would have realized."

"We've been pranked? Damn."

"Though there /are/ adult versions that looks /exactly/ like the regular ones, but they're really expensive and sold only in specialty stores."

"Damn. We've been double pranked. So, where are these "specialty stores"? Asking for a friend, of course."

"Of course you are. Wait, you have friends?"
