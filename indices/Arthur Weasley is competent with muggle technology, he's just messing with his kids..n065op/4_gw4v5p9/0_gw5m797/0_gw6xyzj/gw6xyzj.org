Eh.. I think it makes some sort of sense in canon.

You grow up in the wizarding world... there's literally a spell for everything. Magic just obliterates the mundane in terms of usefulness.

Toasting bread? There's a spell for that. Cleaning clothes? There's a spell for that. Tidying up? There's a spell for that.

Arthur's fascination with muggle tech and lack of knowledge about it also acts as a stand-in for wizarding culture in general. Wizards don't view muggles as fellow humans, they view them with an Attenborough-esque fascination or a Hitler-esque disdain; something to be studied or exterminated.

Arthur asking about rubber ducks? Sure, paint that as fatherly banter, or do whatever to his character, it's fan fiction, that's the whole point, but I think his curiosity and lack of knowledge is a legitimate portrayal in canon.
