Well, I honestly think that's how Rowling intended it, but still. No.

A lot of characters in HP for the side characters are Brit soap opera cliches.

Fleur is the French bitch, though she gets a bit of expansion especially in the last book. Arthur is the stupid dad. Fudge and Scrimgeour are caricatures of bad politicians, etc.
