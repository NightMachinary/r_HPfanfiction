There are too few fics with a cool/decent Arthur. I remember one scene I read who knows where that had Harry asking Arthur something, and Arthur revealing to him and Percy that he used "magesight" in his job (finding cursed or hexed muggle artifacts being part of what he does) and Percy being really impressed because it took so much skill and dedication to learn to use.

Have no clue what that was from though, which really sucks.
