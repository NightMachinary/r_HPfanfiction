Maybe it sounds like I'm jumping on the bandwagon, but I always sort of assumed this was canon. Arthur is basically the walking embodiment of the goofy dad sterotype. You can also clearly see that there are traits from the Prewett side of the family and traits from the Weasley side present in all of the Weasley children, but the making jokes and having people on thing doesn't visibly belong to either. I'm not suggesting that a sense of humor is genetic, but the twins obviously didn't learn it from Molly or Aunt Muriel.

Arthur, Bill, and Charlie are the only real sources it could have come from. And Arthur is upstream of Bill and Charlie.

Seeing how actually competent witches and wizards like McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Shacklebolt seem to be fully aware of how to dress and pass themselves off as muggles (though I imagine Dumbledore insists on wild colors just because he knows no one can stop him), I have difficulty imagining the Department Head of the division of the Ministry that deals with muggles is actually that stupid.

A certain amount of the obliviousness is real, probably, because Harry Potter runs on Monty Python logic, and that's canon. I'm entirely willing to believe Arthur does not understand electricity, just to give one example. But I'm pretty sure at least a portion of it is exaggerated. He's just doing it to have people on.
