If you want to, you're welcome to read any of mine lol are you on fanfiction.net or AO3?? I'm on both and I've written a plethora of dramione fics. I'm not saying they're good or anything, but they are there. You can also click on my Favorites and see the very large amount of incredible works from other authors I've read and have thoroughly enjoyed.

Edit: also in my Favorites there are several different pairings - I like to read different ships but often tend to just write dramione.
