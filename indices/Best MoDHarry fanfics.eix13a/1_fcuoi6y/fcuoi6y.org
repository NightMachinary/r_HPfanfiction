linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]]) - dead things, gen. It's simply brilliant. MoD is a curse here :^ )

linkao3(tell me whether he is dead), gen

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Time to put your galleons where your mouth is) - classics, gen. Although "time to..." doesn't really focus on Harry being MoD.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10218541]]) - As good as Death - actually, I don't remember what it was about, but I read it 2,5 years ago, marked as "liked" and put in my mod collection, so...

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]]) - Train to Nowhere (it's said to be tomarry) - It's very good and it's probably MoD or something related? I haven't progressed far into the story but I know that if Harry gets knocked out, he spawns on King's Cross and talks with dead Albus

linkffn(It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts), snarry, - it's an old fic and full of tropes but it was almost the first fic for me and I liked it very much :') Also there's an interesting plot. But really, beware of tropes. And Snape is OOC here... And Harry, I guess........... Very good recommendation from me, yeah

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244]]) - Spoonful of Sugar, gen - good one, I hope it gets updated

I'm not sure about recommending linkao3(survival is a talent), drarry, and linkffn(The Bitter Hug of Mortality) as Harry is a born necromant there but they both are very interesting. In the latter one Harry even interacts with Death one time.

Linkffn(On a Pale Horse) - another classics, abandoned

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155]]) - Full Circle, tomarry, very good and interesting and I don't remember MoD parts there but it's in my collection so I have to rely on old me

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21033122]]) - Life 15, summary reminds of Again and Again but is actually a good fic, WIP

linkffn(Again and Again), tomarry (but tomarry scenes are designed to be skippable, so try it) - classics, very interesting. I love how Harry just doesn't care anymore. Also, I liked parts where Harry publishes his non-fiction works in political magazines.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2528972/chapters/5621090]]) - Hell to Raise. Abandoned but interesting and good. Harry is an accidental necromant here and he accidentally reanimates dead things :^ )

--- not sure ---

Here we step into the "not sure" and "I heard about it" territory, so be prepared

linkao3(The Graveyard Is Empty Because The Ghosts Are In My Head) - abandoned, gen. The beginning (when Harry is back in time) is full of tropes (he's lord potter-black-insert-many-surnames-here, I almost dropped it there but I was curious and read further) but actually after Gringotts it's pretty good.

linkao3(Just for an Hour of Every Day), snarry, linkffn(Hallows and Pathos), gen, - I haven't read them.

linkffn(Be Careful What You Wish For) which is preface for linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783]]), rise of the wizards. Haven't read.

linkffn(Coming Back Late; Path of Decision). Knowledge of Sandman in the latter one is not required, they say. Haven't read.

linkao3(Inevitabilities) - Harry is a necromant here. Haven't read.

linkao3(Be the Death of Me) - interesting idea and well written. Death's subordinate fucked up and took Harry's soul when Death and Fate made a deal long ago about him surviving. Death feels guilty and decides to have his first vacation since the beginning of his existence and ventures into the mortal world to live as Harry Potter. Sounds very interesting, right? Why would it be in the "not sure" section? It's readable only up until the start of second year (if not earlier). The author got impatient and wanted lemons. The pairing is snarry. The result is disgusting. I understand that Death is millions years old and it's just his body that is 12 years old. And his body is very horny. It would be probably tolerable if only Death felt that way. But when Snape starts having wet dreams about mf 12 years old boy... WTF??? So. I advise you to read it until the end of the 1st year, then drop it and say "ah, it's so sad that it's unfinished". This part is really interesting. And I liked the interactions between deities.

linkao3(The Arts of Potions and Spells) - haven't read.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) - haven't read and never will. I'm sensitive about Snape and I like him portrayed as a good or neutral guy. Here he is clearly not tolerated so I dropped it pretty early.

linkffn(Of Shadow, Shine And Shades), snarry - I almost haven't read it.

linkao3(The Dead Master) - abandoned, I read it, marked as liked but I don't remember it. There was something about Harry being partially dead?.. Like he had no pulse, for example?..

linkao3(The Call of Death) - it's good but it has only a few chapters and was updated in September... Maybe if we bombard it with comments, the author will want to continue?

And a bonus oneshot - linkao3(2Spooky)

--- crossovers ---

Here are some abandoned crossovers with Naruto: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10052824]]; Ninja Who Lived; Multicolour Post Its) linkao3(Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black)

Here is a finished crossover with Dragon Age, it also has a finished sequel: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10001746]])

I'm no fan of Marvel but there are a lot of crossovers with it. Probably better wait for other users or use filters on ao3 to find them.

If you're interested, here is my [[https://fanfics.me/collection37841][collection]]. It's on a russian site but if I post a comment for a work, it's mainly in English. It has fics from ffn and ao3. For all those who are concerned about publishing others' works: they are not published. It's just a name of a fic, name of its author, its summary and a source link. Nothing more is stored.
