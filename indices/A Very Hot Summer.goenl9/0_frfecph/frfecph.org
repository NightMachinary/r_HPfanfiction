Tried to find his stories too, but he seems to have done a very good job of erasing all traces of his work from the internet.

He removed them from all sites and they even got removed from fictionhunt, at his request I guess. And the waybackmachine doesn't have them either for some reason. So I fear your only chance would be if someone has an offline copy saved.
