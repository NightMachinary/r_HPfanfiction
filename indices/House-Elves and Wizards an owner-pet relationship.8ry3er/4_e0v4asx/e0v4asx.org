I am inclined to agree this is best for a silly story. Though Dobby taking Lucius to be neutered would explain why Draco is an only child, when an heir and a spare would be much more sensible.

I don't really think it fits an owner pet relationship from a human perspective. If you had a load of wild versions of your pets running around killing your pets you would probably see humans putting them down. Also the elvish tendency towards self-abuse does seem to extend beyond Dobby (see Kreacher and Winky).
