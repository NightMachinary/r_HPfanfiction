But the thing is, wanting to be a servant is perfectly fine - wanting to be a slave isn't fine. Brainwashed or not, it's wrong. Even if you want to be a slave, you should be freed - since you do not lose anything. As a free elf, you can still work for free for your family. But as a slave, you cannot leave, even when you're abused.

The problem with the SPEW plot is that it pretty much turns everyone who doesn't at least support Hermione's movement after she starts it into an evil scumbag or an absolute braindead moron who can't even understand how evil slavery is.

So, where would Dumbledore be on this issue? The Weasleys? The Longbottoms? Bones? The Order? On the side of evil, or on the side of good? Why would purebloods who were willing to risk their lives for muggleborns not oppose slavery?
