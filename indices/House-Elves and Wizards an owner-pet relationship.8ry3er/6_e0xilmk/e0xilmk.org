I actually go the other way. The way I handle it in my stories is that house elves (unlike, say, goblins and giants) are working animals magically bred up to human intelligence. This allows their psychology to be different enough that they genuinely want to be servants and aren't just brainwashed, without going to the dumb "living off their owner's magic" trope.

I do this in large part because if you actually approached canon!house elves from a real world perspective (i.e. Hermione's), as [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] said, it would cause so much conflict that it would derail the story.

...Although that might be a good story in its own right. Hermione blows up at Ron and anyone else who supports house elf enslavement in second year. She starts SPEW earlier and quickly recruits Dean, followed by many of the other muggle-borns (who like canon!Hermione might not even know about house elves yet). This causes more conflict by separating the muggle-borns even more from the rest of the school, and she has to face the struggle of fighting a hopeless uphill battle to free the elves that most of her new social circle agrees is more important than the fact that the elves themselves don't want it.
