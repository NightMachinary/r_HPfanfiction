That is an... interesting motivation.

Rowling intended her fictional world to be deeply flawed. Over the course of seven books we get to increasingly see the ugliness and the disarray behind the beauty of the magical world. The government ranges from inept to corrupt. Bigotry is common. At its most extreme is the violent terrorism of the Death Eaters. But there are also 'softer' forms, like Lupin struggling to get a job as a werewolf and only barely being allowed into Hogwarts. And that's just what's clearly meant by the author. Stepping outside that, it's easy to find evidence of more problems with wizarding Britain. For example, it can be seen as a society where child abuse is common and accepted---consider how casually it's mentioned that Neville was held by feet outside of a window by his great uncle, who 'accidentally' dropped him. One can also look for evidence of economic inequality. And there's the casual dismissal of muggles as having any sort of rights or being fully human---cough obliviation cough cough. Or the massive fucked up-ness that is Azkaban.

The house elf thing is just one more on the list (though admittedly, one that Rowling doesn't fully explore). Why would you want to whitewash over the author's presentation of her world as full of serious social ills?
