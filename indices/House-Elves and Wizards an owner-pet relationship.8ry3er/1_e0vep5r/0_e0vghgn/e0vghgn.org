This is a good summation. At best, the wizard-elf relationship is one of indentured servitude. In reality and practice, it's slavery. There is no other way to sugarcoat it. Maybe some elves are treated well, just like in real life there were slaves who were "treated well", but at the end of the day, they were slaves.
