It raises far more interesting moral questions for slavery to exist and for even the 'good guys' to practice it. Can you be own slaves and still be a moral person? The Order of the Phoenix don't free Kreacher because they don't feel it is tactically sensible, but would they if they could (probably not, except if you're Sirius to torment him)? If you are against it who can you ally yourself with to do the right thing?

The world should be messed up. Aiming to remove the problem of House Elves from wizarding society such makes for a blander picture or in some cases simply reverses the problem by foisting it onto the muggle world (which wizards could justly criticise hypocrisy and for still using slaves today, for instance in the sex trade or in various other professions even within well-off countries).
