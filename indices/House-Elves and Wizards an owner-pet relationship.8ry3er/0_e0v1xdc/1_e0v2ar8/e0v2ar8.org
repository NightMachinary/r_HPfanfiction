But Dobby's canonically considered to be a weirdo by the other elves, so assuming house-elves are pretty much indestructible to physical abuse (which I always kind of thought anyway considering how casually he talks about ironing his own hands), he could be the kind of weirdo who 1) takes the whole thing way too seriously, and 2) is, what, proud that he can't even take care of his own wizard family?
