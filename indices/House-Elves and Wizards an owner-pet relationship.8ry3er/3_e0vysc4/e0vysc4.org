Why don't you want to believe that? is it as hard to believe that the entire United States was complicit in slavery of OTHER HUMANS? Don't wash over it, don't try to come up with alternate explanations, because there isn't any. It happened, it's how it is. Accept it. It's horrible, it's disgusting, and it's real. Work with the problems in the story, ask questions about it. That's way more interesting to face it head on, rather than try to twist it into something "acceptable" in your own eyes.
