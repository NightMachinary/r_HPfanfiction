I know a couple of good ones. Most of them are actually with a pairing of Hermione/Sirius but it's okay since she travels back in time to the 1970s.

First one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12798733/1/A-Good-Life][A Good Life]] and it's really good

Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][The Debt of Time]] is amazing but it can be quite explicit.

Sadly, I read most of my fanfiction in Russian so I don't know any other stories to suggest to you.
