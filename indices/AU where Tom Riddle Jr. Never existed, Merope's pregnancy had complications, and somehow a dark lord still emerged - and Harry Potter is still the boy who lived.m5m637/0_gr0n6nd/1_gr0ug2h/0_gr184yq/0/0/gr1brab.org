She wasn't raised to be a logical thinker.

Canon didn't tell us much about how Tom eventually escaped. (I don't think of escaping from a rapist as “dumping” someone.) Dumbledore had his ideas, but he didn't know for certain. I have my own ideas about this in my own fic, but there are various ways to extrapolate from the few hints we get in canon.

Ah. I'm happy to say I've never read a fic that bad.
