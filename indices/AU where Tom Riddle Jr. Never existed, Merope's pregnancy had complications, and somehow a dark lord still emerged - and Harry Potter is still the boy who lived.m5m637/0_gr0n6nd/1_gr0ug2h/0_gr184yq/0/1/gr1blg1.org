To your first point: self-delusion. She'd been living in a world where she felt she was loved and over time deluded herself into thinking it was real actual love that had nothing to do with the potions. The same thing happens in Weasley-bashing stories, where Ginny (if she's not cold and calculating) always seems to say something like "I knew you loved me deep down; you just needed help showing it!"

For the second, I don't know if the authors of those fics actually believe Riddle Sr. is the bad guy and Merope was just a poor girl who deserves his love (and if they do, ew, that is some massive gross Nice Guy nonsense), but something like that is probably necessary to transform Merope and Riddle Jr. into the good guys.
