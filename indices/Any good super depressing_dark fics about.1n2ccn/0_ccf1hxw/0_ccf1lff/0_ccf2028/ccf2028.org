It's a long story, but the short of it is that site rules stipulate that you cannot post a story where [[/spoiler][Ginny dies]]. And the story rubbed some people the wrong way.

I think the larger subtext was that something so dark and dystopic could eke out "Best Story" and "Best Drama" in one of their contests. It's usually the case at SIYE that their awards go to fluff, WAFF, or to one of their Moderator's cheesy self-inserts. This story was not that.
