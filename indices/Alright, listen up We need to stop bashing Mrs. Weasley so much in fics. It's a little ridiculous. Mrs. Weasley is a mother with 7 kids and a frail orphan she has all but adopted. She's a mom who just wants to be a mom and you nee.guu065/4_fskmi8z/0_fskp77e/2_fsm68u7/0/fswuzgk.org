Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I don't want to spend any more time on this conversation than I have to---not least because the ancestor posts have been downvoted into hiding and so I have no idea who is still reading this---so I'll try to be brief.

1. I think that any criticism that is factually accurate is fair. The line between the objective and subjective is a fine one and is often itself subjective, which leaves us with the marketplace of ideas: I'm a judge; you're a judge; the writer is a judge; everyone's a judge!
2. If the author intends to give a character a non-canon characterisation, the only thing I ask is that they put it in the summary or in the A/N. It is when bashing and other degradation is sprung on the reader without warning that it becomes a problem. If the reader notices, then it's a theft of the reader's time, because the reader had invested time in reading the fanfic under the assumption that the writer was writing in canon universe unless otherwise stated. If the reader doesn't notice, then it's more insidious, because the reader's view of canon is nudged towards the degraded portrayal---which will influence the reader if they ever write, thus polluting the whole fanfic ecosystem.
3. I would ask the proponents of the Don't-Like-Don't-Read maxim to apply it to criticism: don't like to be criticised, don't read the criticism.
