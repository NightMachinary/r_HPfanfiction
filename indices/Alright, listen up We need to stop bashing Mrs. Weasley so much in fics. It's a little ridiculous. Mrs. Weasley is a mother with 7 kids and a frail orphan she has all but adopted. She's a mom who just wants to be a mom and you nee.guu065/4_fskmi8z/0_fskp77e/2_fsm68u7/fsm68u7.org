I somewhat agree with you in the sense that, whatever the craft, your art is open to critique once you publish it, and that there are ways to objectively criticize art. However, I think that the disconnect between you and the other people here is that most people don't read fanfic because they think it's good art. Don't get me wrong, a lot of fanfics are well-written, plenty of people write fanfic to improve their skills, and a lot of people only enjoy fanfics that are well written. But that's only a portion of people who read and write fanfics. Others do it as a hobby to get their stories out and don't care about improving as an artist, others don't care about the quality as long as it's readable and it fills what they're looking for. Others still might purposefully read poorly written fics. A lot of people just sort of see it as something to read for entertainment and not think about it too hard, like Transformers. While you can criticize it, most people aren't going to care. It's kind of like trying to criticize The Room; no one watches The Room because it's an amazing drama or should be treated as such, but because it's entertaining.

This goes a bit deeper than your original statement and touches on criticism as a whole, mostly the last part of the comment I'm replying to. However, as for bashing, simply disliking a trope isn't enough to objectively criticize it. There's a reason that tropes exist, and the usage of tropes doesn't make something inherently bad. Look at the Star Wars OT: it's just The Hero's Journey but in space. But it still uses that template well and makes a decently original take on it. So the issue wouldn't simply be the usage of a trope, but rather how it's used and how the story is written as a whole. Another thing is that you can't really compare canon characterizations with fanfic ones, unless the person is trying to make it canon-compliant up to a certain point, in which case, if the characterization is grossly inconsistent with canon, then it's fair enough to criticize. However, pretty much every fanfic is its own universe with its own characters who have the same names. So you need to see how each individual fic portrays the characters and judge them one at a time rather than throwing out a blanket statement saying that all fics that include this are bad. The most well-written fanfic out there could very well be a Molly bashing fic, or at least something you would consider Molly bashing.
