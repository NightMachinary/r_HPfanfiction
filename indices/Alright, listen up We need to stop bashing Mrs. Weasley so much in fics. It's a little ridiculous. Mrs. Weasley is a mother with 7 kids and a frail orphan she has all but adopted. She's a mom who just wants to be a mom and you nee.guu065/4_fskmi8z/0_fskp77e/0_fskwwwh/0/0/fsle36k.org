Most people who write want to tell a certain story. Quite a few, myself included, write what they want to read but can't find.

You claim that just reading something makes people write the same. I call bullshit. I've talked to a few people and we agree that if anything, reading something makes you want to write the opposite, to do things right rather than whatever we've just read. Obviously "right" is subjective, but to say that authors just echo what's popular, no matter how bad, is honestly insulting.
