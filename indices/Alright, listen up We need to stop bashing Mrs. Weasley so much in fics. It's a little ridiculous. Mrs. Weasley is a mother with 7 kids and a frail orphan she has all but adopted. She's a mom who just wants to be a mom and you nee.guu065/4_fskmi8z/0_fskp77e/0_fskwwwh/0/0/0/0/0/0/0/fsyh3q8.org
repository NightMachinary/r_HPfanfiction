Even if only 10% were serious, that's still almost 60 at this point.

Bashing is just an extreme form of negative character distortion, and it is often a sum of milder ones accumulating up. Say, a writer might read a hundred Harmony fics in which Hermione is portrayed as an authority-worshipper "rescued" by Indy!Harry from this mindset---a portrayal that is actually sympathetic, if degrading. Then, they sit down to write a non-Harmony fic, and when Hermione makes an appearance, her fanon authority-worship becomes a point of bashing.

The example I gave elsewhere on the thread---that Dumbledore prevented his friends from writing to Harry during the summer of OotP---is a very common misconception and an inconsequential detail in the grand scheme of tings. And yet, it motivates massive amounts of conspiracy-mongering and Dumbledore-bashing.
