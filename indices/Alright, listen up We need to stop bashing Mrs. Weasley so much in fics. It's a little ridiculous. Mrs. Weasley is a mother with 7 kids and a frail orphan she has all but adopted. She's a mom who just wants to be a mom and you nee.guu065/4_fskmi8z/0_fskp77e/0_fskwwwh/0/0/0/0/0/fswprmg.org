Can you tell me how often you've seen a bash or some other distortion and kept reading without a reaction? I don't think you can, because it's not a conscious process. And, that's without getting into you being fairly exceptional, as far as I know.

As it happens, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gw0409/what_did_you_read_so_often_in_fanfiction_you/][someone just started a thread]] asking people for their examples of mixing canon and fanfic. The thread has attracted over 500 replies after less than a day and some of the most upvoted posts I've ever seen on this subreddit.

If that's not overwhelming empirical evidence that fanfic affects perception of canon, I don't know what would be.
