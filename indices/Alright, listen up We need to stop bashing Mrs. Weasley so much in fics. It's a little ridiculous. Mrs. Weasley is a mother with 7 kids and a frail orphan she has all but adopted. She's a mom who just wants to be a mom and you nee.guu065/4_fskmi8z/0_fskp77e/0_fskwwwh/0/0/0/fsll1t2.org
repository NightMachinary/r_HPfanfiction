  You claim that just reading something makes people write the same. I call bullshit. I've talked to a few people and we agree that if anything, reading something makes you want to write the opposite, to do things right rather than whatever we've just read.

Again, the fanfic that people read is only one of several things that influence how they write.

It's not even a conscious process, most of the time. Can you ask those people whether they've ever thought that something was canon only to realise that it was from a fanfic? I can think of at least a few instances of that for myself---and I've probably forgotten many more.

Human memory is not like files on a computer, which you can open /read-only/, or where you can give two files different names and have contents of one not affect the contents of the other. Rather, every time we read a fanfic and a canon character or event is invoked, our memory of that character or event has the potential to be altered, often without us noticing.

Maybe a bashy portrayal of a character will cause an adverse reaction and motivate the reader to write a fanfic with the opposite portrayal (incidentally reinforcing that opposing image of the canon character in their memory, rather than leaving it intact). But usually, the bashed character is not the focus of the story, and so the reader will move on, their memory of the character subtly nudged in the direction of the fic without them realising it.

And there is a lot more fic than there is canon, so it adds up.

For example, what fraction of the fanfic-reading fandom would you say thinks that Dumbledore ordered Hermione and Ron not to write to Harry during the summer of 1995, and that they obeyed? (As I am sure you know, in canon, he only told them not to put anything sensitive in their letters, which was a very good idea at the time, even if it frustrated Harry.)

Now, given how many fanfics actually /start/ from that point and include that as a key element of their premise without giving any indication that this is a deliberate divergence from canon, I'd say that it's quite a high fraction of the fandom. I don't think they've all developed this misconception independently.
