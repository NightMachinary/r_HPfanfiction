In that case, who are you to judge what's healthy and what's not? Who are you to decide that fics can't be "wrong" or "bad"?

Personal experience is one source of experience that influences characterisation; reading other fanfics and online discussions is another; there are myriad others.

Nobody's policing anyone's /thoughts/ or even what they /like/. People are judging each other's /acts/ of posting a particular story. And, it's up to each of us to decide what we believe is good and bad---within a story and for the whole ecosystem---and act accordingly.
