No.

*"Don't like, don't read"* is a very healthy way to go about it.

People write from experiences, some people have shit, overbearing mothers and write Molly from that perspective, some people have great mothers and write her that way.

Bashing fics aren't 'wrong' or 'bad' they're someone's opinion and imagination.

We aren't the thought police, we don't get to judge what other people like to read/write.
