So you're telling me that you voluntarily read things tagged with 'bashing' to bully people into stop writing bashing?

I'm hyperbolizing your behaviour, of course (I hope) to make a point. If someone writes a fic with bashing and it gets little views or a lot of views but 3 kudos (meaning the readers didn't like what was written) they will understand that bashing is not something to write to appeal the public and write something else (or not, if someone writes for themselves might keep writing what they like instead of what will give them kudos).

"Don't like it, don't read it" is based upon that ecosystem.

You are saying that you don't like bashing, but other people do evidently, or there wouldn't be that many kudos in fic with bashing. Bad characterization, bashing and bad practice aren't objective - this is fanfic, everything is in various degrees of out of character.

(Also why would you read something you know you won't enjoy? Love your self a little more and filter the tags).
