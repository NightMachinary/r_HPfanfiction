That's not hyperbole, that's outright making things up.

We don't live in a world in which more than a tiny number of bashfics are tagged. We live in a world in which half the time, the bashfic authors don't even realise they are bashing, because they've read so many untagged bashfics, they've forgotten what the character was like in the first place. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/guu065/alright_listen_up_we_need_to_stop_bashing_mrs/fsll1t2/][See my comment here.]]

That's what makes it an ecosystem rather than a vacuum: ideas---good and bad---spread.

And, lack of an objective standard for characterisation, bashing, etc. is no defence: it just means that each of us has to set a standard and advocate for it. Like I wrote in one of the other replies, I'm a judge; you're a judge; the fic author is a judge; everyone's a judge: welcome to the marketplace of ideas!
