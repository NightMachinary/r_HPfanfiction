I am going to vehemently disagree with that.

Fanfics are not written in a vacuum but in an ecosystem. Yesterday's reader is tomorrow's writer, and how a given writer sees and writes a given character is a function not only of the canon texts and the writer's values but also of how that writer has seen that character written in the past and what discussions they have had or seen about that character. This is not a value judgement, but a statement of fact.

If bad characterisations, bashing, pernicious (and, occasionally, benign) fanon, and other bad practices aren't called out, then whoever can put out pablum the fastest wins.
