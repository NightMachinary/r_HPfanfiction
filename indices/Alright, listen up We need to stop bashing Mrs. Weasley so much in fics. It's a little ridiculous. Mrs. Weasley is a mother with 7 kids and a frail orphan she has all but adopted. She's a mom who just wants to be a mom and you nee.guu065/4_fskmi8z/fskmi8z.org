This is fanfiction. We may do whatever we want. If you don't like it, don't read it.

That said, I think of Molly as yet another flawed character in this cast of flawed characters. Her brothers were killed a few years before we see her. Of course she's overprotective of the family she has left. She's another traumatized character who isn't necessarily dealing well with that trauma.

A lot of fanfiction reduces Rowling's complex characters to simple caricatures. Molly is just one example.
