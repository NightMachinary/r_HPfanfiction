I love Molly. I have to agree with you that she's a mom being a good mom. I always thought she was a badass who cared for all her children and their friends. Does she make a lot of mistakes and sometimes misjudge people? hell yeah. But it's all in the best interest of her children--- Harry included. She's a MOTHER. Being overprotective is in the job description.

I am also concerned by the fact that some people think Molly's behavior is toxic and uniquely horrible. Have... have any of you ever had a mother? Because I know for a fact that of the woman who birthed me would not hesitate to dropkick any mf who is not up to par. Yeah there's arguments and disagreements about what falls under “up to par”.... that's the whole point.

Anyway, I'm just sick of people bashing characters because of singular mistakes and then exaggerate their personalities to fit their narrative. Characters are supposed to be flawed, not black and white.

Sincerely, someone who is tired of opening interesting fics only to find them ruined by unnecessary character bashing :)
