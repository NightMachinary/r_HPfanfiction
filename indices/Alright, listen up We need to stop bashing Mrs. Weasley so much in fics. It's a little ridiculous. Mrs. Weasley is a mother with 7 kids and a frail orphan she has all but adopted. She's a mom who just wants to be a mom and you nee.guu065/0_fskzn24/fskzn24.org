I could always see her point of view while arguing with Sirius but something is to be said that practically no one agrees with her at the table, not even her own husband, and certainly not when she told him to back her up. But that was such a low blow, the poor bloke doesn't need reminding of it, he probably thinks about it every single day.

Mr. Weasley himself was at odds with her for that very same thing two years ago (she didn't want Harry to know Sirius wanted to kill him, Arthur did, and he was right, even if Sirius was innocent). Molly is very protective, but being a mother of seven will do that to a person and I can certainly understand where she comes from, and that's the most relatable thing about her for some people whom Molly became an echo of their parents.

I do find it odd that people go as far as kicking her it of the house and dosing Harry with love potions on behalf of Ginny, and wanting all his money. Molly does have very negative associations that female characters are often portrayed with, like being a big gossip (she believed everything Skeeter wrote down about Hermione, for one, and treated her terribly afterwards). Her treatment of Fleur is also frustrating, and I hated that plot point so much, because it perpetuated the stereotype of women being catty gossips. But to be honest there's also always going to be people like that in the world - male or female - and I'm glad the books addressed it.

The brilliance of her character however is that she embodies so many traits and avoids becoming an archetype. I think Molly and Mrs Weasley are two very seperate people. Molly was the one who lost two brothers brutally to the war, and later had ther murderer break out of prison, so she must've been nerve-wracked with worry for her children even afterwards, on top of her Order work. The way she tries to have some control over Fred and George even after becoming of age and being entirely responsible for their actions, was as heartbreaking as the boggart scene. The fact that Rowling wrote it to be straight after the fight with Sirius wasn't an accident; Mrs. Weasley may be wrong at times, or overbearing but she just worries for the people she loves, even when they seem to think she is being overprotective.

But her involvement in the Order after her brothers' death always struck me as interesting. If she was so scared for her family, then she could easily just board herself there, prevent them from going to Hogwarts and stay under protection until the war has ended, and yet she rank the risk of herself dying and leaving them behind (as she confides in Lupin later, she's afraid of them being alone in the world). The fact that they were poor was also an added stress, both herself and Arthur were at risk of dying, and yet she wanted to make the world a better place for them (and Harry) by fighting. If she cannot protect herself, then she can protect them. She's the only woman within the Order who has that many children and yet still chooses to fight, because Molly is in her true nature a warrior, just like her brothers and her children. They must've gotten it from somewhere, after all. Molly wants to fight, Mrs Weasley wants to protect.

What I love about Molly (and so many other characters), is that they're good people. They're kind, they're loving and they're courageous and the everyone has a glaring flaw. This is always what has drawn me to the HP characters more than anyone else. Lupin can be a coward, Sirius can be thoughtless, Dumbledore has shady principles at points, Fletcher fights for the Order and yet is a crook, Harry has a hero complex, Hermione can be extraordinarily cruel. The list goes on and on.

Either way, I love Mrs. Weasley as a character, and I appreciate how well-written she is. Bashing in general is a sign of poor writing, but people can do what they want, after all, it is fanfiction. But the sign of a good writer is someone who appreciates all the good and bad qualities simultaneously, and balances them in writing.
