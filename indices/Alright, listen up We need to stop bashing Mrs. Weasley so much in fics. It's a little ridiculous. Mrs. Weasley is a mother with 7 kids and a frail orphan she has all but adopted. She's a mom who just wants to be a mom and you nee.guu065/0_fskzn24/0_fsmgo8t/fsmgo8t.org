I love Molly Weasley, but I'm not blind of her flaws and shortcomings (overbearing, overprotective to the point it becomes dangerous, can become catty).

She isn't a bad mom, at all.

To me, it shows that even the best parents can make mistakes, can sometimes do the wrong thing believing they're doing the best for their children.
