While I (kinda) agree, I think it is far more scandalous that there are fics bashing Lily Potter and make her an abusive and/or neglectful mother (WBWL) when she literally sacrificed herself to save Harry.

If people managed to bash Lily and redeem people like Snape and the Malfoy family, I don't think you have much of a chance in your fight for Molly
