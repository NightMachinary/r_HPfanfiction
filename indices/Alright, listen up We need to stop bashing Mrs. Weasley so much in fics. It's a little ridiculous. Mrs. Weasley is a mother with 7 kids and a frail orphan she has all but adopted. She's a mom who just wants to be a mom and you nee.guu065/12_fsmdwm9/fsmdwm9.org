She crosses a line with the howlers. Good plot device, horrible parenting.

She tries to shelter Harry from bad news. Sounds good, but not really. Knowledge is power, and lack of knowledge killed Sirius Black.

Forcing children to clean a house filled with dangerous pests and dark artifacts, without magic. Which doesn't at all mesh with her advice to Harry to...

... leave everything dangerous to the adults. So, when are the adults going to handle it? I'm at a loss to see how any adults handled anything in books 1-5 (books 6-7 doesn't exist, they were never written, they're a figment of our imagination).

Sweaters. Why did she make one for Harry? Because she's enamored with the Boy-Who-Lived hyperbole. She turns Ginny into a fangirl. Why didn't Hermione get one? She's Ron's friend too. Maybe it's because she's a /girl/. Girls shouldn't fly on brooms.

She's a hypocritical prude. "Scarlet woman"? Really? She gave Arthur a love potion, and then treated it like a joke afterwards.

She wants her children (and Harry, and probably everyone else) to conform to her narrow worldview. She can't accept long hair, or a fanged earring, or wanting to make a career outside of the (immensely boring and corrupt) Ministry.

She may mean well, but she's unable to follow through.
