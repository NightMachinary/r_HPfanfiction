  Sweaters. Why did she make one for Harry? Because she's enamored with the Boy-Who-Lived hyperbole. She turns Ginny into a fangirl. Why didn't Hermione get one? She's Ron's friend too. Maybe it's because she's a girl. Girls shouldn't fly on brooms.

You need to re-read the books.

There's not a shred of evidence Molly turned Ginny into a fangirl, and in fact told Ginny off for wanting to go onto the train to see Harry again.

Furthermore, she does too give Hermione a hand-knit sweater. This is mentioned in several of the books.

And with regards to Ginny being prevented from flying, that was all on her big brothers who didn't want to play with a girl. We never see Molly prevent Ginny from flying.
