What always struck me as funny is that quite a bit of "Molly Bashing"* is *not even intentional*, but occurs as direct consequence of changes made to other characters.\\
*note the " "

Molly Weasley is good, kind, courageous and generous person. She can also be quite stubborn and rash. All of those traits are part of her and quite necessary - while raising 7 children you can't allow yourself to be distracted or swayed on important matters, you have to act quick before the kids make a big mess (especially with magic), ensure they all have what they need, be there when they need you, cook, clean...

As a result, we have a curious Gryffindor-Hufflepuff hybrid that is not used to being told no and shoulders much responsibility, especially when it comes to matters of the household. Arthur Weasley might provide the money, but it's Mrs Weasley that makes it last.

This naturally leads to sparks flying when in contact with independent characters, or outside her remit. We see it at Grimmauld Place, where Mrs Weasley arrives and immediately assumes the duties she is used to. Obviously, Sirius is not happy about her claiming ultimate authority in his house, or over his godson. He might have limited means due to the injustice system of magical Britain, but he still does his best and dislikes having that thrown in his face.

*On to bashing:* One of major issues fans have with Harry is that he's kind of reactive, and a bit of a doormat at times. Hermione catches flak for authority worship and occasional no-fun attitude. Ron, for being lazy and ambitious and not book smart.

When those traits are changed, with Harry acting for himself, Hermione diversifying her interests and abandoning her post as Avatar of Rowling, Ron starting to work at actually achieving his ambitions (even if it's just Quidditch or noticing Chess tournaments as an opportunity)... They suddenly need a mother figure less. The influence of Molly Weasley, once welcome, starts to feel constricting. Coddling. Confining.

You can't really test your limits in a padded room. It's soft. It's comfy. It's safe. You are provided for... And you die inside. So, they try to leave, to grow up. Make some mistakes, learn from them. Find their paths on the crossroads of life.

Of course, Molly likes that not at all. In her opinion the young birds are too small and weak to leave the nest - and that is not taking into account the fact that Bill is in Egypt, Charlie in Romania, Twins do their own thing, Percy is lost to the Ministry, Ron and Ginny away at Hogwarts for most of the time... All her children, so far away.\\
This leads to conflict of interest - the children want to grow up. She wants them to stay with her, accept her care and never leave.

That leaves the Author with 3 options:\\
- Write Mrs Weasley out of the story\\
- Change her to eliminate the problem\\
- Keep her original characterization and regularly remove "Muh bashing" messages from the inbox.

I am, of course, not including explicit bashing like Potion!Weasleys here, but only part of the whole that is Weasley bashing.
