Well, she has her faults in the books. Her treatment of Hermione in GoF or Fleur overall show her to be a narrowminded person that isn't very intelligent. And how she treats Sirius in OotP is really, really annoying. Overall, I can easily see how authors decide to build on the many negative qualities she showed in canon, and I have no problem with any Molly bashing, as long as it doesn't become the focus of a fic.
