To be fair, while it doesn't lend itself to high literature, I frequently get into moods where I go looking for bashing/salt fics. It has an audience, if done in an even remotely entertaining fashion. Tropes are tropes for a reason, much like cliches. Sometimes peanut butter off a spoon just satisfies better than the fanciest gourmet meal.
