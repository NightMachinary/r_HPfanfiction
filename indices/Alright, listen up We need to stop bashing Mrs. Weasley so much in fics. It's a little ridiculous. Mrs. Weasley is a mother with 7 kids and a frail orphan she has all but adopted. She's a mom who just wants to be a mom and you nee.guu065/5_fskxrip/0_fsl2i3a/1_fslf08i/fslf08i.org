Bashing is boring and pointless unless done for comedic value through utter exaggeration to the point of absurdity. Don't like a character? Include them as little as possible. Write them out completely.

But I honestly don't see how people can stand her. If you tell an abusive child that you care but then do nothing about the abusers, that's unforgivable. If you, as a 50ish woman, slut shame a 15 yo girl over an article written by an author you yourself know to produce fairy-tales rather than actual news, that's bad and no friend of that girl should ever speak to you again. If you tell the boy who faced magical Hitler 4 times while you sat out the civil war that he shouldn't be involved with the defence of his own life and leave things in the hands of the people who failed those 4 times, you are so far removed from reality that you probably exist in a different solar system.
