  If you tell an abusive child that you care but then do nothing about the abusers, that's unforgivable.

This describes almost every adult in Harry's life, so it's unfair to use it as ammunition against Molly specifically. There's plenty of indication that Remus knew about the abuse and he never advocated for Harry as far as we know (other than to be part of the group who warned the Dursleys to lay off Harry at the end of book 5, which isn't really worth much of anything). The same could be said about Arthur, but somehow only Molly gets the blame. Sirius is really the only one who tried to remove Harry from the Dursleys, and we all know why that didn't work out.

  If you tell the boy who faced magical Hitler 4 times while you sat out the civil war that he shouldn't be involved with the defence of his own life and leave things in the hands of the people who failed those 4 times, you are so far removed from reality that you probably exist in a different solar system.

Maybe Molly was being naive or deliberately obtuse, but I don't see this as a reason to hate her. She saw Harry as her son, and just as she wouldn't want her children to be put in the line of fire, she didn't want that for Harry either. She was wrong, but it was coming from a place of love. Despite the fact that Harry has been failed by adults in the past, he's still a 15 year old kid, and to a middle-aged adult, that's impossibly young, and she's just trying to protect him, even if she's going about it in the wrong way.

  If you, as a 50ish woman, slut shame a 15 yo girl over an article written by an author you yourself know to produce fairy-tales rather than actual news, that's bad and no friend of that girl should ever speak to you

I agree that this was nasty, and imo Rowling never should have included that in the story. It does nothing for the plot, and feels out of character for Molly.
