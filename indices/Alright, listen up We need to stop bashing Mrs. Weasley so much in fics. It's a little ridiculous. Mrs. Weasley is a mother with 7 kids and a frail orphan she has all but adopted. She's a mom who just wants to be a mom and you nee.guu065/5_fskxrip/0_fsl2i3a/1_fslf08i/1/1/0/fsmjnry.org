  Hell if you remember most of this war was caught by fucking children.

That's the thing about child-centric stories. There's no easy way to put them in dangerous situations without making all the adults incompetent. It's just that as the characters aged and the series grew darker, the incompetence of the adults became harder and harder to ignore. It's the same issue with the Dursley's abuse. In the first couple of books, they were written as somewhat cartoonish, but things seemed more sinister in later books, when Harry started showing signs of PTSD from the graveyard, which illustrated the very real consequences of the trauma he went through.

I actually think this is one of the most realistic flaws/mistakes of any adult in the series, as it was clearly framed as a problem in the book rather than glossed over like the other issues you mentioned. It also felt very real, somehow, like something a person might do in real life. His actions were fueled by pain, fear that his child would be like him, and a need to be needed. He saw the error of his ways and went back to his family, and his actions were never painted as anything but wrong.
