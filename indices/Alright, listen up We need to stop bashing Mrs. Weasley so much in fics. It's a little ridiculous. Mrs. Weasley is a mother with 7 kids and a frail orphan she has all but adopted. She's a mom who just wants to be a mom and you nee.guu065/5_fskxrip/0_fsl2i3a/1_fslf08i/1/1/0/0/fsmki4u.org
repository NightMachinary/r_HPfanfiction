I was and am happy how the series portrayed the effects and outcome of his temporary leave, and thought it was very realistic. Also, with series that revolve around children, I think it should start out to be at least young adult. While in fifth grade a lot of people are immature, there's also many people who are beginning to slowly have their minds open to the world around them. There's two things that could've been done by this series, either explain it away by saying those with more magic mature faster, or start it from a more mature standpoint. It feels a lot more like an elementary at times honestly, which is my overall problem. While a lot of people like to say, "Well they're eleven so they shouldn't be this mature", I feel completely differently. Especially when they just came out of a war.
