That's honestly why I don't care for most adults in this series. Hell if you remember most of this war was caught by fucking children. Remus Lupin in particular is just a disgrace, I get he was a werewolf which was heavily oppressed. Does this change how he has the opportunity to send letters and explain his parents lives, no yet he did not make an effort. Nor at any point in time does he really reference how much important he was to James, and possibly Lily. Then he later on tried to leave his child to join on a hunt, abandoning both his wife and child. Also, like Molly and Dumbledore many people in this series believe that the children should keep their nose out of the war, completely disregarding that the same thing happened the last war.
