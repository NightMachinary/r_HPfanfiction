Oh, she is far from the only adult I dislike for this. Why do you think I can't stand Lupin, Dumbledore or McG?

Delusion I say. Harry had faced Voldemort just a few weeks before that due to a plot from Voldemort. It shows very clearly that Voldemort has an interest in hunting Harry. And I'm not even arguing that Harry should go Death Eater hunting or anything, but she wanted to exclude him from a meeting about his own safety. Had Molly not shut that conversation up, Sirius would have likely lived.

Funny, I'd say that it fits her perfectly. Including the bit at the end where she's called out and pretends that nothing ever happened.
