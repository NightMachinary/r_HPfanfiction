That's why I included the likely in that sentence. Harry might have still gone, but if he had been told that there was a prophecy which involved Voldemort and him, one which Voldemort desperately wanted, with maybe another reminder after the attack on Arthur, there's a good chance that Harry would have called the bluff. Of course, this is mostly on Dumbledore, but even you have to admit that Molly played a part.

As for delusion and love, I don't doubt Molly's intentions, but I judge her (and anyone else), by their actions, not why they acted that way. A good deed coming from a bad intention is better than the reverse.
