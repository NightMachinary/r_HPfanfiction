  Delusion I say. Harry had faced Voldemort just a few weeks before that due to a plot from Voldemort. It shows very clearly that Voldemort has an interest in hunting Harry.

Delusion and love are not mutually exclusive. People can act very illogically when it comes to people they care about. She was wrong and short-sighted in the way she went about it, but she was obviously trying to protect Harry, however ineffective her methods were.

  Had Molly not shut that conversation up, Sirius would have likely lived.

That's a stretch. They might have told Harry that Voldemort was after the prophecy, but none of them knew about the connection that Voldemort had with Harry, so Harry would have still rushed to save Sirius, even knowing what Voldemort was after. And before you say that Harry might have put two and two together and realized it was a trap, he wouldn't have known that the vision of Sirius was fake, and even if he suspected it, after trying and failing to reach Sirius in Grimmauld Place, even the smallest chance that the vision could be real was enough for Harry to rush off into danger.
