  Her disregard for Fred and George's dream was no good.

Their dream was a joke shop though...like i'm not being funny, I known in canon they got a store and it worked but it's not like encouraging your kids to finish school rather than flunk out and open a joke shop is a bad idea.

Fred and George were assholes at home too, I don't blame her for being harsh on them, just look at what they did to Ron.
