Sending a Howler to your child after he broke /the law/ is ausive now? I'm sorry, maybe I am a bad mother, but if my kid basically steals the family car and uses it without permission, ultimately crashing it against a tree you bet your ass I am gonna yell at them. The had to pay a fine and have a ministry hearing about it. Molly Weasley was justified in sending that howler and that is the only howler we know for a fact she sent.
