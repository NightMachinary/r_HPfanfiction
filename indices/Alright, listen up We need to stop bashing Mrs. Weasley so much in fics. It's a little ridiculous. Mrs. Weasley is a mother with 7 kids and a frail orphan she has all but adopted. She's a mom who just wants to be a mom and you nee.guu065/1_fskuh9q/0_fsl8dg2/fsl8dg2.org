And no one mentions the Howlers. I remember one fanfic pointing at this being abusive behavior in and of itself, to humiliate her children in front of the entire school.

That same fanfic(arguably not canon, of course but fits in with the nature of the characters) pointed out that every time the Weasley twins received one, they'd just walk away from the hall and leave the shouting parchment behind, so the only thing that really happens is the rest of the students get put off their breakfast.
