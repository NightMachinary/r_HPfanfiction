  However her treatment of Hermione after the Witch Weekly article is gross even if it's just for a moment.

They said it was gross, not unacceptable. Though to be honest, I personally DO think it was unacceptable. She was a middle aged woman doing something cruel to a 14/15 year old girl, one who had been her youngest son's GOOD FRIEND for 3 years at that point. One who had spent time with them, been places with them, stayed at their house for weeks each year.

Knowing all that and knowing Hermione, Molly still chose to do something petty and cruel to "punish" her for a shitty article - all without ever asking her (or Harry, Ron, or any of her other kids) the actual TRUTH. She's an adult and should have known better.
