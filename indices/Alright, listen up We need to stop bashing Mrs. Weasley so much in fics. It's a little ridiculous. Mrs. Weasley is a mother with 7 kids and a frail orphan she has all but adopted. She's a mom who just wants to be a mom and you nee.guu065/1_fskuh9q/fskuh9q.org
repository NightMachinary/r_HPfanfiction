Just because she's a good mother trying her very best doesn't mean she's flawless or above critique.

I dislike it, but I understand her treatment of Fleur and she does try to get Ginny to stop calling her Phlegm. /However/ her treatment of Hermione after the Witch Weekly article is gross even if it's just for a moment. She should not have needed Harry to tell her it was rubbish.

Her disregard for Fred and George's dream was no good. That Ron was walking around with a second-hand wand with a hair sticking out while Percy received an owl and new robes was bad. Her treatment of Sirius was bad.

The delusion surrounding Harry, while completely understandable, was terrible.
