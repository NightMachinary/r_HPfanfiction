Honestly, my biggest issue with Mrs Weasley is her utter disregard for the abuse Harry has to suffer. There were bars on his windows? Better to (jokingly) threaten my own children with the same abuse. Oh, Harry gets no food? Better send him some rather than get any authorities involved.

I know that the British law is a bit different to German one, but here "failure to rend aid" is a criminal offence. British law is different in so far that it only applies to people under your responsibility, but given that Molly claims the parent role (most notably when talking to Sirius), at least by my logic she also gets all the responsibilities, meaning that she has to ensure Harry's well-being if she claims the mother role. And she fails to do so spectacularly.

When Harry was grieving Cedric, nothing, followed by telling the boy who faced Voldemort 4 times due to adult incompetence that he's too young. After Sirius' death, nothing again. Before that, in book 2 she says that she was worried about Harry to the point of getting him away from the Dursleys the next weekend, but despite her sons telling her about the windows, she never does anything. Not informing any authorities (and her husband works for a branch of the DMLE), nor intervening personally or even threatening the Dursleys. Just nothing but sending token food and keeping her mouth shut. That is bordering on helping the Dursleys with their abuse. She had the opportunity to stop them, but she does nothing.

She tells an abused child that she cares and then does not, at least not with actions. Utterly unforgivable in my opinion.
