They also both trust Dumbledore, who has told people, including Harry himself by this point, that he must return to stay with the Dursleys because he is protected as long as he sees their home as his own home.

As long as he lives with family he is protected, with such protection Dumbledore himself couldn't rival it.

He has /told/ Harry this, and we've every reason to think he's told the Weasley parents this as well. We know for instance, that Mrs Weasley, at the end of GoF asked Dumbledore if Harry could go straight to the Burrow instead of back to Privet Drive. She tried to intervene as a caring adult and was prevented from doing so (and this is not to deflect criticism of Molly into Dumbledore bashing instead - he had good reasons, and he made them known).

The lack of information reaching Harry throughout the OotP is because Dumbledore knows that Voldemort has access to information via Harry. Over the preceding summer, all Dumbledore has to do is tell the Order that they cannot owl Harry because it is not safe, and that's what they do.

I know I am far from alone in wishing Dumbledore had found a better way around the whole Harry-crux issue - I'm sure there are whole swathes of fanfiction created specifically to "fix", or at least less frustratingly address, all the communication issues in OotP. But Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard of the age, the Big Good, and The Only One He Ever Feared, so it's not exactly a fair criticism of Molly Weasley to say that she trusted instructions Dumbledore gave.
