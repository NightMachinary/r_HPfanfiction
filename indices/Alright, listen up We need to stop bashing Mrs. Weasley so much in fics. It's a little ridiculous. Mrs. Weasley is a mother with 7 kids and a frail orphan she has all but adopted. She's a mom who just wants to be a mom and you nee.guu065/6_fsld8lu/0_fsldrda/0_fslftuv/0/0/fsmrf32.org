The same Dumbledore who did nothing while Ginny was dying in the chamber of secrets, twiddling his thumbs while Harry (and Ron) took action?

And if nothing else, she could have simply gone to Number 4 and acted as a shrink. No need to tell Harry any secrets, but at least let him have someone in that difficult time. Ron and Hermione can be excused due to being underage (no car/driving licence, no apparation licence, no magic). What excuse does any of the adults other than Sirius (wanted and facing summary execution) have? Hestia Jones, Tonks, Shacklebolt, they were not involved in Harry's life. But Lupin? The adult Weasleys?
