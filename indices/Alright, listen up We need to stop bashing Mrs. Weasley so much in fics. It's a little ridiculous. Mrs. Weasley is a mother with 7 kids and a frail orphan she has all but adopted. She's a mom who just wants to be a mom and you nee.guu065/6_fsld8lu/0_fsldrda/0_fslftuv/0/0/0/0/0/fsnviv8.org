Except we, as readers, have no reason to believe anyone knows that basilisks can petrify with their gaze. Chamber of Secrets explicitly states that basilisk eyes kill instead of petrify. No rational person is going to say, "let's check the school for something that doesn't have any obvious petrifaction powers" when there are more obvious choices - gorgons, cockatrices, and the like.

Hermione making the ABSURD leap in logic that the basilisk's gaze is being diluted by reflections and, instead of maiming or causing internal damage to the students, petrifies them is one of the least believable parts of her character. It's just another instance of Hermione being a locus of knowledge whose only purpose is to provide answers when Harry or Ron don't know something.
