The victims weren't all identified explicitly as being outside Moaning Myrtle's bathroom though.

As for the rest of your plan - other than searching the castle, that seems a dangerous plan when looking for a creature that kills with its gaze - what's to say that those aren't the steps that Dumbledore was about to take?

Because you're assuming that what transpired is what Dumbledore planned.

Why? Why not assume that Dumbledore's plans could go completely awry? I mean, if he's as stupid as you say, that could totally happen, right?
