  The victimes weren't all identified explicitly as being outside Moaning Myrtle's bathroom though.

Let's see: Mrs. Norris was hung up there, Finch-Fletchley (don't know if second-half was spelled right), Nearly Headless Nick, Myrtle literally died in that bathroom but we won't count her as apparently adults are idiots, and Creevey was found there. The only ones not found there were Hermione and Penelope.
