It took a 13 year old girl like 6 months from the start of the attacks to figure out it was a giant snake-monster. You're telling me Dumbledore, with all his years of experience, couldn't figure out in about that same amount of time? I mean, the 3 major creatures that can cause petrification or death via its eyes are the gorgon, the cockatrice, and the basillisk. The gorgon is out as it would have had to be illegally flown in from Greece where they typically make their homes so that leaves the two serpent-like beings. Potter is able to talk to snakes, a fact that Snape most definitely shared with Dumb-as-a-door, and the messages were in relation to Salazar Slytherin whose symbol was a snake. So, a creature is going around paralyzing students but leaving no mark so a cockatrice is out as it has a sharp beak and claws/talons and the boy that can speak to snakes can hear it. I wonder what it could be.
