Yes, that Dumbledore. The one removed from Hogwarts at the time due to a decision made by the board. The very same. The Weasleys trusted Dumbledore - whether you think they should or not is a different question.

I suspect that, because Dumbledore strongly believed by this point that Voldemort had a means of obtaining information via Harry, that he would have asked the Weasleys not to contact Harry - for his own safety. And the Weasleys, wanting to keep Harry safe, and trusting Dumbledore, would have done as they were asked.

That doesn't mean they don't make mistakes, get stuff wrong, do things that are annoying or unpleasant or unkind. But they're not /bad people/.
