Like I said, you simultaneously assume Dumbledore is stupid, and that everything that happens is happening according to his grand scheme.

Fine, say Hermione tells a teacher. Great, now it's turtles all the way down because you haven't addressed how /knowing the creature is a basilisk/, or even knowing that it moves about the school via the pipes, helps you actually /do anything about it/.

Unless you can find and access the chamber, you can't rid the school of the basilisk.

Let's say around about the time Harry and Ron discover Hermione's brainwave, and deduce that none of the victims die (what you'd /expect/ he victim of a basilisk to do) due to the power of reflection, that Dumbledore has also just added it all up.

Suddenly, he's forced out of the school.

But if he wasn't - how was he then supposed to find and access the chamber?
