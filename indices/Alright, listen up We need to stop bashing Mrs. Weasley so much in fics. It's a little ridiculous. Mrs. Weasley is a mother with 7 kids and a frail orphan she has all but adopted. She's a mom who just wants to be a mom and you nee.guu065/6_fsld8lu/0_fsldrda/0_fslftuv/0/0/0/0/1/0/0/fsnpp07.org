No, you didn't answer my question, because it would raise the very important gap in your argument.

Knowing what the creature is is fantastic, and as far as I remember there's no reason to think Dumbledore hadn't also worked it out by the time he was forced from the school.

But what can you actually do with that information?

It's only because Harry a) made the leap that Myrtle had information about the Chamber's location and b) could speak parseltongue to open it and c) rather luckily summoned a sword from a hat, delivered by a bird /that was quite probably sent to help him by Dumbledore/ and was able to get a lucky stab at the basilisk's face that he succeeded.

We don't know what Dumbledore was planning, but it probably wasn't "I'll sit on my hands and see what Harry does next" - more likely he had intended to use Fawkes himself to get an advantage over the basilisk, but wasn't able to find and/or access the Chamber in order to do so.

People seem to assume that because Dumbledore is a very clever character and manipulator that therefore everything that happens in the books must have been according to Dumbledore's master plan... not leaving any room for him to be mistaken, run out of time, have his plans scuppered, for anything to happen that he didn't predict.

But at the same time as thinking he has a grand scheme which accounts for all these twists and turns, so that everything ultimately follows his designs, they argue he's "dumb as a door" (which I like, by the way).
