If Dumbledore had indeed figured out that a Basilisk was the weapon used he should have evacuated the school ASAP after either the first or second attack, because were a Basilisk to enter the Great Hall during dinner the UK would lose an insanely high percentage of it future population.. And if he hadn't bothered to talk to Myrtle after she manifested in the bathroom or otherwise draw any kind of useful and meaningful conclusion in the 50 years since Myrtle, then he frankly does not deserve half his titles.. especially because he knows for a fact that Rubeus Hagrid were not in any way responsible
