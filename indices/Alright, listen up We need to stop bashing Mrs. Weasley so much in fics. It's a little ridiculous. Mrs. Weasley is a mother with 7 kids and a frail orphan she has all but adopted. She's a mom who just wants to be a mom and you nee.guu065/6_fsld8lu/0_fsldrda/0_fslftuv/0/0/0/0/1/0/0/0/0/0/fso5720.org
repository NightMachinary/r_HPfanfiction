Not familiar with that phrase. In any case, inform the DMLE/Ministry! They have a department specifically for dealing with dangerous-as-fuck creatures like dragons and basilisks. Even then, it becomes a situation of "the troll from 1st year": scour the castle. If it can't be found, ask Harry where he most commonly found the noise or where it suddenly stopped speaking. Hell, the plot made the oblivious-as-shit child suddenly realize that all the victims were outside of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. How did no adult make that connection?
