And you're missing the point: a girl nearly a tenth the age of the headmaster figured out that it was a giant snake-monster that was petrifying students and 2 boys of about the same age went to face it. Where the hell were the competent teachers? Why didn't the headmaster at least start working on creatures that can kill with a look and then try to figure out the petrification. Hell, he could have assumed it was a cockatrice as it still fits the criteria as it's part-serpent so there was a chance Harry could understand it. That's still a dangerous creature that's petrifying students.
