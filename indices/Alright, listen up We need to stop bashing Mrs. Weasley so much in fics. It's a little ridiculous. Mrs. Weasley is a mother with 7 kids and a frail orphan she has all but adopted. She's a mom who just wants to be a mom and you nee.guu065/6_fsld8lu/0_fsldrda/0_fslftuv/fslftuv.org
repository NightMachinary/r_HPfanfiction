Yes, but she knows that such a thing as the DMLE exists. And her husband ought to know about the police. So between those options or even simply showing up at Number 4, just to make sure that her twins were talking bullshit, she does nothing. And when Harry writes to her, desperate for food because he is forced to follow a radical diet designed for someone clinically obese which, if you are generous has a 50 kcal breakfast, she obviously believes that there is a need to send food. Yet she doesn't get any authorities involved. And if Dumbledore told her to keep her mouth shut, well first of all, you must not follow illegal orders, and second of all, she could again simply show up and take a look. Disillusionment charms are a thing, hell Harry could mail her his invisibility cloak.
