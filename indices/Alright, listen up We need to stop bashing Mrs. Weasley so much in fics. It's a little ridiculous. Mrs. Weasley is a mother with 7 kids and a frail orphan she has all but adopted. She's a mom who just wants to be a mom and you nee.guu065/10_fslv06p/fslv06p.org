Just because she takes care of her kids, doesn't mean that people can't point out her flaws. Bashing fics exaggerate the characters' flaws but they still exist even the the books. Molly is very overbearing and crosses her boundaries a lot. She had no business treating Hermione so harshly in book 4. And she can't forbid Sirius from sharing information with Harry. Harry is not her child. She went too far in her argument with Sirius in book 5. The Weasley parents didn't even bother buying Ron a new wand for his first year. How could they forget that a wand is very important to a wizard? They could have focused on buying Ron a new wand and could have bought Percy's new owl a few months later, with some savings.
