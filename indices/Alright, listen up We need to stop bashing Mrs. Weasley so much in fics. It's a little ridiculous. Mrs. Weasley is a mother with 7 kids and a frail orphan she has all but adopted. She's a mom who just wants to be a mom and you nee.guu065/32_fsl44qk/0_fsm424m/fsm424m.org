  We know Molly can cook with magic, and there's tons of things it's does around the house. Why is she too busy earn money for the family?

The books are set in the 90's, and the Wizarding world is behind that in some ways. Being a stay-at-home spouse/parent is perfectly acceptable in that time period.

Arguably, her kids having magic makes a stay-at-home parent /necessary/ at least until Ginny goes to Hogwarts - there's no mention of Wizarding pre-school, which kinda brings me neatly to the next section.

  Why didn't she homeschool her youngest two?

Okay, this is just creating slights out of thin air. Her kids can read and write, and have a working knowledge of the Wizarding world - all of which they have to have picked up from /somewhere/. Since sending Wizarding kids to a Muggle school is a Statute of Secrecy breach waiting to happen, the most likely answer is, in fact, that Molly was homeschooling them.
