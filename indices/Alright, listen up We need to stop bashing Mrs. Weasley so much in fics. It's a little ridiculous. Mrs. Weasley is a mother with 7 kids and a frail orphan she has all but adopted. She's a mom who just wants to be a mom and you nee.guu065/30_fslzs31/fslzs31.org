Like most people, she's a woman with her positives and flaws. She does a lot for her kids, and tries to be there for them, but she does have her flaws (her argument with Sirius in Order was something that really showed me she had her flaws, cause I didn't take her side at all - nor did anyone else at the table.) The sweaters, though, it's entirely possible she uses magic with them. We don't know that they're hand-knitted. It's one of those things that's hard because of book vs movie, but I /think?/ the first time Harry goes to the Burrow in the movies, he sees knitting needles knitting themselves.

She's a wonderful mum, don't get me wrong. I haven't read enough Trio era/Weasley included fic to see how she's treated in fics, but I do think she's a very human character. She's not a saint, nor is she an awful person.
