She's flawed and that makes her interesting. No one is perfect, and to write a character as such makes them boring and flat. She's a loving mom and a nagging mom, she adores her kids friends but doesn't trust them, she's a powerful witch who thinks she knows better than everyone else. I think the amount of discourse out there about her proves that JK did a good job writing her.
