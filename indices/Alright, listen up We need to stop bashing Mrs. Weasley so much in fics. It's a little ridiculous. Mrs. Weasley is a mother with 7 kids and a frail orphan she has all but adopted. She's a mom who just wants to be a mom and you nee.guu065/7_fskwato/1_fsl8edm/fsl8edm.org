  She doesn't listen to the kids when they've rescued Harry from the Dursleys.
#+end_quote

She didn't witness this herself, she has no reason whatsoever to believe that there were truly bars on Harry's window.

Her sons had just stolen their father's illegally modified car and flown across the country and back in one night, and she caught them in the act.

We can forgive her if she's not in a particularly believing mood.

#+begin_quote
  She's canonically hit the twins with either broomsticks or a woodenspoon
#+end_quote

The books are set in the 1990s and the Wizarding World is several decades behind that.

Studies showing the damage corporeal punishment can do are much more recent.

Stop applying 2020 morals to a setting that is not 2020.

Nobody is ever shown to be genuinely afraid of Molly hurting them. And considering what Molly was brought up with--where Arthur still has scars from his own corporeal punishments decades later--she is not nearly as bad as this implies.

#+begin_quote
  She dismisses the Twins accomplishments, destroyed things they worked hard on, refuses to give them any acceptance about their dreams
#+end_quote

This is primarily in the fourth book, where Fred and George are revealed to have done quite poorly on their O.W.L.s.

Molly believes, not unreasonably, that Fred and George are not applying themselves in /practical/ ways.

Their magic is impressive, but it's effectively parlor tricks and joke candies that can hurt people who don't know what they are.

#+begin_quote
  SHE CANT TELL HER TWIN SONS APART
#+end_quote

As [[/u/pumpkin_noodles][u/pumpkin_noodles]] pointed out, Fred and George liked to trade places to trip her up.

Also, as a twin, I'm astonished Molly didn't get her sons confused more often. I've been called by my twin brother's name so many times, I started answering to it over a decade ago.

#+begin_quote
  Was a absolute bitch to Fleur and encouraged Ginny to be as well
#+end_quote

This is categorically untrue. She was cold towards Fleur, yes, but she repeatedly tells Ginny to treat her with respect.

And some of her concerns are not invalid--Fleur and Bill knew each other for barely a year before their engagement. And Fleur ain't a model house guest, she can be /very/ particular about everything.

#+begin_quote
  Was cruel and petty to Hermione in book four, believed Rita Skeeter's articals about her instead of going by what she knew of her
#+end_quote

Petty, sure. But it's a far cry from cruel.

#+begin_quote
  Cut Bill's hair the morning before his wedding without his permission (my great grandmother did this to my Nan and she never got over it)
#+end_quote

It wasn't Bill's hair she cut before the wedding, it was Charlie's. Her son who spends most of his time with fire-breathing dragons, and for whom short hair has a very practical purpose.

And these are wizards who can regrow their hair by magic.

#+begin_quote
  Her two eldest children moved out of the country almost as soon as they could (speculation but it says a lot)
#+end_quote

Those sons got positions in /extremely/ specialized fields, and from what we see in the Wizarding World, leaving home very early after graduation appears to be the norm.

Your speculation is a stretch, and it doesn't say a damn thing.

#+begin_quote
  Refused to face reality about the war and arm the kids with even the most basic knowledge that might save them seeing as Harry was already a active target
#+end_quote

No, she refused to let /under-aged/ children know details they had /no/ business knowing.

What basic knowledge are you talking about? Voldemort being after a weapon? How does that actually benefit her children?

#+begin_quote
  Was a complete cunt to Sirius in book 5 about not being there for Harry even though she knew that he had been framed and sent to a horrific prison for twelve years
#+end_quote

That's one of the most disgusting words in the English language, and I frankly find it libelous that you would tarnish Molly as such.

That said, she has a *very* legitimate point that Sirius's reckless behavior is dangerous.

Sirius went straight for Pettigrew in reckless revenge, and it got him tossed in Azkaban.

Sirius is a wanted criminal, and despite this, he constantly tries to sneak of out the house, even against Dumbledore's orders.

And that's not getting into Sirius treating Harry as a bit of a surrogate to James.

#+begin_quote
  I actually like Molly, but she's not a saint. She can be a petty and cruel bitch. She's written as a person and it's not fair to ignore her flaws and focus on her good parts (of which there are many)
#+end_quote

Her good parts are exponentially more than her bad. But you wouldn't know it from most of fandom.
