You're arguing something I'm not. No one said Fred, George, and Ron didn't take risks or that it was a good idea. The argument here is that Fred or George told an adult, their mother, at the very least, that Harry was being starved and nothing besides piling more food onto his plate was done.

When they 1st meet Harry is lost and wandering around King's Cross alone. Ron tells us in PS he told her Harry wasn't expecting any gifts. Harry doesn't reply to Ron for a month. Her children tell her he's being starved after rescuing him. There's really no excuse for it.
