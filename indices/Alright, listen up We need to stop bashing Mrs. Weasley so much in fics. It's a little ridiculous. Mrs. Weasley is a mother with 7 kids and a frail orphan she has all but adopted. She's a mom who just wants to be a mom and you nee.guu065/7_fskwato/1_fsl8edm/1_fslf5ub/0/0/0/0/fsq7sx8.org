  “They were starving him, Mum!” said George.

  “And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.

And yet text implies she understood what George meant.

As I pointed out, she 1st met Harry lost and alone in King's Cross. She was then told Harry wasn't expecting any gifts for Christmas. Harry then didn't respond to a single letter for a whole month causing her to believe she and her husband would have to collect him. Then she was told he was being starved.

There's plenty of signs and there's really no excuse here.
