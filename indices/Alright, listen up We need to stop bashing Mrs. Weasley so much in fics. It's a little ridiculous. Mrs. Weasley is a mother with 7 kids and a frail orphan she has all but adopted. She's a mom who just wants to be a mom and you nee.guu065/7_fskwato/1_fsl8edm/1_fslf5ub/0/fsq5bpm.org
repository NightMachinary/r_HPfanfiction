Bars on a window are not uncommon as a way to prevent theft. She wasn't told the bars were only on Harry's window. Not that she's familiar with the Muggle world anyway, so she has no reason to worry that this might be an bad thing. And let's not forget that the twins have a very long habit of making up any old bullshit to try and get themselves out of trouble, and they're in trouble a lot. It's perfectly reasonable that she would stop paying much attention to their excuses

But the absolute more important reason she shouldn't get into trouble over this is that /no one actually tells her about the bars/.
