  Sirius is a wanted criminal, and despite this, he constantly tries to sneak of out the house, even against Dumbledore's orders.

I agree with a lot of your points but not about this. You're doing a disservice to Sirius. He has many flaws but his friends were 20/21 when they died. How many people can say with complete honesty that they were masters of themselves at that age? His friends were just murdered, and his other best friend was the one to sell them out to Wizarding Hitler. You're damn right he went after Pettigrew. He's 20/21 years old and you people want him to be the picture of self control.

The other thing is that he gave up use of his own home for the Order. He was then imprisoned there - yes IMPRISONED - in the very place where he was abused by his own parents. It's canon that he ran away from home as soon as he could. It can take years for victims of abuse to get better and Sirius was sent to, essentially, hell on earth when he was 21. So yeah he escaped prison, only to be put into another prison immediately after. He came back to England and endured it all for Harry. Molly has no excuse for the things she says to Sirius. What she said was cruel and petty.

Keep in mind that I can certainly see things from Molly's PoV in that fight. She was traumatized by the death of her brothers, who were supposed to be powerful wizards in their own right. I can definitely understand her reluctance and need to protect the kids from what's going on. But what she said to Sirius crosses a LOT of lines that she had no business crossing.
