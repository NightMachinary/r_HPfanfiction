Eh, I like not bashing exactly but calling her out on her hypocrisy.

Yeah she's an OK mother who likes her youngest son's friend but...

She doesn't listen to the kids when they've rescued Harry from the Dursleys.

She's canonically hit the twins with either broomsticks or a woodenspoon

She dismisses the Twins accomplishments, destroyed things they worked hard on, refuses to give them any acceptance about their dreams

SHE CANT TELL HER TWIN SONS APART

Was a absolute bitch to Fleur and encouraged Ginny to be as well

Was cruel and petty to Hermione in book four, believed Rita Skeeter's articals about her instead of going by what she knew of her

Cut Bill's hair the morning before his wedding without his permission (my great grandmother did this to my Nan and she never got over it)

Her two eldest children moved out of the country almost as soon as they could (speculation but it says a lot)

Refused to face reality about the war and arm the kids with even the most basic knowledge that might save them seeing as Harry was already a active target

Was a complete cunt to Sirius in book 5 about not being there for Harry even though she knew that he had been framed and sent to a horrific prison for twelve years

I actually like Molly, but she's not a saint. She can be a petty and cruel bitch. She's written as a person and it's not fair to ignore her flaws and focus on her good parts (of which there are many)
