Yeah, read or write whatever you want, I don't really care in general (there are some topics I do care about, but I won't broach that here). The one thing that people shouldn't do with bashing fics is recommend them as quality fics. That's very disingenuous. Say that they're a good bashing fic, say that it's one of the best guilty pleasure fics, whatever, just don't pretend that they have respectable quality. It's the one thing that drives me nuts about them, that people recommend them without disclaimers. I think bashing fics can be great fun, like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion), but people, please don't just tell people to read Sinyk or Harry Crow without disclaimer.
