It's really annoying to see an interesting story idea ruined by the author deciding to have Harry and Hermione as a couple for me but you don't see me kicking up a storm about it. Authors can write whatever the hell they want. They aren't gonna alway write exactly what you want unless they are actively writing for you in a commission or friend manner. If it's not your tastes either try and find another story with a similar idea that doesn't bash, write one yourself or failing those contact an author who may be willing to write up what you want. I do think though it's sucky for something like bashing to not be disclaimed or mentioned in a summary or warnings of a story
