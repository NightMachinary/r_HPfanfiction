.... I have to admit I'm getting tired of posts like this on. If u don't like it, surprisingly you don't have to read it! I know some stories might slip something like this in there outta no where but most authors will put warnings of bashing. Literally the whole point of bashing is to bash! Like wtf! Sometimes I wanna read a “what if so and so was a dick” and see what the author has to say. It's fanfiction not canon! I'm not trying to be mean or anything but I really don't understand these types of posts???? U don't like something, congrats, but not all fanfiction is for u. Some of us like a little bashing alright. Not always, I love bashing but I also love awesome mother molly too. I don't understand the problem

Edit: holy crap, my first award! Thank you
