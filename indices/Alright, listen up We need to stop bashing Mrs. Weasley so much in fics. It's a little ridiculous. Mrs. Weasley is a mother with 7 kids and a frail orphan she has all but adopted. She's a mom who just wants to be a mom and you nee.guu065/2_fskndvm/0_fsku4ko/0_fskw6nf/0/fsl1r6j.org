Guys, no character or mother is perfect.I don't like how the fandom villainizes her for a few arguments with her kids or Sirius where she overreacted (and had some genuine reasons for doing so.)It's so obvious in the text that she's a loving supportive mother. That doesn't mean she hasn't argued with her children Every parent and child with an actual relationship will have arguments and disagreements.
