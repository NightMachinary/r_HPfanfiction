II agree she went too far in Book 5, but I find it interesting how nobody acknowledges her points or that Sirius also went too far with how he treated Harry in Book 5. I love both characters I just find it interesting how people lionize Sirius in fan fiction and ignore a lot of the flaws that make him such a vivid interesting character.
