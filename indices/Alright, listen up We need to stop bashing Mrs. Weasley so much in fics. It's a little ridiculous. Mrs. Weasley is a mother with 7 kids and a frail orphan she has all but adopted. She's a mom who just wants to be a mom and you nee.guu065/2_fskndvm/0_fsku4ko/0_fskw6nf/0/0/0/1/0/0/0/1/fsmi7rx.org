I'm replying about your earlier comment on Sirius. I'm defending him simply for one major reason. Mental health. Now I know this series is very illogical across the board, no doubt about it. This is one thing that was never addressed. Sirius was in a prison that essentially made you relive your worst memories over and over. Whether or not he had an ability to dampen the effects, the amount of exposure is still extremely damaging. Have you wondered why he might treat Harry like James? It's been about fourteen years for him in Order of the Phoenix, thirteen in prison and one on the run. The concept of time when all you do is relive something, whether it be a dream or a nightmare, is extremely diminished. It's similar to being put in a coma, when you wake up you just remember what you last saw, even if it was years ago. Honestly in some aspects this series is fucking atrocious in how it handles mental health, or sensitive topics. This is just an example, similar to how people basically parade about on Halloween celebrating the downfall of Voldemort, with no disregard whatsoever to the deaths. Even Harry himself doesn't really fully acknowledge what it meant. It was essentially the day he lost his entire future. Maybe it's not wrong, and I don't know what I'm talking about but holy hell it's just awful to read and see them celebrating a child being orphaned. I get this is a fictional series, but it doesn't change how gruesome it actually was.
