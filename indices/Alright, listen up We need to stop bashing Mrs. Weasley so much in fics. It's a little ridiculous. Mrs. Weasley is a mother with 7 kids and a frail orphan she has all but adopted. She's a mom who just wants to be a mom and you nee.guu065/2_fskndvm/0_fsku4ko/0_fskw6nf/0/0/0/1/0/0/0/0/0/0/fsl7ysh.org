Double checked that scene. I don't think Sirius thought Harry was James ever. The movies did that and that was disgusting.

However, in the books, being stuck alone in Grimmauld did make him a bit unstable. Was he trying to live a vicariously through Harry there, yeah. Maybe he saw the bit of James in Harry.

However, if we view book 4, you see him give good advice to Harry despite being on the run.

He's not perfect. He's a man with little control over his life.
