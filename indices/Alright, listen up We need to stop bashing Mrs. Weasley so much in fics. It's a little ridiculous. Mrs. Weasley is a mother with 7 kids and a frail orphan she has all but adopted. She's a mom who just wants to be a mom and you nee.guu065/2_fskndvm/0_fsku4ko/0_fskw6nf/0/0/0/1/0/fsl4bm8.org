He treated Harry like a mini James and negatively compared him to the father he idealizes and has never known bc Harry didn't agree with taking a huge risk. It's an understandable bad thing to do in the situation but I always saw that as really cruel. I like that Sirius has that depth there is some cruelty in him some by his upbringing some a darker side of bravery. He also egged on Harry's reckless side but given that lead to his death I'll give him a pass on it
