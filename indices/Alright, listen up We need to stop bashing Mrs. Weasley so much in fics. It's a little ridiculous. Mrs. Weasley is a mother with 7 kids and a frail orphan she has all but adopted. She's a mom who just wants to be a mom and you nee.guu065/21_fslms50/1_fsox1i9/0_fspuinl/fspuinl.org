Called by the wrong name is not the same as not being able to tell your twins apart. I have five sisters (none of them twins) and we get called the wrong names all the time. That just comes with large families.

But when she calls a twin Fred, gets told he's George /and agrees,/ only to find out he's really Fred after all... that is not being able to tell your twins apart. There are identical twins in my family, and their mother and grandmother always know which is which. (I don't because I live across the country and don't spend enough time with them.)
