Mrs Weasley is a parent who can't tell her twins apart, can't remember which child doesn't like corned beef, allows the twins to bully their siblings, wants to dictate her sons' careers, and publicly humiliates her children at school. You say she "all but adopted" Harry, but what she really does try to dictate his actions and privileges (and Hermione's), claiming the right to overrule his godfather while said godfather is in the same room and while a she is a guest in said godfather's house. A few gifts, as heartfelt and appreciated as they may be, and a few visits does not give her authority over Harry, but she stubbornly (and shrewishly) demands it anyway, threatening to tattle to +daddy+ Dumbledore when anybody tries to stand up to her.
