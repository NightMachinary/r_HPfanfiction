Her brothers Gideon and Fabian Prewett died in the first war, it makes sense for her to be overprotective, even irrationally so.

She's allowed to have faults and failings. Because she's a "doting mother" doesn't mean she has to be written as a flawless character. She'd be boringly one-dimensional if that was the case. In many fics I generally skip over her parts unless there's something new and interesting an author has brought to her character. Her being a scheming manipulator can be refreshing if written well. If that's an interpratation of her character you dislike, then drop the fic in favour of another that caters to your preference.

Fic authors are under no obligation to cater their writing to readers.
