I despise bashing of all kinds and agree with you there. But Molly is certainly more flawed that what you portray her as. She remains one of my favourites and she's a wonderfully complex character.

The only real thing I dislike about her character is her taking out Bellatrix. My man Neville deserved some closure/ revenge/ justice.
