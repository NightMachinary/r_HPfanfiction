They have more options besides Hogsmeade or buying a cookie-cutter muggle house in a conventional muggle subdivision with dozens of potential threats to the Statute within walking distance.

With apparation, the floo network, and even brooms rendering muggle concerns about distance and easy transportation moot, a wizard could comfortably live miles and miles away from anywhere and anyone, and still have a two minute commute to work, or be able to pop out to the shops within minutes.

Consider this, during the industrial revolution, a lot of agricultural workers in rural villages found their labor in the fields rendered moot with increasing mechanization, so they moved to the growing cities to work in factories. Now this is muggle history. Moving to find work is something that muggles do. As the tiny rural villages emptied of muggles, any wizards living in the village could have stayed behind. Perhaps enough of the muggle population moved out that the village was considered gone, and it was just one or two houses left that had wizards. A good chunk of wizarding housing stock could come from houses of wizards that were left behind by changing muggle population patterns.
