According to [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/clothing][JKR's Pottermore posts,]] even the most out-of-touch and anti-muggle wizards /do/ know about muggle culture. The Statute of Secrecy has a list of rules of "blending in" when going among muggles. The wizards that go around wearing nightgowns in public (like the breeze between the knees guy from the Quidditch World Cup) know what pants are, they just like walking around with their nuts out.

  Day to day, however, even those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing, which is undeniably practical compared with robes. Anti-Muggles will often attempt to demonstrate their superiority by adopting a deliberately flamboyant, out-of-date or dandyish style in public.

  Some members of the magical community go out of their way to break the clothing clause in the Statute of Secrecy. A fringe movement calling itself Fresh Air Refreshes Totally (F.A.R.T.)* insists that Muggle trousers â€˜stem the magical flow at source' and insist on wearing robes in public, in spite of repeated warnings and fines.

So I guess this makes Lucius Malfoy's [[https://i.imgur.com/3S3GIrH.png?1][ponytail and velvet ribbon bow]] a counter-culture fashion statement.
