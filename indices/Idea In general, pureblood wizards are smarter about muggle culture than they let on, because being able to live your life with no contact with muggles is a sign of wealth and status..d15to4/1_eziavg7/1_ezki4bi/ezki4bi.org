One of the reasons I like to consider Pottermore as quasi-canon is the line about muggle clothes being more practical than robes. Why can't wizards just use magic to make robes practical? They've gone to all that trouble to have separate cultures, and their arts and crafts aren't going to create something new? Baloney!

A lot of design choices in muggle clothing come from a need for freedom of movement. But, what if you could just charm your clothes to move around you? You might choose to wear yards and yards of material that billows dramatically around you, but the hem can fluff itself out of the way if it touches the toe of your shoe, or a stair step, so you'll never trip on it. Your sleeves could be huge and dramatic, but could be charmed to fluff themselves out of the way of a lamp on a side table, or other obstacles, so you'll never accidentally knock anything over. Witches' skirts could be charmed to rearrange themselves into something like culottes if they sense a broomstick. Huge hats could fold themselves to fit inside door frames.

My headcanon is that magical fashion dictates that a well-bred witch or wizard wears clothing that would be extremely impractical for a muggle to try to make or wear.
