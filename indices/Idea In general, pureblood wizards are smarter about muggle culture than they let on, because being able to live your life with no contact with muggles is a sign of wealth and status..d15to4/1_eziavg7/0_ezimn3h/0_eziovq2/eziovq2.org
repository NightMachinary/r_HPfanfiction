What did you expect from a man who forces a baby into the home of a young family who didn't want one, who already had their hands full with a baby of their own? Petunia must have been only 23 years old when Dumbledore dumped Harry on her doorstep with a letter explaining that her sister was dead.

  Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late---the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.

  An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.

  "Remember my last, Petunia."

Then Dumbledore sends a threatening letter when Petunia is upset about her son almost having his soul sucked out by invisible monsters none of them can see.

It's hard to say that Dumbledore truly respects muggles when he overrides their will and desires whenever he believes the situation calls for it. He Confunded and lied to Mrs. Cole from Tom Riddle's orphanage, when she was Tom's legal guardian, and by all rights had a valid, legal reason to know about his magic, like all muggleborn/muggle raised guardians do.
