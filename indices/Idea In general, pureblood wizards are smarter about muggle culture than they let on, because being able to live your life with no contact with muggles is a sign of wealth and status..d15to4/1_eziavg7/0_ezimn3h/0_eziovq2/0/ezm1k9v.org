I've always seen Dumbledore is a bit like Atticus Finch in Go Set A Watchman. A good man who protects the oppressed (muggles/African Americans), but not because he sees them as equals- rather, as someone who sees them as inferior and believes his kind (wizards/whites) have a paternalistic, "white man's burden" responsibility to "show them their place in the world."

Does he do things that are objectively good and help the oppressed? Yes. Is his reasons for doing so racist and condescending? Also yes. It makes for a complex character who can avoid the evil!Dumbledore and incompetent!Dumbledore tropes while still being someone who Harry can strongly disagree with ideologically, even if they are on the same side.
