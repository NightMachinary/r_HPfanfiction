  ‘I'm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that's what you're suggesting!' said the Prime Minister hotly. ‘He's highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them --'

  ‘I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt's work continues to be ... er ... excellent,' said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.
