There is a disconnect between wizards' ignorance of Muggles and their success in wizarding secrecy. Kingsley Shacklebolt refers to firearms as "firelegs"; he also successfully infiltrates the office of the Prime Minister with no one noticing.

There are two possible explanations (which are not mutually exclusive):

1. As you say, the appearance of ignorance is cultural. Wizards understand Muggles well enough, they just enjoy mispronouncing things etc.

2. Magic is very good at covering up their mistakes.
