After reading Strangers at Drakeshaugh, I realised that the Statute of Secrecy makes it very problematic to actually mingle with neighbours. It was sweet to see the Potters swap babysitting and recipes and just hang out with another family from their new school, but as Jacqui kept noticing the signs that something was unusual about the Potters, I kept waiting and wishing for the big reveal. Until I realised that it wasn't going to happen, that legally it /couldn't/ happen, that if the Charltons finally saw too much, they wouldn't be brought into the secret; they would be Obliviated. >! Which happens in one of the later books, when the Charltons' six year old sees accidental magic and Harry has to remove the memory. Which is apparently happening with increasing frequency.!<

No wonder wizarding culture is isolated. Who wants a friendship that can never get past the lies?
