i honestly just assumed that while the main reason they don't bring it back is because Umbridge is gone, the real reason they don't bring it back is because Harry just lost Sirius a year after watching Cedric die while also finding out about the prophecy and seeing his friends almost die at the hands of the death eaters and he feels like he's to blame so there's a lot of guilt there. Harry's also extremely paranoid (rightfully so) due to all of this death and trauma so taking up the job of leading the DA paired with all of the above and again Harry's own self doubt ^{(he spends a lot of time in the series feeling like he's not as good at defensive magic as people see him as}) after everything that happens in the Department of Mysteries Harry is not going to keep the club up. If anything he'll feel like if anything DOES happen to them that he wasn't good enough at teaching them and so it's his fault something happened to them. So on that front it makes sense but i still would have loved to see more flushing out of the minor characters but that would involve Harry trusting anyone outside of his immediate circle and let's be honest the way JK had written the series up until HBP there was only ever signs to him that his classmates were fickle and it was easy for them to turn against him so even if he likes them he wouldn't trust them or even know how to begin trusting them ^{(which could have made for a great character development but that would require more writing on JKs behalf so....we were DENIED!!!! lol})
