See, your explanation makes a ton of sense and would fit well into Harry's character. It's a shame it never truly got conveyed in the books. Like, imagine Harry facing increasing pressure from Neville to reform the DA and Harry's torn between the prospective guilt of something happening to them and facing the stark reality that, really, everyone is in danger no matter what. Book Six felt like everyone stuck their heads in the sand when it came to the war outside the walls--hell, Ron and Hermione think Harry's a moron for being rightfully suspicious of Malfoy--and I would've loved to see the tension born from students realizing that they can't hide from it anymore.
