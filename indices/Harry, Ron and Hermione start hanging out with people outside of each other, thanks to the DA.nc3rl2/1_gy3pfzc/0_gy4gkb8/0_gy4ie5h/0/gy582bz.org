i honestly think the reason that it's not explained in the books is 1. because poor writing ^{(listen i LOVE the series but i would be lying if i said that the author didn't do a piss poor job at developing these characters properly}) 2. because the author expected us as the reader ^{(for gods sake woman we were CHILDREN lol}) to pick up on these characteristics of Harry's ourselves which....NO we shouldn't have to piece this together years later when talking with other fans to realize this. Harry's guilt is a very consistent theme in the series so delving into that would have been amazing to read. I feel like book 6 is the best representation of how poorly written the characters are as a whole (by the author mind you) because that's the book where everything should start clicking together for people. Voldemort being back isn't a secret anymore the disappearances from and mysterious deaths from the previous book aren't that mysterious anymore. The attacks on muggles and magical folk alike have started up again hell Amelia Bones who is hailed by most in book 5 as being a fair and level headed and logic driven voice of reason if you will is murdered outright by Voldemort himself and she put up one hell of a fight! So him being back and that reality setting in for the students ^{(also students family members start dying too!}) would have been SOOO good to explore! I hate how it's implied that the reason they don't believe Harry in book 6 is because he was wrong about the Department of Mysteries situation. Like the nuance for that is gone because Harry was only susceptible to that manipulation because Dumbledore ^{(no shade to him for doing this because now that i'm older i also would have doubts about how open i would be with a 15 year old in a similar situation even if it was Harry}) wasn't open and honest with Harry about what was happening and why he needed to take occlumency but in book 6 Harry has the full picture now and while there are still a few things he doesn't know he's not in the same situation of not knowing the important things and info like in book 5. So them not trusting him only for him to turn around and be correct is so frustrating because aside from the DoM situation in book 5 Harry had a pretty good track record of having a hunch and being damn near spot on. But let me stop because i'm seriously ranting at this point LOL
