This prompt reminds me of yet another reason why I hate HBP with a burning passion.

You mean to tell me that, after a summer where Death Eaters move out into the open and start killing people, Harry just nopes the fuck out of bringing back the DA solely because Umbridge is gone? Your classmates' families are being murdered but apparently there's no point in learning how to defend yourself anymore. And that doesn't even begin to cover the fact that it was a perfect way to flesh out minor characters and expose Harry to new/different situations. But I guess we really needed five chapters of Won-Won instead.
