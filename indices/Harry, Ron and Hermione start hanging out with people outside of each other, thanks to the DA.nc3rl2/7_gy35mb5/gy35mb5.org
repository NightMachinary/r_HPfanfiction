Ginny and Hermione become friends, especially in 6th year. Since Ginny was already sort-of friends with Luna, and Hermione remembers Luna supported Harry when no-one else did, she's willing to bond with her and ignore the weirder beliefs. Via them, Luna gets to know more people outside her House, and gets some more friends.
