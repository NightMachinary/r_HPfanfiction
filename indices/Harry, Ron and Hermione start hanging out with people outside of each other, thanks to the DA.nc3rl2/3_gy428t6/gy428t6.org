Kinda reminding me of [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/Motivations/?bypass=1][Motivations]], where instead of the DA a bunch of kids of all houses create a Muggle subjects club that winds up incorporating basically everything from maths (including accounting and even poker) to dueling over the years (and Harry refuses Hermione's idea because he's already got a club), and it's not until year 6 or 7 I think that Hermione actually wants to join (because poker was brought up in the very first session and she wanted nothing to do with that so she noped out) and by then it's too late lol.
