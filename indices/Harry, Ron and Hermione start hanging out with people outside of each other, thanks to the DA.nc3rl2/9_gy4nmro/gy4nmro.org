I remember reading a story like this with similar premises, but that it was a club for kids that wanted to learn muggle subjects. Harry had friends from all houses as early as second year and became club leader in the 5th after the previous one left hogwarts.

The only problem with that was the story contained Hermione and Ginny bashing. It was Harry x Astoria, btw.
