I'm trying to read it...

I'm not sure I'll be able to get much farther. The quantity is there. The quality? Not so much.

1) “Hardwin” - I don't particularly care for the name, but I was getting used to it, and it does have canon justification as passing down a family name(Hardwin was the Potter who married the one of the Peverell heirs). But just as I was gettin used to it, it switched to “Hadrian”. Also, the plot point of him preferring his given name over his nickname was dropped after the first chapter.

2) Verb Tenses - verbs keep being written in different tenses, even in the same sentence, and it's jarring to say the least.

3) Internally inconsistent characterizations - I don't mind it when characters act differently from how they would have in canon. It /is/ fanfiction, after all. However, I find it very annoying when the characters don't act consistently within the story.
