Concerning the “pig for slaughter” comment, I really liked unfortunately unfulfilled plot bunny in the chapter 8 of linkao3(Scribble Pad by White_Squirrel) “Ferte in Noctem Animam Meam”: Dumbledore knows Harry has a Horcrux in his head, but there is nothing to do with it, and so he treats him as a child with the terminal disease and tries not to ruin his childhood prematurely. The similar theme is the core of linkffn(The Horcrux Within by althor42) and in somewhat oblique way linkao3(Tea Cures All Ills by delizabethl22).
