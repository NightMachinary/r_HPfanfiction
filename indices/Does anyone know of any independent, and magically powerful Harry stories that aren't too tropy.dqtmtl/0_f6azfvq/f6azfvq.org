linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament)

There are some tropes, like learning from a library inside the Chamber, the possibility of multiple marriages based on bloodlines (Black and Potter), Dobby being BFF. There's a bit of Ron bashing in the first few chapters, but he's completely a non-factor after that, so is Hermione, for that matter.

Honestly, its really different from the usual, with interesting character development for Harry, he starts as a whiny brat (imo) and he just keeps maturing and maturing, to the point you wouldn't believe he's the same kid. And it happens naturally and genuinely. There's a few good OC, mainly Madame Lacroix and Natalia, the Delacours are interesting, Slughorn is phenomenal, he has such a depth that is only skimmed in canon. Dumbledore is, well, he isn't evil, nor he is GG manipulative old-goat, but he isn't the omniscient god as he seems in canon, he's flawed, and he's fairly shaded.

Harry is independent without being that annoying kind of fic, he's actively working to become free of any control over him, be it from the Ministry, Dumbledore, and the world in general, with his being the BWL.

Overal, its a great read, if you haven't yet. But I might be a bit biased. I hope not, I don't think I've misled anything with my comments.

If you've read A Cadmean Victory, its that but much better, with no edgy 'I do not forgive, I do not forget' Harry, great OCs, Fleur is adorable, good battle scenes (though there's been only 1 major so far) and my favourite part, the intricate system of how magic works, guided by a journal.
