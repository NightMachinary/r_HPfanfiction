I think linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) would fit the description of 'not too tropey', and either way, if you haven't read it, it's an enjoyable read.

There's also linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness), which, if you can look past the occasional spelling mistakes, is a decent story, written before DH, and possibly even before HBP.
