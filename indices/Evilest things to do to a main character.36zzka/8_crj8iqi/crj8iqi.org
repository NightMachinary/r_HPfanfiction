It's not "blood-boiling" stuff (it was played for laughs), but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][putting Harry and Molly Weasley in a soul bond]] probably qualifies as among the eviler things done to a protagonist.

I can handle most challenges, even extreme ones, sent the protagonist's way provided they're integral to the story and not just there for shock value. More annoying for me is when the character is handed a full-on personality transplant for no reason: Hermione with the idiot ball, Ron the Death Eater, craven or overly emo Harry, evil Dumbledore, etc.
