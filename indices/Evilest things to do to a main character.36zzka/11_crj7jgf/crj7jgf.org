Main character losing their magic. It actually made me stop reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima Ratio]] when Hermione was going through school for months without having any magic. I was rather liking the story until then and I actually tried to push through until it was fixed, but after several chapters of her being in magic school without any magic and no one noticing (how does that work?), I stopped reading out of frustration.

Your point of the protagonist losing control over her body makes for a good second place, I remember reading a story where Ron drugged Hermione with a love potion to make her see he's best for her and it ticked me off.
