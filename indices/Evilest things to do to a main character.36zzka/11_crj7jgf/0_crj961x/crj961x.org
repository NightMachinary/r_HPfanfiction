This is another thing. I know for a fact that there are several hp fics out there that say outright that harry or someone else who is the main character wont have magic. And I'm like: "Dude, that's the point of the whole universe!" You shouldn't write a harry potter fiction without magic because it takes out the core of the whole story, i think at least.
