I agree with you completely. As long as its well-written, any kind of story element can work out.

That said, I'm yet to see a fic well-written enough to make Voldemort someone Harry would be willing to get jiggy with.

Also, this may be the fic where Hermione can read Harry's mind. If so, I actually liked it, the author provided a good reason for why it was so. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team]]
