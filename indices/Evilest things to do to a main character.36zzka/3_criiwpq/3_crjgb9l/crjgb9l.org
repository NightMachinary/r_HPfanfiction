Pedophilia is prepuberty; I'm not one for age gap relationships unless the younger partner is of age and even then it depends on how the character is written in terms of maturity. I get the rest of what you're saying though, the only time I've seen Snape/Harry work was an adult Harry way post war, and the Draco/Harry fics that seem to work are so AU that Draco is essentially no longer the same character. Same original background, sure, but it's diverged big time.
