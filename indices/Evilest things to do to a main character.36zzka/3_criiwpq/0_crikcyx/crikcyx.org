This isn't exactly what I asked, but agree with you regardless. Disregarding the fact that slash is a instant bye for me, pairing cannon Harry with anyone completely evil is really hard. It's an other thing if the author actually takes his/her time to develop Harry so that their relationship is believable. Anyway, can't really comment on this because, as I said, I don't really read any slash fics :) What I asked for are more like story elements that, while make a good plot device, you still hate the author who puts your favorite character thorugh it :D
