hmm interesting opinion, but yeah it's only your personal opinion. I find it quite interesting when the main character's motivation comes from something strong like the death of a loved one. Perhaps you should read more literature, may I suggest "willy wonka and the chocolate factory" by Roald Dahl. Quite inspiration, and the main character Charlie, isn't motivated by any character death.
