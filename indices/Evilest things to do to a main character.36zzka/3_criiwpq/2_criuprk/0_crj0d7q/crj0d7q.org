I personally dislike slash because of the lack of good writing I have experienced. I can not name a good Slash fic that focuses on plot and not the fact that they (the main characters) are in a relationship. If it was done following the idea that "oh, this is the plot, this is what happens, and by the way, Harry and Draco have a relationship." Instead of it being OH Harry and Draco have a relationship, the world stops spinning, people are only going to kill/attack/plot because of this. That in my personal opinion is the problem with Slash.(And all fanfictions with Pairings) THAT being said, I do like the thought of Harry/Voldie and Harry betrays him which ends up killing him... hmm...
