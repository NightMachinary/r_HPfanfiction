When people pair Harry with Snape/Voldemort/Draco.

Don't get me wrong I'm not against homosexuality, if someone has a slash pairing I just won't read it, but those three pairings are disgusting to me.

I could see a Harry/Neville or a Harry/Ron working but he hates the other three.

Pairing them together IMO is evil, why the f*ck would I want to fall in love with the man who killed my parents and annually tries to kill me. Snape and Draco both hate Harry for different reasons but they still hate him.

Snape may have loved Lily but that doesn't mean he would love Harry nevermind that the relationship is paedophilia.

Draco and Harry just no. Seriously the only people who could actually think that could work are teenage girls.

I'm sorry for the rant but once I got going I couldn't stop.

Please don't kill me slash lovers. And OP sorry if this isn't what you wanted.
