One thing I really hate to see is the pov character losing their memory or being Obliviated.

It's infuriating. Basically, the author has just told me what the ending is going to be /then/ made sure my reader avatar doesn't know. So I have to watch them stumble around blindly for however many chapters in the name of 'drama' and 'tension' while I'm sitting back grinding my teeth over how stupid it is that /I/ know more than the character that is supposed to be my eyes and ears in the world.

Obliviation can be done well, but if it is the pov character being Obliviated I'm adamant that the reader shouldn't know /what/ was obliviated until the character remembers. That adds good tension, especially if you add a bit of foreshadowing to suggest that something's not quite right.

Similarly having the main character left helpless before an Imperius Curse or control potion of some kind. A brief stint is fine to show the stakes of the battle but having them completely subverted for ages is just bleak and I have no interest in watching it unfold.
