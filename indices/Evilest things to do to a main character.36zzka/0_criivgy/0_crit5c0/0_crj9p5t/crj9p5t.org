Especially when the antagonist is highly intelligent too, not to mention the people around the protagonist.

I mean, lets be real here. Dumbledore, however stupid his plan in canon was, is highly intelligent. 15 year old prodigy Harry is not going to outsmart him constantly. Same goes with Voldemort. Say about him what you want but he is on a level with Dumbledore.

Same goes with people like Scrimgeour, Bones, the administration of Minister Fudge, the Wizengamot members,... those are all at least capable of complex thought processes. Harry is not going to outsmart them the way he does in so many fanfics, completely ignoring in this argument that authors often come up with a fairytale of politics.
