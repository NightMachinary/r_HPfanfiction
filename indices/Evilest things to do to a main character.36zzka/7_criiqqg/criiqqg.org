There was a fic that has since been taken down called Sanitarium.

In it, Hermione had lost her focus and ingenuity partway through the war against Voldemort. Later it was revealed that she was blackmailed by Theodore Nott to extract the bulk of her classtime memories for him to absorb, thereby making him the smartest wizard of his generation. With the bulk of her knowledge inaccessible, Hermione turned to drugs to cope.

The reveal for that brought me to tears (of course I was sick with stomach flu so my emotions may have been easier to provoke).

I cried again when the trio finally caught up with Nott and made him give back the memories... and took his own as well. Harrowing stuff.
