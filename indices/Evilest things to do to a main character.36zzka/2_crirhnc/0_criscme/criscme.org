I have seen so much of these sadly. I'm not saying I'm amazing at character development etc, but some people don't even try. And what's even worse is when you see a fic that's horrible but has like 100k+ words und stupid amount of favs and follows, and I'm thinking, "what are you doing people! This fic is unreadable!" or something similar :D
