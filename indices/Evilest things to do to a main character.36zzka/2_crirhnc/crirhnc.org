Take a main character, usually Harry, Draco or Hermione depending on your gender and fantasy, but I've seen others. Hollow them out to an empty shell of their canon self and then stuff yourself in them to play out whatever power or romantic fantasy you have to unrealistic levels. Then deny it and get super upset when people point it out.
