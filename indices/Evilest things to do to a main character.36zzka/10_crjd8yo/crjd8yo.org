** Character Bashing.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: character-bashing.
   :END:
I don't like certain characters, and I can understand if a fanfiction author wishes to portray a character in a certain fashion because they don't like them, but when we are /told/ rather than /shown/ why we should dislike a character, it ruins the immersion of the story. The further away a character behaves in the story than how it behaves in canon, the more time and effort needs to be put into displaying this change. However, many bashing authors simply have a favourite character say or think things that are down-putting to the character that the author dislikes, whether or not their actions warrant that. Some times, I click on a bashing fic hoping that there will be some sort of subversion to the trope; where the bashing does not follow the simple 'Word of God says to HATE THIS CHARACTER.' For example, if we see a Ron bashing fic, shown from the viewpoint of Hermione, we might see how Ron is a lazy neer-do-well. The typical Ron bashing fic might include Harmony; but all we're going to get is the author projecting his or her feelings onto Ron. Ron will descend from layabout to worse, contrasting with the relationship between Harry and Hermione. However, if there was a bashing fic where bashing was used as a story tool rather then a lens, it could work out very well. However, most authors who bash characters just cannot write well enough to do this.

Mischaracterization.

I suppose that this is the natural continuation of bashing; it's not as bad, and I might even be guilty of it myself, but it can be very annoying to read; when a character behaves in a manner that is completely alien to what we know the characters to be.
