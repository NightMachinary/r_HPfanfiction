Dumbledore is one of the most polarizing characters in HP; this complexity of character is something that is very hard to recreate. I don't mind people getting angry at Dumbledore, but there is a problem when the author presents Dumbledore as uncaring or foolish; Dumbledore does borderline things in Canon, but he is genuinely motivated to help everyone. Presenting Dumbledore as a Gold-Hoarding, Goblin-Insulting, Harry-Oppressing dunderhead, completely wastes one of the most complex characters J.K. Rowling gave us.
