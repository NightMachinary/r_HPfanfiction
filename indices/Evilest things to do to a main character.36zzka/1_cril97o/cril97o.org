I once read a fanfic where Harry had been burnt alive, paralysed from the waist down, and blinded, all before reaching Hogwarts. As backstory. (I think It Got Worse.)

For me personally, any kind of body horror. Teeth getting transfigured into wriggling maggots tethered to your jaw? ugh. Arms being changed into slimy, slithering tentacles which ooze weird, smelly fluids?

Of course, because this is the worst thing for me, it is also my favourite thing.
