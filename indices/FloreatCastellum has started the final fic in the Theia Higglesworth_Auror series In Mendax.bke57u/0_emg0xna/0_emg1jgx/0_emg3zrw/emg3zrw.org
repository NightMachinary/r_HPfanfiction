Oh yeah I was super inspired by Broadchurch and make no excuses for lifting a few themes from there. Also from the show unforgotten and luther. The ending was tricky because I felt that if I pulled it out any more I would end up in the trial, And that would be a novel itself establishing where responsibility and guilt lie.

In Mendax is far more ambitious so I'm a bit nervous about it but I guess as long as I have fun it's ok. ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ
