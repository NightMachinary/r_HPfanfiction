/Hollow Ash/ is definitely an improvement in many ways, but there are things about /The Aurors/ that I like better.

Personally, I thought that the ending to /Hollow Ash/ was a bit abrupt, but it's growing on me as I re-read it. The quicker ending does seem to match the tone of the story a bit better, due to the tighter pacing of Hollow Ash.

And I have no idea if this was intentional or not, but there are things about /Hollow Ash/ that remind me of season 3 of Broadchurch (victim has no/little memory, involves a small community, bit of a "whodunnit" mystery, etc).

From what little I've seen of /In Mendax/, it looks very promising. Theia's mindset feels like a natural continuation of where she was at for much of Hollow Ash. I also think your prose lends itself well to stories like this, the description of even mundane things like eating bread feel like they're how Theia would be interpreting it, and through the lens of her depression.
