The Depths of Winter [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1728364/1/]]

Let me know how you like it. I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but it's the only one I know where Ron is dead. He's already passed at the start... I just saw there was no recs and I figured something is better than nothing.

OMG I just realized you recommended sacrifices arc to someone a few days ago!! I love that series too!!! You didn't post the link so I posted it under you. Sorry that was off topic, but I love that series I always recommend it. So kudos on your good taste.
