The backstory is canon up to DH, then "faithful to canon but darker" after that. Then Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville suddenly find themselves in an AU, which is where this story starts.

The characters (especially Harry and Hermione, and especially especially Harry) are incredibly broken, but in a very well-done way. It turns out there's a very good explanation -- over and above sheer angst at their losses and the responsibility on their shoulders -- for this, which I won't spoil for you.
