This one is mine. Sadly (for me) it's not a particularly popular story but it does seem to meet your criteria. It's an Auror Harry story set in 2009 and it's generally canon compliant. I do use several OC side characters. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]]
