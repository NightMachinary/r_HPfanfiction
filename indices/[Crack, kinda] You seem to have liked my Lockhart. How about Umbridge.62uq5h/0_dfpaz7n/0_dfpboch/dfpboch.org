You really should read /Suicide Squad/ comics. I recommend the original series from the 1980s by Ostrander, followed by /Checkmate/, /Secret Six/ and current /Suicide Squad Rebirth/.

Also, even if you won't read anything else, read recent /Suicide Squad/Banana Splits Special/. 30 pages of crazy fun followed by 10 pages of depressing fun.
