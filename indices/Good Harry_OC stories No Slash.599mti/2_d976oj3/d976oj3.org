I remember enjoying The Brave New World by bellerophon30 back in the day. But I haven't read it in forever, so no idea how it holds up. Also, it seems to have recently disappeared from the Internet; google still lists it, but you get "story not found" when you click through. I have a copy, but I won't distribute it publicly until I know what's up with the author.
