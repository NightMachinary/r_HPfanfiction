Harry once apparated to the school rooftop as a kid, casually breaking the laws of reality and space-time, and as canon points out in book 3 he is ridiculously overpowered with his fancy NEWT spell.

It stands to reason that Harry once again and manages to save himself by apparating himself towards the right dimension again. Because why should the wizarding world only break the space part of space-time, and only within the reality they know already?

Bonus points if this is the start of either a 12- year old time or dimension traveling Harry fic.

It'd also be fun if he would end up in a reality where James and Lily lived.

This plunny has potential!
