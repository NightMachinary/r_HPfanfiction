Another prompt that I really thought was gonna end differently. I was expecting that Lockhart casts the spell and the arm he cast it on is the only thing left. It's still Harry - the arm answers to the name and is fully sentient and living and moves on its own - but it ends just below the (non-existent) shoulder.
