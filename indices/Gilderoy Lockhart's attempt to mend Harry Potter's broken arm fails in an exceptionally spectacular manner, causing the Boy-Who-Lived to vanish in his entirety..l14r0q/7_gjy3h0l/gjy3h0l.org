One fanfic had a huge chamber underground where everything ended up when they were "vanished". I think it was a plot point to retrieve something by going there. Very old fic.

At least one recent fic had "un-vanishing". Wave your wand and it disappeared, wave it again and it came back. Lazy writing.

Speaking of lazy writing: Don't. Conjure. Food!
