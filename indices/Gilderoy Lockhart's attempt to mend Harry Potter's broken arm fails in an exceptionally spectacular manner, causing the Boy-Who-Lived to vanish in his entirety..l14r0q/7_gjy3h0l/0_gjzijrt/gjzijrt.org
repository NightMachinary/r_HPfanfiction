Actually, un-vanishing is pretty much canon, or at the very least strongly implied. In book 5, after an order meeting Harry's eye catches a blueprint of a building which is collected by Bill, who then proceeds to vanish it along with other documents. Makes sense that Bill would be able to make the documents appear again for the next meeting again, wouldn't it? Unless one claims they'd procure new documents each time they meet of course, which sounds... well.
