Voldemort promptly finds himself, moments after his resurrection, teleported into a solid wall of rock. His new body doesn't exactly die, but it becomes somewhat difficult to control when meshed with stone.

Harry looks around at the DE's and asks them if anyone wants to be next.

Crazy DE starts casting the Killing curse, joins his Lord. Does not survive.

When a second one does the same, Harry sends them all into walls/etc.

The second wizard blood war was short.
