linkffn(12315670) is largely structured around exactly such a thing. In the author's profile it's described as "A magical whodunnit" (although in the interest of calibrating expectations I'll mention it's no more solvable by the reader than a randomly-selected case of Sherlock Holmes ðŸ˜‰).

(Per your request: the story overall has an M rating and starts off with a warning about a sex scene. It is in chapter nine, and if you would like to skip past it, you can search for the text "Oh Harry. How do you keep getting into these situations?". You will have a fairly good/gradual indication of when you may want to do so, i.e. not right away.)
