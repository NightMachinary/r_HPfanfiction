Yeah. I don't think I've seen a fanfic that 'plays fair' when they do the whodunnit thing yet. Mystery is hard to write, after all. But thank you for calibrating in advance, both in the mystery and the smut. I've enjoyed some of LeQuins other works too, so that bodes well for this one. Thanks for the rec!
