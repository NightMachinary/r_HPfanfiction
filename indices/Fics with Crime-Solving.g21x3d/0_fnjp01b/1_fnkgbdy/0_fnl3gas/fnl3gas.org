I don't believe so. The story does a pretty good job at explaining itself. My DC knowledge is pretty mediocre also. There are three big DC names in the story that I know, and I only ever seen Batman. Only know the other two by name. The bad guys name probably should ring some bells, which could add to the story, but I don't know him either.

I think that the story is focused enough on finding Neville that anyone should manage. You might not make some connections, but the overall story readable.
