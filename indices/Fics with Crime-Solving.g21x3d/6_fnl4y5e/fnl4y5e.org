- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]]... Harry is an Auror trying to solve a crime
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][The Conspiracy of Blood]]... Harry is an old Auror trying to solve a conspiracy
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053?view_full_work=true][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]... largely focusses on Harry's muggle neighbour and Ginny while Harry is an Auror and tries to solve a crime (less focus on crime solving)
- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=213384][The Seer]]... James Sirius Potter is a seer and there's a conspiracy... can they stop it before it's too late? I can't remember how much emphasis there is on the crime solving part.

As I remember, there's no smut in those.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13191881/1/The-Peverell-Dilemma][The Peverell Dilemma]]... Harry is a journalist and tries to (a) do something with his life (like solving crime) and (b) date Ginny... to be clear, this is not a Muggle AU

Lots of smut in this. Mostly at the end of chapters. I think you can skip it just fine.

These are all Hinny, incidentally.
