A very interesting introduction - does the Snape-Harry Romance have some actual build-up/growth to it or has Harry gone mad/obtained a moderate to severe case of amnesiac masochism to shack up with his bullying ex-teacher? Which is probably a somewhat harsh-sounding way to ask if Snape is OOC or grows away from being his canon bitter old bastard self, but I didn't mean it harshly and the translation is there if you need it. :D
