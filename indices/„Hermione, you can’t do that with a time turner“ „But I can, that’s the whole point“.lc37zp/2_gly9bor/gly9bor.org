Well, wouldn't they only have to go into hiding until the point she used the time turner? And since the cannon rules are going back only an hour, the hiding wouldn't really be necessary.

Of course, it might be necessary as a strategic measure: If Hermione was known to save people with the time turner, Death eaters would start arranging deaths that couldn't easily be faked, and there wouldn't be much reason to hide the ability.

"Oh, Hermione, you are here, and with your time turner. They are gonna hit me in an hour eh? Ok, lets set up the fake"

But of course, you could tweak it slightly. If you couple it with the ability to do a far time travel and return (ie, go back to the first war), thus making it so the people she saves have to hide until her departure point, you can get a lot of what you want.
