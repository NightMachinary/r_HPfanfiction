Doesn't the incident with buckbeak prove the observer effect applies to time travel, ergo if the people time traveling don't directly witness an incident occur with 100% certainty, it therefore can exist with a state similar to Shodingers cat, both having and not having transpired. Therefore it is possible to change time. It doesn't even have to be a long term difference, since the only people that will remember the two timelines are the time traveler, you could for example have this occur: after the battle of hogwarts harry uses the remaining timeturner to go back before the battle, after having run away and telling people not to tell him who has died. He is able to use a combination of the invisibility cloak, a number of stunners, obliviations and confundus, and some quick transfigurations on downed death eaters and is basically able to save everyone that "died" and after having them hide out until after the battle where he reveals the "dead" doubles
