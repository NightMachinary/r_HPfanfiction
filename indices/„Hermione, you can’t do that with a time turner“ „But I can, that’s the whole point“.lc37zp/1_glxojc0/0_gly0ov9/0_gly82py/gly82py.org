But they never traveled back in time, nor tell the time travelers whether buckbeak was actually executed or not, harry and hermione just assume it happens due to the thunk of the axe and hagrids wail, but don't actually see it occur. Even dumbledore later says they have a chance to save two lives.

This gives uncertainty principal. Hermione now has all the info she needs to realize as long as they can save buckbeak, thier past future selves will still think it has happened, this is further proved when they see events play out from the actual perspective.

Let's say Ron was present at hagrids hut and "saw" it happen and then tells Harry and Hermione it happened, as long as Ron isn't the one to travel back in time, and harry and hermione can arrange events to make Ron think it happened, then the paradox rule of the time turner has not been broken, and no alternative time line has occurred.
