  In addition, your premise has a contradiction- let's say in one timeline Buckbeak is truly executed, and the trio hear the thunk of the ax. Isn't this observing the event?

No. It's only an indirect observation. They don't know the true origin of the sound because they didn't observe the event that produced the sound. So long as H + H ensure that their past selfs hear the same sound they heard they can in fact "change" the past.
