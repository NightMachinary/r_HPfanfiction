See, but that's the thing. Read the paragraph above that one. They didn't actually change the events, they just revealed that what was assumed to have happened was, in fact, false.

You could get the same effect with visual observation by... polyjuice potion, or illusions, or elaborate paper-mache, or whatever.

Like, I'll say that your idea is a neat one, for fanfic or an original work. But it's not the way time travel in HP works (at least for PoA, not getting into CC).

Time travel in HP works in closed loop- you don't truly make changes. However, the 'past' versions of the characters lack information, so they make incorrect assumptions. It is /not/ the case where Buckbeak was dead, and they /changed/ it so that he was alive. It /is/ the case where Buckbeak was alive but presumed dead by the Trio (though Dumbledore knew him to be alive) and this fact was /revealed/ to the Trio.

Like, you've got the pieces, you're just overcomplicating it. Like the Ron seeing Buckbeak die example- your solution is "actually, no, Ron didn't see Buckbeak die, he just thought he did", which is exactly what I'm saying. You can stop there, there's no need to bring in paradox uncertainty or alternate timelines or anything like that. Or the limitation that Ron couldn't be the one to go back, because that's directly refuted by canon, when Harry used the patronus to save his past self.

Past Harry observed the event, and was positive that it was James Potter. He was wrong, of course, but by your rules this situation would be impossible, as future Harry went and 'changed' an event that past Harry had observed. But the solution is just the simple case of, no, you're wrong about this.
