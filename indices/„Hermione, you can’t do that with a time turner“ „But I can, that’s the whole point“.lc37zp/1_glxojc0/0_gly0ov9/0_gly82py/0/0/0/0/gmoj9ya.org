Mate, I'm afraid you're the one overcomplicating things. I know HP time travel is a closed loop and I know that they aren't changing things, which is why I put the word in paranthesis. They aren't changing events, they aren't even rearranging them, they're arranging them, acting then out for the first time despite the fact the that from their pov they already took place.

The only point I was trying to make with my comment was about direct and indirect observation and the effect this might have on time travel.

Even then, even with direct observation, if they saw Buckbeak get his head chopped off they could still save him. As long as they can transfigure a pumpkin into a perfect Buckbeak replica or something similar that is.

The only things that a time traveler knows about the past is what they observed, whether directly or indirectly. Whatever actions their future self took in the past they won't find out until they have traveled back themselves. And while their actions in the past can't contradict what has already happened (it already happened after all), it can contradict the things they only assumed that happened. Even if that something is seeing Buckbeak getting executed.

Edit: btw, I never brought up alternate timelines or anything, I was only responding to a single part of your comment. (check usernames)
