You're just... overthinking things. In PoA, the time travel worked as a closed loop. There was no true 'changes' or uncertainty. H and H went back, and did the actions their future selves had already done.

Dumbledore /already/ knew that Buckbeak was not dead, because he never saw Buckbeak die. However, at the point where he sent H + H back, they had not yet saved /Sirius/, who was still stuck in the tower. That's why "chance to save two lives"- he knew they'd saved one (Buckbeak) but didn't know they'd save Sirius as well. (In fact it was their future selves a moment later who informed him of success).

Now this is separate from the idea the OP raised or your Ron example, which is that events could be faked. There's no reason to bring in alternate timelines or anything, just that what Ron believed he saw was in fact, /not the truth/- just like how when the trio heard the axe and wail, they made a wrong assumption. This really doesn't actually have anything to do inherently with time travel, though it (and future knowledge) would definitely help pull it off.

In addition, your premise has a contradiction- let's say in one timeline Buckbeak is truly executed, and the trio hear the thunk of the ax. Isn't this observing the event? So H + H can't change it, because they observed it. There's zero reason to think that observation by sound is different than by sight (or touch or whatever). So 'time travelers can't have observed the event they want to change' falls apart.
