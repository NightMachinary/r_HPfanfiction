Would also be fun if she had to conceal them with only her resources (because if someone started drawing from their bank account after dying, the Goblins would get suspicious and the timeline would break - so no Black Fortune to help her out in rescuing Sirius from the DoM) and thus had to convince, cajole, and otherwise cavort with reality on a student's budget to keep them hidden/disguised and maintain the integrity of the timeline until some Magic-McGuffin criterion is met and she can release them without unravelling Everything.

And the only person she can talk to about all of this?

Luna.

Because while Hermione's mind is the only one that can keep all these reality changes straight and separate and neatly categorised in her mental library, Luna's mind is the only one that can believe four different things at the same time and still think things make sense, so she's insulated from the Reality Collapse that would happen if, say, Harry had to get his head around the idea of his Godfather being both dead and alive at the same time.
