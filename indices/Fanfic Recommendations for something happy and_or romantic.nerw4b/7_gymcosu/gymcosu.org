If I'm not too late, and you don't mind post-war EWE SSHG, then here are...

My #1 go-to comfort fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit]] by miamadwyn which is short and sweet and /hilarious/.

I've also /written/ some that might fit the bill:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27293059][Constellations Above the Bonfires]] at 3300 words alternating POV described in reviews as "bewitching" and "like a warm hug in story form"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26580946][So You Think That's an Age Gap?]] at 1900 words Hermione's POV described by multiple reviews as very fluffy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29359479][Letters by Candlelight]] at 10k words alternating POV described in reviews as "beautiful" and "enchanting"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]] at 27k words alternating POV is a little bit more serious and while it is definitely an HEA please check the tags and consider how you feel about love potions as that can make the difference between seeing this fic as light and fluffy versus a very serious commentary on the problematic nature of love potions in the HP universe.

Also thank you for asking this, as I may have to check out some of the other rec's people are giving :) :) :)
