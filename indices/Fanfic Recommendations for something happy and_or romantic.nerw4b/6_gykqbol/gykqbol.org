[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] is a favourite of mine and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1157217][Matchmaker, matchmaker]] is really cute as well with a similar premise. If you really can't stand Drarry (even then I'd suggest giving these fics a try), fics like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24204940/chapters/58307161][Percy Weasley and the Prefect Job That Isn't a Vanity Role]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1748005][these two one-shots]] never fail to make me smile.
