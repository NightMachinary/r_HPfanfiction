There are two main things I disliked from the story. I disliked the way the format looked on FFN, which isn't really something that can be controlled. I also disliked the concept of Snape keeping a diary/journal. Snape was a master Occulemens who spied for both sides, at various times in his life. There is no way in hell a spy kept a book of everything he ever saw, especially since Voldemort breaking into his mind was a threat at any moment. I could see him putting the memories of his encounters into the Penensive within the Headmaster's office of Hogwarts while he was head for a year. That actually seems more probable than him writing it down. Voldemort seeing that can be brushed off as, "Master I wished to rewatch some of our exploits with the filth" and some other ego stroking garbage.
