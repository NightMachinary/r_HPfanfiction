This is one I'd read a few years back. It's still decent writing, although I really dislike the format the second time around. Voices floating in the middle of nothing was a bit agonizing. Maybe a newspaper or magazine-style interview would've been a better choice since it could've allowed for some description.

The best part is that it involves characters that usually don't get a lot of spotlight time in fic.
