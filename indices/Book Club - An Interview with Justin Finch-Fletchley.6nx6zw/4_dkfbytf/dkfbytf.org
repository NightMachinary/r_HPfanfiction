This fic was fine, I guess. Decent writing, believable dialogue.

I'm not really a fan of canon compliant stuff, and felt bored after the first chapter. I don't really get that 'what happens next?' page turner feel. I was not exactly expecting a wild ride, but I dropped it partway through chapter two. Their conversation didn't really hold my interest.
