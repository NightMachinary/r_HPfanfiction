I thought it was a really fun piece of writing with well done cannon-compliant world building, and just the right length to say what it has to say. I love the back and forth between Justin and Lee, and the whole 'Dean Thomas, Sex God' bit. The only quibble I have is with Snape's diary--it doesn't really seem believable to me that he would keep that sort of written record around.
