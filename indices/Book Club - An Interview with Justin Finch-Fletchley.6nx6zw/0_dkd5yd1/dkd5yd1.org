I really liked the newblood moniker. It's my headcanon now for stories where the wizarding world actually did the work of improving itself. It's great how the author was able to find a term that not only goes syntactically with pure blood and half blood but also communicates the positive idea that muggleborns are new blood to freshen up the somewhat inbred wizarding lines of descent.

The 'cops see the world in three categories' digression wrt Harry I also thought was pretty insightful.
