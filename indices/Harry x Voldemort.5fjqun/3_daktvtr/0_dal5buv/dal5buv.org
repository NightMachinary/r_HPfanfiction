I don't know what you're ship or favourite thing in fanfiction is but would you like it if on everyone of your posts or on posts of things that you find interesting I wrote a "No"?

If you don't like HarryxVoldemort then thats fine. No one is forcing you to read it. However, what you're doing is childish and immature. There is no need to hate on someone for liking something else.
