Thank you!

Everyone has different tastes, and this subreddit is to actually help people like OP, who are in search of less-than-common fic to find their missing stories, or new ones.\\
If someone doesn't like, there's a nice back button to go back. HELL, there's even a downvote button if you want to be slightly petty.
