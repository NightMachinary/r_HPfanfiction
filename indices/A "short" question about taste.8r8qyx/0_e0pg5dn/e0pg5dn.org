The more reading you consume, the bigger critic you are.

As long as you can still find stories to read it is ok to be picky. But if literally everything you try makes you angry for not being excellent, then you have fallen deep into an elitist view.

Growing up I loved reading the canon Harry Potter stories, but I would definitely be loath to read one now.
