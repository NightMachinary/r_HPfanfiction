Sorry you lost me when you said you liked Dan Brown novels, now I cannot comprehend anything you say. (JK)

Seriously though this is normal, in particular you get burned out on certain tropes, especially when the majority of writers don't do them well. (Hadrian Potter as an example). There are plenty of stories I enjoyed but when I went back later couldn't stomach my way through anymore.
