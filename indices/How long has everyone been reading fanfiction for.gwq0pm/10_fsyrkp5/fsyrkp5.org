I started in 2004 when I was 12. English is not my first language and I started reading in English only a few years ago. I read mostly slash back then (and still do). HP's been my fandom since my childhood and it's the most important fandom for me to this day.

I remember reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/344335/chapters/558662][Stars With A Spin]] by /Maxine/ in 2004 or 2005 when it was translated to my language. I remember reading [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]] by /Cinnamon/ (again a translation) and crying my eyes out. Just re-read SWAS and thought it was quite good! Not emotionally ready for re-read of BW yet. Drarry fans probably know those fics (they're classics). I can rec both.
