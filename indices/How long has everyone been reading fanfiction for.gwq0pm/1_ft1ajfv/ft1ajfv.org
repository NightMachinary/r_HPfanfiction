I started reading fan fiction in mid 99. I remember cause POA was about to come out, and all the hype about it had me curios about the series. I actually couldn't get the first book of the series to read first. So I started with COS, I was several chapters in before I realized Hermione was a girl and not a really old fashioned British name for a boy. (I was in 4th grade at the time) I plowed thru that first book pretty quickly and to this day it is still my favorite of the series. After finally getting the first one I was dismayed to realize the series wouldn't be finished for some time which led me to going online to find out when the next book would be released. I found a plug for someone's fanfic in a chat board, it was in an old geo-cities webring. I don't even remember what the story was about but the sparkly background was so lurid it made the text hard to read. I was hooked after that. ;)
