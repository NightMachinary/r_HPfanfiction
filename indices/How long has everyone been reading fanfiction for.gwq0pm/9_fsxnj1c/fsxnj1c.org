I dabbled in reading a couple fanfics in high school, /very/ infrequently (like once a year or so). I followed a couple Hunger Games fics and web serials during my first couple years in college but came upon Alexandra Quick in the middle of my junior year. During the rest of my undergrad and the following summer I must have made it through 200 or so fics, it was definitely the bulk of my reading and a terrible addiction.

I'm in grad school now and am reading more actual books, I maybe read a new fic one night a month. I still follow AQ, Victoria Potter, Pretense, Imposter Complex and a couple web serials, but that's about the extent of it.

I've dug around the older parts of ffn, and here's the summary: old fics tend to be far more poorly written, far more crazy, and far less put-together. Shipping and slice of life are big in old fics, many of the venerated epic, universal fics that are pretty all-inclusive of genre were written sometime between 2005-2015. Recently we've seen a return in the fandom toward lighter, slice-of-life or comedic fare and well-written romance, especially with AO3 taking a bigger role.

linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) was released sometime in the early 2000s that's regarded as one of the first /really good/ epic Harry Potter fanfics: you'll see a bit of AU, a bit of romance/drama, a bit of slice-of-life. It's in my top 5 fics and reads really well today. It's incomplete but definitely worth a read.
