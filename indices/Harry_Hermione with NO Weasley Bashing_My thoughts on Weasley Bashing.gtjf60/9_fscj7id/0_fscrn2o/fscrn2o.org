You need to use lowercase, linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift).

To expand, this one just started recently, but has been actively updating. I found the divergence point to be quite reasonable, going to the Slug Club with Harry instead of Cormac, and the characterisation of Ron and Ginny's reactions was spot on. Ron is even making a proper go of things with Lavender, who when you think about it is not a bad match for him if he can get over his original motivation.
