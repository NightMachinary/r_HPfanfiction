Have you read the Draco Trilogy by Cassandra Clare? There are controversies behind it but I really enjoyed it back in the day. There is a Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione love triangle but the endgame is Harmony. And Draco ends up with Ginny. Ron plays a supporting role and he's in general a good friend. Ginny gets more of a major role in the last book. No hate from Ron or Ginny to Harmony.
