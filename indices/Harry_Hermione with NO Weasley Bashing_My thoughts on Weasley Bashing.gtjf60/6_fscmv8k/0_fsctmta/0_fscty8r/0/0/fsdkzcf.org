So I'm assuming you've read DT, right? I don't like how people say she rewrote it into TMI by changing the names. Sure there are similarities (Jace is definitely Draco) but not that many. She still built her own world, and Clary is neither Hermione nor Ginny. In fact, I like DT's Hermione and Ginny both way more than Clary.
