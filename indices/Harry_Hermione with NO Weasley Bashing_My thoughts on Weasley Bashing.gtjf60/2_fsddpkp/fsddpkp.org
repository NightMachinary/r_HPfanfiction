I've written an oneshot which has Harry/Hermione and background Lavender/Ron, with Lavender serving as a catalyst which got them "together". It throws some shade at Molly, but not beyond any regular teenage feelings towards adults who might get in their way when it comes to romance. Ron shares the sentiment.
