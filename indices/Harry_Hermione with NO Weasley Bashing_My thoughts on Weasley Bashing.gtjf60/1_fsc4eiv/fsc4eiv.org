Yes I agree so much SNARKY please no Weasley bashing ever!!!! :( Ron would get over it and end up supporting them, like he always does! He can't help his initial reactions but he can make it better after! And he always does, and I love him for that more than everyone actually focuses on his initial bad reactions!
