Your stories are rather interesting. I like that you deal with AU's, in different ways. (Even if I might not always like certain things per say), not to hate on you, of course. It's rather admirable how many different type of AU's you're able to write.

I have different AU's I'd love to write, though I haven't written fanfiction in years, rather unsure of how to go about it again, though I know the best way is to "just do it"
