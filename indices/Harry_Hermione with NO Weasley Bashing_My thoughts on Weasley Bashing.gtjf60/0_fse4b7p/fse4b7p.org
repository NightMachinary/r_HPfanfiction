TBH I hate character bashing in all its forms. People are complicated in real life and literature is supposed to reflect that. Nothing turns me away from a fic faster than an author proclaiming â€˜X Bashing' like it's something to be proud of.

That said, I just recently read an HHr fic that might fit what you're looking for, though it's pretty short.
