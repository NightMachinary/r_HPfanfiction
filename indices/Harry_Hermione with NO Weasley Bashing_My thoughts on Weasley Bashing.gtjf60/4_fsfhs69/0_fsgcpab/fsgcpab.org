Ron let his emotions get the better of him, more then others, but that doesn't make him a bad person.

He also wasn't stupid, he was above average in that department. He and Harry weren't Hermione, but then again no one - not even the other Muggleborns were either.

There are different kinds of smart, some are book smart, some are experimental smart, some are people smart, et cetra - there are different kinds of smart.

Ron pretty much got similar or the same grades as Harry, he was able to cast a Patronus, which is a difficult thing to cast.

His emotions often got the better of him for sure, but I'd say that's pretty normal, he was one of the youngest of his siblings, he got hand me downs - which there's nothing wrong with them of course, but when jerks like Malfoy putting him down, it's easy to let his emotions get the best of him. He left Harry and Hermione behind, but the locket was affecting them all, and was feeding into his negative emotions, if Dumbledore had felt the urge to put on the ring, despite knowing there could be consequences, Ron can be cut some slack for leaving.
