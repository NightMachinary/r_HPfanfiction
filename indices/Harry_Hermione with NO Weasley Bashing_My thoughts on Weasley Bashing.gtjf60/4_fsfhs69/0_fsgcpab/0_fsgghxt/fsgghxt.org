Okay...? I don't necessarily disagree with most of what you say (maybe the ability/smarts of Ron I'd grade a little lower than you - he wasn't stupid, but never stood out as smart to me), but overall I'd respond 'so what?'

Like I said, I don't hate Ron. I just see him as very normal, the way I and billions of other people are. I don't think it is inherently insulting to say that he is average.

We judge Ron based on the context we see him in. In all 7 books, he is surrounded by noble and heroic characters, so the fact that - /as I said -/ he acts like a normal boy just illustrates all the more that Harry and Hermione are exceptional. Maybe the locket was responsible for him abandoning H/HR; that just shows that H/HR are objectively better than Ron since they were able to resist its effects. Plus, what's his excuse for walking out on Harry during GoT?

I can't say for sure, but I would have thought that was part of Ron's appeal to people that like him. He's like Joe Everyman, alongside the super-genius and the prophesied messiah. He doesn't have to smart/capable for you to like him, but it's hard to deny he's the weak link (lazy, jealous, unmotivated) of the group. Adds a lot of personality and comic relief.
