I'm not boosting Ron up, I'm just pointing out his good side, since a lot of people like to bash him.

I live in a realistic viewpoint as well. Give this a thought: If Harry was not someone who had survived the Killing Curse, if Voldemort was not after Harry, he'd be known as an orphan, but he'd be a pretty above average person, or average in most classes that weren't DADA, that others would not even look at twice.

Similar with Ron, he would be considered an average, or above Average in certain classes.

If there wasn't a war going on, Harry, and Ron would both be considered relatively normal in terms of personality traits and looks, and other things.

I love Hermione, I love her, but I also hate how Rowling made her over zealous in her studies, making other students look bad in comparison.
