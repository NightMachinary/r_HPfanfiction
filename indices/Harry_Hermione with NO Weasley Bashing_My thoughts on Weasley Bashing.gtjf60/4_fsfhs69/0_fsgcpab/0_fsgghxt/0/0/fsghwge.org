So Harry is exceptional at the only wizarding sport we know of that most magical people are obsessed with, and exceptional at the combat-related area of magic (during a war).

You don't see how that might make him a little more useful/capable/popular than Ron? I legitimately don't understand what there is to argue about. You said you felt Ron was relatable - so do I! I just don't have an interesting life and am not extremely talented or special. I'm just normal. Like Ron. But I live in the real world, where normal is fine. Ron exists in a fictional universe where teenagers decide the fate of the world.

Ironically, in decrying the bashing of Ron/Weasleys, /you/ are bashing Harry by saying he's nothing special. You don't need to boost up Ron to justify liking him. I LOVE Lockhart, and he is a total fraud/useless. But I don't try to make myself feel better about that by trashing Dumbledore, I just accept Lockhart's failings and enjoy the character all the same.
