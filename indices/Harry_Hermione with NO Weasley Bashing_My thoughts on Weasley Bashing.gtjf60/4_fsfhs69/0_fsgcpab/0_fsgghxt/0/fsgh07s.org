Harry's only exceptional thing is that he excels at are, his ability to cast a patronus at a young age, DADA, and fly. Hermione is incredibly ridiculously smart, and can't be measured against "normal" people.

Re Read the book that shows Ron and Harry's O.W.L's, he and Harry got the same grades (except for DADA, if I'm not mistaken), he didn't try hard in his written work, but not everyone is for that, anyway.
