I don't know that Ron is a *good* person, but he is definitely an average one, just like Ginny. I wrote this comment on a similar thread - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gtf2ti/how_do_you_build_a_realistic_harmony_aka_hhr/fsfby3g?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]] - where I pointed out that a lot of the hate for r/G is based around the fact that they act like normal, immature, cowardly children. In other words, they respond to the events of the series the way most of us would in their shoes. Does that make them bad? Of course not. But it certainly makes them *look bad* compared to Harry/Hermione/Neville who are legit heroes.

That's the main reason I can't handle [[/r/HR][r/HR]] and H/G pairings. They usually end up trying to make Ron or Ginny smart/capable/heroic, which is totally OOC for them.

Agree with your points RE: Molly.
