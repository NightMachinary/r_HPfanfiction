I don't hate Ginny or Ron, but I do hate their canon pairings. JKR really shoehorned them into relationships with H and HR, and it soured the end of the story for me. She is a very poor YA author for a lot of different reasons, but romance was certainly near the top of those. It would have been great if she could have handed the series off after GOF to someone else.

She had 6 books to develop Ginny as a character and barely made any effort beyond a "monster in the chest". Especially at that age, instantaneous attraction to someone you grew up with is silly. Somehow both Harry and Ginny made it through puberty without him noticing he was attracted to her? /jerk-off motion of disbelief/

As for Ron and Hermione, I mean, hell, even JKR admitted that divorce was the best case scenario for that marriage. He simply isn't capable of making her happy, and she would drive him insane.

I never called Ginny a slut, or even implied it. But how likely would you be to immediately jump onto your roommate's ex-bf/gf (depending on your orientation) a few weeks/months after they split? It's kind of gross. I know I wouldn't want to step on that landmine, especially given that Harry's in a school full of available witches.

Imagine if Lily had dated Sirius for a year and a month or two after they split, her and James got together. That wouldn't change the way you looked at those characters?

But whatever. You dig canon pairings - good for you. They bother me enough that I don't read any fics with Ron or Ginny as main characters. Good thing there are 900k HP fanfics on FFNet for us to choose from!
