Just going to point out that Harry and Dean weren't *Friends*, but closer to friendly with each other. They weren't close like Harry and Ron, who would have each other's back in a pointless fight. Though, they were close enough to fight together to stop Voldemort, but almost everyone was close enough to do that. Not that the situation wouldn't have been awkward with Harry and Dean being roommates.
