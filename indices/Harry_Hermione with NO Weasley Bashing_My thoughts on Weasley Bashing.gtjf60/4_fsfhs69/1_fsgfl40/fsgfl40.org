Also I read your post, seems like you hate Ron and Ginny - (Sigh), Or at least don't seem to understand their characters.

Ginny was a Harry Potter Fanatic at first, for sure, but she wasn't a stalker, she didn't put love potion in his drink to make him love her. She didn't cry in public over him or act all clingy towards him.

She had boyfriends, trying to get over someone is a healthy thing to do, I don't think that she was using any of them.

She didn't "date a bunch of guys" She dated two. Two guys in her Hogwarts years before Harry, is pretty normal.

It's realistic for boys and girls to date several different people, throughout years of slowly becoming an adult. It's also realistic to date several different people in adulthood. There's a difference between being in a relationship and being slutty, or easy, and imo Ginny wasn't slutty or easy. She was a normal teenager.

Dean and Ginny dated in the 5th book, and continued until his sixth year, which a year to two years is a relatively normal and healthy relationship standing point, imo.

Michael and Ginny dated after Dean, which seemed to be almost a full year, before Ginny broke it off.

Two boys before Harry, that's normal.
