I'm a third of the way through amalgam - lockharts folly, I have to say wow! The Ron bashing and the Dumbledore bashing is just so over the top awful and painful to read. I don't think theres a chapter where the author doesn't mention how stupid Ron apparently is, or how the fic "subtlety" points out Dumbledore's /evil/ plots and manipulations. Now I'm reading about this whole thing about Dumbledore's need for "a plan to separate the Potter heir from the mud-blood Granger Witch" not to mention how the author keeps calling Voldemort 'Voldewhore'. Some of the plot points were interesting but the characters have been dumbed down immensely like how lockhart swindled malfoys money with a scam. And that almost everytime lockhart introduced himself in almost every scene he *has* to say "I, Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award, Hogwarts' beloved Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, and adventurer extraordinaire"

Though I have to say, no other story has quite resonated with me in such a spiritual and philosophical manner like the quote "Harry wondered at times who was the greater Dark Lord, Voldewhore or Dumbledore?"

This can't be crack, its just a blatant character assassination of the people the author doesn't like.
