My belief is that when Magic first appeared in the world, the different users, or first of the family, had abilities geared towards certain aspects. As time went on, these skills would adapt to current events. If any families intermarried, the magic would fuse into a combination.

Ex. Potter's have Pottery related skills and marry into the Black's with Dark Magic Skills. The combination produces strong defensive curse building skills.
