I'm not really a fan of the concept, but how I see it; we know magic is somewhat hereditary, we've seen this in abilities like parseltongue and metamorphmagic. Magic isn't inherently sentient. It's simply interlocked with the users, which leaves traces of the personality and skills on the magic it carries over into the next generation. When this happens often enough the magic forms it's own minor sentience; a reflection of the past generation.

This magic is mostly neutral. Ancestor A might have been very good at defence, but ancestor B was very bad at it, so it evens out, which means new muggleborn are just as talented as every other magical family. Some are slightly better than average at a single magical field, but they have an equal chance of being slightly worse than average in another field.

There are extremely few exceptions, where a single person was powerful enough to leave a bigger mark on the magic than normal. In the case of the Black family this was a mentally unstable person that excelled at the dark arts. The wielders leave a mark on the magic, this however also means that the magic leaves a equally minor mark on the wielders. Which is the origin of the 'Black Madness'.

The family magic has a minor sentience, so it can be called upon to act. It's personality and morals echoes the previous holders in these cases.
