hmm i thought of it as a secret rite to protect the lines -- distilled from whatever ancient sources they had. for instance- - quite a few families are descendants of the peverells - including the Gaunts and Potters, right? Makes sense that their family magic would be specified through some death defying ways..

i really like the way magic from families was explained in ffnet's Stepping Back by TheBlacks'sResurgence
