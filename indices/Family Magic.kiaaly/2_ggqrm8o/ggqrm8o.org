Depends on the story. The author could make it so that there's actual family magic that's passed through the blood.

But I am actually a fan of the other 'family magic'

The one that since there's been a bunch of wizards on this family, they have made a lot of spells that only get written and taught to family members and that's family magic.

It makes a lot more sense than having a weird totem that beams knoledge to your head
