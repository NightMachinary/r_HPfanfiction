My fic has two different approaches to 'family magic.' First with the Blacks, a Black back in the Roman Empire got desperate, and created a physical object that collected small amounts of magic from family members while they slept, storing it for when it was needed. (On AO3, my fic has the 'The Black Family has an I.W.I.N. Button' and 'But the batteries ran out' tags.)

On the other hand, the Potters settled in a magically strong location and built their home, and over time living there and casting spells left an 'impression' of sorts. Basically, the normal magic that exists in the air/earth at their home has been colored by the people living there over the centuries. When Harry decided to cast a Fidelius Charm over the whole property (basically fields and the ruins of the ancestral house) the residual magic came to his aid and helped him cast a spell beyond his power to cast. Also, let him use magic that would otherwise have killed him in the newest chapter.
