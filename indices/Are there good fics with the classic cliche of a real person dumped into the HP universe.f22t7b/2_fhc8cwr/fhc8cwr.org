I literally just finished reading a fic like this a few minutes ago. Technically rereading I suppose.

Linkffn(A Curse of Truth)

It's not incredibly long, about 200k words, but in my opinion it's really well done and honestly the only self insert style fic I've actually read and enjoyed.

Also, this is the first time I've ever used the bot, so hopefully it works.
