Chapter 13: In the first paragraph, I found "Leakey Cauldron." That was not a good sign.

As a general rule, I never rule out any fic based on pairing stuff (unless its just truly abhorent such as incest or worse). But the problem I have, and I say this not at all to be inflamatory, there are two ways I can see this fic going, based on past experience:

1. You spend a lot of time focusing on the H/F romance, but it runs out of steam once they end up together and the fic gets boring and/or dropped.
2. Most authors writing a long fic (barring time-skip stuff or skipping huge sections of the years) tend to grind to a halt somewhere between 2nd and 4th year, usually because of lost interest or too many AU plot divergences they now have to consider.

Its possible it could go another way, but these make up somewhere between 95-99% of long form fics. And the fact that you have a bunch of tropes like love/soul bonds, undiscovered inheritance, and children falling for each other is going to make the story hard to put up with. I have more, but I don't think its necessary for you to start seeing some of the issues here.
