No soul bonds, but I can see where you're coming from and some of the concerns but I do have things to keep it interesting and I do intend to venture AU or somewhere in between. I know what you mean about being abandoned further in but I'm so excited to get there I don't think it'll happen. Think what you want about me quitting, that's okay and I understand I only hope to change your mind as I venture further. And yeah the romance will be toned down as they meet new people and focus on school. Sorry for the experience.
