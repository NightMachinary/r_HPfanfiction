Well there aren't any love bonds really. And there isn't any relationships in the fic at this time and there won't be for quite some time. As far as inheritance goes it isn't one of those fics where Harry runs around insanely rich and buying a boatload of crap. He does have money but I have avoided some stupid Gringotts scene where he inherits millions of dollars and buys all this and that. The story is mainly about Harry growing as a character and him developing skills for the long term (right now) down the line when Harry gets older there will be romance and a lot of things I haven't seen in a HP Fanfic. But right now it's light hearted and and if you're looking for a serious fic then come back later because it's following the theme of the books where it went from light to dark. If you have any specific questions let me know.
