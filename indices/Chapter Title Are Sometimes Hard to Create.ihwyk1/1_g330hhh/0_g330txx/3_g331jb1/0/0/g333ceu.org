Ask yourself what do you want to tell with the title.

Saying "The Teacher's Assistant" just speaks action, plot.

Something like "The Deputy Professor" marks the character after actually taking the role of the teacher in substitution or of a more fixed role.

YOu can also focus on how this teaching position translates in the story....Was it new to him? (A Teacher Within)... Is he not sure about taking the position (The Reluctant Helper)... Is it more focused on the actual task of "help" instead of "knowledge"? (A Moment of Guidance) Is he reevaluating his future? (A New Career Path)
