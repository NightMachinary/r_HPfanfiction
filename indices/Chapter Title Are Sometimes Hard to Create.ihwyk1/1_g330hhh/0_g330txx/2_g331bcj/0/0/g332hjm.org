Had he displayed this prowness in teaching before? Did he know he had this skill before but just didn't show it until now? Was it a surprise for him as well?

If it is the main, like in this case, usually you would like to talk about the action of assisting... if it is a background usually you can focus on the noun as in "assistant"

Also, you mention patronus... is there any other relevant spell he is teaching, that might also be a good title.
