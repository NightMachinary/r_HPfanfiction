If you just want a high number of reviews, have a lot of chapters. There's a specific breed of reader who reviews every chapter leaving no actual feedback, just "good job", "great work", or "loved it". Take a 100+ chapter fic with 1k reviews; a single reader like this could be responsible for a tenth of those reviews.
