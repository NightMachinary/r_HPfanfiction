Doesn't it make sense for crossovers to come out around that time? How else would the author get the idea? Story ideas aren't formed ex nihilo.

It's tempting to believe that increased quality automatically leads to reduced quantity, but I think the true metric here is 'time spent writing.' If someone works incredibly hard, there's no reason to believe that they couldn't increase /both/ their words per day /and/ overall quality.

I agree with your third point about pairings, though. `Shipping/romances in the HP universe have almost nothing to do with the characters and everything to do with the readers' trope preferences. If an author can't decide on which of /those/ elements they want to incorporate into their story before they begin writing, then that's a big red flag.

I agree with the fourth point, too. Doubly so for catch-phrase endings that are resolved in the first one hundred words of the next chapter and never mentioned again. Ever.

I don't know about author's notes being beacons for controversy. That's never been an issue for me, but maybe we just aren't reading the same stories.
