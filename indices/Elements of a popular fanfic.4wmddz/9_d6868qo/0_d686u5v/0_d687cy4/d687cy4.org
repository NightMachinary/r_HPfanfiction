Lol. I do sometimes think it would be an interesting exercise, but I don't know if I could bring myself to actually do it. I don't suppose I'd have to spend too long working out the plot at least. I'd have to post it under another ID too. But semi-seriously, don't you think readers would pick up on it if it wasn't somehow sincere in its intentions?
