If done properly, there's no way to tell the difference between sincerity and satire. Personally, I went for a 50/50 mix of genuine and crazy, and no one's called my bluff yet, so it might be working. The real trouble isn't getting caught, it's getting too invested. Even a low effort plot takes time to type out. At some point, you'll look back and go, "Goddamn. I've spent weeks on this, and it's now my most popular fic."
