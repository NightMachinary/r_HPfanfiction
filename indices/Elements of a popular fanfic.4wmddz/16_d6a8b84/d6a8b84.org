Frequent updates are important. Also using author notes to engage the reader should help but please do not outright ask for reviews. I usually only review when the writer does something brilliant or really stupid.

So write a decent story with frequent updates. It should have a somewhat different plot but not really necessary. You can use clich√©s but add a twist to it so it is not all what the reader expect.

When you put in a twist like that where the reader is expecting a cliche it comes as a pleasant surprise to the reader.

Story shouldn't be choppy. It should flow well.
