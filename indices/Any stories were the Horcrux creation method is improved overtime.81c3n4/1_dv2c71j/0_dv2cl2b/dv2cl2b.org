That's not exactly how it works, though. [[/spoiler][HPMOR is an AU where souls don't actually exist; the normal Horcrux ritual worked differently by copying one's brain, minus magical knowledge, into an object so that it could imprint on someone, much like the Diary did in canon. Tom's invention essentially /creates/ a soul for himself, not tie one that already existed to the world.]]
