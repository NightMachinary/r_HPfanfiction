Really? Hermione is by far the most well adjusted socially of the trio, at least by the time we get midway through the series. She basically coaches Harry through his short-lived date with Cho, and she has no problem recruiting, organizing, and helping to run a sizable student club (the DA). At the very least, that takes connections.

Like, she's no social butterfly, but if I had to put her as socially awkward or competent I'd go with the latter. "Not date anyone until college?" Did you somehow forget the Ball in 4th year? Where she dated probably the most famous Quidditch player of her time...?
