So I don't fully agree with the other guy but Hermione literally says that people overheard her talking about the first DA meeting in the Hogs Head and then they spread the word to their friends. You really can't attribute the large showing to Hermione. She, at best, vaguely knows of everyone who showed up but she wasn't exactly the driving force behind how many people there were.
