Oh. So evidence of her being socially well-adjusted in canon doesn't count because it goes against your own fantasy head-canon. And her date with Krum doesn't count as a date because... reasons. And the formation of the DA, that would require her knowing dozens of fellow classmates and them being able to trust her, goes completely unmentioned by you. That's how you're rolling. Gotcha!

Just curious, is there anything I can bring up you won't fob off with some excuse or another? Just asking so I can tell whether this is completely pointless and I should just move on.
