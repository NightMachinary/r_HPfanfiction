My argument isn't that she's a socially awkward nerd, it's that she /should/ be.

She doesn't have friends, other than Ron and Harry (and they have some outside friends they do stuff with like games and Quidditch. Her spare time is in the library).

She, unlike Harry and Ron, has almost nothing in common with her dormmates.

She has no romantic experience beyond her fling with Krum. While that puts her ahead of Harry and Ron, it means she has very little experience with "high school romance"- flirting, crushes, dates, etc.

All in all, she does not have the social life of a "normal" Hogwarts teenager.

And yet, as you say- she gives dating advice, observes crushes, conjures up the DA, and so forth. THAT'S what I'm complaining about. (What I was complaining even more about was fics that take this tendency to the extreme- as [[/u/galathielaltheral]] said, giving her /~mysterious girl powers~/)
