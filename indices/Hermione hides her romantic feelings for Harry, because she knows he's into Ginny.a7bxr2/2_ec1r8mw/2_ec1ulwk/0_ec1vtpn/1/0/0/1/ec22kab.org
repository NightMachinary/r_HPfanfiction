There is quite a bit of evidence against Hermione as a social butterfly, even in her latter years.

First there is the entire failed SPEW campaign which is just incredibly awkward and shows that Hermione doesn't really know how to motivate people for something they don't already care about, or even recognize the fact that her campaigning has very little chance of success.

However, even more indicative is her treatment of Harry after the deaths of Cedric and Sirius. It's pretty clear that while she probably read up on the stages of grief, as well as general psychology somewhere, she also has no idea of how to actually connect with Harry and instead just keeps adding to his grief and unintentionally pushes him to avoid her.

I'm not saying she's socially inept, her social capabilities are far above the typical nerrrrd cliche, but she's definitely no social guru either.

Having one successful short relationship (which was initiated by the other party) does not turn someone into a relationship expert, and follow Hermione on the whole DA thing because they trust that when it comes to school stuff she knows what's she's talking about, not because of her charisma or large sphere of influence.
