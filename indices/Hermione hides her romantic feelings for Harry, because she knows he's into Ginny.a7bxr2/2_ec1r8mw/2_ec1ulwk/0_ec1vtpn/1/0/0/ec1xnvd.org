The book is from Harry's perspective. You don't see Ron being social with others either. Or Ginny, for that matter, but she is widely accepted as being a social butterfly. Yes, things happen off-screen.

You are supposed to infer characteristics from what we have available. And what we have available tells us, again and again, that Hermione, despite how badly she came off early on in canon, became a well-adjusted, socially competent person by the 4th book.

If you are going to argue that Hermione is a nerrrrrd, then give me evidence. I have provided plenty of my own.
