Ugh, you are not hearing a word I am saying.

All the things you are using as examples are EFFECTS of being social. If someone is outgoing and socially competent, then they date people. If someone is well connected and liked by her peers, then she can start a popular club. If someone has experience in romance, then they are likely perceptive about others' romances.

Canon Hermione has all of these effects, but hasn't done the work, so to speak.
