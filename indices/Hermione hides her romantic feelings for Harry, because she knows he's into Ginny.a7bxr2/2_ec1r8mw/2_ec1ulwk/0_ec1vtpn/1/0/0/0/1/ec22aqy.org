You are projecting so goddamn hard it hurts. "She *should* be a nerd." What is that even supposed to mean? Not everyone fits into a box. Someone can enjoy intellectual pursuits and still be healthy socially, and Hermione obviously comes from a healthy background. Her parents are wealthy. She takes summer trips abroad to France. What part of that shouts "socially awkward nerdlinger" to you?

I could understand this argument that she "should be" socially deficient if you were applying it to Harry "Cupboard under the Stairs" Potter, but Hermione does not have that kind of freakishly horrific upbringing.

No wonder you dismiss every point in my favor I try to bring up: you are so attached to the idea that Hermione *must* be a socially awkward loser that you are deaf to evidence that shows otherwise. She has no dating experience if you ignore the existence of Krum. She has no points of interest with her classmates if you ignore the massive school club she recruited them all for. She is a socially awkward person if you handwave away everything that shows otherwise.

This is going nowhere. I'm done.
