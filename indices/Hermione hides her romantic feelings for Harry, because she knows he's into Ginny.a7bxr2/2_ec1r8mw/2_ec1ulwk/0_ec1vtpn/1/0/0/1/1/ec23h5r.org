You are setting up a strawman and arguing against it instead of what I actually said. Nowhere have I said she is a social guru. Just competent.

In my first comment I literally say "She is no social butterfly", so when you open by saying "there is plenty of evidence against her being a social butterfly" I wonder if you even read what I wrote.

  I'm not saying she's socially inept, her social capabilities are far above the typical nerrrrd cliche, but she's definitely no social guru either.

That is basically paraphrasing what I said in my very first comment.

Failing to console someone after death hardly makes her a blithering social idiot. Trained psychologists have trouble with that at times. It's a pretty damned hard thing to do, doubly so if the one suffering is a moody teenager.

What the OP is claiming is that she is abnormally socially deficient. Here's a quote:

  If Hermione had been a Muggle, she'd be really into hentai and wouldn't date anybody until college.

That kind of obnoxious flanderization and projection is what I was arguing against.
