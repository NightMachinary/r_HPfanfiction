I guess my point is that we see the effects you're talking about in canon, but no causes.

We don't see her with friends. She has zero interest in guys (the Krum thing happened completely without her action, she thought he was just some weird guy hanging around)

Yes, there's the DA, but they just kind of... show up?

So what I'm saying is that canon has all these situations in which Hermione has all these socialite "effects," but the books never show anything leading up to that.

The DA is actually quite a good example. Until then, there had been zero mention of Hermione having contacts with other houses, and even less of them seeing her as a leader figure.

Yes, she has the highest grades in the school, but she is never shown being social with anyone but Ron and Harry.
