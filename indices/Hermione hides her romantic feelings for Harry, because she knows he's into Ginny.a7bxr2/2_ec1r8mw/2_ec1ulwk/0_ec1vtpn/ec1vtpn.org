  Really? Hermione is by far the most well adjusted socially of the trio, at least by the time we get midway through the series. She basically coaches Harry through his short-lived date with Cho, and she has no problem recruiting, organizing, and helping to run a sizable student club (the DA). At the very least, that takes connections.

Yeah, that's what I was complaining about, partly. It's an issue even in canon. Hermione is even less social than Harry and Ron- while their free time is spent on Quidditch and games, hers is in the library.

There's no way she should be able to effectively "coach" Harry on a date. My headcanon is that she took all her stuff from a YA romance series she once read.

As for the Ball... listen, Krum's a nice kid. But /he/ asked out /Hermione,/ they took a couple walks, had a nice night, and that was basically it. It was a nice short romance, but it does not make Hermione a master of the seductive arts.
