Hermione is textbook Aspergers, in girls. Professor Tony Attwood even uses her as an example in his talks on how Aspergers appears in girls since most people have a certain set of expectations as to what Aspergers looks like in people, but those are mostly all traits of boys with ASD, not girls.

[[https://youtu.be/wfOHnt4PMFo][Here's a really neat talk from Professor Attwood]]

-Has primarily boy friends because they're easier to work out than girls.

-Has really socially inappropriate interaction skills without appreciating what it is she's doing that people don't like. (Trouble reading the subtle cues kids use to tell each other they're being weird or annoying)

-Tells people what they're doing wrong all the time / comes off bossy. (Aspies function by intellectually working out what they're 'supposed to do' and will inform other kids when they're doing it wrong, without understanding that the other kids know full well they're not â€˜supposed to' and don't care.)

-Very intellectual but socially inept in early years. Through intellect and learned mimicry, is able to learn better social skills and appear generally normal in later years.

-Spends a ton of time/escapes to the library

-Reads to understand people

-Gets super into certain subjects or causes that other people don't get or care about.
