Honestly what annoys me is the idea that Hermione is some kind of social guru. In the books, she immediately catches on to everybody's crushes. Her interactions with Ron often have a "I know we like each other but he's so immature vibe."

When in reality, Hermione is a big ole nerd! Her only friends are Ron and Harry! She doesn't have any giggling girlfriends, and there's no reason she should have any particular insight into teen romance.

If Hermione had been a Muggle, she'd be really into hentai and wouldn't date anybody until college.
