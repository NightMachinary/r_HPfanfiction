Ginny was the only one that Hermione confided in when Viktor Krum asked her to the Yule Ball, and the only one who knew that she had kissed him at least once. Ginny also told Hermione about her teaching herself how to fly and about her relationship with Michael Corner before her family and most others were aware of either.
