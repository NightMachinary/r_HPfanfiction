She's friendly with Ginny, especially as the series progresses, but they're not exactly bosom buddies.

And Krum came up to /her/. They had a brief fling. I'm sure it was a very nice romance, but I'm talking about being well-versed in stuff like flirting, socializing, dating, etc.

Yeah, she's definitely ahead of Harry and Ron, but that's not saying much.
