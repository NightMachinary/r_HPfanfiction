I don't feel like Hermione is that socially competent in the books. She pays attention and can understand the back and forth between people likely because of what she's read in books. She recognizes patterns of behavior. However, she doesn't do great at handling relationships herself.

Think of the DA. She knows who people are so she could invite them. However, it turned out that the only reason they turned up was to hear Harry. She just annoys people with SPEW. She doesn't hang out with anyone when Ron and Harry are mad at her. Her only other friend is Ron's sister, who she would have been thrown into close proximity with at the Burrow. (The DA feels connected, but they don't casually hang out.) She had no idea Krum kept popping up in the library when she was there and casting glances her way because he wanted to talk to her. Remember "why can't he read on his stupid ship?" She knows about the feelings shared with Ron, but their relationship becomes filled with anger and misunderstandings because they both handle it badly.

Hermione one of those people who give good advice because the know the logical and right thing to do, but is sense when it comes to themselves. Those people certainly exist.
