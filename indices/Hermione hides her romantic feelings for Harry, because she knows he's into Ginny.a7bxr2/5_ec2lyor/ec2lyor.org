Honestly, it is more plausible that it is the other way around and that while Hermione liked Harry and crushed on Ron, she knew Ginny crushed on Harry and Hermione and Ginny were noted to be particular friends, so if Hermione liked Harry romantically in any capacity, then if she hid her feelings from Harry it would have been to prevent ruining her friendship with Ginny, as well as Harry. Seriously, Hermione dating Harry could have lead to a Hermione losing Ginny as a friend and Harry losing Ron as a friend in sequence, and that rift could have lead to Harry and Hermione breaking up due to the stress, which would have lead to nobody being friends within that friend group.

I vaguely remember a fanfiction that had an alternate Hermione that overthinked most of the events in the book by making a "simulation" that was always wrong before showing the canon version of events, such as Harry falling off his broom after Draco stole Neville's Rememberal.
