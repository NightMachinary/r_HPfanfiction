He is a good enough writer that I read even the fics that would normally be an instant no. I have actually been enjoying his twinscest fic and his Joan of Arc fic. But I am waiting patiently for him to return to Does and friends anyway. (I normally am not interested in Haram or incest fics, but he writes them very well)
