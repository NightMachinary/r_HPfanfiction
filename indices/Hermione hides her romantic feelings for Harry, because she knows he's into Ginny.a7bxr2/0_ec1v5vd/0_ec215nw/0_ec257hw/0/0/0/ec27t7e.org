I'd argue that they weren't amazing together starting off, but as time went on, both characters began to grow naturally closer. And that's why you have scenes like them laughing together in HBP over the thought of Filch and Pince having an affair. In DH, they end up sharing a couple of the most romantic moments of the series (Hermione beaming at Harry during the end of Bill and Fleur's wedding vows).
