Eh that's a stretch and certainly not what I meant. I /like/ Harry and Hermione together but it's more that I like the idea of it. Objectively, there are plenty of canon-based reasons as to why they wouldn't work together. Especially the times when Ron is having a strop and Harry is kinda bored hanging out with only Hermione. That doesn't exactly scream perfect romance to me.
