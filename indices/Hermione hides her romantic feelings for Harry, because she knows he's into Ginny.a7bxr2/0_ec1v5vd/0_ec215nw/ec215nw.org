I feel bad saying this, because Luna's great. I can't picture Harry falling for her. There are certainly elements to their relationship that make them good together, but Harry never really seems to get her. He never gains an understanding of her passions and I feel like unless he did grow to understand, he'd never gain feelings for her. That's partially why Harry ending up with Hermione feels like the most natural and realistic of outcomes.
