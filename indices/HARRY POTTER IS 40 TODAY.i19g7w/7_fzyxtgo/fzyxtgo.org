Time for a "Midlife Crisis" fic.

Realising that his life has been stagnating ever since Voldemort's defeat, Harry uses years of Auror training to singlehandedly rob the Gringotts Goblins blind and blaze a trail across the world to escape justice.

Everyone of his friends sent to capture him also realise their lives are kinda boring and that (as the best of the Ministry) no one can actually stop them from doing what they want. Leading to further shenanigans.
