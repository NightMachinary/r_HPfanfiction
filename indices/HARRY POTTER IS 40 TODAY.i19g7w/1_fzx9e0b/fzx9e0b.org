I will always and ever remember this. Harry Potter is 40 tonight.

Neville got 40 on the 30th july.

I myself got 40 on the 29th of july.

It is always a good trivia thing, that I am 2 Days older than Harry.

Neville is the backup Chosen One, I am the backup backup Chosen One.

Voldemort is lucky to not have encountered me.
