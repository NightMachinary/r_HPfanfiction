If we assume Harry lives to 150, at 40-years-old he's just 26% through his natural life span.

The equivalent for a Muggle with a life expectancy of 80 years would be age 21.

His year of death would be 2130. The change wizards must see the world go through... all on its own, that's a gift no amount of Muggle money/power can buy. Never mind the spells.
