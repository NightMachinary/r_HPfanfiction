I actually never saw Harry living that long. Maybe Hermione, but not really Harry.

I know the whole wizards live longer, however, by what we know it doesn't feel like it is the norm. It is more like "wizards CAN live longer" not like "all wizards DO live longer". We have a bunch of people dying in canon in 30s, and 40s... And yes, you can argue about the war, but there are plenty of people who died not because of the war...

Harry's grandparents caught a bug and didn't seem to be 100 yet. Arthur's brother(s), and parents seem to be all dead (Arthur is the head of the house after all). Neville's grandfather is dead as well. The Black family tree has a bunch of people dying young of non-war related deaths.

IMO, mortality in the wizarding community is just way higher than on muggle communities. The capability of living longer is a countermeasure for that. It also explains why there is no overpopulation of wizards.
