JKR in 2000:

#+begin_quote
  Question: How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  J.K. Rowling responds: Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy. Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)

Obviously she changed her mind later about Dumbledore and McGonagall's specific ages to fit various plot ideas she had (in McGonagall's case, several times). Nonetheless, I think it's fairly clear that she has always considered wizards to have a substantially longer life expectancy than Muggles - see also Marchbanks, Dippet, etc.

And I never even got the impression that Dumbledore was really /that/ old. He's still in full time work. He's not frail at all and can move very quickly when he wants to. The witch who examined him when he was 18 years old is still alive and also still in work, albeit she is much more frail than he is.

I think Marchbanks is the best book evidence (and therefore highest canon) we have of what a natural wizarding life-span would be - she's probably at least 30 years older than Dumbledore, but also going frail. Probably by the time she dies she'd be around 170-180. Even if you say that she's particularly well preserved and knock off, say, 30 years to reach the average life span, that still brings you to 140-150.

For the other bits you reference:

- Black family tree. The Doylist explanation is obviously that JKR is bad with numbers at the best of times, and quickly scribbling out a family tree for a charity to sell is not the best of times. The Watsonian explanation is the Black family is fucked up and probably not afraid of murdering their own family members. Definitely an outlier, not the norm.

- Harry's grandparents - JKR said they were already old in wizarding terms when they had James, which just begs the question of what old in wizarding terms means. Personally I have always read that as over 100 years old (incidentally this is also the reason why Charlus and Dorea were never viable options to be James' parents).

- Arthur - don't think we know anything about his side of the family.

- Neville - again, not sure we know anything here. Both Neville and Arthur seem like very fragile hooks to hang an argument from.
