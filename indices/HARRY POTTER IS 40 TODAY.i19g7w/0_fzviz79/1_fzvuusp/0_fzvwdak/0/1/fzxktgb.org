Inbreeding also vastly reduces lifespan. Maybe magic can prevent actual deformities, but the genetic fuckups can't really be fixed willy nilly.

Maybe that's why pureblood families hate squibs so much? Without magic, these kids would be /insanely/ more obviously inbred, while coming from seemingly healthy parents.

No wonder they think that without magic you're some sort of dimwitted beast, if all the kids without magic are Habsburg children x10 it would color your preconceptions.
