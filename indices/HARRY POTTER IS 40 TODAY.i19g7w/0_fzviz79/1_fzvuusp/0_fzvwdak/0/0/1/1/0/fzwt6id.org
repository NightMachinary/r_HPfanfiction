Yeah, wizard's are more prone to violent and accidental death, but have the potential to live longer. It might be also, as some deaths suggest, that they can effectively suicide themselves via depression through negative magical self-influence.

Neville's grandfather - could have been pretty old, there is nothing stopping someone who's ~60-70 to have children, he could've died at some point over 100-110?

Idk about Bilius, might've been brother of Muriel and not arthur though.

Mrs. Crouch - effectively my first point.

Luna's mother supposedly died in an accident.

Walburga - no idea, might be point 1 due to loss of children.

Binns died a very long time ago, god knows how old was he. For all we know he's teaching since the founding of Hogwarts.

Voldemort's mother - point 1 and she was basically a squib who gave birth in some dingy orphanage in the 1920s - so she had no access to magical healing thus she died.

Dippet lived to, what, 400?

Astoria dying isn't canon idk what you're talking about /j. IIRC she was cursed or something and that's why.

Kendra Dumbledore - no clue.

Hagrid's father - no clue, though he could've been pretty old for all we know. Hagrid refered of him as 'small' and while that can be an inherent characteristic old people do kinda shrink.

Well, overall, i think it's that while wizards potentially CAN live to a very old age, they often don't - for a number of reasons, and violent death needn't be one of those. Just a minor bloodclot or anyuerysm can take someone out if they are alone and noone's nearby to help, magic or no magic, and those can happen to people of all ages. Or a number of other 'fun' ilnessess.
