The Malfoys are said by WOG that they married with some half-bloods to avoid in-breeding, unlike the Blacks who sometimes married their first cousins or had children at age thirteen. Basing ourselves on people we see like the Weasleys, Longbottoms and Potters who are actually sane and not some batshit craze zealot gang, we know that this (the Black family's family tree) is an outlier attitude that you would find in rare families like the Gaunts and the Crabbes and other such fanatic families. When you think about it, the only difference between the Blacks and the Gaunts is that the former family is rich so it doesn't have to commit incest as often as the latter because they're still part of â€˜polite' society.
