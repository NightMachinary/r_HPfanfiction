I never implied natural causes. Just said "not war related" causes. To let that as excuse of the high mortality.

That was my whole point. THey can live longer, but they don't usually do. The number of non-students we have met are overwhelmingly NON 100 year old.

So I stand by my point. IMO, I do see Hermione exceeding 100, but I always pictured Harry as a death 90s.
