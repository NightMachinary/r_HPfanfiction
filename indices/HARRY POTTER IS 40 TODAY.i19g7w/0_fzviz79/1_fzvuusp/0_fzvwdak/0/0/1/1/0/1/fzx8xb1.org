Just to add on:

Ariana accidentally killed Kendra. The Blacks seemed to die young (by wizarding standards) which I chalked up to inbreeding. It's pretty much established that Merope had no wish to live and JKR has Binns as old when be died.

My headcanon for Mrs. Crouch was that she died of a "broken heart." Her husband's career, her son's choices, and their relationship just took its toll.
