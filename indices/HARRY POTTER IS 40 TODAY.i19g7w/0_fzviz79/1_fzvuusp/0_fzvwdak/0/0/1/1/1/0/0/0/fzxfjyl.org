There is no canon information linking high mortality of Blacks to inbreeding, or to relate it to accidents.

To me it does feel like there is an extra degree of inbreeding to Gaunts than to Blacks. They are clearly physically affected. And they seem to be marrying almost exclusively among them. As some sort of Targaryens...

I guess Blacks only tried to marry purblood families, and kept that tradition among Blacks. Yet they married Potters, Macmillans, Prewetts, Longbottoms... who, even if pureblood, most certainly had some halfblood ancestry at some point.
