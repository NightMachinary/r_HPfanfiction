The way I see Harry's grandparents is by what's going on now with covid. People who are 60 plus have a higher chance of dying because of it, but you wouldn't consider 60 old. That's actually reasonably young isn't it? If they were 70+ when they had james (which is pretty old even by wizarding standards) then they would have been late 80s early 90s when they got the dragonpox. That is pretty old for a disease like that... they wouldn't have had the strength to fight it. Add on to that the stress is a war going on (stress messes up the immune system) its really not surprising that couldn't make it.
