Still, that just adds up on my theory of higher mortality.... There are a bunch of deaths that we are certain that are not related to wizarding wards, but to diseases or magical related accidents. Surely plenty of those we don't know about are not related to wars either.

We know Neville's grandfather died at some point, after the war, we know Neville witnessed it.

Uncle Bilius died after Ron was born, after the war.

Mrs. Crouch died of illness as well.

Luna's mother

Walburga Black died after the war as well.

Professor Binns didn't die in war either.

Voldemort's mother.

Armando Dippet.

Astoria Greengrass

Kendra Dumbledore

Hagrid's father
