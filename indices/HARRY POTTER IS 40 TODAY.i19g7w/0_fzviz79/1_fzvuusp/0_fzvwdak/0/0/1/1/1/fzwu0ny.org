I'm not what your point is it's that list of names: Armando Dippet died at over 300 years old, I have absolutely no idea why you even brought him up; Pandora Lovegood died by a freak accident when something went wrong while she was making a spell, that not a natural death; we don't know any information about when Binns died and how old he was; Merope Gaunt was a dirt poor near Squib coming from an abusive household whose mother might have been some kind of aunt or cousin and is even more genetically messed up than the Blacks, Carrows or Crabbes. Astoria Greengrass (going by Cursed Child) had a blood curse, something she wouldn't have if whatever ancestor was cursed hadn't been, meaning she would have lived passed her â€˜canon' death; Mr Hagrid Sr died in the midst of Grindelwald's War; has Taure pointed out, the Blacks are an exception, not the rule; finally, we don't know what circumstances surround Mr Longbottom's death. Of course, people can die more or less young if they catch a disease and aren't cured, look at any mortal disease, and scientist from every era died while experimenting, something represented by Pandora Lovegood. I don't know why you bring up the deaths of people who clearly weren't natural or early and perhaps the oldest wizard who didn't have a Philosopher's Stone.
