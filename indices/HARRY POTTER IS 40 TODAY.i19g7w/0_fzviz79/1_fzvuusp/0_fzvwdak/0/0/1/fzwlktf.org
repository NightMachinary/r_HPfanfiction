Well, they had, what, 3 major wars between 1914 and Harry's birth (in the progress of the 3rd one) and another some years later.

Those wizard's are a violent bunch, plus they have a lot of other 'fun' stuff to croak from.

Also IIRC i've read somewhere that harry's grandparents died from dragonpox, so it might be that there was a pandemic going on somewhere during Voldemort's 1st reign of terror.
