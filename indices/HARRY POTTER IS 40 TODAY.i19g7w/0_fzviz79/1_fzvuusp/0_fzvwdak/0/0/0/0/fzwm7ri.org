[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur_Weasley]]

He is the head of the Weasley family. Not like in weird non-canon Lord kind of way, but as in the eldest member, point-of-reference, decision-making sort of role. He is mentioned as such in the books, though don't remember exactly where.

Also, Ron got his grandfather chess set, another hint at Septimus Weasley might be dead thing.

There is no mention or appearance of any other Weasley family member during Christmas holidays.
