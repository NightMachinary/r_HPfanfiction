#+begin_quote
  It was 2027. Advances in biotechnology allow people to reach incredible levels. If, of course, there was enough money... A new species appeared - half people, half machines. But not everyone liked it.

  Lily [Luna Potter], completing her studies at Hogwarts, could not find her place in the wizarding world. But her father almost lost his hand and he met augmented muggleborn on duty, and this man is somehow familiar to Lily.

  She decided to learn all about Muggle biotechnology, without even suspecting where it would lead her.
