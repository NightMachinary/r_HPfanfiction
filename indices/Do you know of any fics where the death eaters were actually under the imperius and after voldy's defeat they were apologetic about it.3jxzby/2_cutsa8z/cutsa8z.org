It's canon that Harry is completely immune to the imperius or at least very close. I imagine that resistance training to it was a serious thing because the unforgivable's didn't achieve that status until 1717.

The curse fades in potency very fast if the intent isn't behind it and I doubt that chaining the spell would carry the intent forward well.
