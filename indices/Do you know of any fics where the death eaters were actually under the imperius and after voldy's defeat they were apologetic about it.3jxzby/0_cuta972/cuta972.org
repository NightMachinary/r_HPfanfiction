I'm now laughing at the idea that every single Death Eater and synpathiser was actually under Voldemort's imperius. Just one huge web of mind control with Voldemort at the centre.

It's even possible within the HP magic system: we know from the Malfoy-Rosmerta-Katie situation that it's possible to chain the imperius (i.e. have an imperius victim cast the imperius on another).

And you can totally see Voldemort putting everyone under the imperius, even his faithful followers, just to have that extra level of control and security.

Would really up his "Dark Lord" potential. That's Sauron-level shit.

And would also be a convenient way for Death Eaters to claim imperius if caught. The're not even lying. It just so happens they would have been following Voldemort anyway.
