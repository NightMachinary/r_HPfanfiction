I myself don't hate the pairing (in fact IMHO it makes way more sense than Hermione/Ron who in my oppinion would tear each other appart (or at least would have had a divorce by now!) - as long as Hermione tones her high-horse-I-am-always-right shit down a little and Harry at least tries to do better in school etc. (show some curiousity man, try to learn stuff that's not needed for a) class b) quidditch or c) survival (note: On the last one he IMHO kind of still fails...has a dark lord after him but doesn't at least dedicated an hour or two per week to extra curricular studies? - Damned, he really must have wanted to die!)))

In my oppinion they make a lot of sense:

- they bring out the best in each other
- they compliment each other (she's the best at theory and he's the one for practical application)
- they have a similar enough background
- she'd know better than any other witch that Harry might need a therapist (can't go to one because they usually don't know about magic)
- she knows there's things that are off limits (talking about the Dursleys)
- he'd support her ambitions
- she has never betrayed Harry at all (while Ron does so all the time)
- etc. etc.

Still, I do dislike the pairing if the author does it wrong like turning Harry into Hermione's whipped yes-man (seriously, for all his flaws, the guy does have a spine!) or turns her into a bimbo (sorry, if that's what you want? Pair him with Lavender or something!) :(
