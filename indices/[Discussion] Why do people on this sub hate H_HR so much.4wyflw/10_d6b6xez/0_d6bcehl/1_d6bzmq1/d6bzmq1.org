Yeah he wants to know about Flamel because it's a damned secret (no one is telling him, which sparks his curiousity - but he is NOT curious about school work and spells, he never asks a teacher questions or tries to do better (extra credit))

As for Ron:

- he didn't believe Harry about the tournament and was even to much of an ass to tell him about the dragons!
- I agree on OotP but that wasn't what I meant (if it were then Hermione also betrayed him because she also listens to Dumbledore and doesn't even think about a phone-booth or muggle-mail!)
- Ron's leaving in DH was also one of my examples
- but there's other things: He doesn't speak to Harry after he learns that the ORPHAN has a little money (sorry, but Ron's an ass!)

Yeah, sure Hermione goes to the teachers a lot and that's wrong, too (I think Harry should really have told her off countless times - I mean she wants to know his secrets and feelings etc. but the book never says she spills the beans herself if something bothers her, so why not leave Harry alone?) and she also worships authority (teachers, books etc.) which is wrong, too but it's always with good intentions - Ron's betrayals never have a good intention, no: There's selfishness and jealousy and that's it (oh, and stupidity - come on the guy knows that he'd give up everything he owns for a chance to even talk to his parents for a few minutes, much less to have them back completely!)

Of course he does support her, he defends her from Malfoy etc. (sure he sometimes makes fun of her, but he isn't wrong here either: She really goes above and beyond and it's hurting her, too like having no friends except two boys (come on she doesn't have any female friends her age - Ginny doesn't really count either as they don't seem especially close, not as close as the trio at least!)

Of course that has something to do with it - they have both a lot of potential (Harry is damned good at practical magic, despite shoddy education especially in defense and with her bringing his theoretical knowledge up to speed and him helping her with the practical aspects they'd go far IMHO!) and could bring that out by helping each other!
