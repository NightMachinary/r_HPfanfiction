  He didn't believe Harry about the tournament and was even to much of an ass to tell him about the dragons!

Then how do you think Harry found about them? Sure, Ron didn't tell him directly but he found out nonetheless.

  but there's other things: He doesn't speak to Harry after he learns that the ORPHAN has a little money (sorry, but Ron's an ass!)
#+end_quote

When was this? Anyway, Ron feels awkward and jealous and he has the right to do it. Most people would feel jealous of Harry, who gets all the attention and has all the money. Ron has six siblings to compete with for his parents attention and his parents have very little money. Most people who have families don't appreciate them either. It's human nature.

  Of course that has something to do with it - they have both a lot of potential (Harry is damned good at practical magic, despite shoddy education especially in defense and with her bringing his theoretical knowledge up to speed and him helping her with the practical aspects they'd go far IMHO!) and could bring that out by helping each other!
