Found out is not "Ron told him" is it? :(

Yeah and Harry has a right to to tell him to bugger off (sorry, but I think he should have really told him where to stick his jealousy, just like he should have told Hermione where to stick her bossyness!), also:

Ron isn't competing - he's got no skills (ok: Maybe chess!) that make him stand out, his brothers do and Ginny has the "I am a Girl!"-Bonus! - he's given up years ago!

I know - I don't like mine as much as I should (Oh, I do love them, but sometimes I'd rather have a vault full of gold, too - at least that vault wouldn't try to run my life etc.!)

Of course Ron does defend her, but otherwise he's not a great friend (much less a great boyfriend...he's a prat with the "emotional range of a tea-spoon!" -.-)

They are - but I bet Harry would be more motivated to learn if his girlfriend wanted him to :) (especially if she promises him a reward later!))
