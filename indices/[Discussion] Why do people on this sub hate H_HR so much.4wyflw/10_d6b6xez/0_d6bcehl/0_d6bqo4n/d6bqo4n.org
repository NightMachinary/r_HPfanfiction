I like this reply. Harry got pretty decent grades for someone who apparently doesn't care much about school. (Divination and History of Magic were his worst ones, and History had the excuse of him receiving the vision, while who cares about Divination?) He was most definitely one of most curious students in the school...it's just his curiosity was aimed more at the happenings in the school than learning everything for every subject.
