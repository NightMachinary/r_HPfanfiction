#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. *For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night.* And he also happened to be a wizard.
#+end_quote

(That's the very first paragraph of PoA, emphasis mine)

It bothers me a lot when people say that harry doesn't care about school or learning, or isn't curious. "Doesn't care about learning" seems to be pretty much entirely a fanon construct with little to no evidence from the books---as for "isn't curious", that is not only not evidenced, but also blatantly untrue; An uncurious Harry wouldn't have searched for Nicholas Flamel, nor tried to find out what was paralyzing the student body, nor stalked Malfoy for an entire year...

.

I'm also a little confused where you're getting a few of your other ideas from:

#+begin_quote
  she has never betrayed Harry at all (while Ron does so all the time)
#+end_quote

I can think of three occasions when Harry felt betrayed by Ron:

1. GoF, when Ron didn't believe Harry about putting his name in.

2. OotP, when Ron didn't tell harry anything about order business and Grimmauld Place.

3. DH, when he apparated away, immediately regretted it, and returned to find H&Hr gone.

I can likewise think of three occasions on which he felt betrayed by Hermione:

1. PoA, when Hermione got McGonagall to confiscate his Firebolt

2. OotP, when she wouldn't tell him about order business/grimmauld place

3. HBP, when she was trying to confiscate his copy of Advanced Potions Making.

Those three occasions are neither "never at all" nor "all the time" -- for either of them.

  He'd support her ambitions.
#+end_quote

As far as I can remember, Harry takes equal part in making fun of her for SPEW and her homework habits, and does not, in fact, support her ambitions.

#+begin_quote
  she knows there's things that are off limits (talking about the Dursleys)
#+end_quote

What evidence is there for this? For her respecting of limits, her having some intuitive idea of what his limits are, or even that the Dursleys are off limits to talk about??

.

Finally, I'm confused what either of the following have to do with being a smart match.

#+begin_quote
  she's the best at theory and he's the one for practical application they have a similar enough background
