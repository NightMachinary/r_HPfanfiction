And Hermione lacks a sense of humour? News to me. I know people get hung up on ships, but this "they would NEVER EVER be romantically involved" stick is getting old. People are not one-dimensional. They are not caricatures. If Harry couldn't stand her they'd not be friends. If he can stand her, they can fall in love. It's not as if love is rational, nor is it as if everyone has just one soul mate and everyone else is out of the running. (Not to mention that in canon, Ron and Hermione made it work, and Ron arguably is about as fond of humour as Harry.)

I think people are too extremist in their interpretations of characters. And base far too much on the last few books, where everyone was acting out of character for plot reasons anyway. (That people even think a time of war when all three were under the influence of a horcrux they stupidly decided to carry around with them would be a fair showing of how they normally interact with each other is weird in itself).
