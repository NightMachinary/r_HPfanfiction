I always have the feeling that Harry saw an intimidating big sister in Hermione. She was always pushing him to do something, even if well-meaning most of the time and Harry knew that. Hermione's tendency to argue also seemed to sit bad with someone like Harry, if not with most people. Only Ron seemed to engage in the verbal sparring with Hermione and not go angry about it.
