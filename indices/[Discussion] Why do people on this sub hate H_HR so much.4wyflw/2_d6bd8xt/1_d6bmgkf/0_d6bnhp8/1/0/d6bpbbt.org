Hermione doesn't have /the/ sense of humor that Harry has. There's a difference. Also let's be real, she's not very funny, which is more the point.

And as for Harry not standing her, they're less than comfortable around each other when Ron isn't there to act as a buffer. In fact, IIRC when Ron isn't there they become rather awkward study mates (GoF, HBP?) or Hermione cries a lot/overcompensates (DH).

Also it's rather presumptuous to call an author's writing out of character for her characters because they're going in a direction you don't like, but okay
