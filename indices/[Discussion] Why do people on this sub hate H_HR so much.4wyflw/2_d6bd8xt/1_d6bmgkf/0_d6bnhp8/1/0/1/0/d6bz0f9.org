  "/The/ sense of humour"? Do you honestly think people really can't have some flexibility, or enjoy several kinds of humour?
#+end_quote

Fine. I'd like examples of Hermione cracking or enjoying the type of acid humor Harry likes.

#+begin_quote
  And do you honestly think that Ron shares Hermione's sense of humour?
#+end_quote

He doesn't need to share it, because if you were paying attention they have a different common ground. Also Hermione is not funny, so it's kind of irrelevant anyway.

  Further, there's an easy explanation for them being awkward around each other: They miss Ron/are under a lot of stress/are under the influence of a Horcrux.
#+end_quote

The point being that they miss Ron in a way that Ron and Hermione together don't miss Harry. The point being that they don't have the easy relationship the other pairs in the trio have. The point being that Hermione treats Harry like her younger brother, not relationship material. But okay.

#+begin_quote
  Again: If Ron and Hermione can make a relationship work, Harry and Hermione can do so as well.
#+end_quote

And if Harry and Ginny can make a relationship work, Neville and Ginny can do so as well, because situations are the same when you change them.

  With regards to OOC behaviour, Dumbledore is the best example of how a character is acting OOC just so the plot won't get derailed. For all his supposed wisdom and experience, he's a victim of the "adults are useless" trope throughout the books. And he's not the only one - everyone is forced to act like an idiot just so the plot is not derailed.

Lmfao. How is a character acting the same way they were characterized throughout the books equal being out of character? I thought you were claiming that they were in character in the first four books +which you liked+.
