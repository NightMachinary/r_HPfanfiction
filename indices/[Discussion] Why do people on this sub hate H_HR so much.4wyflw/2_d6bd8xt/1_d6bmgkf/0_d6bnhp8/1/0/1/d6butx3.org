"/The/ sense of humour"? Do you honestly think people really can't have some flexibility, or enjoy several kinds of humour?

And do you honestly think that Ron shares Hermione's sense of humour? Further, there's an easy explanation for them being awkward around each other: They miss Ron/are under a lot of stress/are under the influence of a Horcrux.

Again: If Ron and Hermione can make a relationship work, Harry and Hermione can do so as well.

With regards to OOC behaviour, Dumbledore is the best example of how a character is acting OOC just so the plot won't get derailed. For all his supposed wisdom and experience, he's a victim of the "adults are useless" trope throughout the books. And he's not the only one - everyone is forced to act like an idiot just so the plot is not derailed.
