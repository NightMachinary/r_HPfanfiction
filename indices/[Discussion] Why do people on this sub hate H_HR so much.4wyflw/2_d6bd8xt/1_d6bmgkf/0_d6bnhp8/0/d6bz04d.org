My evidence there were books three and four. In PoA, when Harry and Hermione aren't talking for a long-ass length of time, Harry honestly doesn't really seem to care, and needs to be told by Hagrid that they should make up. In GoF, when Harry and Ron aren't talking for a substantial length of time, Harry is flat-out miserable, and comments things to the tune of "things were just a lot less fun with only Hermione around."

So I do think that humor is an incredibly important part of intimacy to him, and a pretty necessary attribute of whoever he gets with. Whether it's /necessary/? No, probably not--but you'll need to work twice as hard to put him with someone he doesn't find funny.
