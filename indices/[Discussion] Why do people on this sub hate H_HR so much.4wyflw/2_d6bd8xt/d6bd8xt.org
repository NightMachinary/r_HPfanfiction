Ok. Let's say you're going to write a Harmony fic. You like writing good and realistic relationships, so you think about what both characters need in a partner. You write down something that seems very important for each of them:

1. Harry really needs and appreciates humor.

2. Hermione loves arguing--as a sport, and to keep her mind active.

Uh oh. Looks like you've got some issues, because you also notice that:

1. Harry does not find Hermione funny.

2. Harry hates arguing.

These are very, very hard issues to deal with. You could always give Harry someone to joke with, and Hermione someone to argue with, but then you're going to have an even harder case to make that they belong together, instead of putting Harry with the person he finds funny (Ginny's pretty funny!) and Hermione with the person she loves arguing with (boy does that Ron like to argue!). Or you could try to figure out how to make Hermione come across as funnier. Maybe she has the hots for Harry and starts taking lessons from Ron on the things he finds funny--puts real concerted effort into it to show him that she loves him. That'd be cute! And maybe Harry can learn to tolerate arguing, instead of blowing his lid when people do it around him--It's hard to see him ever enjoying it, but if he put effort in, too, then sure! Maybe it would work. If you wrote that? I'd read that. Each character trying to change themselves to make sure the other's needs are met. Maybe it's ultimately a doomed relationship, but it's one worth writing about, reading about, and it's also one that will /start in the first place/.

...

But you know what's easier than that?

We could just make Harry not need humor so intimately! And we could make Hermione just not enjoy arguing! Then they fit perfectly together!

And that's why I hate Harmony. Because, regardless of what you do to make sure they never get together with Ginny or Ron (itself generally a very tricky thing to do), that Harry isn't acting like Harry. And that Hermione? She's not Hermione.

(Hope that helps)
