Ginny is deliberately written to be the perfect woman for Harry, so I won't argue with that.

The assertion that Hermione enjoys arguing, however, has always been one that baffles me. Unless someone can point out in-text confirmation that Hermione actually likes arguing, I don't think there's any evidence for it. It's telling that whenever Ron and Hermione have an argument, they usually end up ignoring each other for hours or even days at a time afterward, and whenever she and Harry have an argument, it almost always ends with Hermione in tears. JKR has further implied in /that interview/ that Ron and Hermione's arguments aren't as constructive as R/Hr shippers claim: if the author says you'd probably need marriage counseling and that you're 'fundamentally incompatible', it's likely those shouting matches you've been having aren't really as sporting as you thought.

In all honesty, none of the canon trio are particularly good for each other. H/Hr has its issues and so does R/Hr, and it probably would have been a better idea to leave them all as friends. And doing so would have pushed romance further into the background in the latter half of the series, which is always a plus since Jo is an at-best middling, at-worst terrible romance writer.
