I don't think it's this sub specifically, though fanfiction definitely seems to be an outlet for some H/Hr shippers. I would imagine most non-H/Hr people have back buttoned an otherwise decent fic because of the pairing.

But I think there's another reason why Harry/Hermone is particularly disliked within the fandom.

First of all, canon!Harry and canon!Hermione together is out-of-character by it's very nature, so right away at least one of them is going to be OOC. On top of this, Harry/Hermione writers frequently demonize Ron, Ginny and/or the entire Weasley family in order to make sure their pairing is morally in the right or simply to make things easier. It's definitely possible to write a Harry/Hermione fic where Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione relationships fall apart naturally, but it's rare.

A pairing like Harry/Draco can exist while leaving the Ron/Hermione pairing intact. Hermione/Draco can exist while leaving Harry/Ginny intact. Obviously there are writers who tank Ginny to make Harry/Draco work, and writers who tank Ron just to make Draco/Hermione work, but one of the two core pairings is unaffected.

*Harry/Hermione /requires/ OOC behavior from Harry and/or Hermione, and it /generally/ includes in OOC behavior from Ron and/or Ginny. It ruins both of the two core pairings, and it turns the the trio dynamic upside down, which is an important pairing even if it's not a romantic one.*

So a lot of fans dislike it more than they do a pairing like Harry/Draco.
