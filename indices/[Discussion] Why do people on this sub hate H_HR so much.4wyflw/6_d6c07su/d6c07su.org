I tend to ignore the pairing rather than hating it. I have seen Hermione at her worst in fanfiction. The author had made her into a villain. You lose a little bit of yourself reading something like that.

Let me clarify the author did nothing wrong, he was being creative and imaginative. But, that negativity stays with you.

When I think of Hermione I imagine her being bossy and doing Harry and Ron's homework.

I just don't like reading Hermione as if she is Harry's personal genie in the lamp. Simply there to solve all his problems....
