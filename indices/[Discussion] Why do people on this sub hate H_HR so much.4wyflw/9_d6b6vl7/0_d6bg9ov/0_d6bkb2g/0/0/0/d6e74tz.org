I fail to see why Ron, who had had his pet for longer (and whose pet Hermione was well aware of when she got hers), should be the one to make the concessions so that Hermione's newer pet could move in.

Beyond that, even if he had literally been waving Scabbers in front of Crookshanks' nose, Hermione's attitude was plain insensitive. She was more concerned with being right than her friend's very valid feelings over losing his pet, and honestly she deserved not being spoken to.
