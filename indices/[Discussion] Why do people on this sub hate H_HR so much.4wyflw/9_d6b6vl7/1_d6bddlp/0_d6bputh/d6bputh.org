I have many arguments, I will begin with one on each book. If you want more don't hesitate to ask me (and I don't bother to be downvoted, most of them are idiots who worship Emma Watson (and not Hermione) like a goddess) :

First book: It may have been before the three were friends but am I the only one finding her annoying ( I know it's no). How she follow Harry and Ron everywhere like a lost puppy and then snap at them (with the three headed dog for example)

Second book: I don't know you but I wouldn't want for any reason anyone taking my appareance. Who does the little bookworm think she is to polyuice someone else. I like karma and I would have liked that she looked like a cat for the rest of her life.

Third Book: Her pet is a cat. Ron's pet is a rat. Ron was sad and angry that his rat (seems to be) was dead. Couldn't she just say sorry even if she don't think it. For God sake, can't she understand that her friend is sad and try to be mature.

Fourth Book: Can we talk about the fact that Hermione KIDNAPPED, TORTURED and let Rita Skeet IMPRISONED? I really don't know how with the polyjuice fact and this she didn't land to Azkaban. And after that she reprimand Harry for the Sectumsempra he used on Draco.

Fifth Book: The book where Hermione created the DA, said to him that it will only be a few one and invited the whole world. The same book where once Harry get caught, she let Harry suffer even if she was the one who created the DA.

Sixth Book: The book where Hermione decided to be the most annoying. Harry knew Draco was a Death Eater but she was: "No Harry, let me do the thinking in this group. If I didn't discovered that Draco was a Death Eater first how could you? After all I am the most intelligent bitc.. eh witch of Hogwarts." (Just this book I will give a second argument) In this book Hermione attacked Ron because he had a girlfriend (Seriously?) And in the fourth she snapped at him because he was jealous of Krum.

Seventh Book: Same as the sixth. Harry knew that the Deathly Hallows where important but Hermione said the same: "Harry, who is the most intelligent bitch? I am. So stop thinking and just kill Voldemort:

Epilogue: Did she confuse someone so Ron could have his Driver License? Please someone put her in Azkaban.

PS: I have so many others if someone is interessted. It would be a pleasure for me to insult her more.
