All you really need to do is set it a few years post DH. Barely anybody marries the people they date at 17 these days. The characters would be much more mature, so the emotional binaries people are posting here wouldn't have as much effect. I suppose you could argue that that's OOC, but only because there's nothing really defined until the epilogue on.

I read plenty of fanfic anyway, but the fact that there's so much undying love between teens has always bothered me. I've never written HP fanfiction, but if I did (and wanted romance) I'd almost assuredly write it with the characters being a little older. What I wanted from girls when I was a teen is far different from what I wanted from women in my twenties. It might be OOC from my teen self, but it's quietly clearly still me (I might have SI myself into myself though).
