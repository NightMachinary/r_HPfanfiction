While I'm not the person you replied to, personally I think that the most likely way for this to happen would be for them to try, have the whole thing crash and burn, and then give them a reason to try building something on top of those ashes.

We do know that Harry needs humour and can be quite sarcastic if given the possibility, just as we know that Hermione needs her trivia and needs to occasionally argue; those needs are there because they are emotionally ... not fully stable, and it means that if they were to limit themselves to each other the whole thing would crash and burn because of there being no way for them to satisfy those needs. And that, normally, would have been an end to their relationship. bBut there are people who, when given proper motivation, can take whatever it is that crashed and burned for them and try again, differently, try to change themselves for the cause; the same thing applies to relationships, and if both of them were given a reason to actually try they could build something on top of those ashes because they would be more mindful then of each other's hurts and needs.

Admittedly it would be hard because that's quite a mature approach to romance and stuff, but they already are capable of being friends so clearly they can be in each other's company without issues so there already is something from which to change so that they could be compatible as a couple, and change brought by something that makes sense in the world of the story isn't out-of-character. The only question would be how exactly to make them motivated, but I think it something for a brainstorming session rather than something to throw a haphazard idea for and do whatever.
