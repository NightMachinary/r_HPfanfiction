This is bang on. This sub rarely expresses hate for any particular ship, just don't make a thread asking for "good H/Hr" fanfic because there are literally dozens that show up in Google searches.

Although for H/Hr hate, some of the authors of the more popular fics set the bar extremely low. That certainly doesn't help.
