Author's summary: When an accident in Potions class turns Harry into Draco and Draco into Harry, each is trapped playing the part of the other. Romance, mistaken identities, really Cunning Plans, evil bake sales, a love triangle, and snogs galore.

It's a really old fic and very popular when it was first written. Whether it's actually good is a matter of opinion of course.
