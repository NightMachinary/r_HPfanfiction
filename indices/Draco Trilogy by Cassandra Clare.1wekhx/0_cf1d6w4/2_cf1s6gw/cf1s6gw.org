I get accusation of "plagiarism" when it comes to fanfiction if material is taken from another fanfiction verbatim. But accusing fanfiction of plagiarism because it borrows heavily from a famous TV shows? People write and read crossovers all the time - this trilogy is basically an HP/Buffy crossover where the snarky dialogue from the later was the part that "crossed over" to HP.
