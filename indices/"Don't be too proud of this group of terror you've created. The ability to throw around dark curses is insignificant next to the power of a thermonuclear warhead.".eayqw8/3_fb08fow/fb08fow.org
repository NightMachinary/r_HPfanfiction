The only use I see for the atomic bomb in a magical war is a first-strike against the ministry or Gringotts. And unless Gringotts is a gateway to a vast underground city, a large conventional explosive would work just as well. But once the enemy knows they are at war with you, if you know where to nuke you've already done 95% of the work.
