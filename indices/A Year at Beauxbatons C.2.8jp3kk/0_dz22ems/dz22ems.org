I liked it, but you probably shouldn't self-promote this much. You already made two threads for the 3k words first chapter, so it'd be best to wait until there's real meat to the story to promote further.

It's a decent story so far, hard to tell with how little has happened. As long as you avoid any more rewrites, and just focus on content and progressing, this could be a nice story.
