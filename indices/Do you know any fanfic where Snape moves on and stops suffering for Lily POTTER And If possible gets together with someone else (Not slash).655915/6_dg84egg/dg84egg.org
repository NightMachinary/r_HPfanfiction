In the /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Re-]]/ trilogy (/Resonance, Revolution, Resolution/; (1,713,423 WL in total; abandoned), after the circumstances force (IIRC) Snape to become Harry's guardian, he gradually mellows out, somewhat.

Later he gets acquainted with a regular witch (OC), and eventually their relationship becomes strong enough to make the story suitable for your request. The trilogy isn't a fast-paced one, but usually when it's taking its time it's for the sake of realistic character development and not just for stretching out chapters and word count.

So whether or not you'll enjoy it depends on your reaction to the slow pacing, I guess.
