Check out linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville)! Great characterization for Snape and is one of the only fics I've read where 11 year old Harry behaves sufficiently childlike. The Snape pairing (not slash, but I won't spoil it for you) is really well done. And it has a completed sequel!
