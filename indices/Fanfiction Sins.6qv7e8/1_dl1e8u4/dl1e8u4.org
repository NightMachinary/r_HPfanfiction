I might be being rather harsh, but absolutely not. We do not need even a /chance/ of having another Critics United. They purged FFN of tens of thousands of stories once already. We don't need this happening again. I don't care whether it's a good or bad story, even the most /minuscule/ chance of a "cleanup" happening is unacceptable.

Of course, if you do not lose sight of your intended vision - of humorous criticism, than I can support such a thing to a degree.
