Sorry if my last post sounded rude, but Critics United makes me enraged just by /thinking/ of them. I'm just worried that you (and anyone also doing this) might some day lose sight of your original goal, and go off the deep end. The average Critics United review was exceedingly pompous, forceful, and arrogant sounding. It's like all of the world's stereotypical cliche Percy Weasleys decided to band together and be one.

  I ever get around to writing a story I'd be perfectly happy to have someone tear it to shreds, as long as they weren't attacking me personally.

I can wholeheartedly agree with this.
