What if you've got light divergence from the beginning or even pre-canon. But the main divergence isn't till later in the books?

I know that there's plenty that do that and just summarise a bit in the first chapter and reveal more as the story progress, but part of me feels like that's cheating. But on the other hand, those stories at least doesn't get boring or get bogged down with 500K extra words that are as good as useless.
