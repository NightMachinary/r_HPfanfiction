I was meaning more like something that will change some canon events but most things will stay the same, at least in broad strokes.

So still a philosphers stone, still a bassilisk that terrorised Hogwarts, Sirius still escaping, still dementors at Hogwarts, still a fuck up at the end of third year, still a Death Eater attack at the World Cup and still a plot to kidnap and kill Harry using the Triwizard tournament.

But beyond that the journey between those points may be notably different at points. It just seems pointless to go over it all when the 'main story' would start after that point from whence the story will be notably different from canon.
