I don't think that only mentioning the changes when the main divergence occurs is always the best solution. Sometimes if you're writing a butterfly-effect sort of story, minor details in the beginning are going to turn out to be highly important later. E.g. suppose that the companionship of Harry's pet snake in first year triggers a series of changes to his personality, causing him to handle the heir of Slytherin business in a very OC way. In this case, the fun in the story is for readers to watch how the nearly unnoticable changes in first year slowly stack up and be surprised when they fall into place.

Readers who miss the details might leave because they think you're just "rehashing canon", but the ones who stay will be happy. It's similar to why a lot of detective stories force you to read through chapters upon chapters of small talks and ordinary stuff before the murder even happens.

Meanwhile, if you instead skip first year and simply say that Harry got a pet snake in first year, you might get complaints for "badly attempting to justify Harry acting like an OC".
