I disagree, while is true that a fanfiction is based on canon, if well written it should be able to be it's own story. If something that happens in Canon also happens in the fanfic it should be rewritten in the Fic to give continuity in the story.

Edit: a reader can skipp the 'canon part' if they don't want to reread, but if they don't remember something they shouldn't be confused because the author didn't write something that was part of the story.
