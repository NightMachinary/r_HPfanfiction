I hate when muggleborns are sorted into Slytherin and no one bats an eye. Slytherin didn't want to teach muggleborns at all, he would have trained the hat not to sort them into his house. And even if by a fluke one still ended up there, it would create quite a stir or the poor kid would have to hide it or have 7 years of constantly watching his/her back.

I know people want good Slytherins, but even if its set decades after HP and everyone has mellowed a lot, that hat still has 1000 year old prejudice programmed in it.
