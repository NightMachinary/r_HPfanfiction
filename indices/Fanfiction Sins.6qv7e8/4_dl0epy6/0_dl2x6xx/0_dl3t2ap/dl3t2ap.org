Its been outright stated by Rowling that the hat "literally contains the intelligence of the four founders" (source JK Rowling writing on Pottermore: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat]]) and the canon fourth year song said "The founders put some brains in me, So I could choose instead!" so I think its a pretty safe assumption Slytherin was involved.

Having said that, it's fanfiction so if something in canon needs to be hand waved, as long as the rest of the story makes sense I think its pretty easy to forgive especially if they're willing to address the other consequences as you've said.
