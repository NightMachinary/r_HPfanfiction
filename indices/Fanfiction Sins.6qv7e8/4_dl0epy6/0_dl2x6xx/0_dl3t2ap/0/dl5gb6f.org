Good catch! I didn't know about that.

On the other hand, Rowling had also planned to put Mafalda --- a daughter of a Squib and a Muggle --- into Slytherin, only writing her out because she couldn't make the character work logistically.

Also, Slytherin is only one of four votes, and he'd been outvoted on Muggleborns before. Here's how Hermione's sorting might go:

*Helga Aspect:* Too domineering for Hufflepuff. I vote for Ravenclaw.

*Rowena Aspect:* Too goal-oriented for me. Gryffindor or Slytherin.

*Helga Aspect:* Gryffindor or Slytherin sounds fine. That vicious streak would serve her well in Slytherin, actually...

*Salazar Aspect:* A Mudblood in my House? How dare you even suggest that?!

*Helga Aspect:* You know what? I've had just about enough of your racism. I vote Slytherin. Your house could use some fresh blood. Who's with me?!

*Salazar Aspect:* This is ridiculous. Godric, take your Mudblood and go. We know she wants to be in your House.

*Godric Aspect:* Actually, Sal, I think you need a lesson. Slytherin.

*Salazar Aspect:* Veto! You need 3 of 4 to override, and there's no way Rowenna...

*Rowena Aspect:* You know, I never did get you back for not telling me that Baron Whatshisface was prone to murderous raging /before/ I sent him to track down my daughter.

*Salazar Aspect:* F#$%.

*Hermione:* Don't I get a say in this?

*All aspects:* NO!
