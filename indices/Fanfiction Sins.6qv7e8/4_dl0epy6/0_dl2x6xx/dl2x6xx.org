Yes and no. Slytherin did abandon the Hogwarts project part way through, so we don't know if he had any hand in programming the Hat.

On the other hand, as a fan of Slytherin!Hermione fic, I second the rest of this: if you're going to put Hermione in there, don't cop out with the "revelation" that Slytherins are actually more accepting than Hufflepuffs (and Gryffindors are the ones slinging around "Mudblood"), with Draco suddenly deciding to be her friend and protector, or with Hermione suddenly discovering that she is a pureblood.

Actually deal with the fact that she is sleeping in the same room as children of unrepentant Death Eaters who are all too eager to follow in their parents' footsteps. Actually deal with the fact that Slytherin tends to attract selfish, not-nice kids. Let Hermione's own talent, hard work, and her own brand of viciousness shine!
