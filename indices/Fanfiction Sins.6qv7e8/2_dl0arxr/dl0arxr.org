- "You see, Harry Potter was a wizard..."

Thanks for reminding me of this minuscule detail. /s

There is a fine line between explaining something so that readers remember it from canon, or explaining something that is either fanon or AU, but beyond that line there is stuff like this that makes me wonder if the author knows where the hell he's posting.

- Explaining your fanon preference in the story.

- Shopping trips with no other value than to equip your protagonist with shopping bags full of deus ex machina and leather trousers.
