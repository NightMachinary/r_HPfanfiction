Well, I think that it could be a good thread, but only if we require the sins to be written out in King James Bible style prose. For example,

- If an author writeth a Headmaster who doth manipulate, yet is incompetent, he hath committed an abomination: he shall surely be put to scorn; his tears shall be upon him.
- Thou shalt not make unto thee any magical core, or any likeness of any thing that acteth like a magical battery, nor arbitrary power differentials between characters.
