Actually, I completely disagree. While CinemaSins is fun if you watch a few videos, I found it got boring rather fast. And I don't think FanFiction is lacking in petty reviews that nitpick minor details that the reviewer dislikes.

If you want to make something great, make [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8h3ri2WN_-IbviBlWtUcQ][FanfictionWins]], that instead tells you what a story did well.

It shows what authors did great and actually provokes thought, brings attention to well-done details that you might have not notices and beautifully analyzes structures and plot.

But hey, if you want you could also make petty CinemaSins-style reviews. This is especially good for FanFiction as it isn't made by corporations and professionals who earn millions of dollars, but some individuals who had fun in their free time and decided to share it with you. This sure makes you the better person!

And no, I'm not saying 'negative reviews are bad' or should be disallowed. But making something dedicated to make fun of amateur authors is in my opinion wrong and petty.
