Would be funny seeing a 11 years-old Harry deciding that the best way of becoming a great wizard is by imitating Dumbledore as much as possible and upon receiving the cloak promptly starting to stalk him so he can get better at “Dumbledoring”... incidentally he learns a lot of personal information about people that he later carelessly drops in the middle of conversation while acting overly familiar and mysterious -it goes as well as you could imagine.
