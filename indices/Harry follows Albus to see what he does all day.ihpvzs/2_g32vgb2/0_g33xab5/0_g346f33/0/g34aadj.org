Dear magazine I noticed you credited the invention of floo powder to 1740 by miles prowler but if you did your research you would have discovered that it was invented in 1620's and that Miles prowler himself in a 1660 Journal that he wrote which I will now qoute from 'while I am often credited as the discovery of floo powder, it was the life work of my mother who spent decades working on the powder and I being the noble son that i am carried on her legacy, while I heavily refute the claim of inventing the powder, I will not deny that I refined and modified it allowing it to be produced much cheaper, I supose if one must credit me as having invented it then perhaps me and my mother should be listed as co creators for my work was merely built on the foundation of hers'
