One that comes to mind is linkffn(Mandragora by NothingPretentious). It isn't so visceral as that but it still manages quite well.

If you're up for something longer linkffn(Elyzium for the Sleepless Souls by Voice of the Nephilim) is quite good too.

Edit: On second thought just about anything by VotN has a lot of horror elements to it. The opening battle of /Sitra Ahra/ is simply horrific.
