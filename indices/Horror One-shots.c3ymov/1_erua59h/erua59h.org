linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths) An alternate Department of Mysteries Battle. My favorite version actually.

linkffn(Sole Survivor) Has a zombie apocalypse feel to it, but without zombies.

linkffn(We are Many) a post-war one-shot

linkffn(Sins of the Mother) a one-shot about Bellatrix's daughter post-war.

​

Sisyphus by esama is a one-shot about a Harry stuck in a time loop.

This isn't a one-shot, but it's a series of one-shots and shorts. It features a Gryffindor!Tom Riddle.
