I liked The Black Cat, but I marvel at the stupidity of the main character. It set the tone perfectly right, but when the protagonist accidentally revealed that he was the murderer, I wanted to enter the story and strangle him to death.

The Tell Tale Heart was quite creepy too. The tension was so thick that I couldn't cut it with a knife! I might read a few more of his stories soon!
