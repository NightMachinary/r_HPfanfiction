Meh I generally skip over them, unless they are really really good, AND manage to show such in the summary and first chapter. I think the only one if read was... Lilly Potter and the Art of Being Sysifus? Or some such?

They do nothing for me with Fem!Harry as the reader Avatar, and they rarely bring to the table anything that they couldn't bring with a male harry. Most of them are just an excuse to pair harry with wizard of choice.... Voldie or Snape seems popular.
