As Achille-Talon said, you won't get a negative reaction; not on this sub at any rate. I've seen people post recommendations or request fem!Harry fics, and they are always received positively.

However, like OC focused or "Wrong Boy Who Lived" fics, it's not a widely popular subset of Harry Potter fanfiction. Your fic may not get as much of a readerbase, but don't let that hold you back from sharing.
