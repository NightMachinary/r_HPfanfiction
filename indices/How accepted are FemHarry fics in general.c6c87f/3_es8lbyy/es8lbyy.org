As with any fanfic, the moment you put pen to paper you've lost a large number of readers who aren't interested in that particular idea. As a gut feeling with little basis other than the reaction to my fem!Harry fic vs. my previous fics, I'd guess the number to be at around 50% for fem!Harry - a similar rate of attrition as if you choose to write slash.
