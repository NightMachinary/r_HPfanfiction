Just, for the love of god, find original names. I have no issue whatosever with switching genders, but seeing things as spectacularly lazy as using variants of the name Harry, or Draco, or whatever is so cringey. I even saw fem!Harry fics where her name was not even changed, she was still Harry Potter.

There are thousands of female names in the English language, please dont pick Henrietta, or Heriett, or whatever bizarre variant the name Harry has.
