So, um... while still not quite convinced there's any point to it, I'm posting the notes I've been compiling for the past few days. I had to split it into three parts due to the comment length limit.

Here goes. *presses Comment, covers head and braces himself for negative reactions*

​

The core divergence point from canon would be Lily deciding to have muggle ultrasound during her pregnancy (the technology dates back to the sixties, so it should be available at this time), which reveals that she's pregnant with a girl. At this point, the prophecy has already been made and the Potters are aware of it, as well as the fact that they and the Longbottoms are the only candidates. But the prophecy explicitly talks about the vanquisher of Voldemort as a male, yet the Potters having a daughter would mean that the Longbottoms' child is the one the prophecy talks about by process of elimination. As the Potters are friends with the Longbottoms, Lily and James decide to pull off an extremely risky gambit and hide their child's gender, going to the extent of Liliy giving birth at home without a midwife and giving the child a male name (hence Harry is still named Harry). The point being that with two possible targets, there's a 50-50 chance Voldemort will go after the wrong child - and Voldemort indeed takes the bait once he catches wind of a Fidelius being used to hide one target and correctly assumes Dumbledore knows something he doesn't. Dumbledore is the only one outside the family who's in the know about Harry, nobody else knows. Not even Sirius.

​

Fast forward ten years. Harry has been relentlessly teased and bullied over her gender-mismatched name by the other kids, causing her to grow up quiet and reclusive. Not the cool kid kind, the depressed child kind. While the other children are animatedly socializing, Harry can usually be seen silently leaning against the wall in the background, paying attention but not butting in unless someone asks her something. She's not antisocial, she just dislikes being the center of attention because it more often than not meant bad things (NOT because of her gender, because of her name) and is highly insecure about her first name, more than Tonks ever was. The latter part is exacerbated even further by Petunia having been aware of James' prankster nature via hearsay from Lily, causing Harry to assume her name was an extremely bad-taste joke. However, she is NOT a fragile wallflower by any means just because she's a girl; she is more than capable of both asskicking and calling people out if she's pushed to it. At age 11, Harry is still androgynous enough to pass for a boy but by her mid-teens, there'd be no ambiguity anymore, even though she's still plain-looking and nothing unusual in terms of endowment.

​

After the stress of bullying causes one accidental magic incident too many, Vernon starts demanding that they get rid of the freak; Petunia, more afraid of Dumbledore than of her husband, refuses. This causes Vernon to get pissed and pull a low blow by accusing Petunia of secretly harboring sympathy to Harry due to the latter's gender, which in turn pisses Petunia off royally. Their marriage enters a downwards spiral and after multiple fights and a few years of toxic atmosphere, ultimately results in Vernon filing for a divorce, with Petunia moving to a downtown apartment with the kids. She justifiably becomes bitter and develops a drinking problem, but there's no domestic violence and she just plain doesn't care what Harry does in her free time (which is usually roaming the streets); although Vernon has visitation rights, Harry makes sure to spend the day away from home every time he comes over to see Dudley in order to avoid running into him.

​

When the Hogwarts letter arrives, it's Harry who finds it first but after reading it, she assumes it's a prank and throws it in the trash, which is where Dudley finds it and brings it to Petunia's attention. Once again, Petunia is too afraid of the consequences to not let her go. Even once Harry is on the Express, she still half-expects that everything is just a prank at her expense (which causes the Sorting Hat to break out into hysterical laughter upon being put on her head) and it takes a few weeks to settle in that yes, this is for real. Although she still runs into Ron and Hermione, her name isn't revealed until she's called at the Sorting because she spends the train ride wearing a hoodie.

​

Due to not being of the expected gender, Harry has to go through some extra identification tests at Gringotts. Although the goblins are satisfied with the result and consider the matter closed, they still forward the paperwork of the anomaly to the Ministry, who quietly have some legilimency experts verify that Harry is not lying about being Harry Potter and her mind hasn't been tampered with to make her believe that she is. This also brings to light the treatment Harry got from the Dursleys but again, there was no domestic violence, so the DMLE simply shrugs and lets the matter go because it's outside their jurisdiction and the root cause of the Dursleys' discrimination is such that they can't involve muggle child protection services without the Statute of Secrecy getting in the way. Her gender only hits the news after the Sorting, with the Ministry adding the DMLE's analysis as proof that Harry really is who she claims herself to be and not just an impostor. Needless to say, this causes quite a stir in the public and quite a major annoyance to Harry due to all the stares and whispering.

​

In terms of inheritance, there's only one Gringotts vault and while it has enough funds that she doesn't have to work for the rest of her life as long as she keeps her spending conservative, she's not ultra-wealthy. As a member of an old family, she has observer status at the Wizengamot (that is, she can attend and observe the proceedings if she wishes, but has no say in the proceedings, ie. no voting or speaking) but is not required to exercise it (most who have the same right don't) and she's perfectly fine with that. She has no other legal or political rights or obligations due to her heritage.

​

Although it's probably going to be a controversial decision, I'm firmly of the intention of *no bashing*. Not on my watch. Not even Dumbledore. In fact, Ron would mention Dumbledore's three major positions early on; slightly later, Hermione would mention only two, Ron would butt in about him being ex-ICW, to which Hermione would clarify that the Ministry offered him the position but he refused and when they tried to force the issue by giving him the position anyway, he resigned on the spot and simply returned to Hogwarts without an explanation. Harry would later (still in first year) ask Dumbledore why did he do that because she can guess that it's an important position, to which Dumbledore would mock-frown and reply that because being Headmaster is fun. The actual reason is because Dumbledore is sick and tired of people assuming him to be a super-badass because of his past and constantly running to him whenever something's on fire, instead of proactively solving their problems themselves rather than waiting for a hero to do it for them. He's only sticking around to make sure Voldemort is six feet under for real before retiring to throw his feet up and enjoy his twilight years in well-earned peace as the tired elder he is.

​

As for Neville, he develops a bit of a hero worship on Harry after she unintentionally gets Draco off his back in first year (she negatively compares Draco harassing Neville to a muggle bully and Draco shifts his ire to her due to the perceived insult of being likened to a muggle). It's mostly unobtrusive, but Harry still finds it annoying - though not to the extend of telling him to stop it. Similar deal with Ron, as his constant blathering makes Harry initially assume that he's self-centered; this opinion is changed after the Chamber of Secrets incident where Ron awkwardly thanks her for her involvement and Harry warms up to him a bit for showing concern for Ginny.
