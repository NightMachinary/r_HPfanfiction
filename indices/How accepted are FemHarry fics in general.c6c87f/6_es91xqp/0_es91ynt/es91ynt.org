For Hermione, the troll incident goes down differently. When the warning comes out, Harry goes back to the dorm without a fuss, insisting to herself that it's not her business. But her guilt doesn't let her be, so she sneaks out to find Hermione anyway. In the end, they get saved by the timely arrival of McGonagall, who promptly demonstrates that she isn't Dumbledore's right-hand woman for nothing and swiftly kills the troll by spearing it through the head with bathroom taps transfigured into iron spears, then transfiguring the spears to erupt into spikes in every direction to messily reduce the troll's brain into swiss cheese. Moral of the lesson: don't mess with the granny who teaches magic to others because chances are, she's competent enough at her profession to kill people with it in a hundred different ways. Hermione is particularly impressed and afterwards holds McGonagall in very high regard, not for being an authority figure but for being a powerful yet moral and compassionate witch (after hearing out the girls, she sends them to Poppy for a Calming Draught then back to the dorms without docking points because Hermione didn't even get the warning and thus wasn't at fault while Harry initially did as told and only disobeyed out of conscience).

​

This incident would be what sets up the general characterization of Harry when it comes to heroics. She tries to get out from under it, insisting both to herself and to others that it's not her business, but when the chips are down for real and it's time to make a stand, she comes running while silently berating herself for it. She still has the Saving People Thing, but is in denial and refusal about it because she doesn't want to risk her neck, but her stupid conscience keeps making life harder for her. This is exactly why the Sorting Hat sends her to Gryffindor: true courage is facing adversity not without but in spite of fear and her helping others isn't by choice, it's who she is. He'd later state that he was sorely tempted with Hufflepuff as his second choice.

​

Speaking of the Chamber of Secrets incident. Although Harry was initially annoyed by Ginny's treatment of her, the same as Neville's, the shared trauma of this incident (both have trouble sleeping for a time and Harry develops a minor phobia of snakes) results in the two bonding extremely closely to the point where Ginny explicitly calls Harry the big sister she never had and Harry reciprocates in kind. No slash, but bed sharing and bathing together at the Burrow is a thing, so there are still accusations (and Ginny tends to be the more outspoken one when defending them both). Still, Ginny is a major positive influence on Harry and they're straight-up BFFs.

​

The prophecy doesn't become a factor until the end of the fourth year, when things start spinning out of control. The attempt to falsely enter Harry into the Tournament fails because Harry very vehemently and explicitly declines to participate, refusing to budge from this position even after being warned of possible consequences. This forces Crouch Jr.'s hand to taking a more direct approach; no details yet, but both Harry and Neville end up in the cemetery. During the ritual, Harry and Wormtail get into a scuffle, Neville attempts to interfere but gets (non-lethally) stabbed by Wormtail, which causes Harry to flip out, tackle Wormtail to the ground and bash his skull in with a rock, killing him. Except as it turns out, Neville's blood fell into the cauldron, which completes the ritual and resurrects Voldemort - except Harry still has Lily's protection, meaning she's untouchable to Voldemort's magic. Abusing this fact to become a human shield for Neville, the two manage to escape.

​

It's at this point where Dumbledore comes clear to both of them about the prophecy and the circumstances of the Potters' deaths. Harry naturally demands to know why she was sent to live with Petunia and in addition to explaining the blood protection, Dumbledore also admits that he hoped to keep Harry uninvolved and spared of any more suffering. As far as the prophecy is involved, Harry is a non-entity. She is not bound by this fate and doesn't have to act in accordance with it, so she's free to walk away. Except even once Voldemort knows the truth, he still keeps going after Harry to make an example out of her, the one who dared to wound him, declaring Neville to be of lower priority. Not that this prevents Neville from being scared shitless by the revelation that he has to face He Who Must Not Be Named in a life-or-death fight only one of them will walk away from, coupled with the one-two punch of being told that he's the reason why Harry is an orphan. Harry doesn't blame him, she blames her parents for coming up with such a crazy plan in the first place, though she understands their reasoning and admits that she probably would've done the same if her own friends would've been involved.

​

So with Voldemort forcing her hand and Harry knowing for a fact that she cannot kill him, Harry decides to stick together with Neville on the off chance that her anti-Voldemort protection as Neville's human shield will give Neville enough of an edge to do what he's fated to do, to say nothing of the fact that although Harry doesn't exactly like her parents' decision, she admits that if Neville bites the dust, Lily and James will have died for nothing. This decision causes Dumbledore to suspect he may have overlooked something in the prophecy, chews through the wording one more time and comes to the conclusion that Harry may not be as uninvolved as he thought. Specifically, the prophecy says Neville is the only one who can do the job, but nothing about by what means he'll achieve it. Or whose means. Because as a wild card third party who chooses to involve herself out of compassion for her chosen side, rather than force or admiration, Harry is a companion to Neville the likes of which Voldemort does not - and never did - have. In other words, Dumbledore has a not entirely unfounded suspicion that Harry might *be* Neville's Power-He-Knows-Not, an ally who isn't in the prophecy's wording but can still indirectly influence its outcome by way of her blood protection allowing her to intevene in Neville's favor as his Shieldmaiden (title drop).

​

But then again, this is only Dumbledore's speculation and the nature of prophecies is such that he has no way of knowing if he's right or wrong. But he doesn't fail to notice that by their late teens, the hero has a bit of a crush towards his Shieldmaiden who isn't exactly averse to the idea herself, especially with Ginny having also noticed and subtly playing matchmaker between rounds of teasing. Smut is not on the table right now and H/N is definitely not going to be official until seventh year. No other pairings are planned to be in focus and I ain't touching Snape or Draco with a barge pole.
