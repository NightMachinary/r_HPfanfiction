Some additional minor points:

- Harry is fairly bright, but not genius-level. Her main academic difficulty is lack of motivation to perform beyond expectations. Even when she's asked what job she wants to have in the future, she can't answer because she honestly hadn't thought that far. She has no grand dreams or aspirations, she just... drifts. What she initially sees in the Mirror of Erised is herself chilling out in peace without anyone bothering her, with the image later changing to include her friends also chilling out in the background, later changing once again to Ginny and Neville being in the foreground alongside her. She doesn't want power, she doesn't want riches, she just wants the simple things in life and it isn't because she doesn't know any better, it's her choice.
- That being said, she doesn't hesitate to apply force beyond what's strictly necessary when dealing with Death Eaters. She doesn't have any special powers or training aside from the anti-Voldemort protection, but she tends to fight dirty: laying traps and ambushes, blasting through walls, collapsing the ceiling, opening muggle gas valves and chucking fire into the room when the DEs come into the room after her, etc. She never comes at the opposition from head-on and makes heavy use of the Cloak during fights, making her an annoyingly slippery opponent. She still prefers not to kill people but as Wormtail's example above demonstrates, she's not unwilling to rescind that rule if it's personal. It's never her first option, however.
- Harry's anti-Voldemort protection only applies to being directly targeted by harmful spells. He can still use legilimency (but only as long as he's not actively trying to attack her mind with it and it gives him a major headache regardless) or hurt her with the environment, like blasting the ground next to her to hit her with debris, magically hurling debris at her and letting go of the spell before it hits (if he doesn't, it'll still bounce off) or suffocating her by consuming the oxygen in the room with Fiendfyre, but he can't just AK her and be done with it. Harry is protected but she's not invulnerable and she knows it, hence why she fights dirty.
- Harry's unconventional approach to combat would be stated to be coming from Lily. In particular, it would eventually be revealed that according to what the DMLE crime scene investigators who arrived to Godric's Hollow after Voldemort's first demise were able to piece together, Lily knew she had no chance against Voldemort in a magical duel and surprise-attacked him with a muggle weapon (a sawn-off shotgun) but due to her lack of experience with handling it (she had to obtain it illegally due to British gun control laws at the time), she failed to score a kill shot on the first try and didn't have time for a second before an enraged Voldemort literally tore her limb from limb before Crucio'ing her until she expired (he was supremely pissed that the cheeky little mudblood dared to draw his blood with a muggle weapon). The sounds of this execution is what Harry recalls under dementor influence and Snape gets to hear it at one point when he uses legilimency on Harry, massively freaking him out to the point where he actually stops picking on Harry for good.
- While it's probably going to be a highly controversial decision, although Harry still likes the thrill of flying, her aversion to attention means she does not play quidditch at Hogwarts due to performance anxiety. She *can* do it and is an excellent flier, she just *really* doesn't want to do it in front of an audience. The one time she's asked to fill in for someone as an emergency replacement, it takes over an hour of pleading and begging from Wood to convince her to do it just this once, with the result causing Wood to be mobbed by bewildered people demanding to know where the hell has he been hiding her up until now and why the hell didn't he recruit her into the team already. While Harry feels warm and fuzzy from the overwhelmingly positive reaction, she still declines a reserve position on the team and has no plans to go professional after school either.
- Fudge initially appears to be the incompetent buffoon he always has been. However, when Voldemort returns and Harry is giving eyewitness testimony to him and Dumbledore, Fudge suddenly turns dead-serious and pays full attention to her but insists that they can't reveal this to the public or there will be mass hysteria, exactly the kind of atmosphere Death Eaters thrive in, instead proposing to keep things under the lid for now while he discretely alerts the DMLE and Dumbledore reassembles the Order of the Phoenix. Fudge later reveals to Harry that he's been faking his incompetence to honeypot Lucius and collect evidence against the man from within. Problem is, Lucius is not an idiot and is *very* good at hiding his tracks, so Fudge can't bag him just yet for anything other than bribery and extortion, which is nowhere near enough to nail him to the wall for good (even with Fudge documenting every single transaction Lucius sent his way down to the last knut and keeping the money in a separate vault to be turned over as evidence instead of pocketing it). Harry providing memory of Lucius in the cemetery is the turning point, but Fudge doesn't want to spring the trap just yet for fear of alerting the other DEs that he's on to them (though Lucius, again, isn't an idiot and is already starting to suspect something because the Auror Corps mobilized far too quickly after Fudge claimed Harry was too spooked by whatever she had seen to say anything about what happened).

So... input? Pointers on what to avoid? Anything? Note that although I haven't written HP yet, I have writing experience in other fandoms.
