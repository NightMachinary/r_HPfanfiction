  Gonna have to make sure to explain that one. How would hiding Harry's gender help?
#+end_quote

The wording of the prophecy, as [[/u/tediuminahamsterball][u/tediuminahamsterball]] pointed out, explicitly states that Voldemort's nemesis is a male born at the end of July. By date of birth Harry and Neville are both candidates but coupled with the gender, Neville is the one by process of elimination. If Voldemort doesn't know Harry's gender, he thinks he has two targets, meaning there's a 50% chance he'll go after the wrong one, which gives the other one advance warning.

Basically, Lily and James are planning to use themselves and Harry as a decoy for Frank, Alice and Neville. Harry, of course, was not of any age to consent. If that bothers you, that's normal; while I don't normally write my stories around themes because I hate it when a story's plot becomes secondary to the author's intended moral lesson (I'm in it for the story and the characters, not the preaching), if there's a recurring theme in my stories, it's "if a people can only survive by the blood of their children, do such people even deserve to survive?"

  Although what I think you mean here is Harry's normal development occured and she doesn't fall into the wall flower steriotype at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

Yes. I put in that part to preempt people from reading the "quiet and withdrawn" part and immediately accusing me of sexism for seemingly wanting to turn her into a wimp for being a girl.

Let me be perfectly clear here: I don't like female characters who only exist to be eye candy, love interests or accept being told to stand back and let the guys do the hard work because they're girls. I don't mind if they don't doubt themselves sometimes (on the contrary, self-doubt makes a character much more interesting than unbreakable confidence, regardless of gender), but I prefer my female characters strong-willed and proactive, making a lasting impression on the reader rather than being window dressing.

If you're asking me why am I not doing Harry like that, then, the answer is because I'm not that kind of person and can't put myself into such a state of mind to write such a personality in a way that doesn't come off to the reader as inconsistent and borderline schizophrenic.

  So are you doing a golden trio of Harry/Hermione/Ginny? Just Harry/Hermione? Harry/Hermione/Ron still?
#+end_quote

Harry/Hermione at first, then Harry/Hermione/Ginny, then Harry/Ginny/Neville with Hermione still being important.

I have to admit, I have precisely zero idea what to do with Ron or whether to even include him in the story. I don't dislike him, my brain is just drawing blanks at what to do with him in this story. He's nowhere near Hermione in brains and Harry's preference to avoiding danger means she has less need for brawn. Maybe make him equally as capable at coming up with ideas that don't require lexical knowledge as Hermione for ideas that do? You know, stating the simple solution rather than overthinking and overcomplicating it? Streetwise common sense to balance out Hermione's raw intelligence? Possibly more familiar with muggle thinking than in canon, due to Arthur's influence?
