  Yes. I put in that part to preempt people from reading the "quiet and withdrawn" part and immediately accusing me of sexism for seemingly wanting to turn her into a wimp for being a girl.

You had it in the pre Hogwarts section. Thus the question. I was asking if you are doing an Independent!Harry where she comes in already in kick ass mode, or the 'she develops the traits same time as canon-Harry'. Those are gonna have different implications.

If you don't have Harry imprint on him during the train (with the whole first friend thing), you can pretty easily write him out. You'll have to decide if he transfers that to someone else or you do away with it entirely.
