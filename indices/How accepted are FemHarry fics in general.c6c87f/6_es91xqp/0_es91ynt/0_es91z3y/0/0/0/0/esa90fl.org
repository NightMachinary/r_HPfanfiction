  I was asking if you are doing an Independent!Harry where she comes in already in kick ass mode, or the 'she develops the traits same time as canon-Harry'. Those are gonna have different implications.

The latter.

  If you don't have Harry imprint on him during the train (with the whole first friend thing), you can pretty easily write him out. You'll have to decide if he transfers that to someone else or you do away with it entirely.

...actually, now you've given me an idea. Stays in the background until after the CoS incident, after which when he comes to thank Harry for saving Ginny, he adds that if there's anything Harry needs him for, anything at all, he's at her disposal because his sister's life is worth more to him than just one unlimited favor. So while he's not in her immediate environment, he's available as an ally she can call upon, kinda like the DA's membership in canon. Add in her later impressing him with her flying skills during one of her visits of the Burrow and there's potential for friendly bonding over quidditch there.

How about this?
