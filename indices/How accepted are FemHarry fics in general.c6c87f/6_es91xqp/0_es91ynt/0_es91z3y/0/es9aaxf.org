  As the Potters are friends with the Longbottoms, Lily and James decide to pull off an extremely risky gambit and hide their child's gender
#+end_quote

Gonna have to make sure to explain that one. How would hiding Harry's gender help? Wouldn't making two targets just make it harder to protect?

I've seen the flip of this a few times (a bunch where Lily takes potion to ensure she births a girl, opting out of the prophecy, and one where she casts a spell so everyone magical percieves a (very male) Harry as female). Anyway, just make sure your logic is well explained, as it is not intuitive.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been relentlessly teased and bullied over her gender-mismatched name by the other kids,
#+end_quote

Given the ease of adopting a gender conforming nickname (Harrie), I would suggest making it a bit more malicious (Dursleys/Dudley frustrating any of her attempts to do so). Could just be a one liners, but fits with their characterization.

#+begin_quote
  The latter part is exacerbated even further by Petunia having been aware of James' prankster nature via hearsay from Lily, causing Harry to assume her name was an extremely bad-taste joke.
#+end_quote

This has a lot of potential

#+begin_quote
  However, she is NOT a fragile wallflower by any means just because she's a girl; she is more than capable of both asskicking and calling people out if she's pushed to it.
#+end_quote

Ok, some things to unwrap here.

First, it would be a good way to make Harry more nerdy/studious in her pre Hogwarts years, if you want.

Second, if she is capable of asskicking in that time period, that is a major character divergence, you will want to explain. (I suspect you mean later, not in primary).

Harry was not Canon capable of ass kicking at 11. If your version is, you will have to explain it. It could work (Harry's insecurities mean she spends more time on learning to protect herself, maybe petunia is more willing to let fem!Harry learn self defense. Remember that bullying of a physically superior person takes a bit of a different form (but still happens).

Although what I think you mean here is Harry's normal development occured and she doesn't fall into the wall flower steriotype at Hogwarts?

#+begin_quote
  At age 11, Harry is still androgynous enough to pass for a boy but by her mid-teens, there'd be no ambiguity anymore, even though she's still plain-looking and nothing unusual in terms of endowment.
#+end_quote

As a side note, decide early how much (if any) gender dysphoria you intend to have. Does Harry feel like she should be a boy, simply enjoys having masculine traits, or none at all and is frustrated to have to deal with this at all.

#+begin_quote
  Similar deal with Ron, as his constant blathering makes Harry initially assume that he's self-centered;
#+end_quote

Not clear here, so Harry doesn't befriend Ron on the train and attach to him as 'first friend'?

#+begin_quote
  In the end, they get saved by the timely arrival of McGonagall
#+end_quote

Having Harry not heroicly saving Hermione kinda undermines the whole 'she is as badass as normal' thing you said earlier. Does she still jump on the back of the troll? I suspect you could do both (Harry being stupidly heroic and jumping on troll, but without Ron to knock it out the fight goes on until McGonagall arrives).

If you don't have her be at least as stupidly heroic as Canon, expect people to assume it is because she is female.

#+begin_quote
  Still, Ginny is a major positive influence on Harry and they're straight-up BFFs.
#+end_quote

So are you doing a golden trio of Harry/Hermione/Ginny? Just Harry/Hermione? Harry/Hermione/Ron still?

#+begin_quote
  Harry may not be as uninvolved as he thought. Specifically, the prophecy says Neville is the only one who can do the job,
#+end_quote

Alternatively, you might want to consider that gender isn't important for the prophecy (although Dumbledore/Lily don't have to necessarily know). i.e. prophecy is more like a vision that gets translated into language by the seer, so depending on the seer there may be translation problems (like using a default him as is common in the English language).

Or you could have that be Voldemort's thinking, as for why he keeps coming after Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Except as it turns out, Neville's blood fell into the cauldron, which completes the ritual and resurrects Voldemort
#+end_quote

Aww but if you use Harry's blood you can have Voldemort revive female for shenanigans! :P

The only other suggestion I have is to consider using Tonks in a mentoring role at some point.
