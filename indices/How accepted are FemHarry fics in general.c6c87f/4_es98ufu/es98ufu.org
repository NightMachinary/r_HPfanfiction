It really depends on the writing and whether the author takes the change seriously. Being female is more than secondary sex characteristics - it's also different cultural expectations, different upbringing, psychology, puberty process, etc. The simplest and earliest difference would be the Dursley's would be less likely to be able to get away with Fem Harry wearing Dudley's castoffs without the neighbours commenting about how Petunia didn't know how to raise a 'normal' girl or being too cheap to buy her feminine clothing. Bullying from Dudley and gang would also be different.
