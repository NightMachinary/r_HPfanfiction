It isn't clear exactly what you are asking. Are you asking if Fem!Harry is taken seriously in the fandom? Or on this reddit in particular?

Just as a note, *Reddit not generally used for fic reviews:* We get them from time to time, but usually people who want direct, immediate feedback use other locations (such as the chat based options).

Everyone has different interests, Fem!Harry comes up here from time to time. There are a few items that can be common in such fics that get... frown on here. Quite rightly IMO.

For example, Pillars of Canon (where the story is just a rehash of canon) tend to be looked down upon here. That tends to hit one of the pretty common "It is the same story, but with Harry being a girl". Mostly because HP is an extremely plot-driven series, and many situations are already contrived. Thus, anything trying to stick close to canon ends up being a virtual rehash. (Compare this to character driven universes, where if you change the character even a little, it makes perfect sense you get radically different outcomes).

I wouldn't say Fem!Harry fics get any overscruntiny, although the 'common pitfalls' are different for such fics vs fanfic at large.

Are you talking about BornAGirl!Harry or GenderTransformed!Harry? Surprisingly, the first one seems to be the more common one in HP Fanfic, where in most other fanficiton you get more of the second. They have very, very different pitfalls.
