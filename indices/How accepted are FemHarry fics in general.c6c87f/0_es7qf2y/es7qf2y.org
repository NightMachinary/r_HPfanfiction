FemHarry stories are mostly seen as A Thing That Happens. Some people dislike them, but they're a minority; I think the unspoken consensus on the matter is that Harry, in fanfiction, is basically just a blank slate, and so switching the "gender" variable on that blank slate doesn't really matter if the rest of the story's good. Of course, there would also certainly be some interest for a story which actually takes femHarry as its point-of-departure and realistically builds from it, though I can't weigh quite how much.

But at any rate, you certainly won't get laughed at by default for a fem!Harry fic round these parts, if that's what you're getting at.
