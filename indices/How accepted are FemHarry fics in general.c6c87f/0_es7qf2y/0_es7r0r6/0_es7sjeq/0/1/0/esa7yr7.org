Yeah, fair enough. In defence of these stories, though, the first two are more "intense fixation on each other" than anything resembling a romantic relationship (*Art of Being Sisyphus* is about fem!Harry spending a lot of time talking to the Horcrux in her head; *When Harry Met Tom* features a fem!Harry who's totally creeped out by schoolboy!Tom's fascination with her).

And despite the description, *crawlersout* is a parental fem!Harry & Tom relationship, definitely not romantic (though he does fixate on her).

But hey, if it's not your thing, it's not your thing.
