Hmm, *Art of Being Sisyphus* has a diary!Tom show up maybe 250k words in, for the CoS arc... but by that point you're so deep into the absurdity that it doesn't really count. It's a doozy of a surrealist fic.

I totally agree with you that having an evil returned-Voldemort (at age, like, a million) come and hook up with 15-year-old fem!Harry is very creeptastic. I also personally can't stand stories where Harry just decides to forgive or worse, join up with the unrepentantly evil characters (ie Voldemort or various Death Eaters), /especially/ when that then becomes a relationship based on nothing.
