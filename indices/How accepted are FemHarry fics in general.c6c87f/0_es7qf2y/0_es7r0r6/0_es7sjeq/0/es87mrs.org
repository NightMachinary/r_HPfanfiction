A lot of them, as said above, pretty much use "Harry" as a blank slate for an OC with Harry's backstory. That said, a few excellent (very popular) ones, off the top of my head:\\
- *Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]]: linkffn(9911469);\\
- *When Harry Met Tom*, also by The Carnivorous Muffin: linkffn(12793151) - *The Pureblood Pretense*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][murkybluematter]]: linkffn(7613196);\\
- *crawlersout*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1134943/slexenskee][slexenskee]]: linkffn(10942056)

If you're into crossovers, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2221413/Tsume-Yuki][Tsume Yuki]] also does a ton of fem!Harry that you might enjoy. If you're /really/ into crossovers, you could check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5382000/nordiamus][nordiamus]]'s *Game On!* linkffn(11799646) as an example of "really just the backstory."
