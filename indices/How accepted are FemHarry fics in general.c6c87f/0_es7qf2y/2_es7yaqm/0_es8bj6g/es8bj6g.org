  What exactly can I expect from a femHarry fic?
#+end_quote

Surely that depends on the specific fic and author.

For myself, I would want Harry to have a different personality, not just anatomy. Consider how being a girl might lead her to respond differently to similar events. Would Dudley's gang respond differently to her? What about Petunia and Vernon and Marge Dursley - and would each of them react differently to each other? Would Harry have different relationships with primary school teachers? Which dormmates would she have at Hogwarts?

But each author will do their own thing.
