The difference from an OC centric fic would be simply a lot of stories still have the Dursley's raising them and them having similar upbringings and things like that. One thing in my experience you'll expect is a lot of names that give the author an excuse to have her be called Harry/Harri or Harriet or have flower names as some Evans family tradition or something.
