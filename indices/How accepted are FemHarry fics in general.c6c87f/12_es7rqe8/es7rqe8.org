It depends on how you do it. FemHarry fics that are used to give Harry a het relationship are a dime a dozen. Ones that are used a social commentary or as LGBT rep are more likely to get positive reviews. Well, the ones with heavier motives are often also more likely to be written better. I mean it's the same as any trope, there's so many cheaply written versions of it that it's easy to get annoyed when it's just another fem Harry who's genderswap is used to make Harry feminine in a stereotypical or even sexist way. It makes the good ones stick out, but not everyone's willing to try because of all the awful ones.
