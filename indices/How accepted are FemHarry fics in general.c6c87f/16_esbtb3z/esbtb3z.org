I don't read them, because I don't get the point.

For me, a character's gender is and should be just entirely irrelevant to the plot and characterisation, unless you're specifically telling a story about gender.

As a result, Fem!Harry fics are either

a) written by people who think what's between someone's legs matters

Or

b) specifically written to send some sort of gender related message, usually a hamfisted men r bad women r victims one

So they don't interest me one bit. This is made worse by the fact that the existence of magic, the great equaliser, makes any kind of significant forceful gender roles or differential treatment pointless or impossible.

That being said, if a fic was written where Fem!Harry was just a girl and it had no impact on the story's themes or plot, I'd be open to reading it. Except that in that situation, I'd ask "why gender swap in the first place?"
