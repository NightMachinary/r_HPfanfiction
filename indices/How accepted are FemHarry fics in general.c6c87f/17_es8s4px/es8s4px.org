First of all, fem!Harry stories firmly follow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's law]], eighty percent of them (or more, probably a way more) is trash. Despite what linkffn(11511190) says, I am afraid crushing majority of them are written just for purposes of smut (many guys fantasize about it from her point of view, I guess), and because the author wanted to write Drarry (or even worse, Harrymort), but they are afraid (or disgusted) to write a slash.

However, I still believe (and if linkao3(4876630) toned down a bit in the smut department, it would be pretty close) there is something in fem!Harry which could be useful (meaning, geneder-bender Harry; natural Harriet Potter is another thing, which I don't care about much at all). It can be a bit of study in feminism, in Harry's sudden recognition how world could be different and a way less pleasant when seen from the other side. “Oh shut, that's what Hermione was on about all the time? Yeah, it really sucks!” (and I don't mean just PMS).
