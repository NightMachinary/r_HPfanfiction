Yes, fem!Harrymort is probably an exception, I was more thinking about fem!Harry Ã— Draco, which I am afraid is a way too common (a piece of advice from an older man to younger: if somebody looks bad, he probably is, and dating him will end up badly; don't do it! BTW, that's JKR's opinion on Draco pairings as well).
