Sorry, not "looks" like in a physical appearance, but like a general feeling of person. If Draco Malfoy is a bad person (and he is, considering all his actions in books), then dating him is a bad idea. And yet, there are apparently plenty of girls in this world who would love to date a bad guy (because it is more exciting, or because they dream about saving him). These girls usually end up badly (abandoned is the best case scenario).
