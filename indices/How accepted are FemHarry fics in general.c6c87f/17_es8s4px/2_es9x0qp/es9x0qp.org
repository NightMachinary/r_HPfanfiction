fem!Harrymort is actually pretty rare, probably because most people who want to pair a female character with Riddle just use Hermione instead. Of the few fem!Harry/Riddle fics I've seen, only one had smut in it. Suffice to say, it's a vanishingly small subset of Riddle focused fics, and probably a vanishingly small subset of fem!Harry fics also. As such, I don't think it's relevant to judging the fem!Harry genre.
