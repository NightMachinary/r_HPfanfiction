voldemort made bellatrix his second in command, and actively got pissed off when she died, as opposed to anyone else. what fucking ego (read: sexism?) are you even seeing in the guy? i mean shit, he's at least got egalitarianism going for him or whatever in canon! dude's canonically all for gender equality. as long as you're useful and strong he don't give a shit. voldemort canonically would have no issue marking a girl if he thought she was a better fit than neville.
