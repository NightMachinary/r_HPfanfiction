yes! exactly Bellatrix was an exception because she was strong. His senior death eaters are all men. Also, how would he determine that baby potter is strong? You mean stronger than Neville magically?

Canonical proophecy refers to the baby as a boy:

"...he Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not..."

Unless you chose to Change Trelawney's prophecy for the sake of fanon, the prophecy does clearly specify the Gender.

And, my problem is that if you are making a GWL, then make a strong character out of her! (I still don't agree with GWL setting because of prophecy and Voldemort's fallacy in choosing a boy over a girl)
