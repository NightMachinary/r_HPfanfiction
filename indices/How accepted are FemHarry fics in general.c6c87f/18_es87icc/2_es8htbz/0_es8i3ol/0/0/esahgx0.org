Yes, English isn't my first language but doesn't mean I don't understand what you are saying. I was stating my points in order, to prove that , no way will voldy know girl Harry is stronger, unlike in Bellatrix's case. Now I'm asking you, why wouldn't he go after Neville or Why would he go after a girl Harry when Prophecy clearly mentions a "He" pronoun. Why would he go after the girl if he has no way of "measuring" magical strength of the babies.

In canon, he just chose Harry due to combination of factors including that he's a half blood. And when I meant by "fallacy" , I mean it.

He chose Harry, which is neither right nor wrong, he simply did it, that's why I used the word fallacy. This is especially true if Harry had been a girl. He would simply choose Neville for the same reason he chose Harry ( Choosing a male vs choosing a half-blood, aka choosing someone who Voldy relates to more). This is why I have a problem with GWL, now I'm willing to accept GWL if Voldy's also a woman.
