Maybe it's just my luck I haven't come across good fem!harry, they make Harry come across as weak! However, I once read one where Neville is the BWL (which made sense to me as I think Voldy 's ego would prevent him from marking a girl as an equal, or rather he would see Neville as an equal as opposed to seeing Harry weak), and James is the traitor secret keeper, and obviously everyone hates her, but she's just so cool, in this fic! I forgot the name of this fic, and really the only non fan service Fem!harry fic I've read to date.

I find GWL fics (I've read till now) questionable because I believe Voldemort would have marked Neville "as his equal".

I also detest Fem!Harry fic , that are written simply for the purpose of a pair off with Cedric, Draco etc.

I also believe a Girl!Harry would be brave, loyal, kind, fierce, everything her male counterpart embodies, and I don't see why Authors would write off a weak-minded Fem!Harry all of a sudden, in which she's nothing like her canon counterpart (Even if she's in a different house, I expect her to still have "Harry" in her.)
