I would recommend you start with The many deaths of Harry Potter.

One of the best takes on time travel I have seen. The Harry featured could be considered innately even weaker than Canon Harry as Canon Harry was able to perform a few spells on his first try, but this Harry; nope. This is actually used by Horcrux to manipulate him at one point.

Anyway enjoy.
