I am going to give a few stories in which either Harry isn't OP or becomes OP by working very hard.

I would recommend you give each of the story a chance and read through it.. The last one has some bashing and but don't leave it. I hate bashing and found it to be overall a really pleasant read.

This one is mostly told from Hermione's perspective. The Harry in this is messed up. He was really strong in the future, coming back he lost most of his strength but had the knowledge. It mostly focuses on character interaction which makes it better IMO. Give it a try.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
