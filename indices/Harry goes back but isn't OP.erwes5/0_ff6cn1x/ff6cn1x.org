I think it's meh/okay but it's exactly what you're asking for, so here: linkffn(4061219)

Harry and Hermione both go back in time but Harry comes back the summer before his first year while Hermione comes back one month after it started. While waiting for her, Harry (SPOILER) while he (SPOILER). So they beat Voldemort without any problems thanks to knowing the future, but they still end up having to fight another Dark Lord that's even worse because Harry fucked up.
