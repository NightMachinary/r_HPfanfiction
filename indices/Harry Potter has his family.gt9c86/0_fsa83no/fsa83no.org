The first one is a female Harry, but it's a really, *really* good fic. The second one isn't exactly a happy family, but it's still a very popular fic. The third one is a bit long-winded and it takes a while before Harry even appears. And it seems to abandoned. Not sure why I recommended it, but oh well. The next one he creates a family as the fic goes on, but it's a harem if it bothers you. It's the only decent one I've read, anyway. And the last one is a fun one shot from the same author about +Harry+ Hedwig creating a family.
