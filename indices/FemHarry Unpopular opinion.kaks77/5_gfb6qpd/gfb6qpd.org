Honestly, so long as the name makes sense, I'm not really bothered. People seem to forget that names have to be given or taken, so they have to fit what the character's carers or the character themselves would actually choose and/or find a story to make it work (how they found the name, or how they decided on it).

It's especially a thing with carers - people tend to name their kids either things they like the sound of or things they hope the kid will be. So, if you think James and Lily or Petunia and Vernon (or whomever else is raising Harry) would pick those names, or that Harry would happily take that name, then as far as I'm concerned, writers should go right ahead.
