I seriously cannot read any fics where female harry is referres as “Harry” or “Alex” for Alexandra.

Like seriously, have you ever heard someone call a girl as “Harry”???

Cant you just come up with a different name? Any damn name!

I also dislike Rose, mostly because its extremely overused and seems to be the no1 choice.

I want to read a story where i can immerse myself with the female lead, and not be reminded of Harry fcking Potter and feel that its just a transgender harry with different gender pronouns.
