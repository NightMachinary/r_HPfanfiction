Something not quite similar but within the same vein happens in linkffn(Son of Potterx Daughter of Black).

Melania (fem!Harry) is a wolf animagus, still getting used to controlling her inner animal and being able to transform. Dobby, Kreacher, and Winky all look after her while at Hogwarts, and see that Umbridge is a threat. They slowly dose her with some kind of drugs that make her more paranoid, and slightly hallucinate, so over the course of the year she sees signs of Mel's wolf animagus and thinks that she's a new breed of werewolf, eventually abandoning Hogwarts and fleeing the country in fear. At this point in the story Fudge is essentially over politically so, by extension, Umbridge is too, so she wasn't able to interfere nearly as much at Hogwarts or abuse the students like she did in canon. It's moreso played as a background gag.
