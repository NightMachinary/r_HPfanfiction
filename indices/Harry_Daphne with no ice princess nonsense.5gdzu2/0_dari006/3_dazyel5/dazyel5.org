While it fits the request perfectly, I deleted it from my library. The authors are very brusque in response to anyone who gives suggestions on their writing.

The story itself is okay, there isn't a lot of character development and the plot progression is minimal. They say that they are writing within canon boundaries, however Harry just comes across as a raging type-A personality with virtually nothing of his canon personality.

Daphne is a blank slate, the ice queen is fanon creation. They however made her into a character who is so socially inept and incompetent that I sincerely believe that if they were a real person who fall on the autism spectrum. (I have no problem with the concept and it's vastly unexplored) but they claim she is completely within the realm of canon. She's made out to be more of a muggle-lover than Arthur, comic books, converse, etc... There are absolutely no personality traits that stand out to place her in Slytherin; no cunning, no ambition, nothing... If she were in sytherin she would have been an established pariah and labeled as a blood-traitor.

The authors in their most recent chapter essentially told readers that their place was to just read the story and not to guide the author. They have changed it since uploading it.

Overall the story is supposed to be unique and fresh, but the plot falls flat and quite honestly feels like awkward self-insert wish fulfillment.
