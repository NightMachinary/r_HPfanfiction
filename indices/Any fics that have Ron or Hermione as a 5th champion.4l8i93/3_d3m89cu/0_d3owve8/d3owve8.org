Well, from a direct standpoint it makes no sense. on the other hand, it would be a substantial passive help- because it would spread the hate further. if they were from hogwarts, it wouldn't just be harry who "cheated" into the tournament. Anyone who supports, say, "ron", would also need to support harry, and the hate would be spread out too- anything they did to reduce that hate would also apply to harry's case.

Additionally, if they were also inexperienced- if, say, ginny or luna wound up in it, i could see an alliance of neccessity being a thing that happened.
