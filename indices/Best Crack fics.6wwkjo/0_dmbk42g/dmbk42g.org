Thing about crack is that first taste is free.

Then you won't be able to stop coming back for more. You'll need better, stronger stuff to fulfill that itch at the back of your head. There's only so many times you can reuse the same thing before it doesn't do anything any more.

You can try going cold turkey by crawling away, reading other fics or even getting away from fanfiction for a while. But in the end, like that psychotic crazy ex that gave you the best one night stands, you'll come crawling back.

Oh you will.
