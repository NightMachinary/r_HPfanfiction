Specific to the first book, it's hinted that Voldemort possessing other creatures tended to burn them out. The animals near his haunting spot in Albania knew to stay far away as so many would succumb to a dark creature if they ventured too close. Even as a passenger, you get the sense that Voldemort was a burden upon Quirrel.

Their quest together at Hogwarts was to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone and thereby enable Voldemort's re-embodiment, so the periodic drinking of unicorn blood was probably a stopgap to keep Quirrel alive. Thus, when Harry's protection forced Voldemort out of him, the half-life Quirrel had been living came to an abrupt, ashen end.

Of note, Voldemort continued to use Unicorn blood as I believe it was a key ingredient along with Nagini's venom in sustaining his Volde-baby body. There's some weird alchemy going on with that which probably was something he invented himself (out of necessity, as many great inventions are inspired).

Aside from that, I'd assume that using Unicorn blood as a curative would leave you dependent on it until you ran out or found a different cure for what would have otherwise destroyed you. Great for fanatics; not good for those with their eyes on living a long life.
