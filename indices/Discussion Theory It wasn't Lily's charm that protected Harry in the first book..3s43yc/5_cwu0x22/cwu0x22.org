My understanding is that Harry survived the second killing curse because the Elder Wand couldn't be used against it's true master. The killing curse hit Harry but it only destroyed the bit of Voldemort in him.

I do agree with what you mean by a half-life being only able to live in the darkness, but I think that had nearly no effect on Voldemort at all as he was barely human with a shredded soul already.
