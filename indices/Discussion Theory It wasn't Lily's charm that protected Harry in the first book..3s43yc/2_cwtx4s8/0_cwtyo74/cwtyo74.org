I also have something of a contractual view of the situation, but not involving Snape:

  The key is not that Lily died, but that she died after Voldemort gave her the choice to live, to which she said "take me instead". She made the active and free choice to offer her life to Voldemort in exchange for Harry, and Voldemort implicitly accepted it by killing her.

  This is why it was so crucial for Harry not to fight Voldemort in the forest in DH. If he had resisted Voldemort in any way, it would not have been Harry freely accepting the deal Voldemort offered to Hogwarts: give me Harry and none of you will be harmed. Harry took Voldemort up on the offer, sacrificed his life freely in exchange for the inhabitants of Hogwarts, and therefore the people at Hogwarts were protected from Voldemort's magic (even though Harry didn't stay dead).

  So... it wasn't love, it was contract law XD
