I always was fan of the theory that voldemort unknowingly entered a binding magical contract with snape when snape pleaded for him to spare lily. He agreed, a contract (similar to a magic oath, maybe formed through careless wording + intention ) was created and Voldemort broke it.

He asked Lily to step aside (showing that he actually intended to fulfill his promise to snape), but when she refused he didn't care enough to stun her, instead he killed her, breaking the terms of the contract in the process.

The punishment for breaking a magical contract more often than not is the loss of magical power, death or something else specified in the contract.

Now either Voldemort died the moment he killed Lily, but was able to fire the killing curse at harry (maybe one of the horcruxes was already at work keeping him alive), splitting off a tiny fraction of the soulpiece which was currently working on filling his body again (thus making the remaining piece too small to save his body, forcing one part back into the horcrux it came from, and the other into the nearest being with his magical residue, which was harry with the curse scar). Or his magic was leaving him, making the AK so powerless, that it didn't manage to kill Harry (exhausting Voldemort to death), or some other part of the contract was fulfilled (e.g. Lily gets recognized as part of the contract, she says 'kill me, spare him', Voldemoet kills her, her sentence becomes the punishment-clause, leaving him unable to kill harry).

I like this theory, because it gets rid of this 'the sacrifice of a mother is special', because it's not. Actually, I think it would be a fairly common thing, which would leave hundreds of orphans AK-protected.
