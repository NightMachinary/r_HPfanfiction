  I like this theory, because it gets rid of this 'the sacrifice of a mother is special', because it's not. Actually, I think it would be a fairly common thing, which would leave hundreds of orphans AK-protected.

I see what you're saying but really, how many people do you think are running around trying to kill babies while leaving their family members unharmed/offering to spare them? The wizarding population is pretty small in the first place, therefore the percentage that are murderers is going to be even smaller, and murderers who are willing to leave witnesses has got to be minuscule.

Can you think of many real-life occurrences where people have occasion to heroically die for one another? I'm sure a lot of us would be willing, but the opportunity just doesn't come up that often. Even in a war-time situation where a parent might perfectly well jump in front of a child and say "Kill me instead!" a normal soldier would be planning to kill the whole family anyway if they were killing the kids, so that wouldn't activate this protection.

So I'm willing to believe it's an extremely rare protection like in the books. Canon also doesn't state that it's unique to a mother, I imagine it would activate for anyone willing to step up and die for a loved one.

I've also always thought that when JKR had Dumbledore speak of Lily's sacrifice as "an ancient magic" she was referencing the Narnia books- specifically when Aslan speaks of "Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time". That is also sacrificial magic. And of course Narnia is an allegory for Christian myth, and look how the series ended up with Harry's sacrifice. So it's always made sense to me that willing sacrifice equals protection.
