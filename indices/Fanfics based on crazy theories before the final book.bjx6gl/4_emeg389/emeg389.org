I've always believed that the prophecy meant that Harry will become Immortal. Since only LV may kill him and thus be forever be barred from eternal rest. This also increased the tension that if LV kills him LV will truly be Immortal.

Where the person who wishes for immortality dies and the one who only wishes to reunite with his family doesn't.
