I normally hate linking obvious websites in a snarky manner, but it truly seems you have never come across the awesomeness that is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DarkLordPotter's Fanfiction Reviews]]. /Every/ story in anything other than the Almost Recommended subforum is extremely well-curated, and undoubtedly the largest collection of the best darkish, smart/ambitious Harry you'll find.
