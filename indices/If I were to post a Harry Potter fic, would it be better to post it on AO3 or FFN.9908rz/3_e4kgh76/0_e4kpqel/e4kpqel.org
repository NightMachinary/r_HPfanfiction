I've experienced the same, and I suspect that a lot of the people commenting on "more detailed AO3 reviews" may not actually be authors or have any experience with people commenting on their stories. There's also often a perception that a smaller/more specialized community is better for feedback.

There are some things that Ao3 does well, like replying to comments. There are some things it does poorly, like tags. And there are some quirks that are due to the readership base and the kind of stories they're looking for.
