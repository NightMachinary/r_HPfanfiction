I agree that you should post to both but I also want to mention that I have had the complete opposite experience from what most people are saying. On ao3 I get short, one word or phrase comments, while on FFN I get literal paragraphs of well-thought out critiques/opinions/predictions etc

It may be just that I've been on FFN longer and have somewhat of a reader base but I'm actually just completely surprised that ao3 reviewers are usually more detailed according to reddit when that hasn't been my experience at all.
