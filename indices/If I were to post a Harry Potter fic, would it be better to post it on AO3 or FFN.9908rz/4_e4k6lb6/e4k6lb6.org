Both have their pros and cons, but I'd like you to check out a small, growing community called HPFanfictalk.com and it's archive for stories, archive.hpfanfictalk.com. They're a great community that was created in the after math of the HPFF drama and closure. Everyone is super nice, all amazing stories with multiple fandoms (but typically the common thread is HP) and original fiction as well.
