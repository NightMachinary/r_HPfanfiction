For HP fics? [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] seems to be more popular.

Some authors have complained relatively recently that FFN has some problems with email notifications for feedback. The other downside is that the quality of comments seems to be lower. A03 has ways to control the comment section and control via restrictions on who can comment and if the comment shows up at all (great for controlling abusive comments). Also the kudos system for sending general "likes" instead of mixing with potential constructive feedback is a nice change. I mainly use A03 so I haven't messed with those options (if they exist) on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]].

But there is little downside from crossposting to both [[https://A03.org][A03.org]] and [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]
