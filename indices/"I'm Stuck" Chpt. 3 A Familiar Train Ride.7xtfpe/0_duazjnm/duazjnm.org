I posted chapters one and two a few weeks ago and got some really good feed back. I spent more time on this chapter and did my best not to rush it. Hopefully, there is a marked difference.

On a side note, I am looking for a Beta for this story. This is my first HP Fanfic and I'm nervous to join the ranks of those who have come before. Thanks for any feed back and I hope you enjoy it. :)
