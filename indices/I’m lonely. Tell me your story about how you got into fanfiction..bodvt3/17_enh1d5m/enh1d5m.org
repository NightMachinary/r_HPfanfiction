Weird, I cant really remember. It was like 15 years ago and the reason why I started using reddit. Nowadays my standards are higher and I cant find as much stuff to read anymore but there are still a few ongoing fics i follow. I never really got into non HP fanfic and dont even like Rowlings work that much.
