I discovered nifty.org (very NSFW) as a teen on the recommendation of an acquaintance - it's basically original gay stories. Many of them are porn and badly written, but I was there for the stories which normalised gay relationships, having grown up more gay than straight in a very repressive household. These were literally some of the first stories I read that involved gay characters at all, let alone in a positive manner. A year or so later I was at TAFE (similar to community college) and a classmate was reading fan fiction in class (she ended up failing the semester lol). I was curious and she told me what it was. She was reading Kingdom of Hearts slash fanfic which I'd never played so I wasn't really interested in the fandom but the concept of slash fanfiction was like a revelation. I could read about my favourite characters in positive gay relationships! I was sold. I looked for Harry Potter fanfic first and I still love that fandom. My classmate was happy to help me navigate past the badly spelt and poorly plotted stuff right to the good stuff. That was 12 years ago and I never looked back.
