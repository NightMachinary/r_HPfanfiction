When I was 10 we got our first home computer and the internet. I didn't really know what to do with it besides play games, but I figured out how to look things up online and found a site with people talking about Harry Potter. So I went around there a lot, talking about theories and easter eggs. Eventually the discussions of what might happen morphed into stories.
