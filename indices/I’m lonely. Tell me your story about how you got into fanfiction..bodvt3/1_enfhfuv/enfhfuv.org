I was 12 when OOTP came out and couldn't wait to read what happened next. So I wrote my own sixth-year story, “Harry Potter and the Green Flamed Torch” (remember those rumors that this was going to be the name for book 6??). Anyways. It was pretty terrible. There was another Yule Ball, Harry continued dating Cho...

Shortly after starting that, I stumbled across MNFF and started reading stories there. Then branched out to other sites. I eventually started writing again, they were still terrible (Keep in mind I would've been 13-14 at this point) but much better than my first. I wrote two novel length stories and a handful of one shots in the span of a couple of years.

In middle school, I went on to be a mod at SIYE for a bit, and worked as a graphics designer on TDA (HPFF sister's site which made all of the banners for story summaries). I was a self taught graphics “designer” with a bootlegged copy of photoshop lol.

By high school I was getting into a slump. I was still reading lots of stories but had a very hard time completing my own stories. I had multiple ones that I started, completely planned out, and couldn't finish. Major writers block. So I kind of stepped away from it for a bit.

A couple of years after I graduated high school I started writing one story that I had had the idea for for a long time. It took me 8 years (during which time I went to university and got my degree in Nursing) but I did finish it!! I haven't posted it online anywhere but I'm very proud of it and continue tweaking it every so often. I would eventually like to write multiple stories revolving around my OC so we'll see how that pans out.

A nice relaxing night to me is honestly sitting at home alone, a warm drink in hand, reading and writing fan fiction. My husband knows about it but when he goes out for the evening I love cuddling up on the couch with my laptop and start typing away.
