I was actually writing fanfiction before I knew what it was; it was all incredibly bad self-insert stuff, until eventually I got into role-playing Erin Hunter's /Warriors/ series online with friends in elementary school. Looking back, that boosted my writing ability by leaps and bounds. I actually forget how I discovered fanfiction written by other people in the first place - but I do remember one of the very first ones I found that I really liked was a very old Dramione, linkffn(The Cure for Crupulus)
