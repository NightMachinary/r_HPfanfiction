I started reading manga and watching anime in 1991, and when the Internet started in my country in the mid-90s, looking up anime and manga led to stumbling upon fanfiction. Started to browse through my favourite fandoms, joined the Fanfiction Mailing List, and I've been reading fanfiction off and on since then. I started writing in 2014 after finding one too many "Marriage Law" stories where the same people who just defeated Voldemort and his army meekly let the new Ministry force them to marry strangers.
