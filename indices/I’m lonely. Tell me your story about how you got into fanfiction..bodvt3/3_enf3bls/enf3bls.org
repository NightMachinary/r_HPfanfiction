Someone on the main site recommended linkffn(Not From Others) as a Canon compliant Ginny POV story. Absolutely loved the story and just got drawn into fanfiction from that! Continued mostly with Canon compliant stories like linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Halfblood Prince). Then went through a Robst phase unfortunately. From there got into slight AUs. Then went through a crack fix phase. Now I'm solidly in a dimension/time travel phase.
