I remember my first fic, but not the name of it. Only some vague plot points. It was about Harry going to Durmstrang, meeting a creepy boy who wanted to dedicate his life to Necromancy. Much, /much/ later in the story Harry finds out he's some sort of reincarnation of a Dark angel of evilness and falls in love with his Light counterpart. It was a slash story. Horribly cliched but if it's your first fic it all seems so original and fresh!

That was way back in 2010. How I even found the story in the first place is a mystery for me, I think I clicked a link on a forum somewhere that took me to the story directly. After that I made my account on FF.net and never looked back.
