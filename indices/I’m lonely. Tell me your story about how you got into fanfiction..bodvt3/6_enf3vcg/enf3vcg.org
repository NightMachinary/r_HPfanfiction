For fanfiction itself, I used to watch this show back in the day that only aired once every few weeks and I got tired of waiting so I started looking online for stuff about it and found fanfiction. (Best day ever.)

For Harry Potter, I loved the books and as soon as I finished one I'd read fics to finish what was left out of the story. Different interpretations. Never imagined how much I was going to love this fandom.
