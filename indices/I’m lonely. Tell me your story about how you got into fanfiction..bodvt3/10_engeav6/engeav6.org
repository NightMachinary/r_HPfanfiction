I've known about the existence of fanfictions pretty much since I was a kid but I never really started reading them. When I was about 12 I read a fic about Total Drama Island but that was all. This year (I'm 21) I decided to start reading fluffy fanfictions to quit watching hardcore porn. Now I'm in a transition phase between the two. Reading romantic stuff about HP characters is something I've never experienced before. Now I feel that I'm becoming an adult as I'm getting more interested in this kind of stuff. That's about it.
