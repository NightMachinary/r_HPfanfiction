I heard about fanfiction years ago. It always seemed to be Star Trek stuff about Kirk and Spock getting off together and rather coloured the whole genre for me.

It wasn't until years later when I was trapped on TV Tropes for some reason and stumbled across the HP Fanfiction list. I had no idea people were still doing fanfics at all, let alone of HP so I read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

As the first piece of HPFF I read it seemed incredible: I had no idea people could actually do this - fitting their own stories into the existing narrative framework. I'd assumed it was all like the Star Trek stuff, where the monster-of-the-week style of that series meant people could just write whatever stuff they wanted.

I read a /lot/ of stuff that year - 2013. My standards were a lot lower simply because I didn't know what was available. I've done a bit of pruning since then but even so my favourites list has 41 stories from 2013 and only 56 since then.

For me the turning point was when I read Letters by [[/u/Te7]] - and this isn't me just winding him up for once, it really was the first story of his I read. With hindsight even that one isn't great but it led me on to Vitam Paramus, which definitely is.

And that's where I am now. It takes excellent, original stories to get me going. [[/u/Te7]], [[/u/Starfox5]], [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] and maybe one or two others.
