My 50 y/o mom actually got me started. She reads a ton of Pride and Prejudice ffn, and I was really intrigued by the fact that she seemed to have endless reading material right at her fingertips. In an attempt to enable my well-hidden HP obsession, she encouraged me to take a look to see what was out there. I've never looked back. I think some of the first fics I read were Dramione stories, but since then I've planted myself firmly in the Harry/Hermione camp (with a few minor dalliances). After that it was a short hop, skip, and jump to writing my own stories.
