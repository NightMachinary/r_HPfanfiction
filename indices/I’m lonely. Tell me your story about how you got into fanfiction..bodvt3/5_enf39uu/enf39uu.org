Mine's a tad convoluted. There was this webcomic I read (Which I found from another webcomic which I found from Deviantart). Someone on the forums uploaded a gallery of edits of the comic, one of which was tagged as an HPMOR gag (in this case, they took the opening note Harry found about The Game), and I was bored enough to be looking through the forum, so I looked up HPMOR.

Now, I was an arrogant almost-adult, and ate that shit up. I look back on MoR with a more critical eye now, but I still think the story has redeeming points.

Anyways, from there, I looked at the TVTropes page for the work, and then when I looked at one of the trope pages, I saw Oh God Not Again listed as an example, and, well, it was all downhill from there.

I was an idle fanfiction reader until recently, when a friend recommended DP&SW to me, which I read after MUCH convincing. Fun fact: I have an addictive personality and reading stories gives me a rush. After finishing that fic, I needed a fix. And thus, my life was ruined.
