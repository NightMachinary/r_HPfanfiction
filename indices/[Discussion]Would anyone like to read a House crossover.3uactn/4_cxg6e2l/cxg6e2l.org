Okay, thanks for all of your input, guys! Actually, now I'm thinking of writing a fic in the same vein as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4427065/1/Strange-Bedfellows][Strange Bedfellows]] where a HP character on the run stumbles into the Muggle world and struggles to assimilate, finding new friends and a new place in life. In this case, I'm using Snape because he's my favourite character, and the clash of personalities with House will be very interesting to write. So the focus will be very much on the House universe and not really about HP. I guess that Snape will find a job in the hospital or something. Of course, House will do some digging on his own, and sooner or later confront magic.
