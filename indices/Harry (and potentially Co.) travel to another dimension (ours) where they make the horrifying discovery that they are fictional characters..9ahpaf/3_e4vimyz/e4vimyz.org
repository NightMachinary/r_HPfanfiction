It's an interesting concept, but it's very very difficult to do well. The only one I've read and liked ( linkffn(The Wonderful World of Fanfiction) ) is basically a Q&A fic for all stories written by The Carnivorous Muffin, so it isn't actually something you'd read to read. I mentioned it because it actually does pull off the characters finding out they're fictional and written by someone in the way that those characters would react to it, and funnily enough, also realise that that reaction was written by the author too.

There is linkffn(The Substitute) which deals with something a little bit in a similar vein, so check that one out.
