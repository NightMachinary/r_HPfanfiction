Star Trek deals with that in a few episodes? Have you seen those?

  guess how that turned out.

depends. Can they get out of their VR environment? Are there artificial bodies? Is their mind even separable/distinct from the AI running the simulation as a whole? Being able to create or destroy sapient&conscient beings on a whim is a huge ethical can of worms anyway. I'd expect such a story to entirely derail into those kind of sci-fi discussions quickly - not exactly HP anymore.
