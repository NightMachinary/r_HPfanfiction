There's a universe where everyone is a fictional character. Actually there's an infinite number where we're fictional characters. There's an infinite number of universes where your life, as it has been up to this point, is the best selling novel of all time. There's literally an infinite number of universes for every possible, or impossible, scenario. Them being fictional characters in another universe doesn't make them fictional in their own, or in the infinite number of universes where there are other versions of themselves.
