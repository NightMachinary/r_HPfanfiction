Argh I remember one where something Harry does causes Dumbledore to realize he is being lazy and suddenly we have competent Dumbledore who lures Voldemort to a spot and punishes him by trapping him in stone, in constant pain so its harder to escape so Harry has time to deal with Horcruxes. As he dies he hands a crown of power over to Harry that allows him to contact Merlin's council, so Harry has a bunch of wise advisors to help with his new role. There's more but that should be enough for someone to recognize it.
