[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by jeconias]] comes to mind. Harry is at Beauxbatons for a bit but not a huge amount of time. I expect you're familiar with this one, though.

linkffn(Vanishing Illusions). Harry is a Durmstrang student at Hogwarts for the TWT. Does not spend really any time at Durmstrang though. Also abandoned.

A Very Long Engagement by Bioplague. You must have access to DLP's WbA Forum, I believe. It features a Beauxbatons Harry, yet there are only two chapters if memory serves. What little of it there is, is good. It is abandoned as well.
