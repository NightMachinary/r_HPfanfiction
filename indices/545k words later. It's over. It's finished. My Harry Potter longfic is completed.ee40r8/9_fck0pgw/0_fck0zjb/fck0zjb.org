I'm happy to hear that you love it so much! :)\\
Back when I started writing this, I had a few readers who pointed out how much they loved the fact that the chapters were all roughly 2k long, as it was the perfect size for a chapter while they were commuting to work. If you really want to finish reading it, try reading a single chapter a day (during commute if you have it). That way you can easily make it to the end without losing track. :D
