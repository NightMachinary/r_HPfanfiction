I'm on chapter 84.

This is phenomenal so far.

I love your characterization! Lily usually comes off as a flat character, but I really like your Lily. She's kind but not weak or useless. She's sassy and she has a backbone.

Dumbledore is also excellent. He's a very solid Dumbledore. The best version of Dumbledore, imo. He's not evil or manipulative, and I like that. He also doesn't always have all the answers, and I appreciate that too.

I really like the touch with Snape's mother being deaf, and Snape's mother in general.

Thanks for writing this, and thanks even more for bringing it to my attention! I'm going to try to finish it, but I've a terrible track record with finishing long fics like this.
