Yes, It is certainly partly Snape's fault that the friendship became so strained, but, that still doesn't excuse what Lily did, she turned on her best friend without having all of the details, in canon it does state that Tobias Snape (Snape's father) was a man that hated magic, that place would be Snape's home for a while, he was never really friends with anyone in his house, just acquaintances, Lily would always be his best friend, and he never left her even when his housemates surely expressed their displeasure (as i'm sure Lily's did as well).

Yes, Snape has absolutely no right to call Lily that, however, 5 years of verbal abuse at home (maybe physical) and 5 years of verbal abuse and sometimes physical abuse at Hogwarts, including the shrieking shack incident, he snapped. There's many psychological points that I could go into, how the verbal abuse at home affected Snape as a child, as Tobias Snape was Snape's first impression of Muggles growing up, and he was not a good impression, he grew up in a rundown neighborhood, no one there was a good role model, and then he met petunia (do I even need to say anything about this?).

Surely Lily could have made more of an effort to talk to Snape, she was still his best friend, if she talked to him, and kept going (but not to far) to get the truth out of him, then their friendship could have stayed around a little longer.

It is just as much Lily's fault as Snape's.
