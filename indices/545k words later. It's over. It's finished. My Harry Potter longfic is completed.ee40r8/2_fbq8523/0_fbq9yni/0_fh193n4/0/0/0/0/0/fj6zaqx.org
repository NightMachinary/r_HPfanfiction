Didn't Snape meet Lily first? Then Petunia came and told her something about not being supposed to hang around freaks or poor people or something.

Lily does have a damn bad temper and that ensured that Snape saying that to her face would be like destroying any remnants of a friendship with a nuclear bomb to her.

I do agree that if she didn't have a nasty temper she should have and I think would have talked to Snape about it, why he called her that and what it'd mean and whether or not he actually meant it.

In the end I think Snape wouldn't have been able to cope with Lily, his best and only friend and his worst enemy getting married and would either have supported Lily as long as she was happy or gone to the dark lord.

Honestly I still stand by my decision. And I still can't possibly see how Lily could have been the most hated person for you, she literally sacrificed herself for her child to live, how is that bad behaviour.

I hope I didn't forget any points.
