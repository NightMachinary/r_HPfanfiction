In my mind I feel as though she was equally at fault for Lily and Snape's friendship falling apart. She could have done so much more when she saw how her best friend was being bullied, sure, she yelled at James Potter to stop, but she herself saw that it wasn't working, so why not go to the headmaster? Slughorn maybe.
