The damsel in distress trope makes me want to vomit so I did everything I could to avoid that. She's a Gryffindor after all ;) The main line in the story also doesn't revolve around their relationship, but rather about Severus taking over Harry's position in the fight against Voldemort. Their relationship has a very natural and 'unforced' progression throughout the story (as I've been told by readers.) Their relationship is very meaningful, but they don't stick to each other like horny adolescent leeches.

There is no bashing on any characters involved whatsoever (I find character bashing to be very lame, and I don't hate James or the Marauders in general). The Marauders hold a prominent role in the story and eventually cooperate with Severus against the rise of the Dark Lord.

There is a Horcrux hunt but it's done very differently. Also, there's an entirely new prophecy. Severus is not a Horcrux himself, after all. So things had to be done differently.

Here's an overview on how I tagged the story on OA3:

  Extra:\\
  - English is not my native language and therefore it is almost inevitable that you'll sometimes encounter a word or a sentence structure written in a silly way. I try my best to avoid them and have other people read them before I put any chapters up. Keep in mind that even Rowling, who had a whole professional team of linguistic nerds behind her, still ended up with errors in her published work.

Hope that clears it up a bit! :)
