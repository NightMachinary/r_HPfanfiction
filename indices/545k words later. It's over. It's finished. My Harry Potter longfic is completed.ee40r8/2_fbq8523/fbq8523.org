Congratulations too!

It seems that it's a time travel Sev/Lily. I have a few questions first before committing to read this long epic:

- How is Lily depicted? Is she more of a damsel in distress type or someone who contributes meaningfully alongside Severus?
- Is James bashed?
- Is Dumbledore bashed?
- Is there a standard Horcrux Hunt, or do you decide to introduce some new elements here?

Thx
