Thank you so much for that!\\
I kept the chapters short on purpose. When the first readers started to come in they told me that they appreciated the short size of it because of their commute to work. Also, I awarded myself with a cigarette every time I completed a chapter, so I totally get it. :')

I'm currently speedrunning a beta process through it to make the necessary corrections. I'm looking forward to your review!
