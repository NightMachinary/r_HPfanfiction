Just wanted to throw my support in for this story. I'm only on chapter 31, but so far it's been marvelous. I love it. I'd absolutely recommend this fanfic to anybody. Fun fact, the chapters are super short, which is perfect. I can usually read 1 chapter per cigarette break while im at work, which is freaking perfect.

Kudos to you on completing such a long story. You can't even tell that English is not your native language. I'm pretty damn enthralled with this story, and can't wait to see where it goes. I didn't even want to take the time out of reading it to write this, but my desire to encourage you outweighed my reluctance to stop reading.

I'll try to remember to update this with a full review, once I do finish it.
