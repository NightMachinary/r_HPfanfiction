Dumbledore's patronus is a Phoenix. Meaning that if he were to be an Animagus, his Animagus form would most probably be a phoenix as well. Dumbledore wasn't a known Animagus though, but since he is the former Transfiguration teacher...who knows. :)

What exactly would make Harry a Ravenclaw? What is it about the Ravenclaw traits that would put him there? How would that affect his friendship with Ron and Hermione? Since you seem very keen on the elemental thing, to what extend are you familiar with Avatar? Do you think you could draw some inspiration from the original series?

Wizards already have a longer lifespan than the average human, and they can Apparate once they come of age. To what extend would a Phoenix help other than the ability to travel within the boundaries of Hogwarts?

Considering the fact that you don't know the ending yet because you haven't decided on a pairing, is it ultimately a romance story? To what extend does the romance support the story?

I personally prefer not to stray away too far from the original story. Hence why I would rather have Harry keep his stag patronus. Rowling is a christian after all, and many elements in her story are deeply biblical. The stag is no exception to that. Have you thought about the symbolism?
