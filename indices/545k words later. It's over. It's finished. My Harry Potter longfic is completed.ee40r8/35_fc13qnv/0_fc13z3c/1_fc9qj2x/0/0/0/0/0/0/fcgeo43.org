I don't think it has ever been confirmed that patronus form=animagus form but I really don't care that much. It would add some interest to Dumbledores character wouldn't it? I'm pretty sure Dumbledore probably did become an animagus as he was a transfiguration master after all, but I don't think that is confirmed

Idk much about Dumbledore because I haven't watched /any/ of the fantastic beasts series sadly.

I'm wondering about how to make Harry a Ravenclaw and thus far I have got one good idea on how I could do it and that I'd make Harry hide in the library from Dudley and his gang,

'and so Harry decided to do something worthwhile in the library.'

That would maybe spark a thirst for knowledge in Harry so then he would probably be in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin

Many people forget that Slytherin's are supposed to be very intelligent/smart/knowledgeable too and it is only how they use that knowledge that separates the two houses mostly.

I speculate the wizard/witch lifespan to be about 150 - 180 years with lucky guys making it to 200 so a phoenix animagus could maybe become 220 or something that is around that age, unless of course they die of another cause.

Also Harry's phoenix form could help him go through all anti apparition wards which could prove useful.

The romance is not the main point of the fic and it would only open up a few avenues for Harry in the fic, but the reason I can't make the ending clear yet is because I want to do a bit of a similar ending to your fic and linkffn(harry potter and the lightning scar) basically harry gets married and gets a few kids and then they get a lot of grand kids and then Harry dies a peaceful death and has changed the world a bit.

I prefer to change the original story a bit, sometimes a lot like for example I hate Hinny with a passion and would love to see it burn to be non-existant

I would change Harry's patronus depending on his personality so that it matches him well

No I haven't thought much about the symbolism but now that you point it out it does seem kind of obvious.
