Be careful with the 1st year thing by the way. I've seen many potentially great stories left unfinished because the main character ended up in the 1st year (time travel or otherwise). Stories start to drag really fast if they have to make it through every single year. Writers often forget that it's much easier to start the first chapter right in the middle of a scene. Readers are much more easily drawn into it and any required explanations can always be secundary.
