The power of elements would be nice if it were related to the Houses. If Harry is still a Gryffindor in this story, I'd make his element fire. (Hufflepuff earth, Slytherin water and Ravenclaw air). What's Harry's reason for disappearing? An animagus is magical by default. What would be different about this type of magic? Or is it the creature itself that would be magical? Dumbledore's animagus is a Phoenix. I suppose we won't learn more about that until the new Fantastic Beasts movies come out. Would that make Harry related to the Dumbledores somehow? How is it relevant that Trelawney is Israeli? If it is relevant, how would that influence her stance on warfare in the wizarding world in relation to the war in Israel and Palastine?

I have one major piece of advice that I would give any writer (especially longfic writers) once they start they start writing their journey. Do you know how you want the story to end? Keeping the end in mind is of vital importance if you don't want to lose sight of the continuation of the story. There are way too many incredible writers out there who have never finished writing their longfic for the simple reason that they have lost track of where the story was initially going to take them. Long stories always end up writing themselves after a while. As a writer, all you can do is steer the course that it's taking in order to reach the ending you had in mind. I wrote the last two chapters of my longfic long before I finished writing the other chapters for exactly this reason. The second major piece of advice is, scrap everything redundant. There are plenty of elements in the story I just finished that may have distracted the course of the main plot a little too much. (You write, you learn.) Fanfiction has the annoying tendency to take a little too much pride in word count, and not enough in the quality of the stories. Don't fuss too much about word count. There are always bigger fish in the sea. Third by not least, write an outline. Some rare writers are complete pantsers that can glide their way through a story without as much as a character reference sheet, but they are unicorns among men. I used an actual calendar where I marked down when and what needed to happen. It also allowed me to look up historical references (as my stories is set in the 70s, it allowed me to do a lot of fun research).

Hope that helps! :)
