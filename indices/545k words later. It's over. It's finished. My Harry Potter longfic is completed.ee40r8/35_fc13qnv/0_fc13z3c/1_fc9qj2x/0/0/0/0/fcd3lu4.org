Wait Dumbledore's animagus is a Phoenix??????????????? I always thought that magical animagus forms were like either impossible or like near impossible

It's not needed that Trelawney would be Israeli as it was more of an example and the main point would just be that she is a good sniper with a sniper in a window propped up on a tea mug and this is mainly just a sideplot that could be a bit humorous in the final battle. I know I cracked up when I first heard of the idea that Trelawney was a secret sniper

Harry would maybe be a Ravenclaw in my story so then the element of air, still a phoenix is possible as is a dragon and a thunderbird.. but now it opens to a few more.

I would go with Harry's element being fire too but lightning and water would fit Harry pretty well too (lightning bolt scar) but if I did link the houses to elements then it would become a bit stupid because like come on there's no way I'm giving someone the power of more elements than one because it would be too op. That would happen because if i totally linked the houses then that would happen as everyone is a bit of atleast two houses if not all of the houses.

But fire and lightning are good too so I'm still unsure about it. I don't want to take lightning and water because of linkffn(saviour of magic;harry potter and the lightning lord) fics, they both have Harry saved from the dursleys by a thunderbird and Harry becomes a magical golden eagle (i think) and btw they're great fics you should read if you haven't. BUT what animagus form would you give to Harry?

If I wrote a dragon then it would definitely be Smaug sized instead of those teeny tiny dragons that Rowling made

If a Phoenix then it would be just that, a Phoenix. Would probably give Harry a longer life span and can flash anywhere (only in phoenix form though) or should I have it so that he can flash anywhere in his human form too just so he could annoy Hermione endlessly about being able to appear into Hogwarts from outside of it's wards.

I don't really have an ending made up yet because I don't know what pairing I'm going with, at first I thought it would be Haphne but now I'm starting to wonder about Harmony and Harry/Luna and Harry/Fleur too

Idk how I'd make them other than the train ride of first year would work for a starting point for Haphne and Harmony pairings and maybe even Harry/Luna if I changed the timeline a bit with Luna being the same age as Harry...

Now I have more pro tips from writers

1. You can/should have a ”hook” somewhere at the start of a fic so that the reader starts questioning why something happened and thus are interested, I'd do this every time a new thing appears that could need that

------------------------------------------------------

1. You need to know what you're going towards at the end because it's easier to visualize the whole thing if you already know where you're going.

2. Write an outline so that it's easier to do what you had planned, no one has a perfect mind

3. Quality over quantity is a great way to start a fanfic

Did I get those right?

Darn this was a long reply
