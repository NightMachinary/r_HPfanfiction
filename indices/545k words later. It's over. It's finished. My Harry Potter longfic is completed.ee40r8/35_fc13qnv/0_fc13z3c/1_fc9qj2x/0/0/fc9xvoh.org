Ok so I first need to make a compilation of all my ideas into one but basically

Harry is storm born aka has the power of an element (or more) (could become a magical animagus of that element) and that happens because Harry disappeared for a while and then they find him at a forest fire site (control of fire, phoenix or dragon animagus possible) or somewhere that just had a violent thunderstorm (lightning and water control, thunderbird animagus possible)

That is the basic premise

Also Trelawney is a secret Israeli sniper and in the battle of Hogwarts is dropping de's from her tower with her trusty rifle propped up on a tea pot (that's how I envisioned it) though it is not my idea but I have permission to run with the idea.

There were some other small things but basically a kind of OP!Harry but just a slight op and is a magical animagus

I'll answer to another comment on the other stuff if you're interested
