Whoa, that's insane. Gives me a bit more appreciation (already had a lot) to everyone who writes these long fanfics. It's basically all I read, stories at atleast 300k+, and I still haven't run out of stuff to read yet even though i started reading fanfics 15+ years ago. I'm definitely going to check your story out! Good job!
