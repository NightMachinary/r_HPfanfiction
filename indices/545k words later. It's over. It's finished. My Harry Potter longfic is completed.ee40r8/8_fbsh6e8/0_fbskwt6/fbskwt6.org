From the 5 years that it took for me to finish this, 2,5 of those years were spent being on a hiatus and having major writer's block. It is super hard to stay in a constant flow of writing, so I totally get where you're coming from.\\
The only tip I can give you as to outline your story as much as possible and to KNOW what the ending of your story is going to be. Knowing how it ends will help your writing (even subconsciously) to flow towards that ending. :)
