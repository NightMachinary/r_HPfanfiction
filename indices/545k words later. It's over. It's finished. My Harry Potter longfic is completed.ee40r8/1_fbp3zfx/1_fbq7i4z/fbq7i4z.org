I think you really could give it a try. I generally abhor Snape-centric stories for their shameless adoration of somebody whom I consider to be absolutely horrible person, but this story is really better. Severus here owns his faults and really goes through redemption. It is a bit long (as 80%+ of all fanfic stories), but otherwise it is really good.
