Thank you! In my final author's note on chapter 248 I acknowledge the fact that I'm not that proud of the first twenty chapters or so. The beginning of the story is a bit trivial to me, but I've been told by readers that they started to love the story more and more as the story progressed (and I hope they're right!)
