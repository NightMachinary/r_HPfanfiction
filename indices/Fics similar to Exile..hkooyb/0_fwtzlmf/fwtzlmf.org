Draco Malfoy experienced a similar, albeit shorter stint into the Muggle world in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855). That part is hilarious to say the least. Unfortunately, the pairing is Harry/Bellatrix, although it's a time travel and deals with a pre Death Eater Bellatrix.
