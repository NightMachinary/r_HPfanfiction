Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

When Voldemort was defeated in 1981, the death eater movement didn't fall apart. Instead, Lucius Malfoy took over and quickly installed himself as dictator of Britain.

The Weasleys, Harry, Dumbledore and most of the other good guys spent the last 20 years or so in France in exile. Now it's time to return to Britain and take their country back.
