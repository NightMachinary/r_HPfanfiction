I actually do this with everything I read regardless of quality. I have aphantasia so I never really picture anything in my head. As such, detailed descriptions are pretty worthless to me and I skim through them. I'm particularly bad with character descriptions. I actually made it through 3 books in a series before realizing/recalling that one of the MCs was African American because it wasn't relevant to the plot until then and I kept skipping all the description.

Maybe because it's fanfiction you don't really need the description. We already know what a good chunk of the characters look like and we know what most of the major locations look. A paragraph on what the potions classroom looks like doesn't really add anything and at this point it's hard to describe it in a new way without sounding strange.
