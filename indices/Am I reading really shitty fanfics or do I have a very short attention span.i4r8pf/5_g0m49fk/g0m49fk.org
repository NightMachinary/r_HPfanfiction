I think people already mentioned the main reasons why fanfics are less interesting than books. I'll just add that, in the case of Harry Potter, this fandom has more than 10 years, a fresh story became a rare treat, and it most of the time, it feels like I always read the same 10 stories with only a slightly different wording.
