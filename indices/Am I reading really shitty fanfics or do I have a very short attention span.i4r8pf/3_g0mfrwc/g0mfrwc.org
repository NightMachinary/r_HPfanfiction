One of the most advanced and late game reading skill you can acquire is to skim a paragraph and get most of the meaning. This DRASTICALLY reduces reading time, when I first started reading Fanfic, I used to take like 3 days to finish a 100k word fics. Now, in the span of 3 days I can read a 300k fic. Maybe I just spend a lot more time in a day reading it now, but I think it's mostly because I skim over useless stuff.

This is a double edged sword, though. There may be a chance that you missed something important bc the paragraph started out really boring.
