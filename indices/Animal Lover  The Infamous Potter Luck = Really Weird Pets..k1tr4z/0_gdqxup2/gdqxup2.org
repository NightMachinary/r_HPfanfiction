Harry hatches a Basilisk while at the Dursleys, and it uses its gaze on Vernon to help Harry run away to Mrs. Figg.\\
In response, it's arranged that Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family, and gets a primer on raising dangerous magical creatures.\\
He starts a little menagerie of snakes later on, including a Horned Serpent.

It's my favourite "Harry hatches a Basilisk" story simply because it's one of the few that stays light-hearted and doesn't bash anyone.
