linkffn(Seven Smple Years), and it's companion (well, I just really think they work well together) linkffn(Harmony). Most stories by this author are also canon compliant, I just ahven't read much of it, so I can't vouch for them.

There's linkffn(Ginny Weasley and Half-Blood Prince) for GInny's view of the sixth year, and linkffn(Not From Others) for her view of the seventh.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's eye soul's reflection]] it's not canon compliant, simply because it was written before we learned about Luna's father and house. It's still a very good story, though.
