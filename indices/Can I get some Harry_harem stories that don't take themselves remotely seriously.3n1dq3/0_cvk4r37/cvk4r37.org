- linkffn(Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You by SmallBurnyThing) is one that doesn't and is deliberately over the top pileup of tropes and fanon.

- I recall reading a fic named linkffn(Harry's Harem) a long time ago and finding it amusing. Though, for the life of me, I can't remember if it was intentionally silly or whether I just found it funny how over-the-top it was in every way. Nor do I remember the author.
