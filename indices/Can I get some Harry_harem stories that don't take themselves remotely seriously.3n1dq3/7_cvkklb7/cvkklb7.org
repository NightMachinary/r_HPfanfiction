Well if you don't mind Crossovers then Megamatt09 is probably gonna fit the bill. His stories are fun and the arcs are pretty good IMO. A few unappealing aspects in his stories but give them a try.

My favourite was probably the "Beyond the Veil series"

His FF.net profile contains the non-explicit versions and his HPff archive profile contains the explicit versions.
