Thank you for the sum up. That's just the sort of thing I needed, so now I can see how I need to write her as a teenager. Insecure, probably a little shy or maybe just introverted, always trying to prove herself and be everything to everyone in her life while falling sadly short in (almost) all endeavors. I can see her cultivating some of her 'otherworldly' persona but not be completely wrapped up in it yet, and already making false predictions--or sometimes not so false--she's bound to get something right eventually. Maybe even declaring fervently that Divination is her favorite subject when it really isn't, just because of who she's related to.

Once again, thank you.
