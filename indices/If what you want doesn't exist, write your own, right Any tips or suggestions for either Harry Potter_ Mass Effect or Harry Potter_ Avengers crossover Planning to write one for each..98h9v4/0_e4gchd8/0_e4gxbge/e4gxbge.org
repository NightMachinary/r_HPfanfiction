It sounds like you have stories that you want to write, which is pretty cool. Personally, those types of stories are that one I don't have much interest in anymore. The Avengers/ Harry Potter crossover archive has enough stories where Harry is super power/ super veteran/ etc.

As far as Harry's spellset goes, he has more options than you would think!

Below are the different spells Harry would have learned from his first two years at Hogwarts (there are some repeats; at least one spell is taught across all three books).

The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1

- Wand-Lighting Charm

- Softening Charm

- Severing Charm

- Fire-Making Spell

- Unlocking Charm

*Levitation Charm

- Locking Spell

- Mending Charm

The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection

*Curse of the Bogies

*Green Sparks

*Red Sparks

*Knockback Jinx

*Smokescreen Spell

*Wand-Lighting Charm

*Wand-Extinguishing Charm

The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2

*Wand-Lighting Charm

*Severing Charm

*Disarming Charm

*Skurge Charm

*Avifors

*Dancing Feet Spell

*Engorgement Charm

*Fire-Making Charm

*Freezing Charm

*General Counter-Spell

*Memory Charm

*Tickling Charm

*Unlocking Charm

*Arresto Momentum

Now, not all the spells are relevant or would see any use in day-to-day life or combat. But I would say that Avifors could very well be his ace spell, as it turns the target into a bird--or flock of birds. Personally, I think a wizard's home is not on the battlefield, but developing and applying utility spells that could help logistics and stuff.

Edit: Sorry bout the formatting. I can't fix it...
