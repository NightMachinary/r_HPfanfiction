A possible Avengers Idea how about,- Harry being a 21-29 year old Auror, he's has basically become the Harry that everyone usually treats him ass during the Voldemort War. He's badass a leader spells and tricks out the wazoo. He's already done a stint with the ICW as a International Auror and is on track to be a Auror captain and eventually head of the DMLE. but one day Harry best called into Kingsley's office and joins Kingsley In a meeting with important people on both sides of the divide mostly military personnel. Harry is asked to join a program and become a agent of MI6 to act as a guard against supernatural threats that have been targeting Muggles recently, Vampires, Werewolves, Demons and Giant Monsters ect. And to assist in his efforts he is to become Britain's very own Super Soldier 'Union Jack' empowered by rituals and powerful rare potions Harry takes on insane odds.- this gives you a direct plug into both the untapped parts of the Marvel Universe since no one uses the Horror comics as a bridge between the two universes, and the normal things, I mean the US could contact their British friends in hopes of using their Monster Slayer to slay a monster in the US, or maybe Shield being employed by the UN and the World Security Council pushes To induct the British Monster Hunter into the Avengers

On the one you have, it's interesting but it feels like all the Kid Harry gets raised by XYZ stories that are around alot, I mean how many plots can a highly limited 13 year old get intangled with? In combat he has literally nothing, he can make some smoke and some small fireworks like explosions and that's it, maybe the bind spells and flipendo at the most. Even walking X Men joke Jubilee and her 'Fireworks' still can make those fireworks blow through a solid steel door.

It could be more interesting if he gets banished to the Marvel Universe by Voldemort while Harry is all tied up in the Graveyard, Voldemort unwillingly to try and fight Harry knowing it has never gone well for him uses a spell to spin him off into a parallel world, at 14-15 and after the Triwizard Harry can be treated both as a kid who is in over his head and as a threat if you give him some more impressive violent spells and assigning his knowledge of them to his training for the TWT.

General Avengers thoughts, use the Comics, and ideas from them especially for Harry's adventures. The worst thing you can do is make him into the MCU's Rick Jones. Who's Rick Jones? Well he's most notably the Guy that Bruce Banner saves from the Gamma Bomb that created the Hulk in the Comics, Rick then goes on to be the uninteresting generic side kick of the Hulk and then eventually the Avengers that Young readers were supposed to identify with, he often has to be saved was called Bucky by Captain America while Bucky was still officially dead but did no badass Bucky things and all around was boring as fuck. Don't be afraid to send Harry off on his own adventures while other characters are having their own adventures, imagine how lame you would see The Hulk if during the Fight with Blonski Iron Man shows up to save him, that would make you never be impressed with the Hulk and thus see him as a weakling. The same applies to Harry if we never see him succeed by himself against major threats. But how can he find a major threat and take it out if there all accounted for and beaten by the main players? Make some of your own or harvest them from the source material. Tony is dealing Ivan Vanko, well Harry is off investigating a Cult of people obsessed with the Snake God Set, and has to stop them before they break open a gateway and allow him Dominion on Earth, or Captain America is dealing with the Winter Solider, then Harry has gone to South America where he can feel powerful Magic being preformed only to see a Giant Monster burst forth and Harry has to kill it before it reaches a city and kills people. How about Thor is dealing with the Dark Elves and Harry afterwards has to deal with something the Dark Elves released, the Executioners Axe, which like super Horcux takes over the holders body and mind replacing it with the Executioner's which is a being on par with Thor himself and Harry takes it upon himself to stop the monster separate the innocent person from the power of the Axe and destroy it without falling Prey to it himself. All three Scenarios I've offered there all involve ideas from the Comics, all make Harry out to be a hard ass on par with the other Avengers and all allow for Harry to Grow up without being a Tag along kid or a useless burden. Hell all three could and do relate to the 3 main Avengers, Serpent Society is tied to Cap, the Giant Monster was gonna be Fin Fang Foom the Giant Dragon is tied to Iron Man and The Executioner and his Axe are tied to Thor. These Adventures away from everyone else would make your Harry his own character not only on the Marvel Universe but also in the Harry Verse, he wouldn't just be Bland Ole Harry, he's a interesting badass who won his own fights. Plus you could give him his own Love interest without scrapping around for people his age for him to date
