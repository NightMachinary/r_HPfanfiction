Yeah, that's something that frustrates me, as well, about a lot of the ME fanfiction. I really, really hate it when the "new character" (canon character from different series, SI, OC, whatever) just steals or uses someone's lines, too.

I have some ideas of what Voldemort accomplished from still having a horcrux to keep himself alive. However, I'm still torn between what to pick. Like, he could be a Shadow Broker, or he could be a monarch on a planet hidden by magic. Or he could be waging wars again other magical races. There's a lot of options.

I think a lot of Avenger stories is about what kind of story is unfolding in addition to the Avengers movie, which is can sometimes be neat. But writers do it too often, I sometimes feel. But there's quite a few enjoyable crossovers, although my favorite is still "Ink Stains". If you haven't read it, I suggest reading it! I linked someone else to the story in this same thread.
