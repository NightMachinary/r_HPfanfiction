Oh! The different Marvel "Universes" (e.g. the MCU, Earth-616 where all the main stuff happens, the Ultimates Universe) all have a "designation" of Earth followed by a number. 62442 spells out magic on alphanumeric keypads, which is why it's the passcode for the Ministry's phone booth guest entrance. If you branch out far enough in scope to need a designation, I thought it'd be a cool one to use. Sorry for any confusion I might have caused!
