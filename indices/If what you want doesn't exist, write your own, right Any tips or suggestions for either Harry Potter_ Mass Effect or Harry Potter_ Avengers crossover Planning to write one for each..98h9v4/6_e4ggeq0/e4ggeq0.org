With Mass Effect, if you can try to avoid the "Stations of Canon" of the ME universe. 90% of the crossovers I've seen just follow the events from the game religiously, which is frustrating. If you wish to /undermine/ the original storyline, then by all means pretend to go that way at first, but the universe is really wide and it makes a lot of the stories feel the same just sticking to those few things.

The horcrux idea is cool. What happened to Voldemort Prime? Would he still be a wraith somewhere? Or maybe he decided to take a quieter route to power and is now the Shadow Broker? Would the Prime and the Horcrux be allies or enemies? Does being trapped in an object have a negative effect on the soul, or are they in stasis for all that time?

Avengers is a lot wider since there are so many character plot paths you can follow, so less of them feel "the same". I'm not sure I've seen 11yr old dimension travel to Marvel before, so it'd be cool to see it done!
