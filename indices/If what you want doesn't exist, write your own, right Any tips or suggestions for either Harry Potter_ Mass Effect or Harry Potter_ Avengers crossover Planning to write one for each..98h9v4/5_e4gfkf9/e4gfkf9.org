I'd love to see a young Harry being taken in by Dr. Strange and learning Kamar-Taj style magic with a sling ring- Perhaps he has to be convinced by the Avengers to do so.

One possibility, he needs instruction after he starts to lose control of his magic due to the stress of finding himself in a new dimension, and there's nobody else who can teach him.
