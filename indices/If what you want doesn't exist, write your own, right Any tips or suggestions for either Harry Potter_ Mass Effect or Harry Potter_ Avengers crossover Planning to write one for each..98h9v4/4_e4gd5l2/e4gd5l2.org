Mass Effect crossovers where FemShep is thrown through time and space together with Liara and Tali and they end up at Privet Drive roughly two hours after Dumbledore dumped Harry there. While looking around, Jane finds a baby on the doormat and brings it back for hypothermia treatment while Tali is working her own branch of magic and repairing the shuttle/spacecraft. They end up adopting Harry ( technically kidnapping) and create a company which introduces all kinds of future technology, making Jane an better version of Elon Musk. And no one has qualms about messing up the timeline since they were getting bend over by the Reapers and needed the extra edge.

They set up a hidden base at the Prothean archives and are surprised when an owl shows up there a decade later, bringing Harry's Hogwarts letter. He ends up telling everyone that he was raised by two aliens on Mars and all magical children are like "sounds like something Harry Potter would do".
