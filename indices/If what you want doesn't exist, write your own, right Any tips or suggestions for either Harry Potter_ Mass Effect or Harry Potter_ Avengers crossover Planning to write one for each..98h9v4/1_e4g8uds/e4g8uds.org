Interesting idea for the Avengers crossover. I would like to see a Harry limited to only first or second year spells, actually. As for some actual tips... I suppose that would be don't include X-Men unless you're willing to get your brains fucked by some seriously messed up timelines. I'm writing an Avengers crossover myself and I personally do not want to touch the X-Men universe with a ten-foot pole. Another thing would probably be to work out a timeline for the canon events of MCU, especially if you're starting early on like during the Incredible Hulk movie or something. It'll help work out where your plot fits in and how to pace your story so that it complements the MCU universe. There's a pretty detailed timeline available on the MCU wiki page, but you'll have to sift through a lot of the TV series stuff too.

Can't really comment much on Mass Effect as I don't really play the game - I only heard about it through fanfiction actually.
