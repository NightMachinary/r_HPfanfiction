Mass effect, keep magic and biotics separate. They are different, have different rules and uses. You risk offending both fans by smashing them together and compromising both. Biotics are very, very limited compared to magic, there is absolutely no reason that wizards would have given up the greater flexibility of magic for biotics. There is no way for them to be the same without damaging what has been built. You risk losing any immersion if you start out with things that don't make sense.

Mass Effect was great. The games were fun, but we all know about the ending. The Reapers were too strong, it made sense for them to be but it also meant that a deus ex machina was needed to beat them. The reapers have to be strong else they would have been stopped before. The first two games are about building unity in the galaxy only for you to realise that it doesn't matter, the Reapers are too strong. Think carefully about if you'd be better off focusing on the first conflict war. Beating the Reapers should be almost impossible, is the way we see the only way? If you can't think of another way then you risk being slaved to canon. What is the point of adding magic to the Mass Effect universe if it changes nothing?

Tom Riddle being behind Cerberus is an interesting idea. His diary potentially trying to indoctrinate the Reapers. Are Cerberus that different to the Death Eaters? Would Voldemort rise above muggles vs wizards if it became humans vs aliens? Or would he just be fighting for magic still?
