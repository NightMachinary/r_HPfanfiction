Honestly, probably a combination of two things: first, Tonks is likable. Secondly, she's a shape-shifter.

People get all fetish-fueled up by the shape-shifting thing, and then the fact that she's friendly and likable just makes it easier for them to go "oh, we can hook Harry up with her" or whatever.
