  To that end you drew a comparison with Ginny against background characters who only contribute to the plot in infrequent (but occasionally significant) ways. Tonks doesn't even attend Hogwarts anymore, making that an unfair contrast. Luna is in Ravenclaw. Another dodgy example. Neville is the only other Gryffindor - and hence someone more likely to be interacted with on a regular basis by the three main characters - and he has a higher mention count.

....yes, and? In most instances, the more interactions a character has with the main characters, the more we know about them and the more quirks it adds to their characters. Neville got more mentions in OoTP than Ginny or Luna or Tonks, and indeed got more added to his character than any of them. I don't see the issue here, and in no way does it does it invalidate this:

  Your post attempted to force a conclusion regarding the number of mentions a character receives and the ease in which their 'quirks' come to the fore. To that end you drew a comparison with Ginny against background characters who only contribute to the plot in infrequent (but occasionally significant) ways.

Number of mentions might not be a perfect way to measure the personality of a character, but it is by far the most objective method that gives any handle on the matter. It also invalidates obviously false statements, like Tonks having more of a character than Ginny, or Ginny barely being present in OoTP, which were statements made by others that I was aiming to refute.

  My post pointed out that character mentions don't merit much consideration, given that H/G happens despite their being more instances of Stupefy than Ginny's name. [Hyperbole but you get the point.]

An obvious case of apples and oranges. Do I really have to point this out?

  I believe that compared to the rest of the characters in the series, Ginny's personality traits are given insufficient exposition.

That depends on what you mean by 'rest of the characters'. Compared to the main cast of the Trio or Dumbledore or Snape or Sirius? Sure, and that's the way it should be. Given that Ginny isn't a main character, and is more comparable in her role in the series to other secondary characters like Luna or the Twins, I can comfortably say her characterization is fine. The number of mentions of the characters seems to support me here.
