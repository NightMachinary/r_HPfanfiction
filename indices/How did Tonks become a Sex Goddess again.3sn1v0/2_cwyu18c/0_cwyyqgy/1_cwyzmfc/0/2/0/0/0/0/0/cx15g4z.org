  false statements, like Tonks having more of a character than Ginny, or Ginny barely being present in OoTP

Okay, but I've never argued for the former and made my views on the latter known [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3sn1v0/how_did_tonks_become_a_sex_goddess_again/cx0fdn1][here]]. I know you're not trying to strawman me, so I'll just say again that in contrast to DZCreeper's original post I understand that Ginny played *a* role in OOtP. I think where we differ (and are unlikely to find any common ground) is in the subjective scale of that role. I don't find it as noteworthy as you do, but we can just agree to disagree on that point.

  Number of mentions [...] is by far the most objective method

Eh, it still feels like an attempt to quantify a character. I understand what you're saying, though (and correct me if I'm wrong): the more often a character is mentioned, the more likely it is that we as readers will gain insights into their motivations and values system. It's a persuasive argument, I don't think you can throw out the qualitative aspect. Ginny's mentions don't do enough to demonstrate her own unique character, which I'll admit is purely subjective.

#+begin_quote
  That depends on what you mean by 'rest of the characters'.
#+end_quote

A good point. I should have qualified my meaning to say that I don't believe Ginny's personality traits do enough to explain how other characters in the series react to her.
