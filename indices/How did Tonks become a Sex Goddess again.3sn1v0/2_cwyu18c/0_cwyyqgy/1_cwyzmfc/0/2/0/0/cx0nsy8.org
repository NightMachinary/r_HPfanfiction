  Because the Ginny Weasley I remember from the books was mentioned in OoTP 230 times (compared to Tonks's 102 times, Luna's 155 and Neville's 275), and if that doesn't give you any of Ginny's character quirks and leads you to ask 'Who is Ginny again?', the blame definitely lies in you and not the books.
