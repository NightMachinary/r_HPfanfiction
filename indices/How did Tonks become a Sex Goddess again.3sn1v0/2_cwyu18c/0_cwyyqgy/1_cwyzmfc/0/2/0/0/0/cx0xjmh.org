Your post attempted to force a conclusion regarding the number of mentions a character receives and the ease in which their 'quirks' come to the fore. To that end you drew a comparison with Ginny against background characters who only contribute to the plot in infrequent (but occasionally significant) ways. Tonks doesn't even attend Hogwarts anymore, making that an unfair contrast. Luna is in Ravenclaw. Another dodgy example. Neville is the only other Gryffindor - and hence someone more likely to be interacted with on a regular basis by the three main characters - and he has a higher mention count.

My post pointed out that character mentions don't merit much consideration, given that H/G happens despite there being more instances of Stupefy than Ginny's name. [Hyperbole but you get the point.]

You've resorted to personal attacks a few times:

  the blame definitely lies in you and not the books.

and

  I get the feeling that arguing with you would be as useful as shouting at the wall.

I hope you aren't taking this too seriously. This is a friendly subreddit. Both [[/u/DZCreeper]] and I believe that compared to the rest of the characters in the series, Ginny's personality traits are given insufficient exposition. You're welcome to feel differently, but please don't resort to childish antics. Reddit would be a really boring place if everyone agreed about everything.
