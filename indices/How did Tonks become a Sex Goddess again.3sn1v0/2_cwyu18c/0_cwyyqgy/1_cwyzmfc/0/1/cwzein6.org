She starts off with a fangirl crush on Harry, vents to Diary!Riddle, gets possessed. Her vulnerability and affection for Harry were exploited. She becomes more outgoing, a good Quidditch player, dates, is talented and combative (Bat-Bogey hex). Goes with Neville to the Yule Ball even though she could have later went w/ Harry. Cares about Luna, an outcast. Book 6 Harry's chest monster wants to fuck her, they get together, you know the rest.

Not directed at you, but I've always wondered why people at say, DLP, loathe Ginny. She's hot, skilled and fierce. Every shallow thing people look for to pair someone with Harry.
