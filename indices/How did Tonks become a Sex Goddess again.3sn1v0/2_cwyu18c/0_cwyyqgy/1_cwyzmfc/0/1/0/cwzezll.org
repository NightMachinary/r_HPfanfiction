Your point about her vulnerability and affection for Harry is a bit misleading. She was already being possessed thanks to the natural vulnerability of an 11 year old girl, her crush on Harry was just a topic that she naturally talked about.

I don't see how she could have gone with Harry to the ball, that was never brought up. If I recall correctly it was Cho -> Parvati.

I agree with your conclusions about her personality type but I feel it's a shame that most of that comes from how well Bonnie Wright managed to portray Ginny with how little material she had to work with. It feels like both she and Harry were just paired off for the sake of closing the matter.
