Mhm that's what I meant, I was more listing what she wrote. Riddle fed on her 'soul', so, her feelings and I imagine her crush on Harry was a not insignificant part of that.

  “Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I'll just ---”

  “I can't,” said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. “I'm going with --- with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought ... well ... I'm not going to be able to go otherwise, I'm not in fourth year.” She looked extremely miserable. “I think I'll go and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.

And I disagree. I think movie!Ginny had less fire than book!Ginny. She awkwardly tied his shoe laces. And I don't see how it's unrealistic, he was attracted to her, she has a cool personality, she was attracted to him, they got together.
