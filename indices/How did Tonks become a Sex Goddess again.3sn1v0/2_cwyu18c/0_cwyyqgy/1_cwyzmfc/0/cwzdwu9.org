Did we watch or read the same series? The underdeveloped nature of Ginny's character is, in my opinion, one of the worst flaws of the Harry Potter universe.

Book 1 - She exists.

Book 2 - Childhood crush. Next appearance is the end of the year during which she is possessed and saved. No further interaction.

Book 3 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 4 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 5 - Who is Ginny again?

Book 6 - Well I suppose hooking up with my best friends sister is a good side hobby to go with the pressure of saving the world. She supports me about an edited textbook.

Book 7 - Pining over short term girlfriend to distract from shit luck and living conditions. No interaction until successfully killing self is completed. 19 years later, married with 3 kids.

Maybe I wouldn't prefer Harry/Hermione if Ginny had a couple paragraphs of personality development.
