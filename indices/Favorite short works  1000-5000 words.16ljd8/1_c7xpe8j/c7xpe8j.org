[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]] - (7000 words) James/Lily, very down-to-earth take on their relationship during the war.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295307][Friendship for Dummies]] - bit of cracky fun with Terry Boot and co.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315682][Serenity Hill]] - switches between adult Charlie Weasley dragon keeping and childhood Charlie listening to a bedtime story; really charming.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317236][Unmasked]] - (500 words) a moment with Harry after the war, which I thought made great use of limited words.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=289998][It's Only Love]] - Cormac/Lavender, Post-War. I love minor characters, and I think this does a great job of exploring two characters that weren't the most beloved in a way that doesn't compromise their canon characterization.
