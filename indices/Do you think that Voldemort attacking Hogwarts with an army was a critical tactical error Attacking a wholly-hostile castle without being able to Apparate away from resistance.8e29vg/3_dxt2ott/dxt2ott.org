I think in Voldemort's mind, he was at the height of his power. He had no reason to think he was not capable of capturing Hogwarts and taking out anyone who stood in his way.

Hogwarts is fortified to an extent, however Voldemort himself took down the shield easily. And its defenders where you mentioned the students. There are only a handful of-age students. How many 6th or 7th years do you think there are considering the book implies that Slytherins were not included? Especially, since the Carrow siblings would not properly teach them how to defend themselves and cursed most of them all year long. The DA could only teach people with what they learned from Harry only from a single year, knowledge of several years of inconsistent defense teachers, and from books. They could only learn so much self taught without experienced witches or wizards teaching them. Also, realistically, not all of them could produce a Patronous charm under pressure. They are not all Harry Potter. Not to mention, people would be dying right next to them and very few would find the strength to recall a happy enough memory to produce that charm in those conditions. You also mentioned inexperienced imperius witches and wizards in Voldemort's army, the students are inexperienced in full out combat as well. Plus, many of them could barely fight against *adult* witches and wizards when they are barely adults themselves. Even with the help from the Order and professors, they are not yet full fledged fighters.

Also you mentioned Apparation. If we are basing off the movie, the Death Eaters obviously could Apparatus on the school's ground after what Voldemort did. [[https://youtu.be/OJH2VSfQvYM]]

Finally, I don't really think anyone was psych up after Voldemort announced his presence. I could practically feel the fear in the air. All of them knew not everyone is going to make it. It was just adrenaline and tension building up as well as the determination to defend Hogwarts. However, I will agree that there was a sense of rebellion and anticipation to fight too.
