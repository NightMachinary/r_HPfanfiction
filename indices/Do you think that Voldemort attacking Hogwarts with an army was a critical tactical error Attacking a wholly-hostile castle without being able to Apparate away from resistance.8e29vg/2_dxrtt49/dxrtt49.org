I think that from the start his ideas weren't tactically sound, he was nuts though- I subscribe to the theory that each horcrux he made degraded his mind somehow- there has to be some reason why every dark wizard like the Black family wasn't doing it- though Mrs Black's portrait having control over the curtains and it's nigh indestructibility - presumably they tried destroying the thing, has me thinking it might be a Horcrux.

The first mistake Tom made- other than the Hocrux thing, was throwing away his life for artifacts he didn't even use beyond stuffing his soul in them. He could have gone into politics and probably taken over in short order with their ineptitude and his prehocrux intelligence. Edit: and parading around that he was a founder's Heir.

Hell, his whole goal is kind of dumb as well, it's like if Hitler had been a Jew, I mean honestly.

But going to the castle had to be done- he had to get his hocrux or at least try- after all think about it, that's a piece of his soul, his secret of immortality, one of only two (as far as he knew) remaining! He had to try to save it for his own sake, and barring that, he had to put down the one that could defeat him, who kept getting away and would after he destroyed part of Voldemorts soul would go back into hiding.

But bringing along his familiar was beyond dumb.
