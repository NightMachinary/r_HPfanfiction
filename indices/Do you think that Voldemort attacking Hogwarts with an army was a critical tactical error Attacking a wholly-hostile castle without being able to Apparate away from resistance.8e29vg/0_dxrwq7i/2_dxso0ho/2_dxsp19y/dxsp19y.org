  Ah, i must Thank you, because you delivered an explanation to one of the most annyoing things mentioned in the Books. So i can cut this from my list about the "annoying 'Deus Ex Machina' things, that happened or mentioned in the Series, but werent explained". Now this explains that, BUT i still am annoyed and angered. It seems like Rowling did Harry make into a God-like Person.

For starters, it's pretty obvious that Harry is supposed to be a Jesus type figure. I don't think JK was intending to convert us or anything, but she was very deliberately using Christian lore and symbology throughout all the book. In one interview, she mentions she never bothered to make a point to the public that she was Christian when Harry Potter was being accused of being the devils work, because she was worried it would give away Harry's temporary demise and sacrifice. Whether you like writing decision or not, it was almost certainly a deliberate intentional choice to frame harry as Jesus, sacrificing himself so others could live.

And as for Dumbledore talking about 'ancient magic,' I'm pretty sure he was talking about love (the driving force behind the sacrifice, and why it works in the first place), not some deliberate studied magical art that Lily researches and put into place to protect her son. Dumbledore meant ancient magic in the sense that love is ancient, is as old as life or whatever, and that this ancient magic of love is what protected Harry against voldemort. Feel free to make your own headcanon as to how Lily actually accomplished protecting Harry, but in JKs canon world it was just pure love that did it, nothing else.
