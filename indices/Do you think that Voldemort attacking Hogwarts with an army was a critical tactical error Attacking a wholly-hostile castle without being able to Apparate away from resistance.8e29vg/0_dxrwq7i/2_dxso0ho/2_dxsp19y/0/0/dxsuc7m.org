All I'm saying is that we are shown throughout the books that harry never in any way attempts to research any rituals for love magic, but in book 7, he manages to pull off the same magic that lily did the night she died, despite not being shown any evidence of him even being aware that there was a specific ritual that Lily did to save him. There is a direct comparison between what Lily did and what Harry did, intending to show the audience that they were the same magic. So if Harry and Lily both did the exact same magic to protect the people they love, and Harry could not possibly have done it through any form of ritual, therefore Lily did not use any form of ritual either.

“You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---”

“But you did not!”

“--- I meant to, and that's what did it. *I've done what my mother did*. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”

As you can see here, it is stated in canonical text, that what Harry did in book 7 is the same as what his mother did. Harry did not use a ritual, ergo, his mother did not use a ritual. So the ancient magic Dumbledore speaks of can not possibly be a ritual that must be studied.
