Your absolutely right that Lily's sacrifice isn't special, and there were probably tons of other mothers who did the same but their baby died, but there is direct textual that there was no sacrifice ritual. If that means that all those other mothers just didn't love there children enough, then that's what it means.

But something you should also take into account - James died, and no protection was cast upon Harry. James was willing to die for Harry, just like Lily. But the reason it didn't work is because James wasn't given a choice. It is the fact that Voldemort stopped, and gave lily a choice, to stand aside and let him kill Harry, and she would be spared, and lily said no, please kill her instead of harry, that made the sacrifice work. It was also a magical sacrifice, and by all accounts the magical population is rather small, so if the cause of death was, say, a gun, it wouldn't have worked. And lastly, the reason Harry was so famous, was primarily because it was voldemort that 'died.' the only reason so many people knew that he survived the killing curse was because voldemort was a terrorist whose news and circumstances death would have spread faster than a blink of an eye. If it had just been some random magical crack addict trying to steal a broomstick instead of lord voldemort, and somebody did the sacrificial magic, and the crack addicts spell on the recipient of the magical protection rebounded and they died, I don't think anyone would believe that story had they heard it. The killing curse was entirely unprotectable, is what everyone believed. Somebody telling a story about how it rebounded off of them would make them a laughing stock. So there very well could have been isolated incidents involving magical crack addict thieves and magical domestic abusers where the sacrifical magic was done, but nobody believed the survivors tale, with the story getting lost to history.

So given that the sacrificer has to be given the choice to live but refuse to step aside, both the attacker, sacrificer, and presumably sacrificee have to be magical, and the attacker would have to be enough of a known threat that their death would be big enough news that people would be more willing to believe the seemingly impossible, it's no wonder that there's no historical known precedent of someone surviving the killing curse via sacrifical magic.
