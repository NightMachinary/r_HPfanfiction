Except it it is flat out stated that there was no ritual used. If the implications of that are that all other mother's sacrifices were loveless, then those would be the implications. Because in the Harry Potter canon, as written by J. K. Rowling, there is no ritual used when Lily sacrificed herself. What you are saying directly contradicts that. You are claiming that Lily used a ritual. J. K. Rowling wrote otherwise. If what you say is true, then you are claiming that J. K. Rowling, who /wrote the book/, is wrong about the book that /she wrote./
