i dont claim that Rowling was wrong. Im just telling, that the feature about Lilys sacrifice wasnt so special anymore, IF you consider, that other Mothers did the same but nothing happened. SO, if we assume, that others sacrifice themselfs but nothing happened, i think, we can assume that Lily used a Ritual (as i said before: i would buy it without a doubt, that she studied the (old) magic....probably like Snape studied Potions)
