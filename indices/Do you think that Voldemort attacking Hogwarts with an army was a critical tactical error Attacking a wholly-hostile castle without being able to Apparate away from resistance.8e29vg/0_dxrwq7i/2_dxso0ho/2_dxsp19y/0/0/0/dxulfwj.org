Yes...and how many victims sacrificed themselfs to protect their loves ones far from the Point Voldy killed Lily? We dont know it, but it has to be numerous. The point that this performances is so underlined makes it even more ridiculous. As i mentioned Before: the other Victims were purely heartless, because they died in a "wrong way". Imagining that Lily did indeed performed a Ritual and use her death to seal it, makes this "Plothole" more plausible.
