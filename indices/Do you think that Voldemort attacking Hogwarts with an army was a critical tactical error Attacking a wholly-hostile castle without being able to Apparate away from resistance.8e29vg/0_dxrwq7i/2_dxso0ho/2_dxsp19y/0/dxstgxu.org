Excuse me, but i like to believe, that for "ancient (Powerful) magic" a ritual is needed. I mean, If it just "the magic of love" that is this ancient magic, then it is no Ritual, that brings Voldemort to his old Body, but pure Hatred for the Life(s) and Harry...aside from that, that its really a ritual and no sacrifice.
