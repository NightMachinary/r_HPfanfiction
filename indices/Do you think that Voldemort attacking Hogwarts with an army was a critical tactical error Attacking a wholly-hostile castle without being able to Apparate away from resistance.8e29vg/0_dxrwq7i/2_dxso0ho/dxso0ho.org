> â€œ--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. *Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?* You can't torture them. You can't touch them.

> each of which would have probably killed their targets but for Harry's sacrificial magic. Without that sacrificial magic in place, Voldemort probably could have killed Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley in the space of seconds.

Voldemort's true mistake was granting everyone in Hogwarts' an impenetrable protective Charm against his magic by accepting Harry's sacrifice in exchange for the lives of those in the castle, just as Lily had done for Harry.

Ah, i must Thank you, because you delivered an explanation to one of the most annyoing things mentioned in the Books. So i can cut this from my list about the "annoying 'Deus Ex Machina' things, that happened or mentioned in the Series, but werent explained". Now this explains that, BUT i still am annoyed and angered. It seems like Rowling did Harry make into a God-like Person.

1. Voldemort (and i think Dumbledore too) mentioned that Lily used "ancient Magic". So i would without a doubt believe that Lily, as a smart Witch (the Hermione counterpart, i would tell, but with Beauty and self-confidence) has read or studied about old Magic and was even capable about performing them (or atleast she thought so. as we can see, it worked). She knew, what must be done to perform this. I doubt (or rather, i refuse to believe) that simply sacrifice yourself to protect a person you love is the trigger, because THIS is one of the Main Logic holes in the series: Its like Lily Potter was the only Person brave enough to sacrifice herself, to protect a loved Person and all the other did nothing to do something like this. SO, she must have performed some sort of Wandless magic (or performed a Ritual, just in Case and her death would only seal the deal). That Harry was "through a 'trade'" capable of doing this sort of magic.....im sorry, but i have the biggest doubts. His School grades were average (i think his mother, would have been better grades), PLUS: Harry didnt studied ancient magic. The fact that his mothers Protection was now also enhanced to protect all his beloved, because HE thought it was because of his sacrifice or "trade", is just purely ridiculous. And i think this was something not mentioned or explained enough by Harry himself (even if so, he claimed it was HIS doing, not his mothers). The Magical World of HP seems to be a lot about Bonding by some Persons actions: as Harry spared Wormtail, it did Practically Nothing (Dumbles only mentioned, that a special Bond is forged if such thing happens). The result was that Wormtail was killed by Voldemorts "spawn", because the Silver Hand acted like Voldy would. but this "special" bond had actually nothing to do with it. Harry could have said anything that would serve his purpose. But i guess it was Wormtails hesitation that openend the Spawns eyes. And now this, Harry sacrificed himself to protect the others...another Bond was forged. Jesus, so if you want to kill someone, you have to make sure that this Person didnt make an arrangement in His/her past. AH, but hey, Sirius saved Snape from the Willow, BUT nothing happened (atleast nothing we know about).
2. Besides of the lack of explanation, Harry is on that passage (in my eyes) arrogant and a poser. Usually any explanation and conclusion that Harry made, we see in his thoughts. But this Protection was only barely explained. If i remember right, he only thought, that NOW he was ready to fight and then came his "solution" as he faced Voldy. He acted, like it was his doing to protect the others (we dont see, that Voldemort used the Unforgivables against the others (sure, you would say, he would, what a purpose he would have in using the other Spells)), but he just mentioned, that he protect the others, like his mother did to him. So Harry assumes, that just the sacrifice is the Trigger and no Ritual (it might have slipped his mind (like so many other things), that Voldy and Dumbles said it was "ancient" magic. So it was difficult to perform or would take a long preparation time....or its simply "ancient" because the age of this spell is really old and not because its powerful.

And isnt it ridiculous, that ancient magic is stronger than the Elder Wand? The most powerful Wand, ever made? Its not clearly dated, when the Wand was made, but i like to presume, that it was nearly as old as Merlin.

I dont know, what my thoughts were, when i first read that passage, but i was definetely confused, after listening to it after a whole century.
