If it helps any, 'as old as Merlin' only takes you back around the year 500 or so. Hogwarts actually predates Arthurian time periods by a disgustingly large amount of time considering the kind of castle it is usually presented as.

Also in Arthurian myth Merlin aged backwards and was a baptised and thus de-evilled attempt at creating the anti-christ in some versions.

This has no bearing on anything, but it is amusing to me to think the potterverse wizards venerate a (failed) antichrist and irl religious anti-Potter activists never raised that point.
