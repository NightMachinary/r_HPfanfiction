"Ancient magic" is used in HP to mean the deepest, most profound rules of magic. For example, the protection against spells in a dragon's hide is referred to as ancient magic. It's not a body of wizardry that can be studied and learnt, it's just a set of fundamental rules about how magic operates (the phrasing is a nod to Narnia).

Lily didn't "cast" any magic and nor did Harry. It's simply that her choice to die when she had the option to live had innate magical significance.
