oh, I understand, what you are saying, but your Logic is wrong (in my eyes). You see, IF Trelawney considered Dumbles to die, she would have told him. And of course, the FULL Phrase is Important. "IF i join", YET she hasnt, SO nothing happens...unless of course Rowling made a mistake and wanted to claim that Trelawney indeed joined "already", but why would she show concern about this unlucky thing when its to late? As Dumbles stands up (he leaves, so its 11) to welcome her and conjure a Chair, she joins reluctantly. NOW they are 13 and she indeed was the 13th. Trelawney was shocked, when Ron and Harry were standing.

But Trelawney clearly said "IF i Join", means, she hasnt Joined them YET, so nothing happens to poor Dumbles. It is true, that of these 13 Dumbles was the unlucky one, but i Doubt that Rowling has forseen this (its my Opinion). She just wanted Dumbles to die, so that the most important Protection for the light side and Harry and a Mentor for said Person would vanish and Harry would be on his own.

There is no Threat about Dumbles, because Sybill didnt/hasnt joined them yet...she pointed it out herself. Its actually obvious, but if you want to believe it the way you stated untill now, i wont interfere.

Oh wait. You want to say, that Trelawneys Prophecy did occur, BECAUSE it were 13 People from the Beginning? You have been counted Wormtail from the Beginning! Ah....now if this is right, things are clear. So that Ron and Harry both standing was a red Hering....hmm, ok. But i still have my doubts about that Rowling has forseen/planned this, but as long as she wont admit it, we can only speculate.
