about the 2nd Point. Didnt Trelawney count exactly 13 Person on the Table? She refused to sit, because she would be the last 13th Person. So she didnt counted Scabbers...or to go even more, her "Prophecy" was wrong from the Beginning, since it was already 13 People on the Table and she was the 14th.
