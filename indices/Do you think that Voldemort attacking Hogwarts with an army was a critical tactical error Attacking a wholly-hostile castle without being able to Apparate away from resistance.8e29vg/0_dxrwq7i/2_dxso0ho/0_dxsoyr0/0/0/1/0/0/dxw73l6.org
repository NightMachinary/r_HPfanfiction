>"It was Professor Trelawney, gliding

toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined

dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like

a glittering, oversized dragonfly.

“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore, standing

up."

>"And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which

revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors

Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did

not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table,

and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.

“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!

Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen

dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!”"

As we can read on here, Trelawney DID NOT joined them yet! She is still standing beside the Table, a couple of steps away and i think its stupid of her not to tell Dumbles as a Warning, that he will die. "**Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will die**" Dumbles was rising before she joined (sit down). To be Fair: Its not described if Ron did take Scabbers with him to Lunch (could be possible, that he locked him away in their Bedroom or Trunk). Please Remember: >"Full to bursting with Christmas

dinner and still wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got

up first from the table and she shrieked loudly.

“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”

“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry."

So, she saw Ron and Harry stand up on the same time. Why else would she be bothered on them instead of bothering Dumbles? As i said, its not described if Ron took Scabbers with himself, if so, Trelawneys Message was pointless from the beginning, without her knowing it, but if not, the 13 only counted the moment, she sit with them.
