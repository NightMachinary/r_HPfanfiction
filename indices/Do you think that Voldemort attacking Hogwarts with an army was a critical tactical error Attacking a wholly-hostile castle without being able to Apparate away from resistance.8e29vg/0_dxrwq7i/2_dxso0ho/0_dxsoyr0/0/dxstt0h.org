so my "knowledge" about ancient magic is not allowed in HP and just what Rowling think it is? Yeah, that makes my pointed passages even more frustrating.

> It's not a body of wizardry that can be studied and learnt

you mention Narnia, so different Universe. But if this also counts for HP, then the whole learning and studying in the Magical School is worthless, because all Students already have the Power to perform this magic, they just need to be "aware" of. Example for what i mean: Neville can perform the Alohomora and envies all his Pals for doing it with perfection

Neville: "That so unfair, i want to perform this useful spell to"

Pal: "Oh, but of course, you can do it. You just have to be aware, that anybody can do all spells, so even you"

Neville concentrates "i am able to do it, so i want to do it" and suddenly, he perfoms the spells as perfect as any other of his Friends....without practicing....just because he made himself aware, that Anyone can do any sort of Magic, no matter how much s/he trains.
