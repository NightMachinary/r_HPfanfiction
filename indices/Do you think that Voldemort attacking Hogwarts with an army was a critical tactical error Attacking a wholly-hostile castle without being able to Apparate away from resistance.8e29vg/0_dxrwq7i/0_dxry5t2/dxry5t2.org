In addition to this, Voldemort has shown that he isn't opposed to dealing with powerful (politically and magically) opponents personally. The key examples that come to mind are the Potters and Amelia Bones (were there any specific others I've forgotten?).

Allowing a pitched battle to occur at all was a fool's errand in the first place. Surgical strikes across the UK against his foes would've been far more successful. It's what I imagine the first war was very much like, until Riddle was unceremoniously duped by love magic.
