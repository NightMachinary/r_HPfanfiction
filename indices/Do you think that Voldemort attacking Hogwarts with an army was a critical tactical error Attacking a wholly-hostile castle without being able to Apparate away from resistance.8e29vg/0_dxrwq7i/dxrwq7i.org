Well, from a writing perspective, I certainly think that writing pitched battles in the HP world is a mistake.

From an in-universe tactical perspective, I think you are underestimating Voldemort's personal power. In a conventional fight, I'm not sure that the combined defenders of Hogwarts would have been able to overcome him.

Consider his duel against McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him ---

  “You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---”

  “But you did not!”

  “--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. *Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?* You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”
#+end_quote

From this we can deduce that Voldemort was laying waste to everyone around him, and that even when confronted with the most powerful opponents available to the defenders, he landed multiple spells on them in a very short space of time, each of which would have probably killed their targets but for Harry's sacrificial magic. Without that sacrificial magic in place, Voldemort probably could have killed Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley in the space of seconds.

Voldemort's true mistake was granting everyone in Hogwarts' an impenetrable protective Charm against his magic by accepting Harry's sacrifice in exchange for the lives of those in the castle, just as Lily had done for Harry.
