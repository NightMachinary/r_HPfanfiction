Ok, well Linkffn(To shape and change) is a go-to then, Dumbledore doesn't apear as much as Snape but his characterization is still great, while in Linkffn(The mind Arts) it is the opposite with Dumbledore being a much more prevalent character than Snape, never really saw them as a paring, but rule 34, so it is somewhere and I can't remember if Snape has a good characterization in linkffn(More Equals than you know) or in linkffn(more than equals), but in both Dumbledore is well-meaning, competent and proactive (an increasingly rarer combination) and while Snape has no interaction whatsoever up to this point Linkffn(Albus and Harry's world trip) is a must for a good Dumbledore.
