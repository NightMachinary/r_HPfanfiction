Perhaps a dumb question, but should I post here in this post if I end up writing it? I haven't paid enough attention to the sub to see if sharing your own stories in a separate post is considered good etiquette or not. Haha.

I would like to do this, but I've got another fic I've essentially abandoned and probably should spend some time on as well. So I might see if I can shift gears enough to write both fics at the same time.
