I could see this going a different direction entirely. Ginny gets imprisoned next to a prisoner who asks her all about her experiences having the true Heir of Slytherin in her head, controlling her actions. During their downtime when the Dementors retreat for short periods, the two discuss the diary Ginny found, and as they discuss, she learns more about where the diary came from and that perhaps a certain Lucius Malfoy wasn't Imperiused all those years before in the first Wizarding war. Instead, she learns he was actually one of the loyal servants who escaped detection by his lies and money in the fallout after Voldemort disappeared.

As time passes, the two discuss Ginny's family and friends, lighting on one Harry Potter, who Ginny has had a crush on from the time she first met him. Her feelings towards him now border on hero-worship for having defended her so heatedly but also disappointment that he was unable to secure her freedom with his celebrity. They discuss her brothers and the way her parents smothered her in affection for being the only girl and the youngest, and Ginny lets out her fears that her parents have bankrupted themselves trying to hire someone that can represent her in the hearings and help her. All the while her newfound confidant has listened and let her get out her fears and failures, while paying particular attention to the relationships Ginny mentions.

Meanwhile her family has poured every last cent into championing Ginny's innocence, spending every penny of Arthur's winnings from the Ministry on finding good representation, petitioning for her case to be heard again, and even greasing palms as needed to try and open the right doors. With Lucius Malfoy directly against them, however, their efforts are in vain, and rather than take a big trip to Egypt to visit Bill, they spend their summer in a frenzy of tried and failed avenues for releasing her.

As Ron and the twins prepare to go back to school, a reporter from the Daily Prophet asks for an interview, promising to share the Prophet's view that the family and Ginny have had a bad go of it. The boys line up in front of their Hogwarts trunks with their too-short robes and Ron's still-broken wand front and center for a photo. Peeking out of the picture, perched on Ron's shoulder is a particular rat called Scabbers. When the article comes out, on the day the Hogwarts Express chugs its way out of the station, the reporter, a nasty piece of work who apprenticed under Rita Skeeter, has instead dragged the entire family through the mud, going so far as to interview certain Hogwarts personnel like Filch and Professor Snape, who both denounce the returning Weasley children as menaces to the school. The reporter ends her “article”, such as it is, with a scathing call that perhaps the three Weasley boys and their friend Harry Potter need to take a trip to Azkaban to join their sister for some shock treatment.

This, of course, leads to an enraged Molly Weasley attempting to storm down the doors of the Prophet. But more importantly, it leads to a certain Minister sharing a good laugh with the human Azkaban guards on his visit, whereupon he leaves his copy of the Prophet with notorious mass murderer Sirius Black when the prisoner expresses interest in it.

Black quickly reads through the entire edition of the Prophet, including the “Did Ginny Weasley Have A Co-conspirator in Harry Potter? Details on Page 23!” Realizing both that he was sharing a prison with one of Harry's alleged “girlfriends” and that her brother was carrying around his ex-friend, Sirius is spurred to action, first spending time exploring Azkaban to determine where the poor girl was locked away. Squeezing out of his cell in dog form, he trots around the prison, narrowly avoiding entanglements with both human guards and Dementors until he finds her cell. Devising a plan of escape, Sirius chooses the perfect moment and pops into her cell with the stolen wand of one of the guards. Ginny at first thinks she's hallucinating, but once Sirius convinces her of his realness and the possibility of escape, she jumps at the opportunity. There's just one hitch in the plan. Ginny demands to take her new friend with them. She's convinced her confidant doesn't deserve to be here, and in her mind, no one deserves to be stuck with Dementors night and day. Ginny refuses to leave without her friend, and given her shrunken appearance and pallor, Sirius feels she won't last much longer if he were to leave her. Torn between his intense desire to escape and his knowledge that Harry would be devastated to lose his “girlfriend,” Sirius reluctantly agrees to release her friend.

Negotiating an escape plan for one is hard. For two, it's imminently more dangerous. But when he learns he'll be letting a third inmate join them, Sirius has to use all his wits to ferry Ginny to the cell her friend is in without getting caught. He unlocks the cell and has his first intense shock when he sees the mass of wavy black hair on the head of the skin and bones prisoner before him.

“Hello cousin,” she croons almost lovingly, her eyes mad. “Fancy meeting you here.” A low chuckle escapes her throat before her dark eyes land on Ginny. “Oh love,” she says, almost gently, before walking over and embracing the young girl. Ginny sinks into her embrace, shoulders shaking as she does, and then the woman says, “Right then,” standing back and meeting Sirius's eyes with a surprisingly steady gaze, “are we getting out of here or not?”

And that begins Ginny's journey with the two most unlikely escapees.

P.S. I can see this being an epic story actually, with a really fun plot playing out between Sirius and Bellatrix (tried not to make it too obvious, but still). Now I kinda wanna write this, but I don't know if people would want to read it.

Also I know Bellatrix's reaction here seems insanely out of character, but I have at least six reasons for it that all wind back to her actually being in character when you get to her motivations.
