"I will ask you all once more..." Snape began, eyeing the assembled third years in front of him. His eyes moved from person to person with eerie calm, sending shivers down the spines of all present. His gaze finally settled on Weasley, who was standing beside Crabbe and Goyle, surprisingly enough. They were standing off to the side, away from the other students and almost exactly opposite from where Malfoy took his near-fatal plunge.

"What happened to Mr. Malfoy?"

Nobody spoke, and for the next four minutes the only sound that could be heard was the winds whipping around the top of the Astronomy Tower. Weasley looked sick, his face a death-like shade of white. Crabbe and Goyle looked little better, and the latter appeared to be clenching his hands so tightly he might be cutting circulation off to his fingers. The rest of the students seemed to alternate between staring at Professor Snape, staring at the odd trio off to the side, or staring off into the distance and wishing desperately that they weren't there.

Eventually, Crabbe opened his mouth to speak and let out possibly the most unconvincing excuse Snape had heard in his entire life.

"Draco had an accident, Professor. Y'see, he left his wand on the ledge while he was tryin' to find Mars and when he went to grab it he knocked it clean off."

Snape's gaze zeroed in on Crabbe and Goyle immediately began to unclench his hands.

"And how," Snape drawled, "did that lead to Mr. Malfoy plunging off the side of this tower, might I ask?"

Crabbe opened his mouth to respond, but Weasley beat him to it.

"The wind blew him off!" he blurted out, looking somewhat surprised at his own words.

Snape simply stared.

"Y'know... when he... grabbed for his wand..." Ron finished lamely, eyes directed at the floor. That seemed to be his default mode these days, ever since his little sister was sent away. Neither Snape nor the other professors could recall seeing him smile even once that year.

"It's true, Professor." Goyle added helpfully, placing a hand on Weasley's shoulder in support. "Just a bit of bad luck. You know how windy it gets up here."

As if to punctuate that statement, a particularly strong gust of wind buffeted them, sending Snapes robes billowing around him in a rather dramatic fashion. He noted that it was blowing /away/ from the direction in which Malfoy fell.

"Mm. Quite." Snape's face and tone were unreadable, but all present seemed to draw back nonetheless, quite certain that this was going to end rather poorly for all involved.

Snape, meanwhile, continued to stare at the unlikely trio for a moment. Continued to watch as Crabbe glanced nervously at Weasley's down-turned face, who seemed quite resigned to punishment, and then to Goyle's hand, which was still placed comfortingly on Weasley's shoulder as he stared back at Snape, a strange mixture of determination and resignation on his face.

Snape made his decision on the spot.

"You would do well to remember that story when the aurors arrive. Mr. Malfoy's father is quite concerned over his son, as you might expect, and the Ministry will be conducting a full investigation."

All three students in front of him began staring at him in bewilderment as he turned his attention to the remainder of the class.

"It seems what happened here was a simple lapse in proper safety procedures. I'm sure you will all attest as to what happened here tonight. How Mr. Malfoy's lack of caution and disregard for his own well-being led to a /completely avoidable/ incident."

The assembled students stared back at him, most seeming to understand what he was implying. A few would probably have to have it explained to them by their comrades, but that wasn't surprising. This year group was a particularly pathetic group of dunderheads.

"Of course, it is regrettable that the wards around the railing happened to fail at just the wrong moment. One would almost think they had been tampered with." Snape's eyes landed on the trio once more before turning back to the rest of the class. It was Crabbe's turn to look sick, it seemed.

"It is equally unfortunate that they left no trace for anyone to investigate. One can only hope that Mr. Malfoy happens to recall the last few moments before his fall, otherwise the investigators will simply have to accept the word of their witnesses."

The class stared at Snape with a mixture of surprise and, for the first time in all his time teaching, respect.

"I know you will all do what is right," he finished, sweeping through the crowd and down the stairs, leaving the students to their thoughts.
