I think the idea of "canon" in HP is like "Canon" in classic Dr. Who or the Marvel universe. It's whatever the current story requires to be true at the moment.

For my own ranking, it's

Headcanon

Main Books

Main Movies

Original notes from main books

Other books

Interviews

Other movies

...

Fanon

...

...

Random hot takes from JKR on twitter.
