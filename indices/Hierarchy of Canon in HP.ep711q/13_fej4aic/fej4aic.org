What I typically consider relevant canon, in order, is the 7 books, then Pottermore/Wizarding World, then everything else. Harry Potter is a massive franchise, owned by a massive company, that makes a ton of money. Like most things that make a ton of money there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, so to speak, and the original intention gets muddled, nuiance gets lost, and little details often change.

Magic, for example, in the movie looks different in notable ways than it's described in the books because film is a different medium and you have to cater to it while also trying to get the gist of things, and that means you gotta change or cut things entirely, and that's ok. But abridgement is still abridgement, however necessary, and shouldn't be taken as gospel IMO.

Cursed Child and the Fantastic Beast movies I consider apocryphal at best because they are, in my opinion, rather blantant attempts to cash in on the popularity of the franchise and not born of something genuine or conceived with some artistic merit in mind. The numerous ways that Cursed Child contradicts, leans on, and rips off it's source material supports that.

(Not to say there's anything wrong with wanting to make money, but when the result is as bad as Cursed Child and Crimes of Grindelwald I become significantly less forgiving.)

But in the end what is or isn't canon is all semantics to me when it comes to fanfiction, because the point of fanfiction, to me, is to twist the canon in new and interesting ways. For example The Albus Potter series feels like a truer continuation to the books than the Cursed Child could ever hope to, and Contractual Invalidation is just a more interesting romance than anything we ever got in the books.
