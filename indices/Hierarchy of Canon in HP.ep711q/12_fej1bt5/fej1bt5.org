I like the idea of degrees of canon. For me it's

1. original 7 books
2. supplemental books - Tales of Beedle the Bard, Quidditch, Fantastic Beasts
3. JKR's interview statements up to ~2008

With the interviews, dates and math can be tweakable to make sense (Black family tree). After this it is picking and choosing what I like from:

1. Pottermore (some articles are really good others are trash)
2. Movies (the original 8) (Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are Co-ed)
3. JKR tweets

I also consider HP Lexicon to be a more authoritative source for quick lookup or fact checking than HP Wiki
