Personally, I go for B, Headcanon (interpretation of B), F, and sprinkles of P.

I haven't really touched the supplemental books, as I'm hesitant on the fact that JKR could have ballsed it up.

F is only good for names, some events (if you are doing marauders/grindelwald era. Also can be a good canon source over the movies, as F doesn't have a book series to contradict like the original 7 books does for their movies.

And by sprinkles of P, I mean names, families, books, potions, spells, etc. Nothing to do with dates or hard numbers. Because JKR contradicts herself with them a lot.

â€‹

T, I, M, and O I throw out immediately. JKR contradicts herself or messes up the numbers religiously with T and I. O because reasons, and M because it mangles the books up to no end.

C on the other hand, has a special place in my heart. The only thing I consider canon in that is that adults in the HP world are incompetent idiots that mess up EVERYTHING and leave it up to the kids to fix.
