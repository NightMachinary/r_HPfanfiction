I would push M a little bit higher (there seems to be trend of JKR getting more and more crazy in her statements, films were so early after books, actually first films were released before the last books were, which is the explanation why later Ron and Snape in books are film personas not the book ones). Also, F should be split: the first film was to some extent reasonable (and for example the concept of Obscurial is probably the best explanation of what happened to Ariana Dumbledore and I can happily have it in canon), the second film just went out to the deep end on the same level C ... just forget it ever happened and pretend it didn't.
