I would not say C&F to be canon at all, and for the rest the parts that don't contradict the books could be considered canon, but I would definitely rank the original movies much higher on the list as they were made when JKR still put more effort in the series. I don't know why you would put the Fantastic Beasts movies above them, I would put them above everything but the supplementary books solely authored by JKR. For T&I I think when the statements were made should be taken into account as you can certainly see they get stranger as time goes on.
