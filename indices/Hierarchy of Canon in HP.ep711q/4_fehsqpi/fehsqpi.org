  Some are less obvious, for example do we put F above or below C? She is the only credited writer in F, but a film production may have less creative control for JKR than a play, even though there are co-authors. Another hard one is where to put I. She is the sole author of them, but interview statements may be less firm then published material even if she doesn't have full creative control.

I'm not sure that's really an interesting question and might be missing the point. Depending in which major camp a person falls in it's either clearly canon or clearly not canon. Does it really matter which one is slightly more or less canon? I can't imagine many people exist for whom the dividing line about canon is between Fantastic Beasts and Cursed Child.

IMHO if you accept Cursed Child you don't have much leg to stand on in order to dismiss Fantastic Beasts and vice versa.

Most of these kinds of discussions just fall deeply into the motivated reasoning trap anyway: "I really like X so I now have to make up many reasons why it must be canon!"
