Everybody hangs on the clincher of: "You have to internalize hatred of your magic."

But JK honestly expects us to believe a child that was called a freak and made to live in a cupboard didn't internalize his hatred of magic on top of his torment by his cousin. Yeah okay.

Sure I guess he didn't even though child psychology tells us almost every other child would as they do with other things.
