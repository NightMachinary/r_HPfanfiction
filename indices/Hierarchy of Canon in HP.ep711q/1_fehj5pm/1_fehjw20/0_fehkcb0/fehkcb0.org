True true, honestly one of the things I like to include most from the movies, is stuff in wizarding society, ie in the movies, they had a goblin stockbroker that talked about the potion market. That little thing adds so much to the economy and flushes out the world, or like the Malfoy's owning an apothecary that sells 1,000 yr old wine, Superior Red.
