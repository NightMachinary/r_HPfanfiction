Yes, this is a good approach I think. I don't like contradictory "Canon" IE Pottermore saying McGonagall was born in 1935 then JK saying McGonagall was there with Dumbles teaching DADA pre-1935.

My order would be: B>S=P>I=T and M>F=O don't exist in canon for me. Now, will I cherry-pick cool little things from M, F, and O that I like to add flavor to my story, yes, do I consider it canon, hell no.

Notice I didn't put C in there, because I consider that fanfiction. Less canon than the games, which aren't canon at all, and basically any other fanfiction but it has the stamp of approval to get money made off it.
