I despise these challenges. I really do. They sound like the author of the "challenge" was too fucking lazy to write his own damn story and decided to ask other people to write it for him.

This is a prompt:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
#+end_quote

The entire rest is a commission. It restricts every bit of creativity the author could push into it, but hey - /puts cynic cap on/ - that is probably why so many fanfiction authors like it.
