It reminds me of a pseudo interview Burnie Burns (Writer of "Red vs Blue") did. "For starting authors, I say give yourself constraints. Too often we're told writing is an open canvas where we can do anything we want. We get overwhelmed by choice and stagnate. I had two forts in a box canyon, a couple of vehicles, and a skull. It forced me to be creative with what I had."

And I think that's the appeal. It gives direction in the endless void of possibility.
