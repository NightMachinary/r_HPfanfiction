Flamethrowers are a lot easier to make than drills. You can have entirely mechanical ones which require no electrical components.

Edit: For everyone disagreeing, [[https://live.staticflickr.com/7228/7253204458_ed60c3c0d4_b.jpg][here are the schematics for a Soviet Flamethrower]]. This is not a complex device in any shape or form and if you have the tools to make a drill, you can make flamethrowers easily.
