There were people living (even without the Philosopher's Stone) well over even the magical-extended life span: Armando Dippet was apparently [[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a4/Armando_Dippet_-_HPLE-PA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160807183131][really born]] in 1637 and died 1992. I couldn't believe it.

Hmm, now writing this, it came to me that he died in the same year Flamels were supposed to die. Coincidence? I don't think so.

And yes, he was alive during the First Wizarding War (even in the first year of Harry Hogwarts' years) and we don't know anything about his life post-Hogwarts. It is a shame, there are no stories about it.
