I feel that this is up to interpretation. The wizarding world being what it is, I wouldn't be surprised if she had, although I doubt with malicious intent. However it could equally been, for example a dare with her other dorm mates. They would each take a few minutes worth of potion keyed to someone who wasn't in the room, and then when it had worn off they laughed about how stupid it made them look. You could have something similar done formally if you want to make the teachers responsible. A one off lesson to help recognise if you or your friends are being potioned to help protect each other. I feel that would make a great (and educational) story to tell your children.
