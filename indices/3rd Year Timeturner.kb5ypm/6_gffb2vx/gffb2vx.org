For sure! If a Gryffindor can't take all the classes, why not just put her in the Hufflepuff class (or whatever)?

I did see one fic explain this as Trelawney refusing to teach on "inauspicious" days of the week and times of day and Dumbledore indulging her. Meaning that the Divination schedule was so precise that it was impossible to schedule around, and as soon as Hermione dropped Divination she was able to get to classes without a Time Turner.

But the real reason is that JKR just didn't plan it out. /shrug/
