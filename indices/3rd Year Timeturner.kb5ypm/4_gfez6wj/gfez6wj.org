Personally, i think the Unspeakables have a specific logic: high-achieving students with access to time magic will do interesting shit with it. It could function as a recruitment spec. If the student gets into interesting things (potions experiments, spellcraft, enchanting, etc), they are allowed to keep the time turner and are marked for further interview. The twins may have "found" a time turner and that's how they found time to acquire the advanced knowledge in potions, charms, and other fields necessary to make their prank items work.

If they only use it to do homework (or like a dork [the Hermione method] where they use it *only* for class attendance, and not homework or health management), they are not considered for further interest. There are probably several of those, and I like to think Percy was in a similar mindset as Hermione.
