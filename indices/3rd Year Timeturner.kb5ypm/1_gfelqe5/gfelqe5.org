Massive plot holes. Based on how controlled they are a student shouldn't get one. Much less for something as attending classes. And yes, the school should have made sure that the whole subjects can be taken without crossing, not for a madman who wants to take them all, but because people shouldn't be deprived of choosing 2 classes they want because the schedule made them collide.
