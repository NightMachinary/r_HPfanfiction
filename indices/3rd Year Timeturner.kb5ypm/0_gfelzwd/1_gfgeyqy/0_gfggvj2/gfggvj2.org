Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there another part in the books where there are dire warnings about what can happen if the timeline is tampered with? So they obviously know it's a huge potential problem. I don't mind stories having their own internal logic, but then that logic needs to be consistent. Either they don't have a problem with people going willy nilly back in time, or they do.
