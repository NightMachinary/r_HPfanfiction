I am not so sure if it is a plothole. Is there actually a Gryffindor who doesn't choose the combination of Divination/Care beside Hermione? I am pretty sure we see all Gryffindors at one point in Care and in Divination. So it isn't a problem if this three subjects take place at the same time, because every other Gryffindor had choose the same classes. And from book 5 we know that Hermione took classes with Ravenclaw.
