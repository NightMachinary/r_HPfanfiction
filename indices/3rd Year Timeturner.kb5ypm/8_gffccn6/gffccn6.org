  "Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today," she said happily.

  "Hermione," said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, "they've messed up your timetable. Look---they've got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn't enough /time/."

  "I'll manage. I've fixed it all with Professor McGonagall."

  "But look," said Ron, laughing, "see this morning? Nine o'clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o'clock, Muggle Studies. And /look/---" Ron leaned closer to the timetable, disbelieving, "---underneath that, Arithmancy, /nine o'clock/ . I mean, I know you're good, Hermione, but no one's /that/ good. How're you supposed to be in three classes at once?"

  "Don't be silly," said Hermione shortly. "Of course I won't be in three classes at once."
