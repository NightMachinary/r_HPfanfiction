This is a problem that real schools and students face. Of course, real schools have more classes and teachers to try to fit together. My guess is that Rowling just copied over the problem without really thinking too much about the causes or implications.

There is a pretty logical way to schedule classes to make it work though. If each elective is taught twice at each grade level, they could be scheduled so each one overlaps with a different elective in a single closed loop.

For example, Arithmancy 2 at the same time as Care 1, Care 2 at the same time as Divination 1, Divination 2 with Muggle 1, Muggle 2 with Runes 1, and Runes 2 with Arithmancy 1.

That allows any student to take every elective. But if, due to scheduling limitations, each house and year has up to one core class scheduled in the same time slot as the electives, the schedule will still work as long as no one wants to take more than four electives. And that matches Ron's comment about three classes happening at once.

Now, I'm not sure how well this schedule matches other information we get in the books (the elective classes should be small enough to only need one class each, unless one is disproportionately popular, and I don't know if there is any evidence of electives having two classes for each grade that aren't split by houses), but it at least shows a possible solution that mostly matches what we see.

I suspect I've already put more thought into this than Rowling did, though.
