There's an event held every September 1st in the ministry. People write a name on both sides and pass their coin around. That name is of a person they trusted before said person died. Being picked by Harry Potter instantly makes you a wizard or witch on an higher level than others. It makes people see you as a person who in life was an untouchable impossibly hard to kill person, lesser only to Harry Potter himself and perhaps the Golden Trio, true or false it may be. No one really knows what requirements there are to be picked by him, but everyone knows you must have faced truly incredible things alongside him to receive such an honor that few people would believe or ever truly understand.
