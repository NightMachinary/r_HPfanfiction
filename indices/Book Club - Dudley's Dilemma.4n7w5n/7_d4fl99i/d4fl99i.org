SPOILER FREE REVIEW

Dudley's Dilemma

Slightly boring, entirely too forgettable, but not too bad at all. I don't think I quite agree with most of the readers here when they say that this is that bad. This sort of light fics can be quite fun when read not too seriously.

That being said, execution of the female characters is just bad. Plot holes are quite abundant and there are a lot of points in which you'll just be so bored, you'll want to give up. The length of chapters becomes a bit annoying after a while as well.

All in all, a light not too memorable read, which despite an interesting premise and good grammar, fails to capture the reader's attention for too long.

My rating- A - Acceptable

Passing Grades - O - Outstanding, E - Exceeds Expectations, A - Acceptable Failing Grades - P - Poor, D - Dreadful, T - Troll

Liked it just fine, but would never read again.
