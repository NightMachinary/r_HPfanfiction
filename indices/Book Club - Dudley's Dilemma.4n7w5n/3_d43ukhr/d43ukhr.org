I read the fic, and if I am being brutally honest... I dont think Ill ever remember reading it. There is nothing to make it standout from any of the other Dudley's Magical Children fics, and if we are being serious, I don't really care for the characters. :/

That being said, for a simple, one day read (Assuming you need something to kill two to ten hours) it wasnt bad. I would not recommend it however.
