I, like many others, only got up to chapter 10. The lack of suspense and mundane chapters failed to get me hooked. The Americanisms really started to bug me (ie. Grade school instead of Primary School, Diner instead of Cafe). I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and didn't feel that the characters had been thought out well before hand.
