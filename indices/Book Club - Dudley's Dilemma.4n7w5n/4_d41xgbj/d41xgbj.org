I'm going to be honest, a lot of the chapters I merely skimmed. I was going to give up but I wanted to participate in this thread with the whole material read. So I committed even though it was kind of boring for most of it. I guess it's hard to depict normal muggle life within HP fanfiction? I would love to see it done well, but it was kind of a week by week catch up on what the Dursleys (bar their child at Hogwarts) did and some catering business. There's a twist and a dark climax but it happens so suddenly after all these chapters where I virtually skimmed that I didn't feel as attached to read this ending.

Also using Mom instead of Mum because I'm nitpicky like that, even when it's fanfiction.

Edited: because I'm shit at tagging spoilers so I got rid of them because I don't know how to use reddit well yet.
