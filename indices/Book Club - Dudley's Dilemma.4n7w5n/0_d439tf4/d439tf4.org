Interesting premise, terrible execution. I take issue with so many things in this story I don't even know where to begin.

As others in this thread I only made it through 10 chapters or so before I had to give it up. The first one got my hopes up with the decent grammar and what seemed to be a novel and interesting idea. It only went downhill from there.

Dudely finds out his daughter is a witch, which prompts him to contact Harry. He had no contact with Harry in a long, long while, a fact supported by the fact that he had no way of directly reaching him, but as soon as he tries it only takes seconds for Harry to appear at his door. Then there's a dementor attack, out of nowhere, and Harry's patronus is incapable of dealing with the dementors, so Dudely has to help by... making them chase him.

The author made Harry the adult auror weaker than Harry the 13 year old who only knew two spells in total. Dudley the muggle who works in marketing did better at fighting the dementors than Harry did. I don't even know what was the point of this.

It goes on like this with more ridiculous little plot points that get resolved in the same paragraph, until the discerning reader has no choice but to abandon ship.

The last thing I want to mention is the way the author deals with female characters. Ten chapters in and we've only met Dudley's wife. She literally spends her life in the kitchen, only occasionally poking her head out to go into hysterics on poor Dudley whenever bad things happen. Typical woman behavior. Now, you might remember Sarah, the magical daughter, but for all intents and purposes she disappears once her role in the story is done. Her brother reveals to the world he's magical too, so all the screen time moves to him. Sarah, at 4, becomes the muggleborn equivalent of Lucius Malfoy: "Magic, how lame! Look at those plebeians getting excited over magic!"
