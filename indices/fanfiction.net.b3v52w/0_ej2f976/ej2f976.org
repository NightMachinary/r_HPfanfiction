Online ads aren't just annoying, they can be dangerous even when not clicked on. On the other hand, maintaining a website with millions of stories and millions of users isn't easy and costs money.

Does anyone know if FFN has a way to provide them financial support? I would give them $5 a month if there was a way, but I don't see anything obvious on their site.
