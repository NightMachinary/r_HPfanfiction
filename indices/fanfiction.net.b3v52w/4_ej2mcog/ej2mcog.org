I have the same problem. starting yesterday, ads started appearing in text every 2000 words or so. the exact same ad per chapter. annoying af. I don't use ad blocker on mobile since it is more trouble than it is worth with certain websites, it's easier to just avoid ad filled websites on the phone. never thought fanfiction.net would be the one that would force me to download a adblocking browser on my phone
