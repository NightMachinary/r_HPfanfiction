My groceries doesn't break my concentration by trying to get my attention all the time. They don't move, they don't flash, and they're dead silent.

I don't mind "old school" ads. It was the moving, blinking, flashing, and noisy ads that made me install the ad blocker in the first place. After that the ads just got worse and my ad blocker stays. They started this shit.
