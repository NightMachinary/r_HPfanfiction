Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy was something of a tribute to Draco (and I'm pretty sure she's solely responsible for the leather pants!Draco trope), but she only ever baited Drarry. I suspect she was a Harmony shipper, but she also gave a big push to the Draco/Ginny ship. Oh man, Irresistible Poison was a force to be reckoned with. Insanely prosey by today's standards though. I don't know if it was the first ever, but it was certainly the first one I ever read.
