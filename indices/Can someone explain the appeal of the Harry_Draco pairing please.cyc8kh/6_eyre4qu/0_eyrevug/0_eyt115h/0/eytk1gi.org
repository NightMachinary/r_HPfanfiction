> she only ever baited Drarry.

I read the underlying HD subtext/chemistry was a big win. We are talking about 2001, so I'm guessing she did ships based on what was on the first 4 books?

>big push to the Draco/Ginny ship

Surprising how that never picked up as much as Harry/Draco or Harry/Hermione, maybe because of lack of interaction or chemistry between Draco and Ginny in rest of the books published after 2001.. ? Or maybe because of popularity of HD ship.
