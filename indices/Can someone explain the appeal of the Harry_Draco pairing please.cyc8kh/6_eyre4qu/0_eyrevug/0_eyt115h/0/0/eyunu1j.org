  I read the underlying HD subtext/chemistry was a big win. We are talking about 2001, so I'm guessing she did ships based on what was on the first 4 books?

Draco Dormiens came out between PoA and GoF actually, though the latter parts of the trilogy took book 4 into account a little bit - mostly to bring in Fleur, who is apparently distantly related to Draco. Oh god...she might be responsible for the Veela!Draco trope too.

But I'm not willing to give her credit for a H/D "win" as such. She was openly friends with Rhysenn at the time - even named a character in the trilogy after her, so H/D wasn't unknown territory at the time. I think hers was just more an early case of queerbaiting. It's not as if she really had any compunctions about what was considered socially acceptable to write about: the first iteration of a "Mortal Instruments" story she wrote was a detailed smut one-shot between an underage Ron and Ginny. Openly writing H/D would have been pretty tame by comparison.
