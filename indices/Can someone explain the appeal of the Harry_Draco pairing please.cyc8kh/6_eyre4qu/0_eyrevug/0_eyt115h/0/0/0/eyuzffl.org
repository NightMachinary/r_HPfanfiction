oh! Thanks for the explanation. Tbh, I wasn't keen on reading Draco Trilogy either because of the very same "queerbaiting" (though I didn't have a name for it), I did read that she got flak for turning pretty unredeemable Draco into some kind of attractive, snarky anti-hero. Tbh, I am not a fan of Mortal instruments, now I'll always think of the incestuous smut one-shot you mentioned.
