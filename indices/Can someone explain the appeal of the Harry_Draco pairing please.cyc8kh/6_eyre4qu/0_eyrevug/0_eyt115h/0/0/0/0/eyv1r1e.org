Hrm, let me qualify that a bit. Cassie Claire didn't get flak just because she wrote Draco out of character - loads of fanfics do that, and there's nothing inherently immoral about it - she got into flak because she plagiarised a lot of her work from famous TV shows and such. There are articles about it all over the web.

I've only read the first Mortal Instruments novel and seen the Shadowhunter TV show (which by the way I'd actually recommend for the Malec pairing), but from that alone it's pretty clear that Cassie has a kink for incest.
