They are /obsessed/ with each other, in the books. Not in a sexual way, obviously, but Draco is constantly trying to get Harry's attention with various weird stunts, like the trophy room duel and the dragon in the first book, telling harry he'd be pissed if he knew sirius ahd escaped in book 3, pretending to be dementors in the same book, the badges in book 4, or how he comments on being "dogged" in the fifth book, etc. He is always delivering kinda useful information to the main cast under the guise of being an uppity know-it-all, and a lot of his mean tricks require a lot of thought. Like, "Weasley is Our King"?" -- the kid wrote a pretty elaborate song about Ron, making sure he hit on all of Ron's insecurities. Draco sure is mean, but he is also incredibly attentive and dedicated in the pursuit of getting Harry's goat. I think it is pretty easy to read all of this as him being like that ten year old boy in your English class who kicks you because he thinks that's how you flirt.

However, for the first five books, Harry & the gang mostly ignore him, Harry most of all. He says he doesn't want to be friends when they first meet, and pretty much follows through. Other than in CoS where they think he's the heir of Slytherin, Draco mostly just enters into the plot because he's chasing Harry, not because Harry has any interest in him. This of course changes in HBP, when suddenly, Harry is /just as obsessed with Draco/ as Draco has been with him for the start of the series. He stalks him, wonders about him constantly, listens to him cry, etc., even though Ron and Hermione tell him that it's weird and that he should knock it off. They obviously don't have a healthy interest in each other, or if they do have a healthy interest they aren't expressing it in healthy ways, but the two of them are canonically very interested in what the other is doing.

Then, from a thematic level, Draco and Harry makes sense because one of Harry's primary goals throughout the series is to recreate the family that was taken from him in the prologue. This is why the Weasley's are so important and why JK saw her epilogue as a suitable way to wrap things up, when he is explicitly shown to have a wife and family and all is well. Well guess what? The only redeeming feature of the Malfoy family is shown again and again to be their love for each other. In fact, it's Narcissa's love for Draco which saves Harry near the end of DH, when she notices he's still alive and proceeds not to turn him in, thus allowing the whole dramatic conclusion against Voldemort. A Draco/Harry relationship would end up healing Harry's primary loss, giving him a family that both loves him and is alive.

There's also the fact that Draco really just never does anything that deplorable. He's a bully, of course, but he's also pretty pathetic. He goes up against Harry and the gang over and over, and is embarrassed every single time. The worst things he does are failing to kill people and failing to torture people -- things that Harry ultimately does both of, and the latter with some joy. Draco's whiny and spoiled. He's also pretty funny -- his ongoing commentary during Hagrid's class is pretty much what any sane person, /including Harry/, is thinking. Harry is a snarky lad who seems to value humor in his relationships to a pretty large degree, and if he were able to get over his hatred of Draco, I'd put that as a point towards the success of their relationship.

I'm not a huge fan of super-sexy fanon!Draco, and I also don't think it's a necessary change to make to the text to allow for a relationship between them. If you allow Draco and Harry to veer from their canon sexual orientations, there's a pretty strong canonical foundation for a relationship. Certainly a stronger one than there is for Daphne/Luna/Tonks/whatever, and arguably a stronger one than there is for Hermione. In addition to this foundation, you have a built in interesting narrative arc: how are they possibly going to get over the years of mutual dislike?

idk. There are a lot of really bad drarry stories out there, and most of them aren't in this mold. But this is the reason why I think it can be an interesting dynamic to explore. Post-war Drarry that features a gawky, trying to self-reform, theatre-kid!Draco and a kinda aloof, emotionally scarred, prejudiced Harry is just something I like.
