Maybe consider if Draco had been written as a girl. A platinum blonde girl with grey eyes and delicate features who comes from an aristocratic background. She's so mean-spirited and manipulative and she just CANNOT leave our hero alone. She hates losing out to him for anything. Then one year she stops paying attention to our hero, and our hero starts following her everywhere, desperate to know what's going on with her. She's on the wrong side of the war, but only because she was born into it. Is she really an enemy, or can she be redeemed?

If it isn't clear enough: if Draco had been written as a girl, she would have been called a femme fatale and Drarry would have been the top het ship in the fandom.
