I like grey characters, so, in the HP universe, Draco is the character for that. Or, at least, the character that can be made into that. Then, he and Harry are basically opposites. They hate each other. But they also saved each other's lives. That makes for an interesting story. How does Draco grow as a character after the war? How come they get together? How does everyone react to Harry's and Draco's relationship? That's the sort of things I'm looking for in a good Harry/Draco fic.
