A lot of people get Draco confused with Spike from Buffy who is kinda cool and dominant with a wussy side, as opposed to Draco who is more of a sad whiny wuss.

That said, the one Drarry I liked used his canon awfulness to lure me into reading about his being broken down horribly and then built back up into someone I liked in a way that wouldn't have worked if it had happened to a character I liked. I can't find it rn but it involved a necromantic torture maze in the department of mysteries.
