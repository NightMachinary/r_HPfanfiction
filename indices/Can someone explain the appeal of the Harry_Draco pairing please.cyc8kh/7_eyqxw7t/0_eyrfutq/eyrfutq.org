I do not subscribe to simplified viewpoint that Tom Felton is hot, hence HPDM fics are popular. If that's the argument, I do not find Daniel Radcliffe hot, but still I read Harryxany fics with UST.

I think it goes back to how Fanon!Draco is written consistently, with sort of bad boy, anti-hero personality.
