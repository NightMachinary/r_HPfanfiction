Basically a lot of people mainly young girls and teens want to read a spicy romance between two main characters in a story. If its a pairing between frenemies, enemies, or rivals then the want is heightened as its seen as a forbidden romance or something like that along the lines. Ever heard of yaoi? Look it up because it'll explain a lot. Lastly some people just love to pair up rivals in a story like Batman and Superman, Naruto and Sasuke, Bakugou and Midoriya aka Deku, Spiderman and Venom, Captain America and Iron Man, Magneto and Professor X, Loki and Thor. These are all legit pairings that people have made and are all fairly popular. Many of these might sound weird AF but people just eat it up on Archive of Our Own (a huge fandom website).
