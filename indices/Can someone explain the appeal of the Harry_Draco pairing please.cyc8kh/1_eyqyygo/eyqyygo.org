Harry: rough-and-tumble poor kid, jet-black hair, expansive.

Draco: aristocratic prat, light blonde hair, conceals his emotions from everyone.

Both prime targets for angst; both cute boys; canonically have a childish rivalry of the sort usually developed into a romance by bad novelists.

It's basically All The Gay Pairing Tropes in one /Harry Potter/-themed bundle. You need only look at the shameless invocation of all these tropes by /Good Omens/ to see what I mean. Draco and Harry couldn't have been more suited to slashing if Rowling had been aiming for it.
