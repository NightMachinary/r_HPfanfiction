I mean isn't fanfiction itself just wishful thinking and throwing canon out of the window?

We live in a world where Harry x Bellatrix, Harry x Narcissa, harem!Harry and other unrealistic pairings exist. Every single trope from evil!Dumbledore to indy!Harry erases certain part of canon in some way or form.
