  Well, but isn't that all just wishful thinking and throwing canon out of the window with fandom tropes?

What is slash-fic /but/ wishful thinking and fandom tropes? We're trying to understand the mindset of slashfic writerers, here, not actually discussing the canonical plausibility of a Draco/Harry relationship.

As for hair color, it's a matter of aesthetic. A blonde and a brunette look good kissing. You should not underestimate those sorts of concerns when dealing with shipping; you would, in much the same way, be at a complete loss for why people ship Hermione so much if you didn't take into account that by most standards Emma Watson is an extremely beautiful woman.
