I personally agree with you, but while they make for a more realistic (and sweet) pairing, they don't have the conceptual Ã¦sthetic yin-and-yang appeal that FanonDraco/FanonHarry does. Again, at this point, the handiest roadmap for non-slash-readers wanting to guess how slashable a pair of characters is is how much they look like Crowley and Aziraphale. It's not by far the only way a gay relationship can work, in fiction or otherwise, but it's definitely what slash is most interested in: "opposites attract" stories where both participants are cute boys.
