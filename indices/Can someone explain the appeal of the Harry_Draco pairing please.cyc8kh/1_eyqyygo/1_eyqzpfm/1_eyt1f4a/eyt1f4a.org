I just can't slash Ron. He feels like he might be the most hetero boy in the whole series. Although, being perfectly fair, he did have a crush on Krum...then his brain had a meltdown when his boy crush started dating his girl crush. I believe Harry went through a similar ordeal in the same year when Cedric started dating Cho.
