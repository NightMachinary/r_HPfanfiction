It took me years to actually watch the movie's after they were out, but if you look closely enough (and based on interpretation, really) you'll find Rowling leaving little breadcrumbs that has us questioning Harry's sexuality.

Harry repeatedly pays close attention to the appearance of the men he interacts with. Realistically, I don't care either way... But it's also fun to think of Harry/Draco being a drastic, closeted gay/bi/pan who breaks out of his shell when he sheds the duties and expectations everyone has of him.

To be honest, Harry and Draco are two sides of the same coin. I know a lot of people who think of Draco as a coward or a "wuss", but he has never known strife. His life was never endangered, nor has he had to learn how to fight to survive. Arguably, Malfoy wasn't outright abused unless he displeased his Father (who was an evil son'vabitch imo).

He grew up spoiled, believing the lies his parents told him. Unlike Black, who hated his parents, Draco held respect but learned - and this is speculation here - that the love from his Father wasn't as unconditional as it should have been. When people seek out acceptance, a large majority will do /*whatever*/ it takes...when you want to be accepted by your /own parents/, it's a done deal.

Malfoy is spoiled, an only child and believes in all that Pureblood horseshite because he wants to feel /special/. Because he believes Purebloods *are* special. But he's also loyal to his family in the end doing whatever he can to save his mother. Draco has layers. Even if Rowling never deemed it worthy to explore them, for any writer who isn't creating an OC, he's an angsty mound of clay for us to build, mould and break as we see fit.

Harry is literally the opposite of his pointy faced peer. The way he grew up, was a sure way to make sure he didn't turn out the way Draco did. Being _/"neglected"/ and at the very *least* verbally abused by family who are supposed to care and nourish you, could have easily sent him in the same direction that Moldywort had...Except for the fact that Harry never *wanted* power, or fame. He wanted to blend in and just /be/. (Unlike Draco who often tries to force the spotlight on himself.)

... Point is, I ship Drarry for many different reasons. Yes, they are different, but they also have similarities between them. They're Yin and Yang. One couldn't be without the other. Besides, Draco literally only antagonised Harry because Harry (and occasionally Hermione though I don't really ship those two, I can respect them as a pairing) always gave him as good as he got.

A lot of people like to ignore it, but Harry also had a darkness within him that could have easily been cultivated into something petty and malicious.

Both have interesting dynamics and I enjoy speculating on what wonders/horrors I can put them through when I drop them into a universe where they can be more than just /"Malfoy and Potter"/.
