People keep using the Horcruxes.....

Let me propose a different take. Frigga's protection spell for Baldr.(Harry's scar is a Sowilo rune carved in) anyways, it's from my abandoned fanfic that I never finished.

Lily loved magic. She didn't love it like wizards do but loved it with wonder and respect. Most wizards treat magic as a good given right and not a gift to cherish. They hoard it like gold but never new the value of it compared to a beggar with nothing to their name. No, Lily loved it like water is to a wanderer in the desert. She never lost that sense of wonder and love after years of hogwarts teaching magic as nothing but tools to use.

It was this respect of magic that made Dorea look at her as the perfect daughter in law. Euphemia looked at her sister in law and to the impending new addition to the family and made decision. Dorea and Euphemia gave Lily a book for rituals for their patron. They sat Lily down and told her of Lady Frigg and how despite Euphemia's age she was blessed with James. They told how the late lady Potter gave it to them when they were young.

"we were Descended from Peverells, you know. All bloodline Potters are. We worship the old gods and ask for guidance. Sometimes our family will be tasked to do something, to fulfill a duty owed to us as we are blessed by the gods." Euphemia told Lily during Charles and Dorea's funeral. "James saw you are his fated, and somethings are inevitable. Our time here grows short, I don't think James will ever grow up before our death so I'm telling this to you. Or if you decide you're tired of James's antics, pass the book to his bride."

Lily had took the words of James' mother to heart but forgot it til years later. She can't help but remember it as looks at her belly. She picked up the book and wondered, 'what if'. She had called for the blessing of a Goddess for her pregnancy and safe delivery of her child. She felt a magic answered her prayer. It was that knowledge and assurance that there is more to magic than spells and wands. Something old and primal had listened to solemn and heartfelt plea. After hours and dangerous delivery, her baby was born healthy. Despite the war raging outside, despite all odds, Lily gave birth safely even after being in the sh!t list of the dark lord.

when Albus had offered to place their house under Fidelus, Lily knew there was something more to it. Lily prodded him until he caved and told her about the prophecy.

Lily blamed herself as she had damned her child when she asked the aegis of the gods for him. She placed him in fates eyes and was cursed doomed to a path of heroes and tragedies. She held her child closely that night. She flipped the book to find a way to appeal to the gods, for knowledge to circumvent fate. None answered, fates get their due even gods fall under their purview. Lily kept calling, crying appealing to gods she never saw, to mother magic, to any who would listen to a plea of a mother who fears the prophetic death of her child. One Goddess answered, it was not a way to cheat death but no magic is perfect either way.

A loving mother, the Goddess Frigga's ability to see into the future caused her great pain as she foresaw the death of her beloved son Baldur. Even though she knew that she could not change his destiny, she simply couldn't just sit by and watch so the frantic goddess extracted a promise from all things that they would play no role in his death.

Lily never wrote the spell or the ritual. No need for any death eater to find out. The bay laurel , the Oak, the Common Juniper plants of the sun God Baldur.

James never questioned Lily why she specified an oak crib for their Harry nor the weird choice for plants in Harry's room. He never saw the runes Lily carved beneath the crib.

When Voldemort came, Lily took her son and started the ritual. She cut her palm and drew a the last rune of ritual with her blood. She wrote it on her son's forehead. The rune Sowilo resists the forces of death and destruction, proclaiming the triumph of the Light over the darkness. The Rune of Baldur completes the ritual all that's left is a sacrifice as Lily is no goddess. Voldemort may have casted the spell but Lily offered it on her own terms.

Protection from fire, water, iron, metals, stones, earths, diseases, trees, beasts, birds, poisons, and creeping things. Nothing in the godly realms can harm Baldur except mistletoe. What more can mortal Seidr and Yew wand do? The spell backlash destroyed Voldemort and Baldurs's rune seared itself into Harry's skin.

the young orphan was eventually shipped off to his aunts home. Normally, Harry would grow up thinking he was a freak, his parents were useless bums who didn't want him but that was not the case for this Harry. Simply because this Harry Potter is an orphan where no amount of beating can harm him nor getting hit by a bus. He knew he was magic and that he was once loved so deeply. It was not simple for him to figure it out but an English assignment caused him to look for a myth. There he found the story of Baldur who was so loved by his mother that she wove a powerful spell to protect him from all Harm except for one thing. He knew that his scar was not a simple car crash cut nor a lightning but the rune of Sowilo, the mark of Baldur. Harry does make it a point to stay away from mistletoes and the strange creatures that no one else sees living in the said plant.

years later

"Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember..." Ollivander looked at Harry's scar "I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great." Ollivander looked at the Holly wand he just sold. He watched Harry leave his store.

Perhaps one day, he shall tell the young Potter about her mother's spell. Ollivander thought to himself. Mistletoe was the only thing that can harm him. Though as the legends say, the plant's berries turned white and parasitic as Figga's cursed the baleful plant. She uncursed it eventually, returning it to the ground and red berries perhaps it's the reason why people mistake holly and mistletoe together.

"yes, how curious indeed. To carry the only weapon that can kill you as their wand." Lily Potter destroyed all the Holly wands in his shop except that one he made after Lily Potter's death. "then again, no magic will affect him unless casted with a holly wand. It's the only wand that will allow a spell to be casted on himself. Hopefully, it doesn't end the way I think it might"
