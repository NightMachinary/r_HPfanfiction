If memory serves, the text is a bit vague on whether properly created Horcruxes are inherently durable, or if it's the result of later enchantment.

Strictly speaking, Harry was never subjected to the ritual that creates Horcruxes (which is apparently very involved), so he's more like a pseudo-horcrux. Easy enough to tweak that narratively into including invulnerability.
