I don't think the diary would've been destroyed by putting it in fire or by ripping the pages, it was drowned by Ginny and it did not look at all like how books do after getting even a little water on them, going of the movies visual here, since I don't clearly remember it being stated in the books.

It's safe to assume it won't be affected by any normal way of destroying it.

Also the trio try variety of spells on the locket to destroy it, but nothing happens to it. Either Voldy put extra magical protections to his horcruxes or the protections are the result of them being horcruxes.
