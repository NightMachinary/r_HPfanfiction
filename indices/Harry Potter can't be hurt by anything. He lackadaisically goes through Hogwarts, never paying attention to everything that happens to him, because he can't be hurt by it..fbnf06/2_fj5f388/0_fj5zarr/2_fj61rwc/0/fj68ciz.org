Horcruxes cannot be damaged by normal stuff because the first step written in the instructions is something close to "/prepare a suitable vessel, idiot/", and most wizard powerfull enough to create an Horcruxe are powerfull enough to make an item "really" sturdy.

Potentially, any Horcruxe like the diary could have used as an Horcruxe without any enchantment, except that anyone could have destroyed it by ripping the pages or putting it in a fire.
