Ethnic magic seems reasonable enough. I bet there is some epic jewish magic passed down since the days of moses, who of cause would have had to be an amazingly powerful wizard to part the sea. Power acquired by the sacrifice off every first born in Egypt. Accents are annoying to read in general, especially Hagrid's.
