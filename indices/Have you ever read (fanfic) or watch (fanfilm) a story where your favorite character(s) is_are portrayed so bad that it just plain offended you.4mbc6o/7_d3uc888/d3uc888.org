It's a shame that the fanfilm you watched was like that. I'd seen quite a bit of promotion on various social media sites for it and I was going to check it out when I had the time, but if it's one of those 'Snape was tragically misunderstood! The (unspeakably evil) Marauders bullied him and blackmailed Lily! Snape is a Good Guyâ„¢!' projects then I won't bother.

On a side note, Snape apologists and Snape fans who want to turn Severus into an entirely blameless, perfect character confuse me. For me, one of the things I really appreciate about Snape's character is his moral complexity. He's neither irredeemably bad or completely good, and that makes him so much more interesting. Why turn Severus into a two-dimensional hero when you already have the flawed but fascinating three-dimensional person?
