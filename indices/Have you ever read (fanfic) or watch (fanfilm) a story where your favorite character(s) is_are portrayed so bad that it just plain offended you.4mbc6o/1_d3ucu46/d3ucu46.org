Honestly, any characterisation of Lucius Malfoy usually makes me WINCE. The guy's a politician with a temper problem, but the way people normally characterize him is ridiculous - he's normally some sort of bumbling idiot, the evilest monster to ever live whose son is terrified of him and doesn't love him (I blame the movies for this one), or a flat villain in the background.

I love exploring Narcissa and Lucius as Arthur and Molly's mirrors, and all four of these characters are more complex than just cardboard cut-outs of Good and Evil, but moreover, the idea that Narcissa and Lucius don't love Draco is just... It's not even insulting to me, it's just ???

What a mess.

Most Snape characterizations I despise for the same reason as you. He's either a goody-two shoes who totes loves Lily and would never do a darn thing wrong, or he's the worst most evil bat monster of the dungeons.

Marauder characterisation usually hurts me for the same reason - Peter Pettigrew is my favourite of the four, but he's either portrayed as the fat useless one in the background or the member of the group that everyone secretly dislikes.

With James, Sirius and Remus, I think people struggle with the idea that the three of them can be good people while also having been bullies at school, which they were. Snape aside, they were known to do big nasty pranks on various Slytherin kids, and that doesn't mean they weren't on the Light side, or even that they weren't mostly good people.

But they were bullies, pure and simple, and they enjoyed causing other kids pain and discomfort for a good laugh, just like Fred and George.

Generally my issue is the black-and-white mentality a lot of fanfic authors tend to take - if they like a character, said character can do no wrong, and if they don't like them, that character has never so much as pet a kitten without an evil ulterior motive.

It's sad more than anything else.
