I generally just treat every story as a different universe to save on some annoyance. But I'm bored of evil Dumbledore, yes harry had issues with him in book 5, yes he wasn't perfect, but some people are just so black and white about it. In fact any character that is black and white evil/awful all of a sudden or desperately sappy and teenage romantic out off nowhere bores me. Complexity and depth please. Although I enjoyed that Snape fanfilm despite its pro-Snape angle. It was just nice to see something with such good producion values and I though the casting was excellent.
