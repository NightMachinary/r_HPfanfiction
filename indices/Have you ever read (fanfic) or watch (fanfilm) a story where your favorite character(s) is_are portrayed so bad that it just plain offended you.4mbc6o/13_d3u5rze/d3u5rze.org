I know!! I just don't understand all that excitement around Snape. I saw this fanfilm months ago and I actually liked Peter and Remus actors, but that's all there is to like in my opinion. When I started reading fanfiction, it confused me why people often put him as Harry's mentor or father figure or Hermione's lover, etc. I just can't imagine it :) I actually liked the character much more in books. Now I just avoid fics, where he is listed among the main characters. As for marauders, I think a lot of people started to demonise them after book revelation when they bullied Snape in 5 year. But Snape fans take it to some extreme levels, portraying him as some misunderstood hero... He is not a hero, but I respect his character, because in the end, he chose the right thing and stuck with it even if it was difficult. Personally, I don't find his love for Lily that touching, and I don't think his actions completely redeem the fact he is a bully himself and that he actually told Voldemort the prophecy (so what if he went to Dumbledore to save Lily, what would have happened if it was just Neville?), but that is just my opinion. (sorry for my English, I don't speak that well)
