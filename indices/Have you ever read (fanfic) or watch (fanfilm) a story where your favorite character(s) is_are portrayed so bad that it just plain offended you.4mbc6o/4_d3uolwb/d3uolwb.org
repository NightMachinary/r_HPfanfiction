God yes. Anything by Robst, for instance, in which /everyone/ is OOC to the point of absurdity. Whitewashing characters mostly just makes them boring, not that the canon characters were super complex to begin with, but doing it to Snape just makes no sense. I mean, doesn't that just destroy his appeal? Aside from his association with the late (and 'smexy') Alan Rickman, what would you have left?

Anyway, generally speaking, character bashing is one of the things I dislike most about Potterfic. I don't even really like the Weasleys that much as characters, but 'Weasley Bashing' fics utterly destroy my immersion in a story. It's like... they replaced the entire cast of characters with brain-damaged political caricatures, and I can't form an emotional attachment to that. Dumbledore bashing, likewise, because I have difficulty believing a villain that stupid has a place in literature. Evil Dumbledore, I could maybe see, but I've never seen it done well. Hermione, with bashing, usually gets to be a minion of 'The Man' or else gets to be Harry's simpering cheerleader, both of which are severely OOC and not even interesting to compensate.

The most effective way to bash Harry is to make him super powerful (but only in a boring, DBZ sort of way) and change his name to Lord Harisadrian Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Uzumaki-Slytherin-Aozaki-Gryffindor-le Fey. Then everyone will hate him. It's already too late.
