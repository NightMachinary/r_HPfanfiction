Snape is my favorite but I cannot read any fics with him where is totally a good guy. It's way way too out of character. He needs to be broody amd snarky and frankly sometimes mean, even if he is doing good he cant be all sweet and lovely while doing it. I read snape fics almost exclusively and those are the ones i cannot stand.
