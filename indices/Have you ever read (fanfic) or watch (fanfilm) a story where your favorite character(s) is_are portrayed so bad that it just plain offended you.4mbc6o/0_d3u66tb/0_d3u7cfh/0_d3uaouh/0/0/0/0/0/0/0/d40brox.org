Well reasoned (Harry not applying himself because he's basically rich (did Rowling ever clarify how rich he is - compared to the Malfoys for example - ?) and doesn't really need to (hell: He's not above using his fame/personal relationship to get into the aurors without any NEWTs!)...sometimes I'd really want to be in this world to smack some SENSE into HARRY FUCKING POTTER...sometimes I understand Snape, even if I don't like him either!) and thanks for the links, I'll read those fictions soon ;)

Question: Any were Hermione is in a pairing (not Ron, Draco, Snape, Lucius, Tom or Dumbledore, please (and also not Krum if possible)) and where it's not "character POV" (instead: omniscient narrator if possible)
