I know that HP/SS is VERY POPULAR...almost as much as Harry/Draco (and in theory I'd have nothing against said pairing as both of them are academics (He's not a potions-master because he hates studying, is he?), both are often under-valued by their peers etc. - it's just that I don't think Hermione would EVER date someone who's as much of an asshole as Snape, not to mention someone who's so much older than her...de-aging or time-travel might work here of course!)

Yeah, that position (all knowing narrator) is hard to pull off :) (but it's great to read if the author knows his stuff!)

Yeah, Harry has money but he still often enough plays the "I am a poor orphan"-card sadly (I mean in his shoes I'd do what many fanfiction-writers have him do: Go shopping for clothes (and other much needed items)...and I dislike shopping for clothes, so that IMHO shows how bad I think the situation is!)...pisses me off, too

Female-Slash? Don't care (meaning: I don't hate it - I don't look for it normally, but I don't have a problem with it...I am usually very tolerant toward LGBTs, I just don't read slash normally, especially if it's between characters that HATE each other in canon (not only in Harry Potter, I'd never read similar pairings in other universes either...just squicks me, I mean not only do you mutilate the character's opinions but you also have to change their sexuality and then pair them with one of his/her enemies...really? Still, as I said: Female-Slash is ok!))

ps: What would be those most popular pairings bar Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Ron (note: I'd love to know what attracts her to him...they are like matter and anti-matter IMHO...the academic and the slacker, the cultured, well read and the buffoon etc.) and of course Hermione/Tom (or Voldemort)?

Well, I don't read Hermione-Centric stuff normally (might change now!), but I've seen fictions that pair her with Dumbledore (!), just like I've seen Harry/Sirius or Harry/Remus (!)
