Yeah, his parents were kinda sueish at times, though mainly because everyone in the Potterverse seemed to know/like them until the 5th book. And it was... /okay/, for a childrens' book, where the orphan's dead parents were seen as almost universally good people, I guess. It's cliche as hell, and kinda boring from an adult perspective, but it's... okay, I guess, because early Potter stories really are Scooby Doo tbh.

And yes, Harry squanders his talents, because he's pretty much the epitome of the rich, vapid white guy. Despite his upbringing. Which makes no fucking sense, but Rowling wrote it, not me. He pretty much always acted like it, snarking mentally at the Dursleys and generally acting like a bit of a dick, but the moment he gets his money... that's the point that he never worries about his position in life ever again. Because being incredibly famous for rather shaky reasons wasn't enough. It's kinda sad. Ron can be similar, but not quite so obviously. Ron using magic to cheat on his driving test in the epilogue pretty much sums up their attitude, tbh. I think the lack of curiosity (especially on the part of the muggle-raised) is a failure of imagination on the part of JKR, because it applies to all of the characters fairly evenly.

Anyway, fanfic recs... linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is a decent place to start, if you haven't read it already, and expounds upon the canon emotional element to magic in what feels like a logical way.

I'm very fond of linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites), though it's more romance than anything. Fairly exotic premise, and it pretty much single-handedly persuaded me that lesbian!Hermione was worth reading. There's a little Hermione/Ron, but it doesn't last.

Some might recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer), although I found that it got boring at times, mostly after Hermione was pulled out of Hogwarts. Apparently there's a sequel now, so I might give it another shot. Definitely worth a look, either way.

If you don't mind crossovers with a (generally) bad anime, linkffn(Effloresco Secundus) was excellent.

I have more, but not sure on your preferences with regard to femslash. I'm kinda hesitant to read het romance these days, largely because the HHr fandom put me off it (bashing too stronk. I think I've developed a nervous reaction to the word 'Dumbles'). I seriously started reading femslash because romance where the woman isn't treated like a fashion accessory to god!Harry was apparently too much to ask for :/
