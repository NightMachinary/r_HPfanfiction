You might be spot on (Rowling ain't Shakespeare after all!) mostly, but I disagree with - supposedly - having to make Harry a passive observer (she didn't need to, but she just did anyway and what could have been a great series (still isn't bad - I just like fanfiction a lot more because the world's just great for that!) with a tried and proven formula (the heroe's journey!) becomes "how to fail yourself to success" -.-) - if Harry had been more active, smart and interested in shit then the world might be even more fleshed out etc. because he'd have asked questions (for starters: "Tell me MORE about my parents" "Can I see my parents academical records?" "Tell me about my family" etc. - later on branching out into magic, government (when the ministry is slandering him at the latest!) etc.) instead of just taking what he got on the way (unless his fun - quidditch - got interrupted, I bet that he'd not have learned the patronus if the dementors didn't disrupt quidditch games!)
