Yeah, he's pretty much suicidally uncurious about the world. It's a damned shame, and why I mostly read Hermione-centric fanfic nowadays. Suemione may be kinda annoying at times, but at least she usually asks the kind of questions I would want to, in her position, without including the icky sexist shenanigans that indy!Harry is rife with.

And yeah, I think you're right about the quidditch thing. It's pretty much his sole defining interest, and frankly, quidditch was stupid as all hell (from a sporting perspective). People wiser and more eloquent than myself have dissected the stupidity of quidditch over the past decade and more. Harry is, in many respects, a bit of a jock stereotype, actually. He's friends with a nerd, and passes off a decent chunk of his work onto her throughout the series, but never actually gives a fuck about /magic school/, because he's honestly a bit vapid like that. You know, despite this being a series about *fucking magic school*. How do you manage not to give a fuck about screwing the laws of physics with your mind? Well, if you're Harry Potter, /quite easily/, because it doesn't usually involve a broomstick.

The point behind all of that bile I just spewed is that it boggles my mind how we have a series about magic school where we learn so little about how magic even works in the Potterverse. As in, there is no real underlying rules to how (or why) magic works or anything, and the best we can infer is that some magic is partially based on emotional state during casting. But not all, and not evenly, because... reasons. Potions involve mixing bits of magical creatures together in a ritualistic manner, with a technique so precise that it would never be discovered naturally, and this works because... reasons. Oh, and there's an ill-defined ritualistic component where certain acts have deep magical significance (drawing Gryffindor's sword, lifedebts, alchemy like Voldy's return, etc) because... reasons.

I don't particularly mind Harry as is, but I weep for all of the things we could have learned had he (and many of the other supporting characters) been more curious and proactive where we can see it. The Weasley twins, while horrible bullies, do so much experimentation during the series, but we (the reader) learn jack shit about magic in the time being. The most concrete thing I think we get in six damn years is that you can't transfigure food, and that was only because the idea that Wizards didn't need to worry about food scarcity bugged Rowling so much.
