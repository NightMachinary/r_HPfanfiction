No, she never did. He seems to have N-1 galleons, where N represents an infinite quantity. He has exactly as much money as is required by the plot, but not actually an infinite supply, not that he ever does anything with it anyway. Snape had a point, even if he was a colossal douchenozzle. Honestly, a lot of Harry's traits can be summed up as 'exactly as much as required by the plot', his curiosity for instance, or how famous he is at any given moment.

Omniscient narrator is something I basically never see, not that specifically seek it out. As in, I could count the instances I've seen on an amputee's stump. I'm not overly fond of it, because most people can't pull it off, and the field of Hermione-centric fanfic isn't huge either. Especially considering the pairing parameters you specified (do you have any idea how popular Hr/SS is?). Basically, if I've read any with an omniscient narrator, I don't remember it, I'm afraid.

Since you seem to dislike the idea of her being in most of the popular setups (bar H/Hr, I guess), how do you feel about shipping her with another woman?

Edit: Is Hermione/Dumbledore really popular enough for you need to specify? I'd never even considered them, tbh, although I guess time travel is probably involved? Dat generation gap would be hellish for writing romance.
