Indeed, in Harry's shoes I'd probably turn into a kind of Hermione 2.0 (I'd learn magic just so I can screw around with reality, to make stuff I always wanted to have, like say a HOVERBOARD (they made a broom fly, so why not make something like THAT?) among other things and to be able to defend myself against everybody and everything possible!)...with less social awkwardness of course ;)

I do mind, because his parents are always lauded as being so great (come on James might have SQUANDERED his talents on pranks, but the guy was a genius in transfiguration, a teenage animagus and made one of the greatest things in the series (with the other Marauders): The Marauders' Map! Not to mention that Lily was kind of a better version of Hermione (more attractive and supposedly smarter))...I bet his parents would SCOLD him, LOUDLY if they were alive and treated school etc. like he did (I mean the guy is practically SUICIDAL (!) because he doesn't learn/train to really defend himself (it's only because of innate talent that he's this good in defense!))

On the other hand: All that applies to MOST of his classmates (the only ones openly CURIOUS about magic are the twins - and only if it's prank-related -.-)

ps: I'd like to read some of those Hermione centric fictions (note: Not Hermione/Ron if possible and not Draco/Hermione either (I'll read them if really well done, but only then!) - oh: Hermione/Snape (or Dumbledore, or Lucius Malfoy or Tom Riddle!) is TOTALLY OFF THE TABLE...sorry, hate those pairings)
