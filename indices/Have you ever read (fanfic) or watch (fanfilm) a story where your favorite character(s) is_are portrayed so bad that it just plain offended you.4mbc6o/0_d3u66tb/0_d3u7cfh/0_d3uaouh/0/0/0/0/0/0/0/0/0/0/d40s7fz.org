I'm not sure how well HHr and RHr are doing atm compared to one another, but Hermione/Ron is pretty popular, yes. I just tend to notice HHr more because of the egregious amounts of fail that come out of that fandom. I used to really like the pairing, but the rampant bashing and general stupidity of a large portion of its proponents has put me right off. I'm honestly swinging more toward Bellamione now, crazy as that sounds, because Hermione really /does/ have a prominent nasty streak in canon, and seeing Bellatrix developed more was always interesting. Those Gilded Chains really changed the way I look at them, certainly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Go read it, btw.]] It's very slow development, and they /do/ hate each other for a long time, especially at the beginning, but people have a capacity to change, and Bellatrix isn't as flat as she was in canon, so the romantic angle sort of creeps up on you. There's no character mutilation that I've noticed, although Bellatrix is a good deal more complex than the lol!Evil character she was in canon. This doesn't particularly change the way she behaves, at least at first, though it weakens her bond to Voldemort in one particularly crucial way. Basically, she's not as /mindlessly/ fanatical as she appears, and has reasons for following him that he inadvertently damaged in the leadup to the battle of Hogwarts. Hermione has no idea she's into women for ages, either, so I wouldn't say it's 'changing' her sexuality, more like a slow realisation that she's not sexually interested in Ron. In many respects, it reminds me of my own realisation that I was bi.

I think with Ron and Hermione it's their joint sense that bickering is natural. Ron bickered with his family, and presumably Hermione did with hers (from what we see of her), whereas for Harry that means 'abuse', and he doesn't really get it. For them, it means they're comfortable with the person. At least, that's how I've seen it put by others. Also, Hermione could be really intimidated by someone as smart as she is, at least until she grew up a bit. See how she reacted in HBP, although I always felt that it was a character derailment on Rowling's part to have her treat Harry like this over a stupid book. Ron always needed outside reassurance of his own worth, and Hermione provides that. They're not divinely-ordained lovers or anything, but I could see it working in theory. I just happen to think Rowling is shit at writing romance, and the books would probably have been better had she stayed well away from the attempt. She's actually written other books besides HP, some of which contain romance, and... well, I wouldn't shred them for my hamster to piss on, tbh. The poor little guy might get some kind of rash.

I misread when I started talking about Hermione-centric stuff, because you were mostly just talking about pairings that involve her. That's my personal biases slipping in there, I think. I mostly like them because they subvert the Harry-centric nature of most fanfiction, and often take things in directions Harry is not wont to touch. But yeah, I could definitely see Snape, because Hermione can be pretty dickish herself, canonically. I mean, if I can picture her with Bellatrix, it'd be hypocritical to say I couldn't see it working with Snape, y'know? Draco/Hermione? Meh. I always thought he had more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did, if only because Ginny wasn't developed enough, and their mutual obsessions. Pairing him with Hermione seems like it would be quite mediocre.
