I would blame Rowling's own poor writing skills on that one. She wrote herself into a corner, and when push came to shove, she had a deadline to push out a seventh book, but basically every character is flying blind in that book. They wander from scene to scene with very little idea of where to go next, or what to do, and there's tons of filler, but my point is that book seven was a mess, and it's not really Hermione's fault.

She's fairly passive, just like the rest of the heroes, and the 'proactive Hermione who actually solves problems' thing is largely a fanon construct. It's one I happen to like, because someone likeable and competent in this damned series would be a godsend, but it's fanon. She's kinda a dick, canonically, and on an even footing for 'not doing stuff' with Ron/Harry. I think part of the reason people make Harry passive ('whipped' as you put it) is that his canon role is as an observer/follower, rather than a leader. He's our viewpoint into the Wizarding World, so he naturally has to be somewhat detached from it, necessitating him to be somewhat passive in his approach. It also makes him less likeable as a character.
