Indeed, that's the actual problem with that pairing - Harry often becomes wipped (sure he studies and learns etc. - but it's to please Hermione, not because he wants to) and it's Hermione who's suddenly the hero (reminds me of the last book somehow - must be because of Rowling who dismantles her hero totally, while giving Hermione more "screen-time"...Harry only wins because of Dumbledore's stupid plan, loads of help and a shit-ton of luck -.-))
