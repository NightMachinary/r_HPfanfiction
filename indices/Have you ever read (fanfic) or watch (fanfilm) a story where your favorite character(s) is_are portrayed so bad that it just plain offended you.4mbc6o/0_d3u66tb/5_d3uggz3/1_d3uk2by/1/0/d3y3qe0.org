You didn't use any quotes. You might think you remember the books well but it seems you get little details wrong, and your interpretation of what's going on "between the lines" is very liberal.

The passage about choosing the subjects is thus:

#+begin_quote
  "But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him."
#+end_quote

Ron has absolutely no direct input here, certainly not bullying.

I don't think Hermione used Ancient Runes or Arithmancy in creating the DA parchment, and we're told she used the Protean charm for the coins, so it's obviously not those subjects.

About Divination, Harry had some dreams that seemed prophetic from time to time (for instance: /"Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realised he had forgotten his Firebolt./" quite resembles the first task). McGonagall belittled Divination very early (which turned out to be bullshit), so Harry's approach to it was nonchalant, but if it wasn't, he might have taken those dreams (and Trelawny's prophecy about Pettigrew) more seriously, and used them to prepare for the future.
