You've SEEN the quotes I used (he makes Harry join him - which isn't a bad thing (I made friends join me in electives, too - but I didn't select lazy ass classes I could go get by doing almost nothing in!))?

I don't need to read the books again (I remember them well enough) - stuff I say might not be stated outright, but if you read between the lines you (well: I!) at least get those vibes!

Yeah, I know that the electives are under-used :( (sadly...Rowling should have shown how Hermione makes the cursed DA-Parchment at the very least IMHO, same for the coins!)

Ok, how's this debatable? Diviniation was never usefull (he overhears Trewlany utter a true profecy, sure but that's it - that could easily have happened when running into her in the corridor!)
