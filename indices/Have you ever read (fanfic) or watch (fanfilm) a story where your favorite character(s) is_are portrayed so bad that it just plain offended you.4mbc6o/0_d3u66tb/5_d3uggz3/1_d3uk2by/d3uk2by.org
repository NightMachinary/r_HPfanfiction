Man, you really need to go through the books again. The amount of fanon crap you're spewing is staggering.

Someone being a lazy slacker is no reason to not befriend him. Ron didn't mock Hermione for paying attention in class (only for being patronizing in a very insulting way), and he didn't bully Harry into taking those classes, Harry was just ambivalent about what classes to take and thought it would generally be better with Ron.

And considering how rarely Arithmancy and Ancient Runes are used in canon (about once each), I don't think his choice in classes is bad at all. CoMC is important considering all the dangerous creatures Harry encounters (as well as useful creatures, like Hippogriffs and Thestrals), and Divination, while it won't make Harry a seer (debatable, actually), certainly gives, for instance, an insight into magical symbolism.
