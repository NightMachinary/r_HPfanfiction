Nope - I really don't get it! Do I vote down people who think some character (Snape, Draco, Ron, Dumbledore etc.) is the best since sliced bread?

No, I don't (I voice my disagreement - maybe! - but I don't use the voting button as a disagree-button which it's not!)...oh, well, that's life (have fun voting this comment down as well!)!

ps: Telling someone to go kill themselves is never ok (maybe if done jokingly when being face to face with a friend - otherwise? Nope!)
