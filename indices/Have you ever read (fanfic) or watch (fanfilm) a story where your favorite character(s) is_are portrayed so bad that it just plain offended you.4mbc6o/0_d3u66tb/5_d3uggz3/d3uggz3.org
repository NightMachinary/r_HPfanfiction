You don't need to go that far (just makes it easier - probable because Harry has a tendency to forgive a lot of shit (he even prevented Sirius and Remus from killing Pettigrew after all - while I personally would have probably cast the curse myself because I think the rat deserves to DIE!))...still, Ron is a lazy slacker (look at the classes he "bullies" Harry into taking when they select their electives...easy peasy classes that aren't all that valuable over all...creatures is only usefull if you want to go into that field, like Charly Weasley did, and don't get me started on fraudy-nation (known as divination) with Trewlawny who might be an oracle, but no true seer!) and look at his attitude towards class (even in first year he mocks Hermione for paying attention and trying to correct his pronounciation (which also almost gets her killed - it's also not him who rescues her (sure he's there, but only because of Harry!), nope it's Harry!))...he's also sexist IMHO (he sees the perfect woman as a housewife, like his mother!)

Rape and becoming a DE? I don't know if done right it could happen (look at PETER PETTIGREW, the "Ron" of the Marauders!), but it's been done to death, so maybe just a jealous slacker who doesn't amount to much - is that too much to ask for? ;)
