I did read it in my late teens (I was 16) and I wouldn't have reacted like Ron did as a teen ever (so I am not projecting anything adult on him, Hermione and Harry)...I might have told her to mind her own business (maybe - probably not, I don't tell people to bugger off if they want to help), but that's it!

That's why I used QUOTES (are you all fucking blind?) - Harry is a follower in a lot of situations where he should actively take an intereset it, but he just doesn't care! Still: It's bad form that Ron convinces Harry to go with him to classes that Harry might not even like (Ron has heard stuff about Hogwarts from his brothers, Harry doesn't know jack-shit - yes: He didn't ask either, I know!)

I read the books (except the last one - couldn't stand Rowling destroying her "hero" (I had my gripes with Harry before and had always hoped that he'd wake up, take action, tell people like Dumbledore etc. to leave him the hell alone etc...but that book took it too far (it makes Harry out to be a bumbling idiot while giving the "hero" slot to other characters (Hermione, Neville etc.))...it was pissing me off, so I never finished that book (heard about the epilogue and did want to burn a physical copy - luckily I never bought one because friends lent the books to me!))
