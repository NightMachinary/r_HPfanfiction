I don't understand the massive hatred Ron has. I mean, I get that if you want to pair Harry and Hermione together you need to get that whole canon business out of the way somehow, but do you really need to accomplish that by making Ron into a lazy sexist incompetent blowhard of a Death Eater who gleefully rapes Hermione and kills her kids?
