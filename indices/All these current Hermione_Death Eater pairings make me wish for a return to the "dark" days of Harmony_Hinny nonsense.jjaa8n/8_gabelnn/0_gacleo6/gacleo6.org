Yeah, Harmony fans can get pretty nasty (I mean hell, I'm a Harry/Hermione fan myself). However, there are some good Harry/Hermione fans out there...somewhere deep in the corner pockets of the fandom. Also, I don't mean to put myself on a pedestal or anything, but I don't think I'm too bad. For instance, I do like the Harry/Ginny pairing when properly developed and I actually like the Weasley family (including Molly, Ron, and Ginny). The users on the Harry/Hermione Facebook page...now they're a rough bunch (and that's one of the reasons why I don't visit the Facebook page anymore).
