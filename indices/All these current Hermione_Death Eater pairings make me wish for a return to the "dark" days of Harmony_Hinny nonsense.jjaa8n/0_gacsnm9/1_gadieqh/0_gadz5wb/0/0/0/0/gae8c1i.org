By that argument then you have no problem with any of the pairings you just want to be written better and yet I dont get that sense from your post or responses so I'm going to go on a limb here and say you are being disingenuous and are not critiquing stories genuinely but rather whining your fictional romance pairings are better than others fictional romance pairings.
