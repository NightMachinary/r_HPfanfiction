It's not to be expected from someone dominant. There's a difference between story and reality, and if someone who cares about BDSM acknowledges that then there shouldn't be issue. This is fanfiction, not a published work, 500,000 copies sold, actively demeaning and misrepresenting people's relationships and changing society's perception of how things are. Your complaint has merit but not when there's no scale
