People can choose to interpret canon events however they please. They can also misinterpret events, or simply not provide their own interpretation or ignore giving an interpretation at all. Maybe it's normalised for that writer or maybe they're just trying to write smut for their two fav characters. BDSM is a complex thing. I think defending people (id est characters) that don't need defending is just pulling pigtails. These are characters being written down for people's enjoyment. Even irl, people in the BDSM or raceplay scene still choose to participate willingly, no matter how much it makes PC people want to tear their hair out. And they don't need defending if they enjoy it and do so of their own free will
