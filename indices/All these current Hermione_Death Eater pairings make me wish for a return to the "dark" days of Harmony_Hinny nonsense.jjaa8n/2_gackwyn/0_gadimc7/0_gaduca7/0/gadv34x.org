It's not that they diverge from canon that's the issue, all fanfiction does that. It's that they take the characters from canon events where one abused the other, just ignore that without rewriting it, and suddenly have them shagging like they've always been lovers.

It's the “Draco was still Draco oh but it was all pulling pigtails, Hermione just knew that all along, now he's her Domme” stuff that's sketchy because it portrays the canon events as normal.
