Thing is though many of these fics, having personally read some to try to understand why these pairings are popular, aren't "dark" though. They don't explore themes of control or manipulation, abuse, power dynamics etc.

They go full "sex pants Draco" or "Snape sexy because Rickman", chuck in "BDSM" as a tag on AO3, and just ignore every aspect of canon that makes these characters awful to instead just pretend they never did anything bad.
