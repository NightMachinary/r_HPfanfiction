Looking through the small abstracts to each chapter, I can definitely see your point. I guess that I along with the trio lander in how comfortable the relationship is at this point ,so everything around it registered merely as packaging, or how one might wish to put it. Sure, the political angle have taken a very much bigger role than in the previous installment, something I honestly hadn't thought about. But still, the scenes where we see the triad act against eachother us still gold to me, even if most hurdles seem to be in the past at the moment. I would like to see a similar scene to the Savage/Serpentine affair again and how the result would be very different with relationship in the form as it is today.
