I will admit to not have very much against the Pureblood Politics-setting, but I firmly believe that those themes have been more or less subtly hinted at since the first(?) chapter of the second part, where Hermione derides Harry for not attending his Wizengamot sessions during the dinner at the Lupin's.

As for being drawn out, I more perceive it as all those foreshadows that was dropped during The World's a Stage finally playing out. The author has hinted at a greater storyline spanning several installments.

The Harem-dynamic was also foreshadowed, first I believe in the after-raid healing session, when Harry is cautioned to how his power may attract followers. I believe that it's not long after that Daphne and Pansy debates the eventual Coven.

But sure, if those are elements that a reader doesn't appreciate, then I can see where the fic would be unsatisfying. But I believe that the reader had a long time to prepare for this.

As an endnote, it is one of my absolute favorites so I might be somewhat defensive.
