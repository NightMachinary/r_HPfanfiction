It was not my intention to justify myself :) It‘s just funny that people get so upset over a habit I picked up as an 11 year old.

But then again, might have been a weird 11 year old, the Snapecast introduced me to fanfiction. At the time my English was not good and I didn‘t bother looking up what the „explicit“ tag meant and just assumed it was a sign of good content. I was also very confused about the meaning of citrus fruit in fan culture, but I found out quick enough.
