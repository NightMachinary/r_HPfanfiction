I‘ve been reading Snape/Hermione exclusively for more than 10 years now. Fight me.

There are a lot of fics featuring that pairing that are not about dominance and racism. I also wouldn‘t necessarily say that Snape is a Death Eater, as I believe that he had truly changed, but that‘s just my opinion. The thing I like most about the pairing is the various interpretations of their relationship paired with all the external conflicts that can arise, every fic has its own dynamic and if you filter them accordingly to your tastes, you will also never read anthing non consensual or overly dark. Fics are well tagged most of the time.

As the other person said, don‘t like don‘t read. As for me, I‘ve had a blast.
