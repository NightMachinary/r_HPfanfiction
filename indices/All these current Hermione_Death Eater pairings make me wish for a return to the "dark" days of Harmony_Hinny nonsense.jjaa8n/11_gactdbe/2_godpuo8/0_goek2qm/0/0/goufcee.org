Hi, itâ€˜s me again ðŸ˜Š I just finished your first recommendation and I enjoyed it greatly. I really liked the emotional subtlety. Many fics just plainly describe emotional states plainly, while this one is more vague and open for interpretation. I really need to figure out how to effectively search stories on AO3, I might be missing out on some gems right now. And yes, Second Life is an absolute classic ðŸ˜Š Maybe I should reread that one some time soon, itâ€˜s been a while.

I hope you are doing well and thanks again for sharing ðŸ˜Š

Also I might have looked at your post history and have definitely joined the Snape subreddit right now. Ever since the Snapecast stopped putting out new episodes I felt very lonely in the fandom, this might be a place that shares my appreciation and passion for once.
