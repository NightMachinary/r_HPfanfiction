o hey there! isn't it a beautiful fic?! im so glad you enjoyed it. [[https://reddit.com/r/SeverusSnape/comments/lrhbwo/doesnt_anyone_touch_you/][i actually ended up drawing a silly sketch of one of the lines lol]]

yasss it can be difficult to search on Ao3 sometimes. I find that searching and filtering by kudos/comments nets higher quality fics, but definitely miss out on hidden gems that way

here's some fic recs from tumblr that i saved as well! (the blog post isn't mine, just a post i saved lol)
