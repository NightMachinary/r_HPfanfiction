I saw that sketch ðŸ˜… Itâ€˜s certainly a talent to both accurately preserve the hurt and vulnerability while turning it into a meme ðŸ˜‚

Definitely checking out that post, Iâ€˜m in the mood for more right now ðŸ‘€ Also would you mind if I dmâ€˜ed you? Exchanging fic recs would be lovely, and while I do still read regularily, I am well past the obsessive days of my youth lol. So you wouldnâ€˜t be bombarded.
