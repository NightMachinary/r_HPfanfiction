absolutely sure!! i think i sent a dm your way (but am pretty bad at technology so it may not have sent)

also dunno if you like Naruto but i have some KakaSaku recs as well (i like that ship because it reminds me of sshg but set in a different universe/slightly less antagonistic starting pointðŸ¤£)

this oneshot in particular is really wonderful, I've read it several times. tbh, it's probably one of the best I've ever read. (it's an AU so you don't even need to be into the show:)
