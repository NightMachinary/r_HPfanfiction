I'm on tumblr, and most people seem to be anti-reylo, it appears to be mainly Twitter. However, as far as Reylo as a ship goes, it's one of the more volatile fanbases, and that's from someone in the BNHA fandom. To be fair, you are right that most of the time it's a vocal minority, that's an issue.
