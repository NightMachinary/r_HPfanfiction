C'mon man. Its the writer's choice to write any shipping s(he) may want. The most you should do is ignore them if you don't like them. And you must not give it a bad review just b'coz you don't like the plot. The negative review is for bad writing style or grammatical error, etc. If you don't like the plot, then why do you need to read it? Plenty of fics to read, move on!!
