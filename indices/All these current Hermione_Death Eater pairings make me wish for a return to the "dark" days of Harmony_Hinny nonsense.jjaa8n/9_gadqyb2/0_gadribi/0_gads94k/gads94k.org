Yeah I get that. It really used to frustrate me when I started. Now... I have just learned to ignore them. It really is no good debating about it. Like the Dramione pairing. I believe that Malfoy could have turned to the light side. But to be on friendly terms with Harry and in relationship with Hermione? Er..... That's too far off of me. Only Ron AND Draco act normally with each other, when Ron isn't like "oh Hermione, you and Harry are always right SO I accept you and Draco being together". Yuck! Whenever I read this stuff I stop reading the fic. My advice - ignore these fics.
