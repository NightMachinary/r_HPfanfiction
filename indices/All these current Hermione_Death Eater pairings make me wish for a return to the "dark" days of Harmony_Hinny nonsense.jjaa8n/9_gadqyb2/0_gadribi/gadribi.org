It's not simply the plot, it's the characterisation where many of these pairings just take the characters straight from canon, add maybe a couple of years to ages to look less sketchy in that aspect, but then are straight to fucking.

The amount of Bellatrix/Hermione fics put out where it's just straight up as they were from canon with the only change being Hermione likes being tortured and treated as lesser is creepy.
