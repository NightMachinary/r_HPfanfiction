I keep on having perfectly fine fics to read and need not to deal with fics I don't like. If people like to write things I don't like to read, it's nice they have inspiration and can write, and I can read something else. Fanfiction can be pretty much everything. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad and the greatness of it is that the good and bad can be different for everyone.
