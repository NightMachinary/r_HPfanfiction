*Forging the Sword* has a nice Trio dynamic where they learn to work together.

*Stygian Trilogy* has one of the best ensemble casts I've seen, it's next gen with 3 canon characters and a bunch of OC's, most of whom are really fantastically developed.

*The Phoenix and the Serpent* is Harry-centric and has a large ensemble cast.

I suppose *A Second Chance at Life* has a nice ensemble cast, but the quality is pretty markedly below the three above.
