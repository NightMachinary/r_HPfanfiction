I must have been lucky, because so far I've only encountered positive reactions when I say I'm reading and writing fanfiction.

The article is good, I think, if a bit too overprotective of fanfiction. I definitely agree that just because it's fanfiction, doesn't mean that the story is inherently worse than original novels. The most notable example for me is the first chapter of linkffn(2636963). That first chapter shocked deeply me and got me so close to crying.

Fanfiction, although it's infused with terrible pieces of shit people call stories, is fun and, dare I say it, an art.

I think escapism is a big part of fanfic too. You discover this world within a book, movie, series etc. and you're enthralled by it. You want to stay in it a little longer. So you read and write fanfiction.

It might seem like a cuckoo's nest, and it really is in many ways, but that doesn't make me love it less. At most it might make me feel guilty when writing with characters someone else created.
