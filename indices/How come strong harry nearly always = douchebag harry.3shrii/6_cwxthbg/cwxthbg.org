I think that the reason that a strong Harry quickly becomes unlikeable is because, when readers write about a powerful protagonist, they want to see him triumph over his enemies. There is a modicum of author surrogacy in this; it is extremely cathartic to see Harry attack Dumbledore/Snape/the Weasleys/the Dursleys/Voldemort etc. etc. because that is what we always want him to do.

However, we, bold denizens of the Harry Potter Fanfiction Subreddit that we are, have become inured to these cases of character bashing; we no longer become filled with glee when powerful!Harry stands up in the Great Hall and starts shouting at all the teachers and, generally, being a douchebag. Perhaps, in our earlier, more innocent days, we did- I know that I, for example, once actually enjoyed reading robst. I know, I know. I shudder at my juvenile behaviour. We look at authors who use Harry as nothing more than a mouthpiece to spout their opinions of characters and despair, knowing that the protagonist in the story is becoming more and more unpleasant with every invocation of "Bumblemore" or "Dumbledork".

TL;DR: Strong!Harry is a douchebag because the people who write Strong!Harry stories are douchebags.
