[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23965102][Cacoethes]] Is a fic I recently finished and found very engaging. Tomarry, Features, Time travel, Slytherin!Harry, Kind of a Horcrux bond between Tom and Harry, Grindelwald as a threat

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26949952][Fine Line]] Harry stumbles over the Diadem!Horcrux while he hides the book of the Half-Blood Prince, which possesses him. So basically he's got Tom Riddle (in his 20s) in his head, who of course follows his own agenda but corrupts Harry alongside the way. Eventual Tom Riddle/Harry Potter *WIP*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681][A Dangerous Game]] is a brilliant WIP Tomarry fic, which features a very well written and manipulative Tom Riddle. *Summary:* Tom Riddle opens the Chamber of Secrets in Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts. After a botched attempt to extract the Horcrux in Harry's scar leaves their souls tied together, Tom is forced to kidnap him when he makes his escape. A story of Horcrux hunting, adventure and unwilling attraction.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/30/]]) Dreams and Darkness Collide. Serial Killer Harry, Minister Tom Riddle. Features, mindgames, bad ppl being killed, Kingsley as head of Aurors and an opposing force, Tomarry. Rather open ending (not complete but worth the read anyway)

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13638300/]]) Hilariously entertaining but sadly only 7 chapters (WiP?) Harry and 2 other Aurors end up in an AU in which Riddle is Minister and Harry ends up working as his personal assistant. Tomarry
