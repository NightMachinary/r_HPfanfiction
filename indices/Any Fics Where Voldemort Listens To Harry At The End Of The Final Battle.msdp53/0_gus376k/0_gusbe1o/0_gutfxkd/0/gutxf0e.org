Heh, I may just have a problem with “empathising with the villain” but this always struck me as odd. Dumbledore was always preaching the idea of how “Love conquers Death” and how Love was the most powerful force in existence. (Even the DoM believes so. Remember the sealed off room?) Anyway, Voldemort; the person who probably needed Love the most (especially as a child) was literally the one person Dumbledore shunned and truly hated. Grindellwald-left to live, but in prison. Snape-pretty much pardoned and entrusted. Draco-sympathised with. Fudge-pitied and indirectly mocked. Tom Riddle-neglected, distrusted almost IMMEDIATELY for no reason and never shown Love.

See? Well this definitely raises more questions. (I'll end this here as it's getting kinda long but I'd love to discuss!)
