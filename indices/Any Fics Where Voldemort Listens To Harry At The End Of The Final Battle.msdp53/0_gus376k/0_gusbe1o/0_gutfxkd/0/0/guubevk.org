Stupidity of youth? Otherwise, there was a story where Harry (in HBP context, when Dumbledore has shown him the memory of Tom Riddle in the orphanage) shouted at Dumbledore exactly because of this: what did he think, that an orphan terrorizing his orphanage-mates because he feels powerless will be turned to The Right Wayâ„¢ by being terrorized into submission? Unfortunately, I cannot find it at the moment.
