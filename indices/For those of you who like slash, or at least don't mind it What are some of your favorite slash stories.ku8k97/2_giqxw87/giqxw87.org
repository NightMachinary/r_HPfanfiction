[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][Soup-pocalypse and The Great Curry Cataclysm]] Eleven years after the war, Draco Malfoy leads a quiet, boring, and perfectly respectable life, thanks very much. Or, at least he does, until a sudden and very unexpected veela awakening causes him to throw soup all over Harry Potter in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25490311][Needs Must]] After Ginny Potter dies suddenly, Severus Snape is among those called in to help Potter juggle his new reality.\\

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26460403][Far From The Tree]] The arrival of Harry Potter's children---snapped back in time, the children themselves guessed, twenty or so years---was the most interesting thing to happen at Hogwarts for years. This has D/s

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19056670][Earning His Forgiveness]] When Snape brushes off James Potter's attempt to make amends, James makes a game out of winning the Slytherin's forgiveness. Instead of giving him some peace of mind, however, the game causes his feelings toward his once rival to spiral out of control in a direction he never anticipated.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9065263][Written on the Heart]] Harry doesn't /mind/ that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] His house liked Draco Malfoy more than him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21758962][Who we are in the shadows]] What happens when you're forced to become the very thing you despise?

Ex-Auror Harry Potter, tossed out of the Ministry for something he had no control over, has been looking for a way back to his former life.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880][All Our Secrets Laid Bare]] Over the six years Draco Malfoy has been an Auror, four of his partners have turned up dead. Harry Potter is assigned as his newest partner to investigate just what is going on.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16135016][Against all Odds]] “Oh no, please, no!” Percival interrupted him, obviously knowing what the older man was talking about. “I read about it, it´s irreversible and binding...” His horrified eyes glanced at Newt before he closed them. “Mercy fucking Lewis--”

“/Percival Galahad Graves!/”

“-- /he´s just a child!/” Percival hissed, glaring at his father.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16138103][you've got the antidote for me]] When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.

He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.

They are not my best ever because most of the HP fanfiction I loved, I read through LJ, etc and I dont have links to them anymore.. But I have read a few of these multiple times. Some of these are the OGs which I adored so much and found them again on AO3. Some of them might have D/s or heavy angst- read all the warnings. I think 2 are from the first fantastic beast movie. I really like Angst and novel length fics. Hope you find at least one of them enjoyable.
