as you said you like generating conversations I have to say I love the trope of Harry being a mess as an adult/human and people (tends to be draco) helping him,

I also love the trope of gay cooking enthusiast Harry!

though honestly I'm just here for gay wholesomeness, and now that I wrote that I only just remembered that I'm making a collection on AO3 for stories with slash and femslash that aren't angst and have happy endings, it's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/low_angst_high_atmosphere_and_queer_wholesomeness][gay as in happy]]

So if people have stories that fit that criteria, then feel free to add them!

Some angst is fine because bad things happen but I want it to be a collection of stories of gays having good lives and finding love and not dying <3
