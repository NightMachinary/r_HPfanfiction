I noticed that you post a lot of requests for fics; do you read all the ones you request or are your posts to generate conversation? In either case, here are my favorite slash fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is hands-down my favorite fic in the fandom (author also wrote 29 and life skills, which I recommend below). With the reluctant help of Snape, Remus rescues Harry from canon level abuse. That's all I really want to say because the less you know, the better.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is a weirdly touching and sensitive fic about a reclusive Draco being forced to interact with the world after a petty act of revenge has unexpected consequences.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]] is so well-known and loved that it's probably unnecessary to include it, but I love it. Harry gets a glimpse into another life he could have led.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] had to have been inspired by a weird prompt. Harry is a recluse, hiding away in his flat. After his toilet breaks, Hermione makes an appointment for him with a toilet salesman. Guess who shows up on his doorstep to sell him a toilet.

I guess I'm a Saras_Girl girl, because I also love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]]. Harry is in his residency as a Healer and gets assigned to a ward staffed by a familiar face.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20636933/chapters/49004756][Making Do]] is a slow burn all about coming back from trauma and living with survivor's guilt.

I legitimately thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]] was a one-shot. I think it was because I devoured it so quickly and I like a lot of one-shots by this author (who_la_whoop). Draco fucks around with an experimental time turner and ends up in a groundhog day situation.

Another writer I love who writes a lot of one-shots is Ignatius Trout. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is one of those. Draco is living in Muggle London and Harry keeps running into him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]] is probably one of my top three fics in the fandom. Harry runs away before his Hogwarts letter comes in and grows up on the streets. The bulk of the story starts when he's older and meets a disillusioned Draco. I love how the magic that Harry uses feels very home-spun and more like the old magics than the easy spells in canon.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-nine]] made me fall in love with Percy. Percy is dealing with survivor's guilt from the war and is incredibly isolated. He starts to engage when an old friend is wrongfully accused of murder. This story has murder, mystery, and romance. Can't go wrong.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] is massively popular and for good reason. Harry never goes to Hogwarts, so Voldemort's rise is much less hindered. He gets found by a ragtag group including Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, and Draco (newly disillusioned with Voldemort's cause).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] is an old favorite of mine. It was started in 2004 and completed in 2006. After a climactic battle, Harry gets zapped back into the Marauders time. This is not a happy fic

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is another one from 2005. Harry is living a happy enough life volunteering at a children's shelter. He has amnesia but is getting by. Until he runs into someone who claims to have known him from his childhood, a past that he can't remember.
