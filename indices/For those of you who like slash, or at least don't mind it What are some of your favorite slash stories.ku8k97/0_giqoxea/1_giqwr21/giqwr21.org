I remember reading Saras_girl fics and Tread Softly.. I remember reading Turn so clearly. Shortly afterwards, I saw somebody had posted this XKCD about angular momentum. And I associate that pic with this fic somehow.

How could it have been so many years? Wow. I know it has been so many years, but it is so hard to believe.

Those were the best days of HP fandom. Before the last two books were released, the fandom was so active. I guess I just forget it was so long ago. The last book was released in 2007. That is 13 years. So almost 14-15 years in fandom. Wow.
