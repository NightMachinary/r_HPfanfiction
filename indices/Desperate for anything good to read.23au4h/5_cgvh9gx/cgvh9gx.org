I haven't really seen anyone mention this one (anywhere really) but I would HIGHLY recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]]; this is a H/HR story, just as a warning. It has one of my personal favorite descriptions of the after effects of the Cruciatus (Ithe story begins RIGHT when Harry returns after Voldemort's Return); it's how I always saw it anyway. Wonderfully written imo.
