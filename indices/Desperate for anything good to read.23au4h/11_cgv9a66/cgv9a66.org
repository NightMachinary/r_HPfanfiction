Methods of Rationality and Prince of the Dark Kingdom are good, albeit incomplete. Prince of the Dark Kingdom diverges greatly from canon, Methods of Rationality less so. LightningOnTheWave has a decent seven-year series, the Sacrifices arc.

Nonjon and Rorschach's Blot are the standard suggestions if you're looking for something with levity.
