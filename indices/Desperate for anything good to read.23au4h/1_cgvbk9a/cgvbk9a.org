[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter & The Fifth Element]] is good, if you don't mind H/Hr. Honestly, I read about 55 chapters in and stopped, but that was mostly because I lost interest in the story, and not any lack of quality. I would definitely suggest it.

I've also enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], which is an interesting mix of Harry Potter and Ender's Game. I was actually really hesitant to pick this one up, but after I started reading, I didn't stop until I went through it all.
