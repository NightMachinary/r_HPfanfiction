Boy, do I have a lot to recommend. Warning: Most are WIPs with one or two one-shots. Also, I tried to note where there are less than 15 chapters. Here goes:

*AU:*

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]]

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. It all started with a letter from home and family. Except, Harry doesn't really have either, does he? He's about to get them. A Snape-adopts-Harry story providing an alternate 6th year. Winner: Multifaceted Best Genfic, Best Draco Fic.
#+end_quote

Also, its sequels: [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=13093][A Summer Like None Other]]

  7 chapters. AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. Then fate intervenes, by bringing together a green-eyed boy determined to restore his family's status, and a Muggleborn girl who refuses to quietly accept her fate.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10216934/1/This-Isn-t-Pride-and-Prejudice][This Isn't Pride and Prejudice]]

#+begin_quote
  5 chapters. When three Slytherins join the DA, Harry finds himself reevaluating what he thought to be true about Slytherins and maybe falling for a girl unlike any he'd ever known. Rating may change. Eventual Harry/Tracey, Hermione/Blaise and Neville/Daphne. Somewhat AU from OoTP.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9627828/1/The-Deception-Series-Year-1-Discovery][The Deception Series, Year 1: Discovery]]

#+begin_quote
  11 chapters. Magic. It was fantastical, complex, and the only part of his heritage that he could be certain of. An AU to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, where Neville Longbottom is the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry Potter was thought to have died Halloween 1981. No Slash. Later parts of the series to be rated M.

  9 chapters... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle.
