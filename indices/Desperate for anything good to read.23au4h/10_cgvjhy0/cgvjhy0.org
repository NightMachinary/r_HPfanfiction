I will always recommend Minisinoo as a top-notch writer. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/106720/Minisinoo]]

Finding Himself is Cedric/Hermione, very long and quite wonderful. There's an unfinished sequel as well, really bummed me out she never finished it.

Her Aorist Subjunctive series is Harry/Cedric, and also quite good. First one is a time travel story of how Harry saves Cedric, and all the rest follow that AU.

Min's Cedric is who I think of when I think of Cedric.

Edit: apparently Aorist Subjunctive isn't on ff.net so here's another site with her work, downloadable as multiple eBook formats as well: [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29]]
