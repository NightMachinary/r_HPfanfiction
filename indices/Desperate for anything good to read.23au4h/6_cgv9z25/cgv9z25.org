Vanity - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=12541]]

Everything listed above is COMPLETE! Some are funny, some are serious, most all are smutty. Yet Everything Stays the Same is amazing. I'm not ashamed to say I may have cried at the end. Vanity is also fantastic. It's basically HBP from Hermione's point of view. I will give you a heads up that For the Potion Master's Amusement is a BDSM heavy fic, but it is very well written. I know not everyone is into that sort of thing. I can also link fics that are in progress that are being updated frequently if anyone is interested. I know most prefer to find completed fics, I know I do!! =) I will add more and links when I get to work!! All of these can be found on Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com.

EDIT:

Per Request, here are more!! =)

Soul Searching - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2002]]

This one is a little weird. I like it but also kinda hate it. I can gladly go into more detail on why it's weird if you are interested haha.

Phantom of Hogwarts - [[http://www.ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5882]]

Voldemort is gone. Everyone is alive (Hurray!) and now it's time to bring Muggle culture into the wizarding world. What better way to do it than with a Theater competition featuring students and staff of Hogwarts acting out Phantom of the Opera starring (who else??) but Severus Snape as the Phantom and Hermione Granger as Christine! Silly, but a fun read. Actually quite well written.

Falsity - [[http://pureblood.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=457]]

Draco schemes to get his father back on top of the wizarding world. Features Hermione Granger as a striptease artist. Very funny! I love this story and have read it many times.
