When was a time they slaved over the map to find a specific dot?

Probably only in the second book to look for Ginny, other times they don't really care, now why didn't Peter try to get the mapout of th way is a much bigger question to me, especially once Remus showed up in school. I mean did Peter seriously didn't have an idea the twins could have it? Steal it in the holidays or something
