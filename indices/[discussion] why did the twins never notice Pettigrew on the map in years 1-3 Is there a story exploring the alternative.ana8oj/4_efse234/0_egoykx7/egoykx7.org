I doubt Peter had any idea the twins had it. Until the third book, Scabbers was living a pretty normal relaxing rat life. He didn't do much but live in their dormitory (seriously there's like no mention of Scabbers after we meet him in PS until PoA). And there's no way the twins would've mentioned the map with Ron around at home. They might've left it in their trunks over the summer.
