That is a terrible excuse.

First of all, the Hogwarts years aren't so big that they wouldn't have ever heard of or at least seen this Peter Pettigrew fellow. Just that alone would be suspiscious enough.

Second, this Peter Pettigrew is with his brother and harry everyday in their room. This would come up, considering that the number of roomates are limited and they know who Ron and Harry room with.

It just makes no sense for it to never come up at all in 3 years.
