Not a fanfiction-related answer but this question is answered over in the FAQs in [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] with a quote from JKR and some additional comments:

“Why didn't Fred and George notice Peter Pettigrew with Ron?

JKR said:

'It would not have mattered if they had. Unless somebody was very familiar with the story of Sirius Black (and after all, Sirius was not Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's best friend -- indeed, they never knew him until after he escaped from Azkaban), Fred and George would be unlikely to know or remember that Peter Pettigrew was the person Sirius had (supposedly) murdered. Even if Fred and George HAD heard the story at some point, why would they assume that the 'Peter Pettigrew' they occasionally saw moving around the map was, in fact, the man murdered years before? Fred and George used the map for their own mischief-making, so they concentrated, naturally enough, on those portions of the map where they were planning their next misdeeds. And finally, you must not forget that hundreds of little dots are moving around this map at any given time... Fred and George did not know everyone in school by name, so a single unfamiliar name was unlikely to stand out.'

Fred and George primarily used the map as an actual map. This is why they elected to give it to Harry when they still had two more years of school, and why George tells Harry that he and Fred know it by heart” and “don't really need it anymore.” The twins used the map as a navigational tool. As long as they weren't out after hours and trying to avoid detection, they weren't paying attention to any of the other dots on the map.

It's also important to remember that Hogwarts has eight floors plus towers and dungeons. Any map of the castle would be immensely complex, and it's unreasonable to expect the characters to retain all or most of that information. When looking for a person or place on the map, Harry or the twins would instinctively filter out all information that wasn't the person or place they were looking for.”

Would be interesting to see some different takes from a fanfiction POV though
