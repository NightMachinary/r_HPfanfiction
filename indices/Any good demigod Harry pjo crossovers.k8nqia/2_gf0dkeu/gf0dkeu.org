Uhm. He grows up at Camp Halfblood in Lokison. Explicit slash, a fair bit of bashing and power wank in a long (abandoned) series. The PJ section is complete, however (the MCU part is not). He's not the Harry from the books - this kid has a vastly different upbringing and it shows. So ooc or not, you pick. linkao3(4724522)
