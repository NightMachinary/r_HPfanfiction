This isn't what you're looking for but When Wand and Sword Collide is fantastic. It's been a few year since I read it, but from what I remember there's a new prophecy and Harry and Percy get switched in a Lost Hero type deal. There's no active romance that I remember, but characters are in their canon relationships. Harry isn't a demigod, but I think he gets some kind of blessing from the greek gods. linkffn(8665858)
