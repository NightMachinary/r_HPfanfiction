Have you not read the books?

Dumbledore didn't raise Harry to be "slaughtered" by Voldemort. That's just what he needed Harry to believe. Dumbledore loved Harry like family. He loved Harry so much, he took possibly the least utilitarian path to victory possible /specifically/ so Harry would live.

When Harry tells him in GoF that Voldemort used his blood to resurrect himself, Dumbledore gets an uncharacteristically "triumphant" look on his face because he knew, then, that Harry would be able to survive the Avada Kedavra because Voldemort sharing his blood would tie him to life, while the horcrux was destroyed.

If Dumbledore just needed Harry to die to get rid of the Horcrux, why does Voldemort /himself/ have to do it? It was all part of his plan to make sure that Harry would /live/.
