Well that's nice. A version of Dumbledore that actually looks out for Harry by actually checking to make sure he's well cared for and most importantly informed. The canon version of him just keeping Harry in the dark with everything, which didn't give him much of a fight chance, and basically raising him like a farm animal for slaughter disgusted me.
