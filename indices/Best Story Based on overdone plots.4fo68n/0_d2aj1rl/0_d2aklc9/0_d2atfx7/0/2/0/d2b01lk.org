Having been born and raised in the East of England for the last 23 years I would like to think I know what British culture is like (and if you want proof there are some posts way back in my history about traffic in Peterborough).

The only people who call each other by last names are the old public school set who are in their 40s or 50s and very close old people. I call my family, my friends, my co-workers, my boss and people I meet by their first names and have never met anyone who would act otherwise.

I would even go so far as to say that calling people by their last name is a fairly rude thing to do unless you have been friends for a long time.

Edit: Sherlock Holmes is set in the 1890s. HP is set in the 1990s. Etiquette on addressing people has changed in 100 years.
