I agree that the wizarding world is set years back culturally but I think we'll have to agree to disagree.

I should note that in this fic Harry (who was raised as a 1980s muggle boy) does call Tonks 'Tonks' to start with but as he gets to know her and they get friendlier he complains that it doesn't feel right calling her by her last name hence the 'Nym' bit.

I could see the Slytherins or co-workers in the Ministry using last names for everyone though. (It would even make sense with the bigotry favouring old families and old names.)
