The thing is, as far as culture goes, the wizards are a bit behind the times so 1890s are likely to be a better representation than 1990s are.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that you don't know what you are talking about. It's just that the time that most likely corresponds culturally to the wizarding world as built by Madame Rowling is not the current time, and thus it's not the current etiquette that matters either.

I definitely should have made that clearer when I wrote my previous reply. I could defend myself but saying that I'm not feeling all that good right now, but that's excuses since thinking doesn't hurt now and the truth is that it seemed too obvious for me that people would remember about this bit of difference when Holmes is mentioned.
