Hmm, as I already said, I was not aware of the exact situation in the story and my agreement with the other side was only tentative, so it's not as much that we disagree that it is that there is a reason for it happening in the story and you gave that reason while I am speaking in general. It still does feel a bit weird for me since I don't think Tonks would feel happy with it happening and it takes two sides rather than only Harry, but I do understand where you are coming from and /maybe/ it will make sense to me too if I ever decide to try to read that particular story.

And, in any case, thanks for being understanding.
