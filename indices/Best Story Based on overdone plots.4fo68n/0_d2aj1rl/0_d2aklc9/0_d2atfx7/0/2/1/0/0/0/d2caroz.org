I did not “state my fanon” and I am not “getting pissy”. I do acknowledge that I could have worded it much better, but it's common sense to check deeper in the comment chain to see if the person you want to disagree with didn't add something else, which your reply makes clear either did not happen or did happen and you decided to ignore the comment in which I clarified it.
