I congratulate you for ignoring the comment deeper in the comment chain where I made it clear that I was taking the wizarding world as behind the time culturally and thus why I compared it to the time shown in the Holmes stories rather than to the current time.

Or rather, no, I do not congratulate you. Instead, I think it is something you should have done before doing your “in the nicest way possible” thing as it makes you appear combative.
