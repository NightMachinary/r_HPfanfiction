British culture, people generally don't call each other with first names unless /very/ close (think about the Sherlock Holmes stories and how he and Watson call each other by their last names even though they are pretty much life partners), and for most people in Britain the fact that someone is as uncomfortable with their name as Tonks is is enough of a reason never to switch.

It might be justified in the story, which I wouldn't know about because I have yet to read it, but so far I am tentatively with [[/u/Hpfm2][u/Hpfm2]] on this issue as without knowing about any in-story reasons for it it feels ... well, out of place, really.
