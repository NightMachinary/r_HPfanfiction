Well, I happen to know plenty of young (20 somethings) that do use the last names. I'm not sure how we arrived here, I don't have to justify to you why a character would use "TOnks" because /she's the one that asks for it/. It's not rude because /she wants you to do it/. It's not impersonal, weird, or anything, because it's done at /her request/.

If you're trying to argue with me that TOnks shouldn't be used, you need to use other arguments than "Oh it's weird, friends shouldnt call themselves by their last name"
