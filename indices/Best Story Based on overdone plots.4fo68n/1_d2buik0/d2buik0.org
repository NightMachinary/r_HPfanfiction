Others have recommended it, but I wanted to put my two cents in for linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin by The Sinister Man). It does take a few chapters to establish his plots, but he does an excellent job making sure everyone has a motivation for the things they do, even the abuse from Vernon and the nigh-hysterical hatred of Harry by James Potter. This fic meets 5, 6 and 7.

The only soul bond fic I actually like (8) is linkffn(the amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soul bond). Harry and Ginny are soul bonded in the CoS and they both HATE it.
