Lomonaaeren writes some good stuff with nice rounded plots, often about characters that happen to be gay (mostly Drarry). I particularly love linkao3(685932) (this one specifically deals with homophobia, if that's something you're looking for/avoiding) but Lomonaaeren has written HUNDREDS of stories, so feel free to just browse by your preferences, you'll probably find something you like.
