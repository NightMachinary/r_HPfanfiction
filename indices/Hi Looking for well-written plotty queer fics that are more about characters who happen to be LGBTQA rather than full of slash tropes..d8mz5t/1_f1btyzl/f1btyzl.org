I think linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by wapabi) might be to your satisfaction. I also second the recommendation of "Put your Guns, its Tea Time". Neither of those two fics has any of that fetishized portrayal of homosexualtiy that is so commen in fanfiction.
