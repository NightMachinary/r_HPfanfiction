I always thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ignipes/works?fandom_id=136512][ignipes]] was good for slash that stuck close to canon characterizations and circumstances. Most are on the shorter side, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17319/][Man-eaters of Kumaon]] is plotty and set during Lupin's Lost Years, with past Remus/Sirius and Remus still mourning his friends and trying to make sense of what happened.
