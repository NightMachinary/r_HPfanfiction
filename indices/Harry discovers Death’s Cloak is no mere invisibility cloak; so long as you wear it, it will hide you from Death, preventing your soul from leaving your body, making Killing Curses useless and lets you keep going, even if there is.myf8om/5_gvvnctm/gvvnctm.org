I've always thought there should be more to it than what was shown in the books. The power of the cloak was that is was supposed to hide the youngest brother from Death, until he took it off and welcomed Death like an old friend. Thus, as you suggested, if one is gravely wounded, as long as they keep the cloak wrapped around themselves, they are unable to die. The problem with this though, is that if the person is wrapped in the cloak and is so gravely wounded that they are unable to move, they will be stuck on the precipice of death for eternity, unable to live due to being so gravely wounded, and unable to die due to not being able to take off the cloak.
