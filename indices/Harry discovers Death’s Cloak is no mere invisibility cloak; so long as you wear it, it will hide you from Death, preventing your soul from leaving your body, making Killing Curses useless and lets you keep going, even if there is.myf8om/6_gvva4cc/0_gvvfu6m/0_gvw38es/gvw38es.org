I still feel that would be OP. It would be an unbeatable defense, while the Wand is absolutely not an unbeatable offence. Grindlewald, a man implied to at least be Dumbledore's vague equal before the Wand, still lost even with it because Dumbledore was just better. Dumbledore didn't just stomp Voldemort with it. The stone just summons ghosts to convince you to die, even when Harry did it just made him OK with walking into the forest to his death. There's plenty of theoretical useful things you could do with the stone that canon never shows anyone doing or even considering. The Hallows just sorta suck, and the Cloak being just a forever cloak is still the suckiest of the three, but it fits the theme. I like the fanon of it being specifically against detection spells of any kind and nothing else. because it's just useful enough to be "wow, thats a useful artifact" but not enough to just make Harry win any fight he can prepare for with the cloak.
