I read a story once ages ago, with this premise. It was a closely guarded secret of the potter family, that whoever had the cloak would not die from anything. Once it was passed down to the next holder, that person would, as owner of the cloak, be protected from death until they then passed it to the next person. And it worked even if you physically didn't have the cloak on you at the time.

James knew this, and gave the cloak to Harry as protection, which is why he died from Voldemort, when he fought him at the cottage. And that is why Harry did not die from the killing curse the first time. It's why he didn't die from the Dursleys; even while he didn't have the cloak he was still protected; and it's why he survived all the various adventures through the books.

And the only reason the Killing curse worked at the end of the DH was because he had taken the cloak off and met his “death as a friend”.

From what I remember it was a really good story, though I can't for the life of me remember the name.
