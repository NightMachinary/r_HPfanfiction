Ideas to make it more powerful

It's given as a baby blanket to the first born child in the Potter family and Harry had it around him when Voldemort cursed him. Dumbledore got it when Harry is swaddled with it by hagrid.

It fucks with soul magic you can't be seen or revealed by magical means. You can also just walk through ward lines but only while your cloaked so taking your head out in a warded house would alert them. I'd retcon Dumbledore seeing through it especially on account of Harry coming every night to the mirror he has a reasonable chance of guessing while mad eye should have a in universe reason like his magic eye picking up something tangental and then making an educated guess it's a cloak

Dementors should be able to sense you but they don't approach they just drift and stare at you menacingly while under the cloak, hell maybe just having the cloak on your person. Imagine walking in to azkaban with hundreds of dementors stopped and staring as you move the prison.
