  It's given as a baby blanket to the first born child in the Potter family and Harry had it around him when Voldemort cursed him. Dumbledore got it when Harry is swaddled with it by hagrid

Had an idea similar to this. The cloak actually does protect it's owner from death, even if they're not wearing it. Theoretically, of you go back in Potter/Peverel history, no owner of the cloak has died. They always die after they've passed the cloak onto the next generation. Nobody has discovered this because the cloak is usually passed on at a young age (James got it during his Hogwarts years for example).

My idea is James, by loaning the cloak to Dumbledore, forfeited that protection. Once he died however, the cloak passed to Harry who tanked the killing curse via the cloak's protection, not Lily's sacrifice. Though, that did give Harry nifty 'melt Voldemort's face by touching him' powers.
