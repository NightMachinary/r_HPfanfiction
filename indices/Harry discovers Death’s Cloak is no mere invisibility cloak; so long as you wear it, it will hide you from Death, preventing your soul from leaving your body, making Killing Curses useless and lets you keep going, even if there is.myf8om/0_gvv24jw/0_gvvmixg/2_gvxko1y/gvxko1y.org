  My idea is James, by loaning the cloak to Dumbledore, forfeited that protection. Once he died however, the cloak passed to Harry who tanked the killing curse via the cloak's protection, not Lily's sacrifice. Though, that did give Harry nifty 'melt Voldemort's face by touching him' powers.

Okay but now o want a fic where James and Lily live bc James doesn't forfeit the cloak, therefore they are able to hide as soon as Voldemort breeches the wards. Maybe I'll even write it.
