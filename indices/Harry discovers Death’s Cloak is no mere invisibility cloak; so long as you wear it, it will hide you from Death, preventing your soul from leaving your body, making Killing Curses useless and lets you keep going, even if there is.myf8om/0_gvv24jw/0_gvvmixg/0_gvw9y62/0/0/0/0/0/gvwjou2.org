That's an idea. all the Master of Death is is some who has all the hallows and thus won't be pushed to suicide: Cloak beats Stone beats Wand beats Cloak.

Wait a second. Dumbledore had some method of knowing Harry was in the room with the Mirror of Erised (Wand beats cloak).

Dumbledore is cursed by a ring containing the Stone, even though he has the Wand (Stone beats Wand)

All that's missing is a canon event the confirms Cloak beats Stone.
