All the Hallows have precognitive/luck modifying qualities to them with reference to their stories. The Resurrection Stone for instance will have the exact shades tell you the exact words to ensure that the user returns to it. It repeats the process, subtly pushing its user into suicide, communicating with dead is just a cover story. /All/ of its users inevitably commit suicide in some form (see Harry and possibly Dumbledore). Makes Dumbledore's final gift a lot more ominous. All Dumbledore had to do in order defeat Voldemort was to owl him the Stone.
