Slowly working on my first ever fic and had a similar idea for a harry who has all three hollows in a AU apocalypse setting. They make him immortal and gives each item increased powers when together. Such as the cloak not just hiding him from sight, but all divination, and allows him to walk through wards and barriers undetected as if he is not there. But if he ever dies without all three touching his body then death is there waiting to snag him.
