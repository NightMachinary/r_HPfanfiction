If you think canon Malfoy is redeemable, then we are not. He never questioned the ideology or even the methods (he never considered that killing Dumbledore was wrong), he only couldn't put his money where his mouth was.

The only way I can buy a Malfoy redemption is if you diverge before year two and have him SLOWLY reject pureblood supremacy (and keep Lucius and Snape as awful as they are in canon rather than whitewash them along the way).
