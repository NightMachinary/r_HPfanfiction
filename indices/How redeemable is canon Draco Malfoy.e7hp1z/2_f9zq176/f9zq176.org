I think he's a nice parallel to Regulus, honestly. Raised by parents who upheld pureblood ideology, followed their example mindlessly but then later showed that he was beginning to second-guess what he was taught. Difference is that he didn't have a Sirius-like figure, someone that he cared about, to show him an opposing idea, and he didn't have the same opportunity to really turn against Voldemort in the same way that Regulus did.

So yeah, I guess I think he's redeemable, but still not off the hook for what he did. Although he may have become a Death Eater under his father's direction (we don't know he didn't want to initially and then just came to regret it), he's still responsible for his own actions. His redemption would come several years after the war, in my opinion, because he would need to demonstrate, repeatedly and publicly, that he genuinely disagrees with the ideology that allowed Voldemort to become so successful in the first place.
