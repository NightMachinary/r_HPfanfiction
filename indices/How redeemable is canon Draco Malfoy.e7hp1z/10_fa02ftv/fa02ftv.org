Well if you compare him to other characters in the past you can easily redeem him. If you look at people like Snape or even Sirius Draco is no worse. Sirius was a bully on the other end of the spectrum, he attacked purebloods and Slytherins simple for being so. He was a dick for a long time until sixth year when he screws up the Remus and realises what he is doing is not so great, the only reason it isn't questioned was because he was on the light side. Draco was a bully trying to follow his parents rather than get away from them and didn't see the problem with what he did until sixth year when he realises he can't kill someone and he has to live with Voldemort in his home and he starts to be a little less of a bully but he is still stuck in the war amd couldn't do a lot other than being completely useless to the war effort. You could say he has learnt from his mistakes and changed to be a better person and now that the war is over, can do that without risking his life and could be redeemed like Sirius.
