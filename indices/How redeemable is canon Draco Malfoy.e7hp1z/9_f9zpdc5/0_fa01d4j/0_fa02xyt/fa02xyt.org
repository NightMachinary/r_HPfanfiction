These are just my own assumptions. He did want to bring Harry to Voldemort but he also didn't tell the others that he recognized Harry in the manor. But I think while Draco made wrong desicions he was not a bad person per se. I think that mostly the circumstances of his upbringing and the desicions of Lucius Malfoy led to him acting the way he did.
