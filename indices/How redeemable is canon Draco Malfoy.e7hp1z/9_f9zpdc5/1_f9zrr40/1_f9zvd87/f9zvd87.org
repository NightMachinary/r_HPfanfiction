Well but while it is his fault we also have to mention that Draco did not outright try to kill Katie or Ron. These were accidents that happened while he - a 16 year old boy - was tasked with the murder of an accomplished wizard (who even Voldemort himself feared) I think Draco would have been quite disturbed if Katie or Ron had died even if the people surrounding him would've probably told him that it's a bloodtraitor anyways and that it made no difference if one of them was gone. Draco was at a breaking point at that point in time. These were mistakes that can be attributed to being pressured into something he didn't even know what the outcome would be if he succeeded. Draco was very blind and naive at that point, but I think that this part in his life was essential to his character growth. I think he redeemed himself over the course of the books and I think we have to consider his age with these actions. He was a teenager at this time. Just like Harry he was forced to fight in a war. We can not fault him for following his parents and thinking that they were right. He wanted to redeem his father by killing Dumbledore. As he grew up and time went on we see him making different decisions as he starts to question what he is really fighting for. In the end I think Draco was selfish but he was also loyal to his family. Just like his mother he just wanted his family to be alright.
