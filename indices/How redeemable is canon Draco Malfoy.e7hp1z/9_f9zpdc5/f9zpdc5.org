While he was a spoiled brat for the first years in his life, I think he really grew up. I think his turning point was when his father was sent to Azkaban after the failed mission in the Department of Mysteries. The mission to kill Dumbledore was clearly set up to fail, but at that point he still believed in this cause. But the war also took its toll on him. Life hit him in his face.

He had Voldemort basically living in his home as well as other Death Eaters, he was in contact with Greyback and I think at that point the whole pureblood superiority didn't matter to him that much any more. He saw that it wasn't that glorious at that point. He was only 16 and saw how a teacher of his school was being killed and eaten in front of him, on a table in his home. As you mentioned he didn't identify Harry when he clearly would have been able to. If he had identified Harry, his honor would've been reinstated in the dark Lords eyes, but Draco chose to protect Harry instead. The only hope of the Wizarding world to get rid of the dark Lord. And if the news got out, he would be clearly objected to Voldemorts wrath. So while it was certain that he had acted for selfish reasons it was a pretty selfless act to lie. By that point I think he did no longer believe in anything that had something to do with the "purebloods are better attitude" And during the battle of Hogwarts he wasn't the one to cast a killing curse on Harry. I think he was very desperate and very scared. At that point he just wanted to survive. He might still be a little arrogant but he lived through his own hell and I think that he is pretty redeemed even if we ignore the ending of the books "19 years later"
