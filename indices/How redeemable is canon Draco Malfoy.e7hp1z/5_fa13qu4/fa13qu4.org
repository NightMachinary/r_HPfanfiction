I think it is hard for me to say I know canon Malfoy well enough to strongly make this distinction. There are a ton of questions that, if we had the answers, would make his morality much clearer to me. For example, what did Malfoy experience during the seventh year up until the Manor scene at Easter? How did he feel after Snape killed Dumbledore? How did he feel about his actions during 6th year once the threat of being killed wasn't hanging over him? The answers to these questions makes a big difference (to me, anyway), but canon doesn't provide clear answers.

I think the reason we argue so much about Draco is that Deathly Hallows does not provide enough info about Draco's experiences, so we are forced into making a lot of assumptions. I personally tend to lean on the redeemable side of things because of his indoctrination as a child, and because the worst acts he committed (Rosmerta, Katie, Ron, and the cabinet) were when he was sixteen years old. And I generally believe most sixteen year olds can be redeemed.
