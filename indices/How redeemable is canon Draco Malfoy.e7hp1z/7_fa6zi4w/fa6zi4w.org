That heavily depends on what you want him to redeem for.

If it's about joining the death eaters and being on Voldemort's side and whether or not he's an absolute monster who's a danger to the public, then yes. I think he's very much redeemable.

If it's about him being a singularly unpleasant individual with discriminating views and you want him to suddenly become a friend to the trio etc, then I think it's much more difficult from what we know of the wizarding worlds.

He's not a psychopath like Bellatrix or Greyback and their ilk, but he's nowhere near a good person.
