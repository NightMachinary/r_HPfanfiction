My issue with stories featuring a redeemed!Draco is that he is very rarely actually redeemed. In most of these fics (which are, coincidentally or not, always either Draco/Hermione or Draco/Harry) the Draco never actually acknowledges the shit he did. Instead, the writer just chooses to shift blame onto Lucius and Dumbledore, say that Draco was just a kid, and BOOM, suddenly he loves watching television and drives cars and whatnot.

I would love to read a story where he actually acknowledges all the horrible things he did, but I've yet to see one done right. Although I understand that this would be very hard (and boring) to write.
