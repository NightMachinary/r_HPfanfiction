If we go with the process of abrogation, then yes. But all being told I'm kind of 50/50 on the issue. That's why I asked it, to hear people's opinion. I'm mostly on him being an irredeemable jerk, that should at least go to Azkaban for years... However, there were mitigating circumstances, like Quine_ pointed out. He was a minor when he committed those crimes. So it's kind of meh for me. I'm just not sure.

Still, he did some terrible things.
