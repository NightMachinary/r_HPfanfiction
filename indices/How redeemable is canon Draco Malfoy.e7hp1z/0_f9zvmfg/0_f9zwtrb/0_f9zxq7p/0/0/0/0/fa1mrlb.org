I hate Draco, but look at it from his perspective.

The worst person imaginable sets up shop in your childhood home. Things are looking ok because your dad serves him, but then your dad fucks up and now it's on you. Evil incarnate tells you if you don't do this thing your mother, father, and everyone you've ever cared about is going to die a slow, painful death. Are you just going to ignore that?
