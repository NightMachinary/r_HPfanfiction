A lot depends on his postwar behavior and actions. 20 years is a long time.

Canon Draco never passed the point of no return in the Books, so if he truly repudiates his parents's ideology, voluntarily compensates his own and the regime's victims, and actively works for the cause of the Trio, I don't see why they shouldn't at least accept him.

Draco in my head canon is a capable business person and investor. Therefore, despite paying out most of old Malfoy fortune as reparations, his fortune bounces back quickly and the new Ministry needs his money making skills.
