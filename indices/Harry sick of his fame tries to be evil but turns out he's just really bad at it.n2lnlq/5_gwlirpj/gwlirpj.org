Two fics where Harry declares himself to be a Dark Lord to get the Ministry to leave him alone and to ruin his Saviour image, which obviously doesn't work like he expects it to:

linkao3(11699844) - an excellent parody of the Lord Potter Black tropes and near the end, a realistic depiction of how living with systemic blood supremacy effects everyone.

linkao3(690093) - a light crack series with seriously OP Harry, a dark phoenix, Harry/Draco, politics, etc.
