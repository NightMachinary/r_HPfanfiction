The dog turns out to be deranged serial killer Sirius Black, who is identified and arrested when Harry approaches him. Fudge decides to make as much of a public spectacle of Sirius as possible and holds a trial, however the trial proves Sirius innocent. Harry is first heralded as a hero for catching the dark wizard, and then as an even greater hero for freeing an innocent man from a kiss-on-sight order.
