Unfortunately, the method he'd been planning - a controllable romance - is no longer on the table, and with a very grateful pureblood wife who will alert Harry of any obvious threats from the Wizengamot, he now has no option but to be either extremely subtle, or very direct.

So he tries to guilt Harry with talk about how his parents would be horrified at him committing murder, and then to Dumble's horror Harry destroys the Little Hangleton cottage... and is praised for moving on by the public.

He then tries to appeal to Harry's hero complex by revealing the prophecy and Scarcrux, and Harry reacts by laughing, grabbing Astoria (who he's become fond of), and leaving the country, gleefully announcing to Diagon Alley as he leaves with all their money withdrawn from Gringotts that Voldemort can have Britain for all he cares because of how bad he was treated during 2nd, 4th, and 5th years, and announces that the Minister can duel Voldemort next time. The press paints this as Harry triumphantly deciding to refuse to allow an older man obsessed with a younger boy to control his destiny.

Harry also finds an expert outside of the UK who is able to actually do something about it without killing Harry.

This also galvanizes the people to take action against Voldemort and the Death Eaters far more than before, resulting in slaughters during every DE raid on a magical target (akin to those seen in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8560964/1/Death-of-a-Hero][Death of a Hero]]), the difference being that it's not Harry who kills Tommy Boy, but the Minister, who Dumbledore tells of the Prophecy and convinces that Harry's declaration designated the Minister as Harry's "right hand man" for the purpose of the killing blow, and it works (or maybe the prophecy was fake the whole time?).

As for the Horcruxes, they don't work this time because the magic is extremely limited in scope (hence why we're not swimming in ancient Egyptian immortal god-wizards).
