He also kills Snape, knowing his value as a spy, but the sheer number of people who hate Snape results in more praise then condemnation.

He decides to try and cross the moral event horizon by forcing his school rival's love interest, Astoria, into a marriage with himself against her will, only to discover that this is her dream come true and her sister erroneously assumes that Harry had somehow found out and decided to rescue Astoria from a loveless arranged marriage, crowing that belief to the heavens and destroying any chance Harry could use the marriage for negative PR. Astoria then misinterprets his confession of his evil intent of forcing her as a dom/sub kink... and she confesses to having sub fantasies.

Harry tries tossing Fiendfyre into a Wizengamot meeting. Unbeknownst to him, all the good-aligned members had been indisposed due to machinations of the dark-aligned members, so everyone assumes he was just clearing house. He then tries this again with Fortescue's only for nobody to get hurt and Florean's insurance policy to let him rebuild bigger and better then ever, gaining him even more positive PR (albeit with more sly winks and him being assigned a fine for arson).

EDIT: >100 upvotes?! Now I'm tempted to try my hand a lemon of the 2nd idea just for a giggle... which would probably lasso Daphne into a threesome for the 2nd round (out of fear that their dad might get pressured to legally change Daphne's name to Astoria just to let Draco get some, cause I'd go the route of Draco taking an unbreakable vow that the only woman he will ever sleep with will be Astoria Malfoy nee Greengrass as the betrothal is being signed to paint the target on Astoria's back so to speak)...
