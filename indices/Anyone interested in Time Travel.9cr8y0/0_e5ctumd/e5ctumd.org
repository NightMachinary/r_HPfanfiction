I really hate time travels that try to keep the time line or have the protagonists behaving stupidly. Time travel, or advance knowledge, is pretty much the ultimate Deus Ex Machina; and if you are still too stupid to fuck it up, then perhaps your enemies deserve their victory!

That being said, I have several time travels to recommend that do not fall into my hated category:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione sent her memories and power to her two years old self. Voldemort was easily taken care of, but that was the easy part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. After a slow start, things looked up until an accident hit...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He did well and remained in character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): Luna raised Tom Riddle, who still couldn't escape the fate of becoming a dark lord. But he would at least have Luna at his side this time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny lone time travel. She accomplished her primary mission objective efficiently and painlessly, but had to fit in this new reality.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]], linkffn(6452481): In their 60s, Harry and Ron appeared rich and powerful, but actually led fairly miserable lives, so they were given a second chance. Once back, they wasted no time in antagonizing everyone around them, especially their former spouses.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10938984/1/][Heterochromic]], linkffn(10938984): Crazy twist near the end.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Unique Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV, and she wasn't paired with anyone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Time traveling Harry killed them all again, but without getting kids involved. Hermione wasn't too happy though when she found out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Time traveling Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan killed most of them even before going back to Hogwarts, and also did the Goblins in soon after. But they were unable to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): The only Hermione time travel in which she KILLED Tom Riddle in the orphanage instead of raising or shagging him. But she didn't stop here either...

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4940094/1/][Strawberry Fields]], linkffn(4940094): Dr Who entered HP world and took the Books with him. He brought Harry to the Grangers, but things didn't always work well.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day old Rose were thrown back to Aug 31 1991. They got down to business immediately and finished off Voldemort in record time. Great depiction of Trio friendship, but bad spelling.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix became very impressed.
