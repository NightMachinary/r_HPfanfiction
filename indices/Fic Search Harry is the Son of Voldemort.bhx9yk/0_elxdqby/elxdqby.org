I read this less then a year ago(or at least part of it, I'm horrible at finishing fics). I will see if I can find it saved on my book marks. Or history.

I don't know if that's the exact one you are looking for. Lily and James didn't die but they thought Harry's twin was the chosen one. If I remember right they gave him to the Dursley's still. Voldemort took him from there and did some ritual thing to make Harry his son.
