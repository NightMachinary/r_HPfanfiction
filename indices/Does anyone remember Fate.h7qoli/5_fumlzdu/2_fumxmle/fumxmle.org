I think it's amazing!

The characters all are interesting, unique, and deep - and I care about them (and there are not too many). The author is so good at writing characters.

It never feels like there's any filler, but it's not too fast either.

There is so /much/ sheer CREATIVITY in it. Dozens of new, completely unheard of or rare ideas, and lots more.

No mary sues.

The plot is intriguing as hell.

And it's written well.

When I started with it I thought it was going to be boring, but at the first chapter I got really interested, and at the 4th chapter I was hooked.

You should at least give it a try, even if Harry isn't the MC.
