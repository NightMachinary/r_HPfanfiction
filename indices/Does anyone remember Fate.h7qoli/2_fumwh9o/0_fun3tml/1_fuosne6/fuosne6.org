What I meant is that even with reading fanfiction there is some cost/benefit analysis. When reading linkffn(It's Always The Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1), I don't care that it is not as good as “The Brothers Karamazov” (heck, it is not even as good as the original Lovecraft), but it is 8,400 words so it is exactly the length to carry this story, and C/B ratio goes straight to the reader.
