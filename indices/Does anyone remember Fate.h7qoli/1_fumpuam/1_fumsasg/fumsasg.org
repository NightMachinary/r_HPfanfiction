A nice plot and lot's of patience and time. I've read a 1.2 mil fic and it's 2.5 mil sequel back to back.

...

I wasn't very happy when I realised that the climax of the 2.5 mil fic (Edit: Not fate, I'm referring to a different one here) the one where literally every single subplot, probably including the romance of the main character (his loved one was presumed dead and she had been getting closer and closer to him since she was rescued) /was never fucking written/.

They literally had a scene where the heroes each used the "powerups" they earned in their journey only for the actual fight scene to never be written.

I'm still fucking mad so many years later.
