It's actually pretty good. The plot and characters are way too good to not be invested, you're left wanting for more each chapter. There's NEVER any boring filler, time never drags on.

You can read the first 5 chapters, if it's not for you then quit it. I actually usually read oneshots (I usually have no patience for long fics), but reading Fate was so different!
