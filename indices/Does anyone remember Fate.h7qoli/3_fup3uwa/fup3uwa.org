Yep!

I read it every time a new chapter comes out and leave a review.

Yes it has its flaws, the pacing at some parts is bad and sometimes the characters act out of order.

But this is a fanfiction.

Dont get your hope up for the next HP when this isnt trying to do that.

It's pretty good for my favourite character Ron so I'd say give it a try.
