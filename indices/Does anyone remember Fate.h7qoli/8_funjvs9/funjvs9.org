All the things wrong with this fic from the perspective of someone who won't read it:

#+begin_quote
  "it gets darker just as the original"
#+end_quote

Almost no one liked that in the original judging by the fact how later book are typically ignored in fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  2.5 mil words, unfinished
#+end_quote

It's too big a time investment for something that clearly has no end in sight.

#+begin_quote
  mostly from Ron's perspective
#+end_quote

OOC Ron, most likely. Not a very likeable character in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Reviews: 2,532 - Favs: 661
#+end_quote

Extreme amounts of people commenting multiple times is almost never a good thing.

#+begin_quote
  tons of guest reviews
#+end_quote

yeah....

#+begin_quote
  Never once seen recommended to me despite the size
#+end_quote

Despite me reading the fandom I haven't seen this in recs

#+begin_quote
  Not enough stuff on author's favourites to get a feel for what they like and how good their taste in fiction is
#+end_quote

For a 2.5m fic it's important.

So yeah, too many warning signs to invest time into it. I haven't read it and likely won't.
