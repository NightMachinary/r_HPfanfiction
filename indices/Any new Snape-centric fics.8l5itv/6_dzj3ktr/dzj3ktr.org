The Serpent's Gaze linkao3(The Serpent's Gaze) is an excellent slytherin AU which features a bolder, smarter Harry as a main character. Snape is in each of the books (5, so far) although we don't get his perspective until the fifth book. But boy, is it worth it. This Snape is reluctant, tired, regretful, and repressed, but he also has friends, humour, and a hint of kindness.
