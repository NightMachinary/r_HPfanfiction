I think more people need to examine the ethics of presenting the idea of everyone, including the protagonist of a story - who more often than not is supposed to be a sympathetic character for the reader to relate to, or at least understand their perspective - being okay with magically-enforced institutionalised slavery.

If you replaced "House-Elf" with "Black Person" in these fanon ideas and had all the characters behave the same way, readers would be horrified.

It really bothers me that people try to effectively justify slavery, rather than have their characters admit that the whole thing's fucked, and that at the very least House-Elves should have something akin to human rights and protection under the law.

People introduce random fanon concepts all the damn time, but this one is without doubt one of the most irritating, being a choice made - more often than not, I find - for the convenience of heading off the S.P.E.W. subplot and getting a dig in at Hermione (similar to all those times that various indy!Harrys inevitably say "don't believe everything you read in books" to her when they meet on the Express).

Although hopefully authors who deploy this trope aren't racists in real life or believe in the concept of slavery, their willingness to paint it as a good thing in fanfiction and then /defend/ that perspective when they get called out on the implication of their statements is unnerving.

Like, didn't everyone get upset at that one guy who repeatedly tried to justify using rape in his stories? Ethically, how is this different?
