Although you're of course entitled to your own headcanon, the issue for me with this trope isn't the unfairness of the House-Elves' situation compared to their masters, but the very fact that authors make a House-Elf's enslavement necessary for their survival.

Indeed, if one were to apply historical slavery to your position, they could simply replace a 'drain on a wizard's magic' with the 'economic costs of housing and feeding actual slaves', as what many slavery apologists used to defend themselves in the Nineteenth Century, and you'd be right back to square one.

You're allowed to construct whatever headcanon you want, in the end, but attempting to make the issue "fairer" whilst failing to address the key moral and ethical issues at hand does you no favours.

On another note, I agree completely that authors should just avoid it if it's not relevant to the story. Any attempt to elucidate matters without condemning the institution of slavery in the Potterverse just ends up with people digging themselves into holes.
