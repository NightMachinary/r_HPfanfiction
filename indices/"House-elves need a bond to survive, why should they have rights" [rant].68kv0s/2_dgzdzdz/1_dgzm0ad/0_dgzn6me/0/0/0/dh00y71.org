Cool okay! Yes it does.

I also think that the bond to make slavery palatable to the characters is stupid. I think that Hermione stops caring in those stories is completely out of character. We actually completely agree on the matter at hand. I was just more talking about how one would go about actually freeing them. My comment on the reality warping was more of a poke at the absurdity of house elves even serving the wizards at all.
