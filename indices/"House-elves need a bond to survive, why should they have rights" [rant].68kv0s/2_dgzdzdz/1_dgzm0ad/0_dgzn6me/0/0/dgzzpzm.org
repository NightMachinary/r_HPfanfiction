Sorry, I think you're missing the point - I'm not really talking about compensation, or making the 'deal' (if slavery can be called a deal) more equal to the parties involved, I'm trying to say that excusing slavery with the 'bond' idea and making slavery palatable to the characters (when they're espoused to not be scumbags), as if such a thing could ever be reasonable to any upstanding person.

Your ideas about a bond having a detrimental effect on the wizard or the gradual ruling for the fair treatment of House-Elves, I'm trying to say, don't address the actual issue at hand - that authors are finding a way to /justify the enslavement of House-Elves/, rather than actually consider that it is exactly what it says on the tin: slavery. No more, no less.

Hope that clears up what I was trying to say!
