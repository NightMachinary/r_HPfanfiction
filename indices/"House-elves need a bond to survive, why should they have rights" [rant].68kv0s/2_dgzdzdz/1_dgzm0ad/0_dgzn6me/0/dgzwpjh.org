Eh. Being paid with the ability to reality warp seems to be fair compensation in most people's eyes. Personally, I'd obviously want them paid as well, but I'm not a part of that society. Hermione isn't either, which is the main underlying issue of muggleborns in Harry Potter in general. She'd have to gradually change it to them gaining basic rights, followed by fair compensation. Starting with fair compensation seems silly when it's legal to just behead your house elf and mount it on your wall.
