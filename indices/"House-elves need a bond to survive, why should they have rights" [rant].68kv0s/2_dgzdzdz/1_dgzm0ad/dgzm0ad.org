It'd make more sense if this whole idea of needing a bond cost the wizard something. Like, the reason you don't have a house elf as a weak wizard is you would feel the drain on your magic from it more significantly. Hogwarts gets around this by having the elves live off the ambient magic there.

Then Hermione could still fight for basic rights, but pay would still be anathema to the house elves, as they are already paid in magic. This is my headcannon for what it's worth.

Ethically, it isn't different. I'd prefer the authors that don't want to deal with spew just leave it out. I'd prefer it skipped over than trod into the ground with bad ethical logic.
