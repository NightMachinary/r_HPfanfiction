I pretty much treat like an unwelcome fourth-wall-break now, where instead of doing anything constructive, the author is just using a (typically douche-y-worded) outburst from Harry to nip Hermione's excessive bookishness and (often exaggerated) trust in authority in the bud so they can push the character in their own direction.
