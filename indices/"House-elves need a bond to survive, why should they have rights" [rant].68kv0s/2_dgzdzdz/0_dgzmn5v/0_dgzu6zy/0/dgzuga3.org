I think there are multiple reasons:

- Harry Potter was hit with a curse, and it deflected. That is a fact.
- Harry survived, she didn't. We know that it was her love that protected him, not the specifics though. Was it something that also needed something from Harry?
- We don't know how the traces are like.
- Boy-who-lived is admittedly catching.
- We don't know what actually was published from that night. I assume though for the next 2-3 days the info info that was out there was two dead parents and a baby that survived, alone.
