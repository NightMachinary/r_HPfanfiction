I feel like if there is one thing we know about Hermione, it's that she fucking loves books. If this girl gets a bug in her ear about something, the first thing she wants to do is read every book that there is on the subject.

So if there is in fact a bond that is required for House Elf survival; either there are no books in Hogwarts' library that cover this topic, Hermione just decided she didn't give a shit about House Elf deaths- freeeedom is more important, Hermione didn't bother researching House Elfs, or that there is no bond.

Of those, I think only 1 and 4 are remotely likely. If 1 is the correct option, I think Hermione would have somehow gotten her grubby little paws on a book about House Elfs. And/Or, someone in canon would have made the argument that they need a bond to survive, rather than the much weaker argument that they like being enslaved.

Now let's look at Dobby. He thrived for four years as a free elf. So either he was secretly bonded to Harry without Harry's knowledge, or there is no bond.
