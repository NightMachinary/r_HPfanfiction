  Are there laws relevant that are just ignored, we don't know.

If there are laws they are clearly inefective or not enforced. So still need for reform. Also the social norms tend to draw a picture of how elfs are regarded.

Even if there were any kinds of laws to appease civil rights activists they are clearly useless.
