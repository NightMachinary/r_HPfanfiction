  And child abuse is one of the most contentious issues. There are numerous cases in the courts where children have been taken from their parents and its being appealed. Heck when I started fencing when I was young I got hit a lot, strange bruises etc, was I being abused? Not at all. I was loving it. What does the teacher see however?

Better save than sorry? Taking a child away from a family is pretty difficult (because we put high value into biological parenthood - which has nothing to do with house-elves btw). It's fine to ring the alarm bells falsely from time to time... better than ignore abused children, just because they might just be rough players.

  With regards to the auror resources, these all have a cost. We could get to Mars if we spent enough, when there are murders, potential breaches in the statue of secrecy, werewolves, vampires, goblin rebellions, giants, acrotmantulas etc House-elves are down the priority list.

Why are house-elves lower on the priority list?

#+begin_quote
  Are the living standard of house-elves ever going to be a priority or are they going to be a luxury to be checked when nothing else is on the books?
#+end_quote

Why do you suppose ensuring the welfare of house-elves is a luxury? House-elves should be citizens and the number one priority of a government is to ensure the welfare of it's citizens.

  Not and have a free society, you can't just stalk someone invisibly without cause
#+end_quote

There's cause.

  you can't go into a home without a warrant.

I'm not advocating for that.

  while there are Death Eaters still on the run.

There were more than 12 years of peace. There was also a long time of peace between Grindlewald and Riddle. This is not an acceptable excuse.

I'm not going to argue whether it's more important to rescue house-elves or fight Death Eaters, the house-elves aren't a new issue.
