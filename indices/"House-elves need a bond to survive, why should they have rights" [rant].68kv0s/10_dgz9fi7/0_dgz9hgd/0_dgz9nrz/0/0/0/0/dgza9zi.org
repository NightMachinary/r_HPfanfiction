And child abuse is one of the most contentious issues. There are numerous cases in the courts where children have been taken from their parents and its being appealed. Heck when I started fencing when I was young I got hit a lot, strange bruises etc, was I being abused? Not at all. I was loving it. What does the teacher see however?

With regards to the auror resources, these all have a cost. We could get to Mars if we spent enough, when there are murders, potential breaches in the statue of secrecy, werewolves, vampires, goblin rebellions, giants, acrotmantulas etc House-elves are down the priority list. Again, that doesn't make it right, it means that when you have limited resources they are sent where they are needed most. Are the living standard of house-elves ever going to be a priority or are they going to be a luxury to be checked when nothing else is on the books? You cannot monitor everyone all of the time. Not and have a free society, you can't just stalk someone invisibly without cause, you can't go into a home without a warrant. Its not right but I highly doubt the chief warlock would sign off on hours of surveillance on potential mistreatment of house-elves while there are Death Eaters still on the run.
