  If they are ordered to say certain things then a conviction is impossible.

I disagree. With disillusionment charms, invisibility cloaks, extendable ears and pensieves the amount of investigative means Aurors have at their disposal is beyond measure. Dobby looks and behaves like an abused house-elf and the Malfoys don't seem to hide it. It's an open and shut case, even without the the victim as a witness - the evidence would be staggering. There could be government mandated yearly health check-ups for house elves too in order to spot such abuse. It's very simple to enforce (not that it could prevent all abuse, but the worst of it).

How do you figure abused children who don't report it to their teachers are found? Because there's laws and regulations to protect them and if a doctor or teacher notices something they will usually report it (which is also a social standard that's clearly non-existent in magical Britain, putting more evidence towards 'House-elf slavery is disturbing'). These processes work without assistance by the abused child.
