I'm not saying its right or wrong. I am stating that your first post misrepresents the argument. We know so little about the wider Harry Potter world. We look in through the window of a child at school. We know almost nothing about their laws. Are there laws relevant that are just ignored, we don't know. Malfoy is powerful, if its a minor rule then he can ignore it. Would someone attempt to prosecute him if it endangered their family's well-being? Its not right but its entirely possible that there are the laws etc, they just aren't enforced. Dobby is the single example of a mistreated house-elf. Winky takes the fall for Crouch but thats nothing about her being an elf. People have been taking the fall for others as long as blame has been a thing. Kreacher and Sirius don't get on but we know Regulus got on with him well and it seems that Sirius' mum treated him well. The kitchen elves seen happy enough and so did the Smith house-elf that was set up by Voldemort. The bond is used to show how ham-fisted Hermione's attempt is, what happens in regards to the Gryffindor common room and the elves in fifth year shows that it wasn't appreciated. Now you can blame the elves for being brain washed or you can say Hermione was ignorant or perhaps you can say there is more to the issue that we can tell from a set of books about a kid's adventures in school.
