  Kreacher and Sirius don't get on but we know Regulus got on with him well and it seems that Sirius' mum treated him well.

He might be treated 'well' but he is still forced to obey and the consequences are horrific (despite being owned by 'nice' owners):

  '/and the locket, Master Regulus's locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!/'

  Harry reacted instinctively: as Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him.

In any case the series makes it pretty clear that wizards treat house-elves as lesser. Winky is not technically treated awfully, but she's not treated like a sentient life form. Mr Diggory is actually one of the nice wizards in the series and he /still/ treats Winky like she's beneath him.
