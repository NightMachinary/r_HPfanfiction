  Are there laws relevant that are just ignored
#+end_quote

I don't think it's just a matter of laws, it's really a cultural matter that /needs/ to be rectified. Wizards (and there are a lot of instances of this) treat House-Elves like they are beneath them-which really can't be justified

I'll be honest-I quit the fic the moment they use this trope-so I don't know if fics address the cultural problem in the wizarding world with their treatment towards house-elves.

  and its the individual owners that are the problem not the 'bond'.
#+end_quote

If the bond did exist then it doesn't change the fact that wizards treat house-elves poorly as a culture rather than just 'individuals'. In the books it's the compassionate and forward-thinking individuals that treat House-elves with any kindness-they're the exceptions-not the Malfoys.

  Hermione's gryffindor trait of leaping without looking.
#+end_quote

Hermione doesn't research the personal house-elf perspective as much as she should. But Hermione does do her research or at least the text implies she does (she spends time in the library). She probably has a very good idea if any laws to help house-elves exist at all. She certainly knows they're underrepresented in the ministry.
