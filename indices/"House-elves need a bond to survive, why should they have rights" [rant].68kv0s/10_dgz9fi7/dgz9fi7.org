I think you're missing a few steps to their argument and bordering on a straw man. Their first premise might be that there is this bond, step two tends to be show that most house-elves are treated fine and its the individual owners that are the problem not the 'bond'. Step two means that you don't have to change anything law wise other than perhaps clamping down on allowed behaviour. The bond is basically calling out Hermione's gryffindor trait of leaping without looking. Its saying hold on, you don't know everything. The second part where they tend to show that most house-elves are happy and that people like Malfoy are the problem not the norm is their actual argument. The bond is used to call out potential ignorance, its a device for that, I don't think I've ever seen it used to say abuse is fine. It is used to say if you didn't know about this, what else might you have missed? Which leads nicely into missing the vast majority of well treated house-elves.
