  why isn't Dobby or Winky dead?
#+end_quote

If the author bothers to address this it is usually done by saying that Dobby is secretly bonded to Harry and that Winky is slowly dying.

I don't think that the idea of such a bond per se is immoral, just the (implied) conclusions in most fics that employ such a plot-device.
