Since Deathcrow 'ignored' the end of the comment, I will respond, since I find it disgusting. Let me change something

#+begin_quote
  Yet Hermione gets a tunnel vision fixation on the *black slave* issue, for some reason, and starts annoying random people --- who are not obligated to help her in any manner whatsoever --- which just alienates potential allies and makes them want to avoid her in future.

Are we morally obligated to help if /we personally/ enslave and /torture/ sentient and sapient race / species?

I think yes. A decent being should always protect another sapient being if possible. It agree that it is harder and more grey in the modern world, were you often can't see the cause and effect (Buying the meat in the supermarket means that people in Africa have less to eat), but the cause in this case is clear:

Wizards in the UK enslave house-elves and order them to punish and hurt themselves, and abuse them. A prime example is Dobby and Winky. Hermione directly and obviously profits from the work of (tortured) slaves without being able to give back.

And look at how house-eleves are actually treated:

  That Mr Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn't anyone do something about it?
#+end_quote

That was how Winky was treated. But hey, "House-Elves like it!" Let's completely dismiss their slavery, because Hermione 'annoying' people is bad. Also, it 'alienates allies'. Hermione is fifteen during the SPEW-plot. I sure as shit didn't think in "allies and foes" during that time. She is a student first, fighting for a single cause, not a politician.

And if you don't have a cause (for example "Betterment of the rights for everyone, even not yourself") than what do you need allies for? The only thing I have is 'being selfish'.
