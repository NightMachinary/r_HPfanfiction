1) whether or not house elves are slaves is disputable, but you're presenting it as an already established premise.

2) house elves are /not/ human. I do not mean by this that they do not deserve to be treated with decency, to have rights, etc. But they can not be compared to human slaves because 2.1) their psychology is very different (and we do not know exactly how it is different) and 2.2) they are not doing their work unwillingly.

You can't force a whole species of intelligent creatures to change their preferred way of life just because you think you're better suited to make focal life decisions for them than they themselves are. Especially when you're a third-year student who obviously doesn't know what they are doing.

3) Hermione has the same problem your current argument has --- she has the uncompromising opinion that not only /her/ stance on the house elf issue the only valid one, but also that it entitles her to get into other people's space even if they do not share it with her. When she goes and starts pestering random people in the common room, “cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses”, she's not considering that they may not see her as a freedom fighter for slaves, but as an uppity individual who thinks she knows best. IIRC, she has managed to alienate pretty much all other students save for Harry and Ron. Do you think this would've been the case if she thought her strategy first and tried being less aggressive, more approachable, and better suited for explaining her position without brashly trying to dominate her way through?

  Hermione is fifteen during the SPEW-plot. I sure as shit didn't think in "allies and foes" during that time. She is a student first, not a politician.

That part of my comment wasn't a criticism against canon!Hermione's character, it was criticism against OP saying a bunch of insulting things about any hypothetical fanfic writer who made a ff!Hermione that wasn't aligning with OP's moral compass [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][(see the top of my first comment).]]

  And if you don't have a cause than what do you need allies for?

Firstly, see 4).

Secondly, I wasn't saying that you (or, rather, the hypothetical ff!Hermione) can't have a cause. I was saying that a) she should have a reasonable cause; b) she should be pragmatic and clever about how and what she does to further her cause; c) OP's rant against writers that design a Hermione that complies with a) and b) but doesn't comply with OP's morality compass is severely unjastified and lacking.

  But hey, "House-Elves like it!" Let's completely dismiss their slavery

See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][my first comment,]] the part about the house elf problem consisting of 3 separate issues. And then the post scriptum [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgzgpr3/][of this one.]]

  I think --- A decent being should always protect another human being if /possible/.

How often do you support, monetarily or otherwise, organisations that are striving to free [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_slavery][current-day slaves]] or prevent [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking][human trafficking?]] I won't use this point as an argument since it's technically an ad hominem, but if the answer to those questions is subpar, then you're being hypocritical.
