  1) whether or not house elves are slaves is disputable, but you're presenting it as an already established premise.
#+end_quote

Holy fuck, have you looked at a definition of Slavery before making such an absurd point?

#+begin_quote
  Slavery is, in the strictest sense of the term, any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property.[1] A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, de jure slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against his or her will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour, to refer to such situations.[2] However -- and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word -- slaves may have some rights and/or protections, according to laws and/or customs.

We don't know specifics, but Dobby is "the Malfoy's" house-elf, strongly implying ownership. But what is clear:

  A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration.
#+end_quote

That certainly fits. The rest of the quote makes clear that Dobby was a slave in every sense of the word.

2) That is why I used the term "sapient being". 2.1) is a point, but I pointed out Dobby as a /clear/ example of a slave being /unwilling/ to work for their master, not liking their punishment, and wishing for a change of status.

  Especially when you're a third-year student who obviously doesn't know what they are doing.

Hermione was fourth year. It happened during the Goblet of Fire.

  You can't force a whole species of intelligent creatures to change their preferred way of life just because you think you're better suited to make focal life decisions for them than they themselves are
#+end_quote

That's not what Hermione is trying to do? Since someone else pointed out her plan for SPEW I won't repeat them here.

But, more importantly: How is /not/ giving them the right to /chose/ to be free not a contradiction of this argument in itself? That directly takes away their right to make decisions. Hermione's goal isn't to take away their right to work for wizards, but to give elves the ability to refuse to work. She doesn't want to take away anything.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has the same problem your current argument has --- she has the uncompromising opinion that not only her stance on the house elf issue the only valid one, but also that it entitles her to get into other people's space even if they do not share it with her.
#+end_quote

No, at multiple points in my argument I said "I think" or something similar, implying opinion. You just imply that I presented my opinion as fact. You can disagree that we need to protect another species for example.

Also, I think Hermione is open for multiple sides of the argument, however every counter-argument that she hears ("They like it") has been

- made exactly the same for black slavery
- easily disproved, by stuff Hermione saw /with her own eyes/ (Winky, Dobby)

Why would she change her opinion if no one really gives her a reason to change it? If you have a different opinion, argue for it.

#+begin_quote
  IIRC, she has managed to alienate pretty much all other students save for Harry and Ron.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, she alienated them all so bad that next year when she invited them to the DA no one would come, right? And Ginny doesn't talk about how she asked Hermione for advice with Harry (post-GoF).

#+begin_quote
  Do you think this would've been the case if she thought her strategy first and tried being less aggressive, more approachable, and better suited for explaining her position without brashly trying to dominate her way through?
#+end_quote

Of course! But she's fourteen, give her some slack. In the world of Harry Potter Dumbledore let two students being almost killed, because he didn't want Draco Malfoy to be killed. Minister Fudge thought it was an okay strategy to present a fourteen / fifteen year old as nutter because he didn't want to accept some truths. Umbrige thought it was a good idea to send two dementors after a schoolboy. People make mistakes, Hermione isn't perfect. She was to agressive, the name was stupid, and selling buttons wasn't the right way to approach this issue. Quite frankly, when I read GoF the first few times, I found her incredibly annoying.

But all of that doesn't mean that her underlying cause is wrong, or even that 'bonds' would change anything about most things about her argument. Also, what she has seen with her own eyes is that two house-elves are paid by Hogwarts and surviving, and one of them is thoroughly enjoying it, the other has been a mess with and without work.

6) I even acknowledged your counter-point before you made it. I am aware that simply by living in the western world I support the system, but I'm also arguing that in the HP-verse it's way more direct.
