  How can you tell that any other human is actually sentient?
#+end_quote

Since both me and them are human, I can project my thought patterns on them. It is much more likely, in my opinion, that they have the same type of intelligence as me (more or less) than that they are some zombies with a maxed charisma stat or something. This even works with animals, since their brain \ psychology is a result of evolutionary selection just like mine. Not so much with magical creatures or AIs --- their intelligence could be completely alien to ours. Or, like with current basic computers, they could be completely lacking intelligence.

#+begin_quote
  It doesn't excuse what is basically torture towards the elf, which again can be prevented.
#+end_quote

I agree on this, actually. This is pretty much what I've distinguished as issue #3.

#+begin_quote
  --- is a clear indication that there is something systematically wrong.
#+end_quote

Is an indication, but not yet a proof. A little further research was required to confirm it as a yet another systematic problem of Magical Britain. But Hermione never did that extra bit of research in canon.

#+begin_quote
  Dobby that breaks out in tears when somebody offers him the mildest form of decency. If that isn't an indicator that something is wrong and things need to change I'm not sure what is.
#+end_quote

That's actually a good point. So I concede on that: it is very likely that a systematic problem of mistreatment and abuse of house elves existed in MB.

#+begin_quote
  That is what everyone here is arguing for, so I don't know who the fuck you're arguing against. The whole point of my point is "Let them fucking chose". I have no clue why you always put the words in my mouth that I want to free them all.
#+end_quote

I misunderstood your position on this because I find Hermione wasn't letting them choose what they wanted (as already discussed: the clothmines, the not asking them about their opinions on options of representation and wages, the not studying their psychology first, etc). /You/ seemed to be interpreting these same actions as her offering them to choose, which made it look like you saw the attempts to force a choice onto them as the offering of the right to choose itself.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione put down self-made cloths all over the common-room. But I always assumed that was mostly a symbolic gesture.
#+end_quote

Ah. And how was I to guess that this was what your interpretation of her actions looked like? With which I don't agree with, by the way. It doesn't matter if Hermione's trick would've worked or not. What mattered was that (IIRC) the trick itself made the elves uncomfortable enough to stop performing their duties inside the Gryffindor tower, and yet Hermione didn't stop her “terrorising” attempts, so to speak.

#+begin_quote
  The representative would be helping humans form their understand and thus the long-term goals as much as it would help their race. Wages are debatable, but shouldn't they at least have the option? Why would you deny that?
#+end_quote

I am not denying neither of those things. I am saying that in both cases she should've /asked/ the elves first if they wanted to assign a representative, or to start receiving wages. /Before/ assigning these specific changes as the long-terms goals of her self-declared pro-house-elf club. It's like if someone found a reclusive tribe somewhere in the Amazon rainforest and decided on their own that the people of this tribe deserved \ needed to have a representative on [insert international alliance] and then went right on to trying to make it happen, without asking them first if these people even wanted anything to do with such a representation.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because in my opinion my position is superior (unless you convince me otherwise), or why would even I bother arguing for it? "Moral high ground" does exist. There are things that are not gray, but black and white (or at least dark and light).
#+end_quote

That's that, I guess. Let's just agree to disagree for now, since otherwise this debate would get several different ways of more complicated.

#+begin_quote
  and the ways they went to 'okay' slavery are awfully weak compared to the rest of their arguments about the make-up of the world.
#+end_quote

For the record, ok-ing slavery doesn't necessarily have to do anything with your moral views winning in this case by default or mine losing. Since my counter-arguments aren't based on "slavery being ok" and for yours the "slavery being not ok" is neither sufficient nor necessary.

#+begin_quote
  And you know what? So are your arguments for it. I bring counter-examples directly from canon, I extrapolate based on what's written in canon, but all you give are some bullshit what-if scenarios - that in the end don't fucking matter, because they are not even slightly hinted at in canon, and need to be rather convoluted. If four out of the five points in your post would be true Hermione's actions are still way better than of the people abusing the house-elves, and if 5) was true that it wouldn't even matter.
#+end_quote

It's somewhat disappointing that this was the impression that you were having from our discussion. Then we've clearly reached an impasse, I guess. I admit that the misunderstanding and confusion was partially my fault, since in my first comment I focused on the form of OP's original message a little too much instead of focusing entirely on the content (and on clearly defining my position from the get-go). Oh, well. Maybe we can argue some more in some other thread, if I stop unintentionally being frustrating to you.

#+begin_quote
  I stated a fact. I didn't judge.
#+end_quote

1) Then I have misunderstood you, so I apologise for that. 2) It /was/ somewhat easy to misinterpret the meaning of your message in this case, don't you find? 3) /Now/ you definitely are sounding unnecessarily antagonistic and angry.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, I fucking have.
#+end_quote

You could've just said that it was none of my business, you know. Still, props to you for being congruent on that.

p.s. Thanks for the discussion. I haven't noticed that you were taking it so personally. And have a nice day --- maybe we'll meet in some other thread on a more friendly note, some other time.
