If the universe 2 or 5 were true, why does Dobby exist? If Universe 5 is true, does it matter? How can you tell that any other human is actually sentient? Hint: You can't, that realization goes as back as Descartes, but this is getting off-topic.

However, five would be the only possibility that I'd treat differently.

If it is three, I do not see why the life should be dictated by such a magical bond. If you make it a law (normal, wizard) law that you have to release a house-elf when he - I dunno - says "<Elf> is drowning in tomato ketchup" you have a convenient way to work arount this issue.

And even if magic somehow prevents that: It doesn't excuse what is basically torture towards the elf, which again can be prevented.

So while the master <-> servant relationship would potentially be needed, it doesn't mean the owners have to be dicks.

  then all that can be done is to gradually implement laws that would make the owners of house elves to take good care of them
#+end_quote

I agree with that, but I'm not sure what you're actually arguing here for - because even then her short-term goals are 100% commendable (Rights to prevent abuse, and representation to exactly figure out what they should do)

#+begin_quote
  Anecdotal evidence is not enough for disproving this.
#+end_quote

Yes, in this case it is. The existence of multiple house-elves that were horribly treated around the main canon characters (Dobby, Winky and even Kreacher!) is a clear indication that there is something systematically wrong.

We do not have many examples of elves that are happy. But we have a Dobby that breaks out in tears when somebody offers him the mildest form of decency. If that isn't an indicator that something is wrong and things need to change I'm not sure what is. Kreacher didn't draw happiness from serving his master, he ran away the first chance he got.

  You can't force someone to have a right, because then you make it into an obligation. All you can do is ensure that whoever wants that right, will be able to make use of it.
#+end_quote

Yes. That is what everyone here is arguing for, so I don't know who the fuck you're arguing against. The whole point of my point is "Let them fucking chose". I have no clue why you always put the words in my mouth that I want to free them all.

Hermione put down self-made cloths all over the common-room. But I /always/ assumed that was mostly a symbolic gesture.

- Clothes have to be given, not picked up
- Clothes have to be given by /the master/, which Hermione isn't.

The representative would be helping humans form their understand and thus the long-term goals as much as it would help their race. Wages are debatable, but shouldn't they at least have the option? Why would you deny that?

#+begin_quote
  What was the point of including that bit in your comment if not to show that you thought of your position as the morally superior and more valid one?
#+end_quote

Yes, because in my opinion my position *is* superior (unless you convince me otherwise), or why would even I bother arguing for it? "Moral high ground" does exist. There are things that are not gray, but black and white (or at least dark and light).

Philosophers since thousands of years have tried to define what moral behavior is, and the ways they went to 'okay' slavery are awfully weak compared to the rest of their arguments about the make-up of the world.

And you know what? So are your arguments for it. I bring counter-examples directly from canon, I extrapolate based on what's written in canon, but all you give are some bullshit what-if scenarios - that in the end don't fucking matter, because they are not even slightly hinted at in canon, and need to be rather convoluted. If four out of the five points in your post would be true Hermione's actions are still way better than of the people abusing the house-elves, and if 5) was true that it wouldn't even matter.\\
So *worst case* Hermione is wasting her time and annoying some students. Bo-fucking-hoo!

I'm not sure how I can continue to argue here anymore, I'm out of arguments now. The ones I made still stand, and I don't think you've convinced me that a single one is outshined by "But they like it" or "But they might possibly need it" or "She should have read on it" (How do you know she hasn't? It's more probable than the opposite), so I stand by what I said.

#+begin_quote
  Because one year of difference completely negates my argument.
#+end_quote

Oh, now I can't even state fucking facts that you got something wrong, because you feel that it weakens your argument? I stated a fact. I didn't judge. I didn't comment "If you don't know that how do you know anything?" or something like this, because that would be petty and wrong.

I only want a factual discussion, and that was the whole point of me correcting this.

#+begin_quote
  But have you ever done so?
#+end_quote

Yes, I fucking have. I have donated to multiple causes that I find important. I'm a student at a university, so I'm not exactly well off, however I regularly donate to:

- The German Red Cross, as they do a lot of good projects for the community
- Human Rights organizations (however, I've yet to find one that I'd trust completely, so different ones)
- The German Protestant Church (Even though I don't believe in God), I have talked to the pastor (?) a bit about how their money is spent, and it is mostly well-spent imo. They even do human-rights projects.
- Netzpolitik.org to defend my rights in the internet, a medium I use daily.

Three of the things I donate to don't do anything for me. I think this is a fair balance.
