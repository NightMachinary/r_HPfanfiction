My reasoning is that nomajical definition of slavery may (or may not!) be inapplicable to house elves because they are not humans. I keep writing the same thing again and again and people keep ignoring this important detail, for some reason.

Let's try it like this: let's write down a list of some possible outcomes that ff!Hermione's research can reveal about house elves' nature:

1) on the “hardware level” house elves are very similar to humans, but their culture has been turned into such that they see being free house servants for magicals as their purpose of life

2) on the “hardware level” house elves are fundamentally different from humans, their brains literally reward them for acting as servants to humans and for nothing else.

3) the magical nature of house elves is such that if they agree to work for a wizard, they will bond to him or his family, which will form a master-servant relationship (e.g. Malfoys-Dobby) and make the elf unable to leave the relationship on their own.

4) house elves are just another magical species with their own unique magic, the families control their house elves through customised magical contracts.

5) house elves are magically advanced golems who pass the turing test.

Now consider 5 parallel universes, in each of which the Hermione of that world comes to that specific conclusion. Do you think the nomajic defintion of slavery applies to house elves from universe 1? What about universe 2, 3? 5? What if it's such a universe that each defining subpoint for nomajic concept of slavery is negated in its own way? That's what my argument is partially about: that Hermione has to first find out what exactly is the nature of house elves, to be able to determine whether a) they're not being slaves b) their culture has been hijacked (exploitation, but at the current state of affairs a mostly willing one) c) defining them as slaves would be pretty accurate, and so on.

If she finds out that it's literally in their nature to serve humans, then all that can be done is to gradually implement laws that would make the owners of house elves to take good care of them.

If it's b), Hermione and Co could gradually change their culture, until there comes a generation of house elves in which the majority thinks like Dobby, of themselves as of free creatures.

If it's c), then it's outright slavery, and so on.

But she wouldn't know how to proceed without first finding out how exactly do house elves tick --- and that is the point I am trying to make. Going with a nomaj's knee-jerk reaction of “it's slavery” without doing all the proper research first is just being ignorant /and/ unwilling to learn.

  easily disproved, by stuff Hermione saw with her own eyes (Winky, Dobby)
#+end_quote

Anecdotal evidence is not enough for disproving this. She'd have to contact and check up on other households with house elves (or observe in some other manner) in order to get an accurate answer. Right now all she knows is that 1 elf was likely being kept in slavery (Dobby), 1 elf was mistreated by owners (Winky), many elves willingly agree serving humans for free (Hogwarts elves).

  Hermione was fourth year.

Because one year of difference completely negates my argument. Still, my bad for mixing up the years.

#+begin_quote
  That's not what Hermione is trying to do?

      “Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, “are to *secure house-elves fair wages* and working conditions. Our long-term aims include *changing the law about non-wand-use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,* because they're shockingly under-represented.”

Has she ever tried to ask if the elves themselves want these things? In case of the wages, the Hogwarts elves have plainly stated that they don't want to work for money, but she didn't care about what they had to say. In case of the other two things, I don't think I remember her ever asking anything like that to a group of h. elves.

  How is not giving them the right to chose to be free not a contradiction of this argument in itself?
#+end_quote

You can't /force/ someone to have a right, because then you make it into an obligation. All you can do is ensure that whoever wants that right, will be able to make use of it. Dobby wants to be free --- that's one case. But if Hogwarts' elves /don't/ want that freedom, and you are trying to forcefully give it to them --- through deception, for instance --- then /you/ are being the one who is interpose on their will. I think a suiting analogy would be the real-world right to live \ right to die issue. If you make someone live even if they don't want to, you're making that right into an obligation for them.

#+begin_quote
  No, at multiple points in my argument I said "I think" or something similar, implying opinion. You just imply that I presented my opinion as fact.
#+end_quote

I was referring to this:

#+begin_quote
  since I find it disgusting
#+end_quote

What was the point of including that bit in your comment if not to show that you thought of your position as the morally superior and more valid one? But it doesn't matter, I suppose --- we're already partially arguing over nothing as it is.

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah, she alienated them all so bad that next year when she invited them to the DA no one would come, right?
#+end_quote

Alientated from supporting her on the house elf issue, not into entirely ostracizing her from their lives.

#+begin_quote
  I even acknowledged your counter-point before you made it.
#+end_quote

No, you didn't. That's why I italicised the “possible” when quoting you in my prev. comment: it's definitely /possible/ to protect at least some slaves \ victims of human trafficking by donating money to those organisations, for example. But have you ever done so? That was my point.
