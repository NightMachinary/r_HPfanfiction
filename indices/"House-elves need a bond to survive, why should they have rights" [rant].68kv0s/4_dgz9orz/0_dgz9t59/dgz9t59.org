  Also, this is not true. Hermione usually has three problems with the house elf “slavery”. 1) --- that they are being bonded to magicals 2) --- that they are being given no money for their work 3) --- that they are treated poorly by their owners.

Are you talking about canon right now? What does the "usually" refer to? There's no "bond" in canon, so Hermione isn't against it. And if there were such a bond Hermione would be insane to be against it because Elves require it to be alive. Not sure where you are going with this line of argument.

  The counter-argument to the second issue usually doesn't have much to do with the phenomenon of bonding. What purebloods argue is that “there's no need to do anything about their situation” because the elves themselves don't want their situation to be changed. They enjoy working for wizards --- for free --- and feel extremely uncomfortable when they have to deal with an “anomalous” elf like Dobby.

Ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome? Elves who think that it is right to get their ears shut into an oven are clearly deranged and not in their right mind. It is very obvious that they don't actually enjoy being punished (a fic with masochist BDSM elves might be funny though).
