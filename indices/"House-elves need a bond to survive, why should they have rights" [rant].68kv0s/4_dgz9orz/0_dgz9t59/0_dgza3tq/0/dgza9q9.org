  What does “usually” mean in your OP-message's very first sentence? You were criticising how the “Hermione v.s. the House elf injustice” by-play happens in various fanfic stories, no? I was describing the same thing, continuing the subject that you've started, and also comparing fanon-Hermione to canon one.

Okay so you were talking about how she usually behaves in fanfics? Just wanted to clear that up, no need to get defensive.

Again, that's insane troll logic. Why would she be against the bond if it consigns House Elves to die? Doesn't even make sense.

"Usually" in those fics - after begging for forgiveness for her terrible sin of trying to better the world - she isn't against the bond anymore, because she would be stupid or some kind of Dark Lady who wants to murder all the house-elves if she acted differently. Maybe you are trying to defend retard!Hermione fics though, not sure.

  Also, you've neatly ignored the ending of my comment, well done.

*sigh* What do you want me to say?

  Would it have been nice if magicals treated their house elves more decently? It would've, sure. It would also be nice if werewolves had more rights, if so many magical intelligent species weren't labeled as magical beasts, and if the magicals negotiated some sort of simbiotic relationship with no-majs to use each other's capabilities for fixing otherwise unsolvable problems.

Werewolves are in a whole other league to house-elves. They aren't enslaved, just second class citizens (AIDS/HIV analogy).

What do you want me to address here? We agree that these circumstances should be better, right? What's your point? You're just against trying to improve their circumstances?

  Yet Hermione gets a tunnel vision fixation on the house elf issue, for some reason, and starts annoying random people --- who are not obligated to help her in any manner whatsoever --- which just alienates potential allies and makes them want to avoid her in future.

Ah. That's a logical fallacy (fallacy of relative privation). Hermione clearly can't address every bad thing in the world at once and just because she decides to address one of those doesn't mean the others don't matter or that she's obligated to address those too.

The fact that this annoys people is kind of necessary. Do you think civil rights activists in the US annoyed plantation owners? I bet they did.
