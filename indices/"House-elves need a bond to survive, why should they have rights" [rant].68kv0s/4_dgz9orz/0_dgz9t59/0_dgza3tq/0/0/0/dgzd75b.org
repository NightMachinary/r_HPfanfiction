Hermione cares about House-elf rights because no one else seems to care (or isn't doing anything about it). She does care about other issues (werewolves, centaurs etc.).

House-elves compared to Goblins and centaurs have no form of self-governance (they're at the mercy of wizards) or representation in the ministry. So yes there is other problems, but it makes sense that Hermione seized upon this one.

  Not go and try forcing people into abandoning their own problems and fixing it for her.

When does she do this? Hermione expects people to join her sure-but she's the one directing the movement. She also doesn't lower the importance of other issues. For example she doesn't say to Lupin 'I think house-elf rights are more important than werewolf rights' instead she compares the prejudices:

#+begin_quote
  'I mean it's the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn't it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they're superior to other creatures...'
#+end_quote

In any case Hermione's criticism of House-Elf treatment is ultimatetly supported in the text (Harry and Dumbledore both supported the issue). Did she go about her movement in the wrong way? Yes. But she /was/ right. There is a serious problem with wizarding treatment of house-elves and it's endemic in their society.
