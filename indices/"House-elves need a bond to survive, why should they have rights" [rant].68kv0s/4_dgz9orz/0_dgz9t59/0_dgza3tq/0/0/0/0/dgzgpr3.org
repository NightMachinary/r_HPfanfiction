  Hermione cares about House-elf rights because no one else seems to care (or isn't doing anything about it). --- House-elves compared to Goblins and centaurs have no form of self-governance (they're at the mercy of wizards) or representation in the ministry. So yes there is other problems, but it makes sense that Hermione seized upon this one.
#+end_quote

She never stops to ask herself why the Hogwarts elves were gradually becoming terrified of her. She wanted to give them more rights without asking them what they themselves thought their rights should be like. She never tries to research what kind of creatures they truly are. Maybe most of them don't need money because their brains are wired in a way to directly reward them for doing work for wizards, similar to the lower castes in Brave New World. Maybe they do not have the same type of intelligence that humans or even centaurs have, so intuitive projection would not work for understanding their patterns of thought. I am not saying these were what was definitely the case in canon, but she never investigates to learn /what/ was. She just /assumes/, and jumps right to the part of politicking and annoying others.

  Did she go about her movement in the wrong way? Yes. But she was right.
#+end_quote

Well, that's partially the point --- we (and she) can't know if she was right or not because she did not do her research into house elf psychology (only into their history in the wizarding society). Nor did she listen when people kept disagreeing with her or try asking the disagreeing parties /why/ were they disagreeing.

      ‘Hermione -- open your ears,' said Ron loudly. ‘They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!'

      ‘Our short-term aims,' said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word

  When does she do this?
#+end_quote

That part was partially addressed against Hermione [[https://www.pottermore.com/book-extract-long/spew][volunteering Harry and Ron into her SPEW initiative,]]

      His and Ron's lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione's determination to pursue justice for house-elves. True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, firstly to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.

and partially against Deathcrow's Hermione-to-be. A story writer (or a story's character) does not need to make excuses for not prioritizing the house elf issue above others to not “look like a crazy sociopath”.

#+begin_quote
  In any case Hermione's criticism of House-Elf treatment is ultimatetly supported in the text (Harry and Dumbledore both supported the issue).
#+end_quote

Three problems with this argument, IMO. 1) Treatment of specific house elves (Dobby, Winky, etc) is one issue [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][(problem #3 mentioned here),]] while wanting to completely revamp the existing wizard-elf relationship is another. 2) I wouldn't trust the judgement of either of these two characters on this issue, even though for different reasons. 3) This is both an appeal to public opinion and an appeal to authority. Her criticism can be valid because [insert logical reasoning], not because [so and so believe it is valid].

--------------

p.s. Just to try clarifying my position on this: I think that the #2 issue [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/68kv0s/houseelves_need_a_bond_to_survive_why_should_they/dgz9orz/][(link)]] has not been proven in canon to be a legitimate problem (it can be, or it can not --- we don't have enough information to judge), while #3 issue /is/ a legitimate problem but not a severe enough one to redirect resources from fixing more important ones first.
