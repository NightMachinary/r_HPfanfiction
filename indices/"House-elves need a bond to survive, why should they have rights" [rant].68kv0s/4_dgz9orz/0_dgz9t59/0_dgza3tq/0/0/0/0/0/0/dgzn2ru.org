We can deduce that she hasn't researched house elven psychology, at least, because otherwise she wouldn't have been placing clothmines all over the Gryffindor common room waiting for the Hogwarts elves to trigger them and “free themselves”.

Another similar scene is her interaction with the kitchen elves during which she again demonstrates that she has no idea what principles the house elves value, what worldview do they have, and what should or should not be a proper way of warming them up to the idea of self-freedom and paid labour.

      “And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?” Hermione asked kindly.

      If she had thought this would cheer Winky up, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.

      “Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”

      “Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But -- Winky, come on! It's Mr Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you --”

      But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr Crouch! Mr Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!”

I even accept that it's possible that /all/ the magicals have been so conceited up to that point that there existed no book about house elven psychology /at all/. But even then, all she had to do was research the matter on her own, carefully asking questions to the Hogwarts elves from different directions, observing their reactions and noting down their replies.

Instead she just keeps blindly pushing ahead. With no regard to how effective her adopted tactics really are and no attempts to update her hypothesis about house elves based on the empirical data that her very interactions with these creatures are giving her.
