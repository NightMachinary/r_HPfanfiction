  Again, that's insane troll logic. Why would she be against the bond if it consigns House Elves to die?

It would've helped if you've re-read my original comment before responding --- I feel like you haven't paid enough attention to understanding what I was trying to say before proceeding to compose your reply.

I'm not saying that she remains against the bonds no matter what. I'm saying that the necessity for bonds gets mentioned to her as a counter-argument only against her first issue --- when she starts criticizing how wizards are bonding house elves to them. The second and the third issues are a separate matter, and the bond counter-argument is not being used against those issues (other arguments are).

#+begin_quote
  That's a logical fallacy (fallacy of relative privation).
#+end_quote

If you're thinking that I was trying to use that as a relative privation argument then, again, you were not reading my comments carefully enough before responding to them.

#+begin_quote
  What's your point?
#+end_quote

I am not saying that house elves should be glad with their current situation, or that their issue should be ignored just because there are much worse things happening out there.

My point is that there's a great deal of things that are wrong with the wizarding society of Magical Britain, and as the reaction of Hogwarts students (in canon) indicated, almost nobody would've cared to prioritise the house elf right issue over everything else that needs fixing.

If your story's Hermione thinks house elves should be considered as full-scale citizens of Magical Britain, that's fine. If, however, the rest of the Magical Britain's population doesn't agree with her and wants to prioritize fixing a long list of other problems first that they find to be more important, then Hermione is out of luck --- they are not /obliged/ to help her in fixing something that they find to be relatively unimportant. And they are not /obliged/ to pay Hermione any attention when their lack of reaction “offends” her.

Another thing is that you're assuming the same population would automatically agree to grant the house elves the status of full-scale citizens, which I also think is quite unrealistic to happen; and a completely separate subject for debate.

  Hermione clearly can't address every bad thing in the world at once and just because she decides to address one of those doesn't mean the others don't matter or that she's obligated to address those too.
#+end_quote

Yet another misunderstanding: I'm not expecting her to address all those problems. I'm saying that /nobody else/ is obliged to pay her house elf campaign any attention --- especially when they have so many other things to deal with, and when she's getting in their faces with her moral superiority delusion. If she has decided to focus on the house elf problem first --- she's free to try fixing it either by herself or with the help of people who share her opinions on the importance of this issue. /Not go and try forcing people into abandoning their own problems and fixing it for her./

p.s. If your next response proves to be as rushed and poorly thought-out as the last one was, I'm afraid I'll lose interest in continuing this discussion with you.
