  What does the "usually" refer to?
#+end_quote

What does “usually” mean in your OP-message's very first sentence? You were criticising how the “Hermione v.s. the House elf injustice” by-play happens in various fanfic stories, no? I was describing the same thing, continuing the subject that you've started, and also comparing fanon-Hermione to canon one.

  Ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

And is Hermione qualified to distinguish which house elves are showing signs of this syndrome and which ones are not? Based on her interaction with Hogwarts' house elves and their reaction to her attempts to free them (hint: they starting avoiding her like the plague) I'd say she's not. And if you're about to say that Dobby's a clear case of a house elf in need for help, I'll link you to my previous comment, where issue #2 is an entirely separate one from issue #3.

Also, you've neatly ignored the ending of my comment, well done.
