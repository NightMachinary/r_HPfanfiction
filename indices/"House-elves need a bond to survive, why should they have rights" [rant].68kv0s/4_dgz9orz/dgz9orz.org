  I'll probably blow an aneurysm if

  insane troll-logic.

  is extremely offensive to me.

  Honestly, anyone who thinks that this "bond" is a good reason for Hermione to abandon her cause seems a little fucked in the head to me

  but please try to find a reason why it's not necessary that doesn't make you look like a crazy sociopath

How do so many people manage to find so many things /extremely offensive/ and to generate so much rightful indignation?

  It usually goes something like this: "But Hermione, didn't you know? House-elves need a bond to a wizard or they will die!!!" Hermione then breaks out in tears and abandons SPEW forever and vows to never question the world of magic and their sacred and super smart traditions ever again.

Also, this is not true. Hermione usually has three problems with the house elf “slavery”. 1) --- that they are being bonded to magicals 2) --- that they are being given no money for their work 3) --- that they are treated poorly by their owners.

The /“House-elves need a bond to a wizard or they will die-multiple-exclamation-points”/ is a counter-argument to Hermione's first issue.

The counter-argument to the second issue usually doesn't have much to do with the phenomenon of bonding. What purebloods argue is that “there's no need to do anything about their situation” because /the elves themselves don't want their situation to be changed./ They enjoy working for wizards --- for free --- and feel extremely uncomfortable when they have to deal with an “anomalous” elf like Dobby.

Now, is Hermione free to try to change the status quo and convince the house elves to stand up for their rights? By all means, she is. What she /can't/ do, however --- if she doesn't want to look like an annoying door-to-door cult representative --- is try to shoehorn people into helping her just because she holds the assumption that her moral judgement on this matter is the only objectively valid one.

Would it have been nice if magicals treated their house elves more decently? It would've, sure. It would also be nice if werewolves had more rights, if so many magical intelligent species weren't labeled as magical beasts, and if the magicals negotiated some sort of simbiotic relationship with no-majs to use each other's capabilities for fixing otherwise unsolvable problems.

Yet Hermione gets a tunnel vision fixation on the house elf issue, for some reason, and starts annoying random people --- who are not obligated to help her in any manner whatsoever --- which just alienates potential allies and makes them want to avoid her in future.
