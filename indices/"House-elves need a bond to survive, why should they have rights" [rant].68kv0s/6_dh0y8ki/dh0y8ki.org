Can I say something completely random? In canon, Kreacher lived for something like a decade or more by himself alone in Grimmauld Place with only a crazy painting to keep him company. With the rest of the Blacks dead, the only person he could possibly be 'bonded' to was Sirius, who was far away in Azkaban.

So my question is, /if/ we assume that house-elves must be bonded somehow to a wizard or witch to survive, how exactly did Kreacher live alone for those years? And, why can't they all just bond to some far away figure and live out their lives freely?

...Ooh, that has potential actually! A 'Dalai Lama' for house-elves who is responsible for anchoring each of them to life; when he/she dies, all the elves set out to search the world for their successor, whoever the bond passed to.

Perhaps for plot, some bad guy, probably Voldemort, finds this High Elf and takes them hostage, threatening to destroy the house-elves through the bond unless they serve him. Our protagonist (Harry, of course) might get embroiled in an adventure to save this High Elf from captivity.

Ooh, ooh, more potential! There could have been a High Elf in the past who performed the role of anchoring house-elves to the world, sort of like a benign horcrux. When the High Elf was slain, the surviving house-elves instead learned to use human magicals as anchors, though it came at the cost of being partially bound to those humans will.

Mystery abounds, when elves who should be dying upon being severed from their masters (Dobby, Kreacher, etc), are somehow continuing to remain in the world. Have they somehow evolved to be capable of remaining in the world without an anchor, or is there a new High Elf somewhere out there?

...Sorry, my brain ran away from me. But yeah, Kreacher lived for +10+ 14 years without serving a real master. Explain that, 'house-elves-die-if-they-aren't-enslaved' fans.
