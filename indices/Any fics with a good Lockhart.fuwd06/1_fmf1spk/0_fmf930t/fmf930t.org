It's a decent fic, but Lockhart is a very weird combination of Lockhart and Harry, and he says a lot of weird-uncle(-though-he-means-well) creepy things about Hermione (he basically ships her and Harry to the degree of some of the more... enthusiastic shippers in the fandom). It's a fun fic, but it's one of those that has one big thing that switches a lot of people off, so be wary of that in advance.
