Depends on your definition of bashing. It varies a lot in this fandom, especially with characters like Ron - if you think he's good and loyal, then calling him a selfish cunt is bashing, but if you think he's a disloyal layabout, then calling him a selfish cunt is not bashing. The characters are open enough and inconsistent enough that you can take whatever interpretation you like and be at least a little right, so it varies.

Personally, I would say that Lockhart bashes Ron more than the story bashes Ron, though the story definitely does bash Ron at least a little. He says a lot of stuff about Ron that he knows isn't true, but he's deliberately trying to drive Ron and Harry apart for future-reasons that probably come close to bashing for most folks.

That's just my opinion, though. Your mileage might vary. :)
