Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider and it's sequel have a very interesting Lockhart, both similar to canon and differently competent. He's a bigger part of the sequel, but he's present enough in the first I can rec it for the request and not just because it sets up a lot of stuff for the second fic's plot.
