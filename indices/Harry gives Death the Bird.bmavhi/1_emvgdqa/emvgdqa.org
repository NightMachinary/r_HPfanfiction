Sounds like a cool idea but doing everything the exact same way would be entirely boring to read. On the other hand if Death were to take offense to having Harry do everything the exact same way and throw curve balls derailing Harry's plan of sticking it to Death then that would probably be worth the read. But if everything is the same... I'll pass.
