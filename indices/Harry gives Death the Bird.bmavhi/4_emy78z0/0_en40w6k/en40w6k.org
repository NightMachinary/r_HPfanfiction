I read one not all that long ago where Harry cleared out, hid his identity with a Fidelius charm and went to America under a false name. Voldemort took over Britain, except for Hogwarts, and Dumbledore eventually tracked Harry down, many years later, and tried to persuade him to come back and fulfill the prophecy by destroying Voldemort.
