To be fair, in book 2 she had absolutely no ability to save Ginny. She didn't know what was in the chamber or where it was, she thought Ginny was a lost cause. It's a terrible position to be in, but she had over 200 other students to get to safety and had to make a hard choice. She wasn't laughing about sending Lockhart away or trying to do a funny prank, she just wanted him out of the way so she could focus on getting the rest of the students to safety.
