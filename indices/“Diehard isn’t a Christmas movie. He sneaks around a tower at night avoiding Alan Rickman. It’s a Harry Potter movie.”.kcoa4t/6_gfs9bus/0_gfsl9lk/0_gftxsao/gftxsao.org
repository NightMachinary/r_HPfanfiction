-Book 1 McGonnagal dismissing being told about the plot to steal the Stone

-Book 2 McGonnagal laughing and sending Lockhart as a joke when a student was in the process of being murdered

-Book 2 and 4 McGonnagal doing little-to-nothing to curb rampant bullying happening in front of literally the entire teaching staff/student body (Plus the guests in GoF)

I don't like the uberbashing but tbh if the Trio didn't have plot armor she'd have gotten four people killed directly (Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny), caused Voldemort to return twice (Getting the Stone, absorbing Ginny's life force), and generally just promoted an environment of harassment and bullying from the Student Body.
