Joe Leland, the main character of the book Die Hard was based on, was in his 70s during the events of the book. McGonagall is probably the closest to an age appropriate person to fill the role.

Of course, unlike McClane, Leland's roles in the story was to actively make things work out poorly and get a bunch of people killed with his stupidity, so maybe not the best comparison.
