This is a Snape adopts 17 year old Harry fic, post-OttP but later incorporating quite a bit of the HBP & DH stuff.

I'm going to spoil a little bit here, just to titilate you.

[[/spoiler][So in this AU, Dumbledore basically has no clue about Horcruxes. But he is still suspicious about something being off with Harry. So he subtly arranges this adoption for the dual purpose of Harry finally getitng someone he can rely on, but at the same time someone who can keep an eye of things and is experienced at managing a powerful wizard (which Harry is quickly becoming in this AU). And you get these wonderful moments, of where everyone is (legitimately) scared shitless of what Harry is capable of (which in turn makes Harry want to shoot himself), that Snape handles breaking little sweat. It's a very entertaining extrapolation to the question, what does serving a powerful dark wizard give you skills for - apparently, how to handle an adolescent wizard whose power is growing by leaps and bounds.]]

[[/spoiler][So there is this interesting dynamic, of Harry and Snape both growing in interesting, believeable ways - Snape, being free of Voldemort can actually act like he's not a piece of shit, while Harry proceeds to auror training, showcasing his developing ability to be a part of power structure. Plus Snape gets a girlfriend and tries to atone for all past shit he got into.]]
