Well in case the Prince of the Dark Kingdom is recommended, I would also recommend the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels - it fits the request the same way the PotDK does. Snape is not the main character there, but he plays an important role. He is highly respected, confident and essentially good character. It is major AU as well. linkffn(7613196)
