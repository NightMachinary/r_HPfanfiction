linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Not sure if this fits, but it's a major AU where Voldemort won the first war (although he is more sane and reasonable than in canon so his made society is not bad, just a bit morally questionable at times) Snape is still not very nice, but he wasn't responsible for Lily's death so he is more well adjusted. He has a lot less hate than in canon and actually pursues his own goals. He also dates a few times and gets together with someone else which makes sense for his character in context.

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me) Time travel story where both Snape and Lily end up time traveling from the time they died to their Hogwarts years.

linkffn(Callidus Prince and the Unseen Adversary) Snape gets slipped a potion that turns him 11 again permanently right before Harry's first year. Without prejudices, Harry and deaged Severus become friends. Although it starts in the first year, has an original story line and not a Canon rehash.
