  Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts brings with it three friends who might just help him honour his biggest role models, a Slytherin rival in the form of one Evan Snape, a bossy girl who refuses to choose between them, and a mystery to be solved involving a small package hidden on the third floor. A retelling set in the world where Lily Evans made different choices as a young girl - a world in which she did not give birth to Harry Potter, and James Potter died for a different son, but their children, raised in the shadows of their parents' choices, must nonetheless find the path that would one day lead them to protect everything they hold dear from the greatest menace Wizarding Britain had ever seen
