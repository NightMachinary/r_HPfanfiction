linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) /may/ fit your request.

Snape isn't the focus, but he's definitely a main character who is much more well adjusted and (imo) a better person. He takes Harry under his wing, partially because he sees himself in Harry (young halfblood in Slytherin who grew up in an abusive household) and because he dislikes James (James is trying to disinherit Harry in this fic for spoiler reasons).

It's overall a great fic but if Snape not being the main protagonist isn't up your alley that's totally fine.
