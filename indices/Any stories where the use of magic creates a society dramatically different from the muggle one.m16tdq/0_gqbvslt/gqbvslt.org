Linkffn(Significant Digits) comes to mind. A society capable of curing just about every illness including aging. Where Gold can literally be permanently transigured into existence. It is an HPMOR sequel though. Deals with world scale politics.

Linkffn(unsphere the stars) has a magical state as its endgame.

Linkao3(October) A God!Harry decides to civilize Mars.

Linkao3(The Lady Of (New) Avalon) Has a magical utopia as the endgoal for the protagonists. Still a long way to the end. But the AU Worldbuilding and Magic is unique and has enough depth to consider it a separate culture. Tons of day to day use of magic : from hairstyling charms to magical apparel to gender-inversion rituals to an actual system of Gods and Powers. Also recommend the authors' other works set in the shared AU.
