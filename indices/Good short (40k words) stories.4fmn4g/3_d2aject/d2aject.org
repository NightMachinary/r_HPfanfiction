On mobile so I cannot link to it. But I recommend Arabella's "The Very Secret Diary". It is basically how Tom and Ginny would have interacted through the diary and it is a very very well written fic to explore their disturbing relationship and for a fic almost 15 years old, has aged incredibly well.
