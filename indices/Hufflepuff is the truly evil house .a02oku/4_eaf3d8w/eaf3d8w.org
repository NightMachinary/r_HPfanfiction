I remember a story in which a very smart arse Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw , where he refused to play by their rules and was excluded from the secret Ravenclaw society which enables them to get good jobs later on.

Hufflepuffs are loyal and hardworking , a Hufflepuff trying to take control of the wizarding world would be amazing. Badgers are vicious little beasts
