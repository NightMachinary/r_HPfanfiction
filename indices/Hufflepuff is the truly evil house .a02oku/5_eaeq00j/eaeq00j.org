I agree that you're on to something with the house system being a pretty bad idea, and each having the potential for villainy.

I've a series that sets up Ravenclaws as the villains. They're the intellectual elite, full of arrogance and lacking compassion. To me, it's the house that creates the classic super-genius villains. The Hufflepuffs are their counterparts, being academically inferior, but caring about goodness and kindness and friendship over personal superiority.

Hufflepuff, though, could easily be monsters. Their first trait is loyalty. Being loyal says nothing about being good. While the other three houses are all very individualistic (individual bravery, ambition, and intellect) Hufflepuff is about unity, and unity is not a particularly good thing.
