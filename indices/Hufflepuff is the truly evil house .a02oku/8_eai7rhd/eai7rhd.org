I remember two,

one was the Saving Connor Series, where a few of his loyal were hufflepuffs and quite... evil, and slavishly loyal. Even getting their families to help them??? (maybe?)

another is the reason Draco doesn't want to be in Hufflepuff was because his mom kept telling him it was evil as it was where Bellatrix was sorted and she was evil.
