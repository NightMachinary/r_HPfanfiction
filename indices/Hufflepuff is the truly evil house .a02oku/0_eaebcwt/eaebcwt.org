If you can get them marching in lockstep, large groups with deep in-group loyalty and a common purpose are /dangerous/.

Hufflepuff House is the great untapped Dark Lord resource: the first wizarding villain to figure this out is going to /clean up/. I mean, leading Slytherins is like herding cats, Gryffindors are even /less/ controllable, and Ravenclaws are too busy contemplating the whichness of what to make effective baddies. Hufflepuffs, all you have to do is sell your agenda as appropriately fair and inclusive and get them doing the metaphorical goose-step in the right direction. You end up with task-oriented team-player minions, and if you can train them to contribute individual initiative to the groupthink they're positively /scary/.
