The thing that defines Dumbledore most as a character is regret. Regret for the things he's done, and the things he hasn't.

If you wanted to bring in the prophecy, you could have him essentially cling to the thing with gratitude and do everything he can to make it happen - after all, those actions are determined by the prophecy, not him, so they'll surely turn out better (in his head - his decisions killed Ariana, created Grindelwald and Voldemort, and lead many to ruin).

If you wanted to make him a good guy, have him basically be trying to give Harry the best childhood possible (ie. not having to be a Baby Politician) and just really, really fucking it up because he's a hundred year old bachelor and has literally no idea what kids are like these days. That whole "What? But when I was your age, I loved making breakfast for the family, and I was grateful for every scrap!" vibe.

Other good guy way - maybe Harry having those titles and powers has some consequences Dumbledore is trying to protect him from in that kind of "Ugh. Everyone keeps looking to me for answers and I'm the Chief Warlock. How in the heck did I end up Chief Warlock? Don't be like me, Harry. Be free and happy and go make cheese in the mountains somewhere" sort of way. I'm currently writing (haven't uploaded yet) a fic where Harry has some Indy Tendencies and ends up getting his inheritances early, only to find out there's some real shitty strings attached to them. (Consider real shitty underlined several times :D). Dumbledore is basically tired of everyone's shit and regularly muses on whether the guilt of abandoning it all to go start a farm and do magical research would be too much for him or not.

If you wanted to make him a villain, make him a Knight Templar who's utterly dedicated to not letting another mistake happen. Sure, Harry being isolated and low-powered might be less happy for him, but the consequences of being wrong there leads to one sad kid. If Harry is the new Voldemort and had all that power, the consequences are significantly worse and Dumbledore is basically three for three.

There's probably a tonne more (and a tonne of holes in the suggestions I made) but that's all I could come up with in five minutes and I've gotta go make dinner now so that's all I got. :D
