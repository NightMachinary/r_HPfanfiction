Harry, Voldemort, grindelwald and Dumbledore. All are extremely powerfull wizards, the type that has been documented in history. Dumbledore sees these people as agent of chaos and death, himself included.

When harry dies fighting Voldemort, both kill each other. If Dumbledore survives he keeps to being a headmaster and making as little waves as possible, because he believes the power he wields is unnatural/disruptive to the world.

Keeping harry as weak as possible is a way to make sure he doesn't survive or if he does then he will at least be an above average wizard at best and will not cause too much strife in the world.

Or something like that, I like the other explanations too, except the wizangamot one haha
