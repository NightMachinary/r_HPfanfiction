The most common explanation I've seen for this in fanfics is that Dumbledore kept Harry in his abusive home life and kept him clueless so that he would need to rely heavily on Dumbledore for guidance.

If he came from a background lacking love and had never experienced being valued by anyone he would be more desperate to have those things once he got a taste of it, and then in swoops Dumbledore, the kindly grandfather figure. That kind of person would have Harry's full, blind loyalty and trust.
