The popular explanations I've seen:-

- Harry would threaten Dumbledore's personal power e.g. Dumbledore is currently using Harry's Wizengamot seats as part of his voting block or Dumbledore is using Harry's money to fund Hogwarts scholarships polishing his public image or making the recipients his clients.
- Dumbledore needs Harry to have few ties to the wider world so he will sacrifice himself to stop Voldemort, as per the prophecy.
