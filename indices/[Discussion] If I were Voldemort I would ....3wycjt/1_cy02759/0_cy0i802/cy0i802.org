  E=MC2 only remains relevant when you can't enchant something so that M = 5 independent of how much fuel you cram into your magically expanded fuel tanks.

Magic lets you sidestep a lot of the problems inherent in spaceflight. Effectively zero mass fuel is insane. You can also replicate food, create water, vanish waste off into the ether... Now I kinda wanna read a scifi HP fic that isn't a crossover, where they start a magical space program and go exploring.
