I think this question deserves two types of answers depending on how you mean it; Am I (A) Me with his power set? Or (B) Him with my methodology?

In either case, I'd do one metric butt-ton more research into horcruxes before trying to make one at 16. Immortality is nice, but an eternity as a crazy person incapable of proper emotions doesn't sound pleasant.

A) I don't think I want to rule the world, or even Wizarding Britain.

It either sounds like either far too much work, or small potatoes. If I woke up tomorrow in the body of an 11 year old Tom Riddle on his way to Hogwarts I'd set my sights on beating the muggles to the moon. From there, the rest of space. E=MC^{2} only remains relevant when you can't enchant something so that M = 5 independent of how much fuel you cram into your magically expanded fuel tanks.

B) If you instead mean how would I accomplish the goal he picked?

If I set out to conquer the world as a powerful immortal wizard... I'd become Dumbledore. I'd cultivate an image of a academic/intellectual researcher type (See my above project) who wants to learn more about magic. I'd act surprised when I failed to die of old age (Assuming Horcruxes even work that way, I suspect I may need to mimic Palpatine's self cloning operation as well as having the horcrux to handle being murdered) Wait until the entire populace sees you as a force of nature that simple IS while slowly building up your political base until it's functionally impossible not to have a vote go your way. (Also helpful if you can resist the urge to meddle in the minor things) (Arguably, Tom tried thisbut Albus wouldn't hire him as the DADA professor because Tom couldn't keep control of his snake, and should consider that as or more embarrassing that the usual way that euphemism runs)
