I was thinking more like Koschei the Deathless, hidden inside a needle, which is in an egg, which is in a duck, which is in a hare, which is in an iron chest, which is buried under a green oak tree, which is on the island of Buyan in the ocean. Or like HPMOR, slap it on one of the space vessels travelling outside the solar system.
