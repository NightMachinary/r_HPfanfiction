Horcruxes (Horcruxi?) never strike me as a logical method of achieving immortality, based of my own thoughts of how a soul or Life/Death works from a magical perspective.

I've always thought that a soul is more like a box. It contains (or links the body to) ones memories and magic. Perhaps even soul bound items if you can figure out how to do that.

If this were the case, splitting your soul would diminish your overall magical capacity and shatter/damage both memories and the psyche, leading to personality disorders such as megalomania, which I'm pretty sure Voldemort had.

It could also explain why ghosts could be seen; their prior magic sustaining some form of illusion at the cost of their magic reserves. Where usually depleted magic reserves would refilled from ones life energy, a ghost is usually tethered to location and feeds of the naturally generated magic there.

Placing a part of your soul in your newly born child would basically mean that a child grows up with memories already in place, but without the developed brain functionality to access them, and while they develop and grow to being able to access these memories they form some of their own, changing the soul within them and becoming a new person (who most likely won't step aside so that you can live). This also why I feel memory charming people is killing them slightly, and remaking someone you prefer (if you alter memories) since our personality and reactions are based off of our memories.

The two best ideas for immortality I can think of are; you can make a phylactery and artificial body (possibly clone your own repeatedly). With your soul safe elsewhere and a replaceable body you can control remotely you can essentially do whatever you want.

The other method is becoming a Necromancer. Necromancers have two main skills/functions they develop while learning; communing with the dead, and the manipulation of life energy. By drawing in life energy from other people, animals, and fauna you can essentially stop or even reverse your aging process.
