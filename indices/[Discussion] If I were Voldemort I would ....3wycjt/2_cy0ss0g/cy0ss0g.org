Make my horcruxes from small, easily overlooked objects that I could keep around my home without suspicion; an old shirt shoved into the back of a drawer, a book picked at random from a giant library. I'd cover them with spells to keep them safe, stop them from deteriorating, and other general maintenance spells and light magic to mask the dark magic within, so that if anyone examined them they'd just see something that had been given a bit of extra protection; perhaps a little over the top, but certainly not suspicious. I'd cover other objects with the same light spells to make them blend in well. I'd also put notice-me-not spells on the horcruxes so people didn't want to look too closely.

Then, my pièce de rèsistance. I would gather beautiful objects from my family, the house founders, leaving a trail of bodies as I did so. I would put the darkest enchantments I knew upon them so they reeked of darkness and death; dark magic leaves a trace, easy enough to cover, but I'd pretend I didn't know how. I'd use a very mild cloaking spell on them, so it looked like I'd at least attempted, but make sure they were still radiating evil. I would make sure the enchantments flared up when they were threatened, or simply opened, and that they were grand and dramatic and unmissable.

A book that contains a spectre of my former self, channeling a little poison into their body through contact with the pages until they slowly go mad.

A ring containing an unstoppable curse that will rapidly deteriorate the body, and an echo of my laugh.

A locket with a boggart tethered to it, and a curse that will make the wearer miserable and weak, before revealing their greatest fears upon opening.

A cup that would poison any who drank from it, and release a flood of dark energy if destroyed.

A diadem whose powers were corrupted to drive the wearer mad with conflicting lies, where once it would give only knowledge and truth. A spectral light show included upon destruction.

Each of these I protect with powerful spells that will stop them being destroyed by anything other than basilisk venom, or fiendfyre. I hide them, in places connected to my past, or to my followers, covered with dark enchantments to make them difficult, but not impossible to retrieve. If these enchantments happen to torture or incapacitate my enemies, all the better. I make sure to give one to a follower with a link to Hogwarts, tell him to sneak it in, right under Dumbledore's nose when the time is right. I make sure to drop hints to my bumbling but affectionate potions teacher, asking about the horcruxes I am already expert on, mentioning the "sacred number seven", as though such things would matter to a boy who grew up in a muggle orphanage. Eventually I will have my followers terrorize him, chase him back to Dumbledore at the right time to drop these hints. I create one final "horcrux" in the form of my loyal pet snake, who I can control easily with paseltongue, and add a spell which will make her blood fester and smoke upon her death.

Finally, the boy. My "seventh horcrux". I am not stupid enough to act on half a prophecy, I certainly found out the entire thing before acting, and the idea that Dumbledore truly believes a toddler will be my undoing is too good not to act on. I am aware that the prophecy may apply to either the Potter boy or the Longbottom boy, and I will "mark" one; I chose the Potters mostly as it gives me an excuse to kill Lily Potter and turn Severus against me.

Make no mistake, I do my research before allowing anyone into my inner circle, I have no doubt that he is in love with her and will turn to Dumbledore the second I mutter the curse. This is good. It gives me a way of feeding the right information to Dumbledore through my "most trusted servant". Severus has already told me of James Potter and his three best friends. I'm sure the Potters are under a fidelius curse, just a matter of torturing those three until they give me what I need; best to start with Pettigrew, he seems the weakest and will crack easily. Perhaps I can make him my spy, or at least put him under a strong Imperius.

Once Pettigrew has spilled, I go to the Potters personally. I send Bella and a few lesser followers to the Longbottoms, having already gleamed their address from their secret keeper. I tell them not to harm the boy, but to torture his parents into insanity, so he will know better than to ever defy me. Perhaps he will come of use some day; the Potter boy certainly will. I kill his parents, giving Lily a chance to live so that the child will be protected by mother's love, and keep him safe until he is old enough to be of use to me. Then I prick both our fingers and rub his blood into mine; our shared blood will stop the protection from affecting me. I mark his head with a curse scar, essentially a modified dark mark; it will allow me to create a passage from his mind to mine, to see and hear what he's seeing, to share emotions, even to channel my powers through him if need be. When that's done, I blow up the house (making sure not to harm the kid in the process) and I apparate away to a safehouse in (also under a fidelius charm, performed by an imperiused witch or wizard already assumed dead who I will keep around as a servant. I'll let people think I'm dead for about 10 years, and spend my time researching the Deathly Hallows, and plotting ways to take down Dumbledore and my other enemies.
