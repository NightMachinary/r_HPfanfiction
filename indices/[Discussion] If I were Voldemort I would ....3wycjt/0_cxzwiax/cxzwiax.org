If I were Voldemort, I would not have bothered with the horcruxes in the first place, or not until I had full control of the British wizarding world.

I have a nagging suspicion that making horcruxes negatively affects one's decision making skills, even though the process does not diminish one's magical power or intelligence. Voldemort had become indeed extremely powerful after going through all these magical experimentations and transformations, but I think that he could have achieved far more or caused far greater damages if he pursued the 'Palpatine Route'.

Palpatine hid under Yoda's (a wise figure akin to Dumbledore) nose for decades, steadily corrupting the Senate (Wizengamot), creating conflicts that had Jedis (Aurors, the Order) confused and the public scared, seizing the position of Supreme Chancellor (Minister of Magic) as a sympathy figure, playing both sides of the conflict as a puppet master, thinning out the ranks of Jedis in a war he controlled, successfully turning the Chosen One due his love for his mother and wife, and eliminating his enemies in one fell stroke.

If Palpatine didn't turn his back to the parent whose kid he was torturing, he would still be ruling the galaxy.
