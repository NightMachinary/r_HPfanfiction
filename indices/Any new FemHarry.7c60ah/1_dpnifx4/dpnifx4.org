Linkffn(A Witch and an Amazon Walk into a Bar) by Philosophize. I haven't read more than a few chapters though, as I'm just not into the DC universe in general. Philosophize's other fem!Harry fics I've liked though, so who knows, give it a shot.

And a completely shameless self-plug: linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)
