This always makes me wonder whether there's a fic out there with a fem!Harry named Henrietta. With Harry being the spoken form of Henry, and Harriet being the spoken form of Henrietta, it's actually astounding that I've never seen a character named Henry or Henrietta. And Hadrian isn't even the formal version of Harry! It's related to the Emperor Hadrian, and the name Adrian, of which the feminine form is Adrianne or Adrianna, the most popular choice for Blaise's mother.
