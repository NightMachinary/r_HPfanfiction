  Besides, it's not like Iris is some super fancy, incredibly rare name.

Iris peaked in 1934 as the 30th most popular name for girls born that year. By 1954 it had dropped out of the top 100 most popular names. Unfortunately there is no data for 1980 because at that time they only kept track of the top 100 names, but as of 1996, the earliest data available, Iris had fallen to the joint 1914th most popular name, with just 8 girls named "Iris" in 1996. It shared that distinction with names such as "AUGUSTA", "ENIOLA", "GWENNO" "JADESOLA", "TOLULOPE" and "ZAIRA".

Maybe in the US it's more popular?
