Why Iris? Surely fem!Harry's name should reflect the same naming attitude on Lily and James' part as "Harry", which is a common name, relatively middle class, and with royal associations. "Iris" is none of those. Elizabeth, Victoria, Anne, Alexandra, Isabelle, Catherine, Mary... these would all be more in line with that naming convention.
