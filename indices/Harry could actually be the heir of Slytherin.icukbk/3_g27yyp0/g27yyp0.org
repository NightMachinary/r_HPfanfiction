There is no direct "known" link between Harry and Slytherin.

Harry relation to the Peverell comes from a marriage between the grandaughter of Ignotus Peverell (the 3rd brother) with a Potter, it is also how the Potters inherited the Invisibility Cloak.\\
Voldemort is related to Cadmus Peverell (the 2nd brother) and his relation to Slytherin comes from the marriage between a descendant of Cadmus and a descendant (probably female) of Slytherin. And this marriage happened years (if not centuries) after Ignotus grandaughter had married into the Potters.

Saying that Voldemort and Harry are related is technically true, but everyone in the world in related if you look far enough, it doesn't mean that Harry is his heir or anything (did you know that pretty much everyone in Western Europe is a descendant of Charlemagne?).

"Heir of Slytherin" is only a made up title invented by the Gaunts to flaunt their relation to Slytherin and their parselmouth abilities. The title doesn't hold any legal power, and any wealth the Gaunt could have inherited from the Slytherins had been squandered decades before Tom Riddle came in the picture, with the exception of the Ring and the Locket (there is a reason why Marvolo Gaunt lived in a shack after all).

"Magic" doesn't have anything to do with inheritance, and cannot be used to determine if someone is dead or not. If it was the case, people would probably have noticed that Voldemort is not dead, and definitively noticed that Pettigrew was alive.

Inheritance in the Magical World is handled the same way than in the Muggle one, your goods are divided according to your will, or probably goes to your next of a kin in the absence of a will. If "Magic" handled the inheritance, the Malfoy and the Tonks would have gotten Sirius house, not Harry. While I am at it, "Godfather" is a religious title, and hold next to zero legal power. Sirius being the Godfather of Harry means that his parents wanted for him to take care of Harry after their death, not that he would have automatically got the guard.

"Right of Conquest" is a pure fanon idea, and a stupid one in my opinion. If Destroying a Family automatically gives you their wealth, the Magical World would be way more violent than it currently is. It also doesn't change the fact that Voldemort had no wealth in his own name, and didn't even own a Gringott vault.

While being pretty rare worldwide (around 2% of the population), Green eyes are pretty common in Britain (around 20% I think), that's a lot of Heirs of Slytherin.
