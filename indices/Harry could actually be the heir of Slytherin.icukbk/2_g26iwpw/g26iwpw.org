That could only be a possibility if either the Peverells or the Potters were direct descendants of Slytherin, which would not be the case because I would assume that it would have been brought up if James were a Parslemouth (it is quite clear he isn't, given his hated for Slytherins) and JK confirmed that Harry lost his ability after Voldemort's piece of soul was removed.

So while Harry and Voldemort are on different branches of the same family, Harry is not related by blood to Slytherin.
