Ron reads books voluntarily. Harry even gives him a book on the history of the Cannons for Christmas at one point. But more to the point, I didn't think that Ron or Draco were intentionally comparing him to James Bond, just that Draco was trying to be cool and stylish and failing by a long shot because he's a weedy 11 year old.

It's only a Bond impression from our perspective.
