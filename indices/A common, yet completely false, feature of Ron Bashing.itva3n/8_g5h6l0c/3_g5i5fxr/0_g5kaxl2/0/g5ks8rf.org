I'm going to nudge back on this a little - I never said nobles. What did Ron never say that I did? From what I'm thinking, the Weasleys, at least to a point, sound like they were comfortably Middle class or so... at some point. Sure, the Malfoys have the manor and others do, but I'm more pointing to financial stability and ingroup privilege, not that Slytherin represents and recruits some kind of upper crust. Ambitions may be that they aim for that, but I'm also pointing qt history. Ron knows Wizarding culture and has an in (knowledge) on some spaces that he still can't access.
