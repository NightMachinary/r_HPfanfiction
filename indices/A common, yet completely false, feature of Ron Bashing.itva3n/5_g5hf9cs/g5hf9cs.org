Fics would be boring without antagonists, I find some Slytherin stories boring where Harry sorts out Draco in the first and then doesn't have an antagonist near him. The best thing about Slytherin Harry stories is having Draco as a regular antagonist and Ron as a semi regular antagonist. And then you have Voldemort for the key bit of the story at the end of the year
