So I know lots of us like to bash on the Weasleys, cause there is a lot of wiggle room from the original story that can be interpreted a number of different ways. And if that's your thing, it's fine. It's called an Alternate Universe for a reason. Even Superman has an evil version of himself running around out there.

But I was looking some stuff up when I was writing some as yet unpublished chapters, and I gotta say, it's made me think about things differently regarding the Weasleys of Canon.

The first thing was wizarding transportation. A ride on the knight bus cost 11 sickles for the basic ride. So in 1991 a ride to the train station for Molly, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny would cost 66 sickles. That's 3 galleons and 15 sickles. Then it's either 1 galleon and 5 sickles for a ride back for Molly and Ginny, or she could side along apparate Ginny back with her. And that's only for one trip to the station, not even picking them up on holidays or at the end of school year.

Floo powder was 2 sickles a scoop, according to a google result. That meant that it would be 12 sickles for them to travel one way, 4 sickles for Molly and Ginny to travel back. /(Edit: The scoop is more likely to be a big scoop sold at a store when I think about this later, and one travel probably only uses a pinch so the costs probably aren't exactly the same as what I outlined, but it still would cost money for the poor family. Not to mention how they seem to be quite unorganized and had to go back several times to pickup forgotten things. Their old owl probably couldn't handle the back and forth trips with shrunken packages if they didn't.)/

In the summer before Chambers of Secrets, when they went shopping, the Weasley vault had 1 galleon and a pile of sickles (google says 58ish). So they had about 4 galleons and 7 sickles all told for their shopping before Harry's second year. So with the amount of money they had, magical travel wasn't often a very viable method to transport their family.

Now, I don't know if apparation is supposed to be taxing magically, especially if they had to go long distances or side along someone, but I can see how it would be tiring for a housewife with as many boys as Arthur and Molly had (especially when they are as mischievous and a handful as the twins). Having that many kids to be apparated back and forth for each trip would be extremely tiring, having to apparate back and forth so many times to bring all the kids, one at a time, both ways to shopping or to the train station, which would include their trunks.

With all that said about their finances, the cost of magical travel, as well as the strain on Molly's energy reserves, I could totally see Arthur acquiring and fixing up the Ford Anglia so that Molly could transport all the kids at the same time without tiring her out, and to save money. Grab an old car from the junk yard, apply some repair charms, some ever-full gas charms, some expansion charms to fit the whole family, and presto chango, they have cheap and reliable transport. What's a bit more tinkering to add flight and invisibility for someone who likes muggle things so much?

So up until Ron was a bonehead and got his family a 50 galleon fine and lost his family their primary mode of travel in second year due to his stunt of stealing the car, it wouldn't really be a surprise to see the Weasley family driving the Ford Anglia to Kings Cross station to catch the train.

The ministry had their own space expanded cars, so they weren't necessarily against the practice of enchanting muggle cars that were of use. But Ron and Harry's breaking of the statute of secrecy really ruined it for the Weasley's, since Arthur would have been watched closely afterwards for a repeat performance.

And Molly talking about muggles in a public setting being a violation of the Statue of Secrecy? Uh, that's why they call them “muggles” instead of “non-magicals”. Even when the muggles hear themselves being called muggles, it doesn't hint anything about magic except to magicals. That's what code words are for, duh.

And if someone was going to be fined for talking about a weird platform number in public, then Harry would also get fined for asking the muggle conductor for directions to platform 9 and three quarters. We all saw how the muggle took that, as a joke, not a serious breach of the Statute of Secrecy. Seems like their code words were working.
