Um, /maaaybe/ Mad Fairy? Mischief's Heir begins with full on bashing of Hermione, Ron and Ginny for quite a bit, and while the Ron/Hermione part is eventually explained away (/and/ it goes away and they become friends again). Ginny is bashed throughout, however, and it isn't resolved - she's completely out of character from the moment she's introduced and stays that way. I believe she's /supposed/ to function as comic relief, but it doesn't quite work most of the time.

Most of the bashing is of the 'bad traits turned up to eleven' variety: poor manners for Ron, nose-in-the-air, I'm-always-right and but-the-book-said Hermione and so on.

Without spoiling it, the over the top behaviours are because of one of the story's big bads. (Except Ginny.)

Now. The first instalment of the five part series is a bit rough around the edges, but the end result is fantastic and it's a fic I've reread several times for a reason. It seems like... the author started it off a pure crack, then eventually found a semi-serious plot for it and ran with it, calming down on the crack elements as she went.

Here's part one, if you're interested. *Not* for people who love Ginny. linkao3(4629198)
