It isn't the whole genre of bashfic writers, but I share the opinion that the absolute majority of more is unable to completely comprehend what they are doing.

Bashing is often enough accompanied by the inability of the writer to create meaningful opposition (something integral to a good story), create more dimensional characters (bashing is the anti-thesis to that) and a compelling plot. Bashing most often requires the protagonist to easily humiliate the bashed character so he regularily waltzes over the opponent. This predictability kills all excitement and suspense of the story.
