What I dislike the most is that a ridiculous amount of protagonists that do the bashing are assholes and in some cases also the bullies. That is even more disgusting.

Sadly, I have never seen a fic that starts out with the bashing, but then challenges the protagonists in a real way and calls him out on his behavior.
