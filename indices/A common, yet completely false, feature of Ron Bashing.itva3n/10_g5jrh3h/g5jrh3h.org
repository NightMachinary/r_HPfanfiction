Ron's scoffing at Draco, the “I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.", the way the twins mock Millicent getting Sorted as the first Slytherin of her year, Ron's “I'm not standing together with Slytherins" when the Hat tries to push unity, and the like I don't think it's unreasonable that if Harry is in Slytherin and he's fighting for attention like he has to at home, that those things get expressed as hatred of a Slytherin!Harry, especially since they grew up in stories of the Boy Who Lived, and the evil Slytherin Death Eaters.

I think it can be OOC in fics where Harry is a Gryff unless Draco or Snape is involved
