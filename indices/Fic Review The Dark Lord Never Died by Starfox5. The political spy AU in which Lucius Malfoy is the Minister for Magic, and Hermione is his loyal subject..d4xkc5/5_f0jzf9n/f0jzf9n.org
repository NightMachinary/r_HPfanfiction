That's a great review! Some remarks here:

First, a confession: The pun with Hook was unintentional. I never saw that Peter Pan movie, nor did I know the actor.

Lucius Malfoy might have worked better as the final boss - but that wouldn't have fit the characters as written. Dumbledore wanted to remove Malfoy first - Voldemort was deemed less dangerous, sabotaged as his resurrection was thanks to triple-agent Snape while Malfoy had far more influence and loyal slave-soldiers. And the Wands who discovered the truth about their families wanted Malfoy gone asap so they wouldn't have to fight their family, so to speak. So, as I wrote the story, I couldn't have Lucius go down second, not without some plot railroading or extensive rewriting. And I generally prefer to let characters act as they would even if it wrecks my plots - in one story, I had planned to have the heroes play cat and mouse with Umbridge at Hogwarts. That got derailed in the first meeting.

With regards to the stakes, well... a lot of the Wands die. I hoped people would care about Dean and Colin, who both died in the final battle, as well as other OCs. On the other hand, not everyone cares about side characters. I do like happy endings, though, even if they come with a high body count.

With regards to the Malfoys, I don't consider "I love my family" as a redeeming quality. Almost every Nazi Mass murderer loved their family. That didn't make them "grey" or "redeemed". Draco only showed character growth in canon when things turned so far against the Malfoys that even he got the message. He showed no empathy before, no regret. In this story, things don't really go as bad before his death - on the contrary, for most of the story, he's living the high life. I don't see him changing for the better in that situation. Narcissa might probably be a little too negative - on the other hand, we don't really see much of her in canon, and, once again, we only really see her once her family has fallen from grace. I agree that Lucius and Narcissa could've been a little happier with each other, though. And Lucius... well, in canon, he wants to sacrifice a little pureblood girl for his political schemes, risking a dark artifact trusted to him by Voldemort. And he is perfectly fine with children getting murdered at Hogwarts. It's hard to find a more evil and more stupid action in the first books.

I disagree that JKR wrote morally gray characters - she just ignored what she wrote, especially about the Malfoys. But objectively? Lucius is irredeemable for his actions before his fall from grace. Technically gray, I suppose - like a tiny drop of white paint added to a barrel of black paint tecnically turns it gray even though it's still black for all practical purposes.

Still, I admit I should have made the Malfoy family a little happier - it would have made the contrast between their love for each other, and their utter lack of empathy for everyone else, especially muggleborns, more drastic.

With regards to emotional clashes, that was a choice. I can't really stand idiot balls, and people starting fights with each other for stupid reasons while facing a much bigger threat to everyone is one of the most annoying idiot balls in stories, in my opinion. It usually feels really, really forced and tends to make me drop a story in the "ah, yes, of course everyone has to become stupid and fight each other instead of finishing the enemy off before settling accounts" sense. It barely works with teenagers, but with adults? I prefer a litlte more competent characters.

Or in other words, for me, it's hard to care about characters who act like idiots in that manner. Hermione could have been more emotional about the revelations, I admit - but overall, she's not the type of person to wallow in pointless angst when there're important tasks to do and lives to save.

However, I hoped that the emotional moments - Luna meeting the ghost of her mother, Hermione meeting her grandmother, the dead bodies laid out after the fight etc. - would help with making people care for them.

With regards to the epilogue, I write epilogues to show how the characters live their lives after the story ended. That can be a wrap up at a funeral, a wedding, a glimpse of politics, or - in this case - a criminal case showing that Ron and Hermione are back to working as magical police officers.

With regards to Ron, I do see canon Ron as a badass. He laid down his life in first year on the chessboard, stood on a broken leg and told Sirius to go through him to get to Harry, he was deathly afraid of spiders, yet faced acromantulas with Harry and went down to the chamber of secrets with a broken wand... if that's not a badass, then someone's standards are impossibly high. I also consider his humour, slight inferiority complex and loyalty to friends and family core parts of him, with the inferiority complex not very pronounced here due to different experiences.

With regards to Luna, I see her as affectionate especially since she is much closer to Hermione in the story - she is Hermione's BFF, after all.
