Thank you for your response!

For the most part I was going to leave your points be, as they can easily come down to a difference in stylistic choices and we've each given our two cents on those, so I've tried to confine my comments to just what I think I could have expanded on a little better.

  With regards to the stakes, well... a lot of the Wands die. I hoped people would care about Dean and Colin, who both died in the final battle, as well as other OCs.
#+end_quote

Yes a lot of Wands die, but except for Hermione, and arguably Dean and Colin, the Wands are just [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt][Red Shirts]]. Hermione probably knows their names, but the reader either learns them right before they die, or right afterwards. We the readers do not care, and their deaths have a pretty negligible impact on Hermione, who is the only central character who might be distressed by them.

  With regards to the Malfoys, I don't consider "I love my family" as a redeeming quality.
#+end_quote

It is though. The whole schtick with Voldemort being irredeemable and weak was that he had no concept of love - couldn't feel it at all, and so could feel no remorse for anything. Having a redeeming quality or two doesn't make a character into a good person, and you'll never catch me saying that Lucius was a good guy, but he's not a psychopath. Whilst power and selfishness is a big motivation for him, his love for his family is too. Like you said, everyone believes they're the good guy.

  With regards to emotional clashes, that was a choice. I can't really stand idiot balls, and people starting fights with each other for stupid reasons while facing a much bigger threat
#+end_quote

So this I can certainly understand. I can't tell you the number of stories which have given me rage because of idiot balls being thrown around needlessly. That said, personal clashes are not the same things as idiot balls. There might be a slice of them in the venn diagram of personal conflict, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons for characters to clash. Having conflict may have no impact on the plot but do much to develop your characters (such as Ron and Hermione fighting at the Yule Ball), or it can propel the plot forward (such as Ron and Hermione fighting about 'death' of Scabbers) - it's all in the writing of it. I agree with you that Hermione is not a wallower, but she is a highly reactive and indignant personality.

  With regards to Ron, I do see canon Ron as a badass.
#+end_quote

The last thing I wanted to clarify was that I'm not saying Ron has no badass qualities in canon. Your examples refer mostly to his bravery, which yes, he absolutely has in spades. The upgrade I'm talking about is mostly to do with his combat skill level, which as I noted, is pretty well justified here. Canon Ron was not this disciplined and could not have pulled off espionage like this - his temper was very much toned down. But I'm certainly not trying to bash canon Ron.
