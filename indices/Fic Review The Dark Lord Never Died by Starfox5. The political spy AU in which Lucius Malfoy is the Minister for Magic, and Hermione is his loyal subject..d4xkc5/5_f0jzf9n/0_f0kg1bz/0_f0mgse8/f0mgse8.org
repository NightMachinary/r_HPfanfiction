With regards to the stakes, I'm not fond of the "Oh, let's kill a character to show it's serious" trope. Sirius's death in canon felt like one of the "oh, Harry needs some grief, let's kill off his last family" tropes, forced and cheap. Fred, Tonks and Remus basically felt like "we need a few more deaths to show it was a bloody battle, so let's kill off some characters". Any of those deaths might have worked, imho, if there had been lots of dead Death Eaters as well. Sirius dying in a battle where Lucius and Bellatrix, and some other named Death Eaters died would have avoided the "Oh, now the godfather dies so Harry can grow" feeling, IMHO. Same for Fred and the Lupins - if they had died, and we had seen villains die as well, named ones, their deaths would have had a bigger impact, IMHO, since we wouldn't have seen the wires, so to speak.

We'll have to disagree about familial love being a redeeming quality. Just because Voldemort is an even worse monster who can't even feel love doesn't mean someone who can love is redeemable. You don't need to be a psychopath to be a monster. And that he thinks he is a good guy doesn't really change anything either - many Nazis thought the same. Or, in other words, how people treat their family isn't nearly as important as they treat strangers and those "below them". And we all know how the Malfoys treated Dobby, and everyone else. You could even argue that the Malfoys love for each other makes Lucius' and Draco's crimes worse - unlike Voldemort, they could have known better and done better. Lucius loved his own child, yet had no trouble murdering other children, after all. It only proves his utter lack of any empathy for others.

I consider the "death of scabbers" a stupid scene, actually. Scabbers was a damn rat. You either keep that animal in a cage or you never let it out of your sight if there are dozens of cats around. The whole thing felt forced - and barely aceptable for immature kids to squabble about.

We'll also have to disagree about Ron. I think he is not quite as undisciplined as you see him. But then - consistent characterisation isn't exactly a strength of JKR. Her characters are always subjugated to the needs of the plot.
