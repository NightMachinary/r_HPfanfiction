  Do you remember why you chose to make their relationship the way you did?

Not any more. Might've been that I just thought that twenty years of ruling Britain would cause some stress in any marriage. And that I don't really see Narcissa as an exceptionally smart witch.

  People do this kind of thing in real life though. I can understand why it would feel weird to write it down as a writer because you know it's dumb, but people do dumb things sometimes, no matter how competent they are.

Indeed, they do dumb things. But in stories, it often feels forced and convoluted (and cheap) if the heroes (or the villains) suddenly act like idiots so the other side wins a fight or escapes. Like, say, if Voldemort gets killed by a plane crashing on him. Yes, such things happened. People got killed on the ground by a plane crashing on them. But if that happened in a (non-crack) story, it wouldn't feel satisfying at all. You can use such mistakes, but it needs a very light touch. And turning on each other while fighting the Dark Lord wouldn't have fit that, in my opinion.

With regards to emotions, I don't detach the characters, usually, from the events - but I assume people have at least some degree of control over their emotions. Yes, they might really want to curse someone, but they won't do it if it'd be stupid. it's not the emotions themselves I avoid, it's the loss of self-control, especially in situations where it'd be very, very stupid. Yes, some people will lose control - but some people will also roll over and let themselves get killed by the enemy, or give up even if it means death. And I prefer to write about people who don't do either.

When it comes down to it, I want to write about heroes, people who keep going when most would give up. Not the average people who will end up traumatised and broken by half of what Harry and Co. went through in the early years in canon.

That might not be to everyone's taste, of course.
