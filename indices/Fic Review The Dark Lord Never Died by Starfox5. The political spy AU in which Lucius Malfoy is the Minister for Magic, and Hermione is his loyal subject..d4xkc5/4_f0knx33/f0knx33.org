You clearly deserve an upvote for the effort you've put into this review :).

I would try to think of a story to recommend to you, except that I already heartily approve of reviewing Problem of Potions. Best Snape redemption arc I've seen, not a bad Draco redemption either, and I love the dry humor. The only quibble I can think of is, it checked in at the stations of canon to a degree that I felt was a bit stretched. But the writing quality pulled it off, and it certainly didn't lack for divergence.

  Snide or not, Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal Potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.

  Luckily for Harry's temper, which grew shorter with every chapter he struggled through with no further luck at actually learning something from the book, good potion brewing involved a lot of crushing things, slicing things into small pieces, and making things blow up. The latter Harry hadn't realized you could do on purpose, but Fred clued him in. ("I think otherwise little Harry-kins is going to melt the good cauldron, George, and we can't have that.") Being able to make red and orange fireworks whenever he got too frustrated by alchemical theory went a long way towards reminding him of the long game.
