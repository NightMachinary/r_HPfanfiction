I think you summed up very nicely why I don't like Starfox5's fics. The premises are often really, REALLY good and imaginative, but the execution.... leaves a bit to be desired.

The writing is always technically sound, but it's also oddly bland and emotionless. There's no real personality or individual voices here... remove the dialogue tags and more often than not you wouldn't be able to tell who's talking, because with a couple of notable exceptions, almost all the characters talk in the same, slightly stilted and awkward way.

Really, the only emotions Starfox5's fics ever invoke in me are anger and boredom.

Boredom because in Starfox5's quest to remove the "idiot ball" from his stories, he also ends up removing much of the fun, warmth and humanity since those things often clash with cold, fard facts and logic. Much of the time I don't buy these characters as PEOPLE, because not being allowed to mess up or do anything that's not perfectly logical or goes against the author's personal convictions on what's right or wrong, their personalities blend together (not helped by the fact that, as I said, they all speak in the exact same way). There are many authors who have one or more characters who can act like the "author's mouthpiece." Starfox5 seems to have nothing BUT "author's mouthpieces" at least among the good guys.

Anger because... well, because that seems to be the most prominent emotion overall. There's SO much anger in a Starfox5 fic, much of it rather self-righeous. the fic wants you to just HATE the antagonists and is generous with loaded words and telling you how scummy and shitty they are, and how justified it is to kill and torture them because they are total scum who deserve no mercy or compassion... but unlike many "angry" fics, the anger here isn't hot and passionate; it's ice-cold, calculating, uncompromising and unforgiving. Usually the set-up involves the protagonist (which is almost always Hermione) having suffered unfair treatment at the hands of the antagonists, and coldly plotting/getting revenge against the antagonist... and often also against the society (read: Purebloods) which allowed such unfairness to exist in the first place.

In fact, "cold" is a pretty good description of these fics altogether. They're a study in cold, clinical anger and a sometimes dispassionate, but still always intense, thirst for revenge. I don't think it's a coincidence that every Starfox5 story I've read starts with Hermione either as the victim of unfair or unjust treatment, or Hermione TALKING about how she has been the victim of unfair and unjust treatment, because without the desire for revenge there wouldn't even be a story.

This particular story takes a while to get to that stage because at first Hermione isn't aware of how she's being oppressed and downtrodden, and it spends more time than usual in exploring all the ways the wizarding world under Lucius Malfoy is oppressive, unfair and unjust... but in the end it's ULTIMATELTY pretty much another "Hermione gets revenge against those who treated her badly" story.

Or that's my take on it, anyway.
