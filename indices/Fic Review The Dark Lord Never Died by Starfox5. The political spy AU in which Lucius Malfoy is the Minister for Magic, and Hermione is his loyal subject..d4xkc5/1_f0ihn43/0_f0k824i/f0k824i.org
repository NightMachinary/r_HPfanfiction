Just to clarify; the fact that Harry is far in the background isn't the issue to me. Harry doesn't have to be the MC for me to enjoy a fanfiction. It was more that he was both kept in the background but still often written as someone we were supposed to care about at the forefront of our minds. He was given a crucial, game-changing scene at the crux of the story which was designed to emotionally resonate with us, but we barely know this character, so it could never work here the way it worked in the original series.
