This is what I feel every time I tried read Starfox5's story. The worldbuilding and action scenes are great. The characterizations are supposed to be great. It check all that I know about good characterization, but I can't connect emotionally with the character, even when the stakes are high.

The only time I care about Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][HP & the Lady Thief]] is on the first few chapter when she's about to be expelled from Hogwarts. I can't really bring myself to care about what The Muggleborns [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] were facing except for the beginning of their resistance. The threat of Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed Returned and Really Trying]] seems... non-existent? I have no idea, I feel like Reformed is only about Grindlewald messing around within the Dumbledore-Voldemort conflict.

This the reason why I'm only able to finish two of Starfox5's work, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans Tomb Raider]]. Both are a short story that explored an interesting premise. I don't really have to care about the character in the story, I only want to know what would happen next.

  Starfox fanfics, and I'm sorry to say this, are like the Live Action remake of Lion King. Visually great, entertaining, well-made, the side characters are given deeper backstories and more complex motivations, but I always find myself going back to the original, because it has something that resounds with me emotionally.

To be fair, this could be said for all Harry Potter fanfictions. I haven't found any fanfiction that is a good imitation from the original. I could read a 200k fanfiction, completely loved it, and I would recommend it to everyone I know; but I'm not sure if I would re-read it only for the sake of enjoying the story again. The only fanfictions I've re-read are oneshots or short multichapters that only takes me less than 20 minutes.

I have no idea how I should recommend you a fanfiction to review [[/u/Draquia][u/Draquia]], but could you do one for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]]? I always want to read this, but stopped within the first two chapters. Maybe I'll finally finished it or remove it from my reading list after reading your review.
