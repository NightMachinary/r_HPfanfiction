  Do you think Petunia Evans: Tomb Raider is worth a look in?

Well, bear in mind that it's complete but last I checked its sequel is not. I'm not sure whether that matters for you?

I've started a couple of Starfox works, and respected the writing, without staying the course and finishing them, but I did finish Tomb Raider. It's not top of my list or anything, but it was a bit of fun.
