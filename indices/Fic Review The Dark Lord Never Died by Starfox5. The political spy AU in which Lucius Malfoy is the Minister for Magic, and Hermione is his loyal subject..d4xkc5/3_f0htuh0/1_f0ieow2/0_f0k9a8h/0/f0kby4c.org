  Do you think Petunia Evans: Tomb Raider is worth a look in?
#+end_quote

/Petunia Evans: Tomb Rider/ has an interesting take on Petunia's character. She's still a bitter and jealous character we see in canon, but she tried to direct it to the wizarding world in general; not to Harry. It has a good description on curse breaking and a good action scene. It's a short story and it's mostly a canon Rehash so I could finish it in a short amount of time.

To be honest, I mostly read it because I'm a sucker for Harry-with-alternate-childhood fanfiction.

  but aside from a Drarry I read earlier this year I'm hard pressed to tell you what those were.
