Ah that's fair. If you're invested in Hinny, then any story which breaks them up may not work for you quite as well as it does for me. Harry does love his kids deeply and wouldn't trade them for anything, and he's a great dad figure in Turn, it's just other aspects of his life which make him unhappy. There are definitely characterisation choices in that story I wouldn't have gone with myself, but nonetheless the strength of the writing brought me firmly along for the ride.
