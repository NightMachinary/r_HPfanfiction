Oh, I stopped reading Turn after a few chapters in, maybe I'll start again sometime in the future.

My issue with Turn is how the authors shows how unhappy Harry is in the original timeline. I'm sure that's only because I'm too invested in canon relationship to believe that Harry could be unhappy with his life. Granted, I've only read one chapter on the original timeline, but maybe if she could try to show that even when Harry have a shitty day he wouldn't trade it for anything else, and then proving that this is not true, it could appeal to me more.
