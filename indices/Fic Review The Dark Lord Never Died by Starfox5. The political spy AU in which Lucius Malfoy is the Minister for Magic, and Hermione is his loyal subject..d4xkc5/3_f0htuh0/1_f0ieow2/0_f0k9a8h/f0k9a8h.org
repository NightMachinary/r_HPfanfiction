I have to say, Starfox5 writes great summaries. I'm quite tempted to read a couple of others just because the premises are so interesting. Do you think Petunia Evans: Tomb Raider is worth a look in? It really piqued my curiosity. I have this feeling like the author is really inspired by the life's work of Angelina Jolie. Mr & Mrs Smith, Tomb Raider and Salt all seem to have their themes echoed in Starfox5's fics.

I feel like there are fanfictions out there which can resonate with you as deeply as the novels, but aside from a Drarry I read earlier this year I'm hard pressed to tell you what those were.

As for recommendations, what you've done is perfectly fine. I've had a look at the premise and a quick scan of the opening paragraphs and it looks good to me. I've added it to my reading list for a future review, so thank you! Let me know if you'd like to be notified when the review is posted.
