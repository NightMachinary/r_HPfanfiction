  the fics that I find most memorable and appealing are ones that engage me on an emotional level.

Yes this. For me, a fic which can make me care about the characters and resonate with me on an emotional level will always leave a more lasting impression than one which does not. The scene of Harry on the lake - that absolutely wrenched at me, and that kind of character writing is for sure what made me fall in love with the Harry Potter series.

I've generally been noticing something of a fork in the road of fanfiction types - they are either very focused on plot and magical mechanics, OR they're very focused on character development, but not both. I tend to get hooked reading the character-driven ones more than the plot-driven ones, but given how popular many of the plot-driven stories are, this is a priority for a lot of readers.

Thank you so much for the recommendation, and I really appreciate your thoughts on it as well.
