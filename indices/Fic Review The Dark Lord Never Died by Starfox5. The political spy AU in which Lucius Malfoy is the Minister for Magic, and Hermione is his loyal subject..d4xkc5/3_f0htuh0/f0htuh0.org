I think I was the one who recommended a Starfox fic. Thanks for writing this review!

I don't consider myself much of a Starfox fan (there are dozens of us!), but the your critique pointed out some fair points about their writing - the worldbuilding detail is thought-out, and the narrative + structure is generally competent, with each character's role well-planned, the update schedule regular, and the fics get a conclusive ending with closure, which is a rarity in fanfic where so much content gets abandoned or trickled out over a period of years. People got stuff to do, that's reasonable, but the amount of content and consistency at which is delivered is what makes Starfox admirable within the fandom community.

Some deserved praise goes to this fic for avoiding many fiction-writing pitfalls - plot holes, Idiot Balls (characters only as competent or intelligent as the plot requires), static action sequences that read like a narration of a turn-based video game, and magic being used just for the occasional Cool Set Piece instead of being integrated as an intrinsic part of the setting.

This is where I acknowledge where and how this fic didn't connect with me. You picked out the main ones - the rotating ensemble cast, the two basic flavors of black and white moralities, and the "off model" characterization, which read like a generalized archetype of the canon characters in question, rather than the characters themselves. It was a personal struggle to keep hold of my suspension in order to keep going with the rest of the story. In short, the characters were like the New CokeÂ® of Harry Potter. Recognizable, but clearly upgraded and deliberately different, something I could adjust to given the time... but my tastebuds still clung onto a memory of the Rowling-flavored OG.

On top of that, once you know the structure of a Starfox fic, you know how the Celestial Karma Scale allocates things, thus the ending is telegraphed from the start. And that ending (as usual) left me externally satisfied, but in a sense, emotionally hollow. You're right, it /was/ kinda like watching an action flick playthrough, while the fics that I find most memorable and appealing are ones that engage me on an emotional level. Usually through having a single PoV with a well-developed character voice and an evocative writing style, like how JKR wrote Harry.

  On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him---any moment now--- "Come on!" he muttered, staring about. "Where are you? Dad, come on---"

  But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear---but no one was coming to help this time---

You know that moment after the stampede when Baby Simba is nudging Mufasa's paw in the original Lion King cartoon and asking him to "get up, I'm sorry, let's go home"?

Those are the feels that JKR's storytelling gives me. Starfox fanfics, and I'm sorry to say this, are like the Live Action remake of Lion King. Visually great, entertaining, well-made, the side characters are given deeper backstories and more complex motivations, but I always find myself going back to the original, because it has something that resounds with me emotionally.
