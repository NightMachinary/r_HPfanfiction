Probably the best example of this is the Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider series by Starfox5. The second one has the globetrotting action stuff you want (so many freaking Uncharted vibes), but the first is kinda necessary foundation for the second so I'm linking that one here. I'd still recommend it as a read though, it's pretty dang good.
