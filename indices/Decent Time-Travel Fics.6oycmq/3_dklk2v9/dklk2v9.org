linkffn(Oh God Not Again) is hilarious, linkffn (Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is considered one of the best-wirtten Peggy Sue stories although it's not completed, linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) may not be as good as later White Squirrel stories but it's not half-bad either. You could also consider the very pleasant linkffn(The Evil Overlord List) kind of a time-travel story (the premise is that a random guy from the future is sent back in time inside eleven-years-old Tom Riddle's mind, and begins giving him advice; future information is exploited by him but he didn't come back willingly, nor is he a known HP character).
