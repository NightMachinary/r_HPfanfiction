In addition to the ones that others have mentioned, here are some more recs.

linkffn(Pride of Time; Divide of Time) is SSHG, and follows canon guidelines on what time turners can do.

linkffn(Ananke) is Lily-centric, starting with her traveling forward then backward in time.

linkffn(Blood and Gold by ObsidianPen) is HGTM and the dialogue is absolutely worth reading.
