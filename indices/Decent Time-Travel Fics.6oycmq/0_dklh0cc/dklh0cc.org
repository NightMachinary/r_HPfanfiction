Oh, boy. I've gone through my favorites and sorted out the time travel fics I like.

ffnbot!slim

Edit: okay, I clearly have no idea how to properly slim the bot. Can anyone explain?

More than 1 traveler:

- Backwards With a Purpose (and sequels) is a time travel classic. Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back to fix everything, but find some of their plans interfered with by another traveler from even farther in the future. Complete. linkffn(4101650)

- Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time has Harry and Ginny peggy sue together. Soul-bond fic, complete, has sequel. linkffn(8076284)

- Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon has Harry and Hermione use a brilliant set of Runes to jump back to a previous point on their timeline. Dead, but 428k words and excellent. linkffn(6517567)

- Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches takes a lot of cliche tropes and plays them straight. Time travel, WBWL, Slytherin!Harry, Lordships, harem, and manipulative Dumbledore. Weasleys are sometimes antagonists, but I would say there's no bashing. 364k words, in progress. linkffn(11574569)

- What's a Little Death between Friends has Harry/Tonks traveling back to the first war, where Harry quickly foils a Death Eater attack, with plenty of fallout. Ongoing, but only 2 chapters (60k words). linkffn(12101842)

Ron time travel:

- The Red Knight - no Weasley bashing here, Ron is the hero! Very interesting timeline shenanigans going on, as Ron quickly realizes he's been sent back into somebody else's universe. The fic lost me about three quarters of the way through. 172k words, incomplete, last updated in June. linkffn(12141684)

Harry time travel:

- A Long Journey Home - if you only read one fic off this list, choose this one. Immortal fem!Harry is sent thousands of years into the past. Has multiple, self-contained story arcs - the Forging a Legend sequence would, in itself, be one of the best fanfics I've ever read. In progress, sporadic updates. linkffn(9860311)

- Messing With Time Harry travels back and time and kicks ass not because he's powerful, but because he's a senior Auror who knows how everything works. Pure crack at times, and always good for a laugh. Dead, but you won't regret it. linkffn(10714425)

- Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is dead, but is well-written and nearly 420k words long. H/G. linkffn(2636963)

- Potter vs. Paradox has fem!Harry traveling back in time to prevent the destruction of Magical Britain, but things quickly go off the rails. Hastn't updated since last August. linkffn(11488906)

- Delenda Est puts Harry Back to his parents' 7th year. Pairing is Harry/Bellatrix (much better than it first sounds). Complete, with incomplete sequel. linkffn(5511855)

- Oh God Not Again! Accidental time travel. Humor/crack, complete. linkffn(4536005)

- Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly has Harry traveling back in time, but he accidentally winds up in the head of our favorite grinning buffoon. Humorous, complete. linkffn(11913447)

- Returning to the Start is short, 40k words, but it's a good time travel/romance fic (H/Hr) where fixing everything doesn't result in a happy ending (or at least, not right away). linkffn(10687059)

- I'm Still Here is somewhat dark, and involves Harry traveling back in time and getting picked up by the Flamels, attending Hogwarts under a fake identity. Author is very slow to update, but close to 300k words. linkffn(9704180)

Hermione time travel:

- One Step Forward, Two Decades Back has a bit of Ron bashing in the background, but since Hermione is sent back (alone) to the Marauders' Era it's not a focus of the story. Also has an extremely manipulative and outright evil Dumbledore. Complete. linkffn(11047955)

- Roundabout Destiny puts Hermione back to the Marauders' Era as James's sister. Complete. linkffn(8311387)

- Carpe Diem has a Voldemort with a strange obsession with Hermione. Time travel is involved, obviously. Pairing is Hr/TR, which is a little squicky at times, but it's a good fic. Complete. linkffn(2948785)

Tonks time travel:

- Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass has Tonks traveling back a year at the end of the DoM battle. Ongoing, 100k words. linkffn(12188150)
