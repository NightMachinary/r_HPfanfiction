[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4819482/1/Leap-in-Time][Leap in Time by velvet86]] This is a really well written Draco/Hermione-centric time travel fanfic. It's completed and is 160,000+ words long. It's kinda a fix-it-fic and Draco time travels back in time after Voldemort has won to change the future. It's also a believable Dramione fic. I just binge read it (right before finals week no less) if that's any indication of how engagingly it's written. linkffn(4819482)
