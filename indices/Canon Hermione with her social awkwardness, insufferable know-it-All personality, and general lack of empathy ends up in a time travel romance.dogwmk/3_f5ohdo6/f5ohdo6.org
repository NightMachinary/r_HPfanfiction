This is the main reason why I have to filter out Hermione or Sakura as main characters from searches. There's nothing wrong with the characters themselves (okay, that was a lie, Sakura is mediocre), but the way they're often portrayed is so Mary Sue-ish the authors ought to be punished. It's infuriating to come across fic after fic where the prose and most things are really good, only to have it ruined by Mary Sue. They keep pulling out new magics or jutsus out of their ass and are super geniuses at everything. And you can tell it's a thinly veiled self insert too, the way they keep cooing about Ron and Harry as "her boys" or Naruto and Sasuke as "her pack". Disgusting.
