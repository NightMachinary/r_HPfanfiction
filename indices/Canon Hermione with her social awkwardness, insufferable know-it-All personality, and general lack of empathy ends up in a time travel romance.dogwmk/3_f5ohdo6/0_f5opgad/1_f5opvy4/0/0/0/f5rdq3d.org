The fault lies with Kishimoto and the shounen genre in general. Women can't be more powerful than men, can't be more competent than men, and have to drop everything and become housewives the moment a child is born. It says something that the most powerful female character in Naruto (Shipuuden-era) is a post menopausal spinster who never had children.

Kishi basically didn't care about Sakura's character arc, and largely used her as a plot device to introduce more tension into the narrative whenever it was needed. Generally by making Sakura make extremely bad decisions that painted her as weak, manipulative and useless. All her vaunted intelligence and skills meant nothing in the face of what her character actually did throughout the story. Which was cry a lot, enter fights she couldn't win, and get rescued by one of the boys.

The largely female writer population of the AO3 Naruto fandom write Sakura as either the most badass of the trio, or the emotional centre of the trio, as a reaction to the very real deficiencies in canon. I tolerate BAMF Sakura better than BAMF Hermione because Sakura was never coddled by the canon narrative. She was the Ron of her trio.
