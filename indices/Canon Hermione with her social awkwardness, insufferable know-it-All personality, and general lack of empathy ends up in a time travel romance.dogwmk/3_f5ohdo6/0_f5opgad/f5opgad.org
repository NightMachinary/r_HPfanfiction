That's surprising to hear on Sakura - really, Naruto fics are far more filled with main character OPness when it isn't Sakura in my rather limited experience. Plus, she seems to have a lot of potential to a) make into a better character than whatever mess Naruto canon is, and b) actually not be crazy overpowered so needing to be smart.

I'm sure there's some wish fulfilment fics, but they don't seem to nearly compare in Volume to the Naruto wish fulfilment ones, or Harry in this fandom
