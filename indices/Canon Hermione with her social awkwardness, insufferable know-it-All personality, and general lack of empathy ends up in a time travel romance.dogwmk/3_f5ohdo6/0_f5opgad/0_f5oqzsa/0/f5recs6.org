  She's intelligent, but she's not next Itachi or next Hokage levels of intelligent.

I'd question exactly what standard of intelligence Itachi actually is given than he killed his entire clan at the behest of Danzo. He mindraped his brother twice and expected him to just live a normal life afterward and rebuild their clan. He allegedly became a spy in Akatsuki and yet Konoha and Naruto are continually surprised by Akatsuki's actions and motivations throughout Shipuuden. These are not the actions of an intelligent character.
