There's definitely different types and areas of intelligence. She's intelligent enough to learn and apply doctor level medical science as a teenager. Naruto, although he eventually became Hokage, definitely could never do that. "Kage level intellect" IMHO refers more to politics, strategy and wisdom than science and medicine. Even if she wasn't portrayed so pathetically in canon, I don't see Sakura leading an army. But then I don't see Naruto performing eye surgery.

I totally get you about the the idiot ball being handed to everyone to make the plot more forward, but I'd say that unlike with Dumbledore, we never see Itachi being brilliant at anything except jutsus. Dumbledore is shown to be a powerful wizard and a subtle manipulator. That the plot requires him to hold the idiot ball in the first few books notwithstanding, we have canon evidence of his brilliance. Itachi... Not so much. Definitely one of the most powerful and brilliant shinobi, but strategic brilliance? Political cunning? Wisdom? No. His character arc shows the total opposite of that. He gets played by Danzo, enacts a cunning plan on his brother that while displaying amazing feats of genjutsu breaks him completely, and ultimately fails because Sasuke rejects everything Itachi planned for him.

IMHO the Uchiha massacre doesn't make sense. That nothing could be done until matters reached a boiling point and the options were either personality warping dojutsu or genocide was just stupid. It reflects very badly on both Hiruzen's competence and character. Danzo himself is just a convenient plot device to take all the blame that would otherwise be heaped on Hiruzen. Can't put Naruto's loving grandfather figure in a bad light. At the very least children Sasuke's age and younger should have been spared, if not all the civilians. Fugaku could have simply taken his moderate faction and begged mercy from the Hokage. IMHO the blame falls entirely on Hiruzen and his incompetence/weakness. At the end of the day, the massacre still massively weakened the village, and left them more vulnerable to Obito/Madara/Tobi's machinations.

Also, Jiraiya was the spymaster of Konoha, IIRC. At least, that's the Watsonian reason for him not raising Naruto. If the spymaster who was investigating Akatsuki wasn't given the contact for Konoha's spy inside Akatsuki, then Hiruzen is complete trash. Hundreds of people died for nothing.
