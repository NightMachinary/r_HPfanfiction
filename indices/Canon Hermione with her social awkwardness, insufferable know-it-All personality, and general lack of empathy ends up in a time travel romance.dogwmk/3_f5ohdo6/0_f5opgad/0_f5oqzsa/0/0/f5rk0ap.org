I had a much longer comment that accidentally got deleted, so all I'll say is that everyone was holding the idiot ball throughout the series, so just as we consider Dumbledore to be probably smarter than Hermione in spite of glaring plotholes, so do we consider Itachi to be smarter than Sakura. Also, I'd like to say that the killing of the clan was fairly close to the optimal choice if you analyse the circumstances. I think he should have spared the children, but maybe he wanted Sasuke to be more focused on getting revenge than waste his time taking care of the children. Getting Sasuke to kill him in order to activate the Mangekyō and then get the eternal Mangekyō is a pretty good idea, though no need to mindrape Sasuke, that's pretty dumb. Not quite sure Kishimoto came up with all this when he decided to have Itachi do all of that, but the Watsonian explanation at least partially checks out. He became a spy, but I think his only point of contact was Danzō, who was a dick and definitely would not tell Tsunade. I don't think he kept in contact with the Third, but even if he did he probably wouldn't keep in contact with Tsunade because she'd probably ruin his whole suicide plan or something.
