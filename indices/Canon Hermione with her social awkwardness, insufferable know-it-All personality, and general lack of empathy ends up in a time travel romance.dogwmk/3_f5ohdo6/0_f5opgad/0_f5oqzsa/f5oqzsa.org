If you look on FFN, it's definitely more OP Naruto, but I've found AO3 to be infuriatingly Sakura galore. If you cut out all the Sasuke/Naruto slash there's a lot of Sakura around. Basically anything that's tagged as BAMF Sakura is suspect, same with BAMF Hermione. OP Sakura is way less believable because in a story where the final battles are like gods duking it out, she's far lesser. Her Chakra pool is tiny, her motivation weak, and her foundation inferior. Yet these stories like to make it so that the moment she puts in effort she's baby Itachi and better. She's intelligent, but she's not next Itachi or next Hokage levels of intelligent. The thing is, she's intelligent enough to definitely be a major player, but not in the way that fanfic authors like to make her out to be. She couldn't be frontline, but what canon has her do is fairly close to optimal. The top fic on AO3 for Sakura is Pulling My Weight or something, and it's been a while since I read it, but at one point, Sasuke tries to fight her and Orochimaru stops him and says she could destroy his mind with one finger. That's canonically out of her skillset and Naruto isn't a world where with enough intelligence you could reasonably segue into any skillset. My biggest problem with Sakura or Hermione fics is that since they're not the main characters, when people write them, they want to make them important. Put a piece of themselves into them, spruce them up a bit. So while there's mountains more Harry or Naruto wish-fulfillment trash out there, Sakura and Hermione fics just tend towards being wish fulfillment, so when you want to read a good fic about them it's hard.
