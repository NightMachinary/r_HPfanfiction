Ugh, I've seen fics where Hermione acts like an insufferable know-it-all, extra-pedantic and smug about her own intelligence... and then all the boys fall for her anyway. When she asks her boytoy why such a sexy Slytherin Sex God would fall for a Bushy-Haired Bookworm like her, they laugh and tell her she's beautiful and lovely just the way she is, bookworminess or not.

Then I realized that these fics don't care about realism, just feelgood fantasy. And Hermione's unconventional looks or pedanticness aren't used as character flaws, and have no effect on the story's plot or how the other characters interact with her. They're merely a way to give her some traits that are "relatable" so Hermione feels like she's "one of us".
