You could make the same case of Ultrafemme!Hermione who discovers that her magic comes from a squib lineage ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html][JKR confirmed that muggleborn magic is inherited by distant magical ancestry]]), and then she's given a formal introduction to the top ranks of wizarding society and becomes the girl version of Lord Hadrian Peverell.

Canon can be massaged the same way to get that result, just as you can for Badass!Hermione. Her Yule Ball appearance caught Draco's attention.

  But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy, but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow---or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back.

  Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one, either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her.
