Can we just have a fic that subverts the hell out of this? "Super badass" time-traveling +Emma Watson+ Hermione hits on Tom Riddle, and then is promptly murdered by him. It's dark, but it'd be so cathartic.

Potter ever after does well with making fun of romance, but really only barely touches on the issues.
