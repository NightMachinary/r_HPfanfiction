To add onto this: If those character traits /don't/ count as flaws... then that version of Hermione has no flaws at all.

And if that's the case, what does that do to her character?

If Hermione's flaws, her traits of bossiness and self-righteousness, are portrayed in the story and treated by other characters as her being "motivated" and the "moral center", she basically becomes Emma Watson Movie Hermione. A bland, blank-slate character who remains static throughout the whole of the story. She's always strong, good, and competent, at the expense of having growth (and being the narrative equivalent of plain oatmeal), compared to Ron's arc of jealousy, doubt, and frustration, leading to his abandonment of the team, and his return to earn forgiveness when he realizes what he's done.

This kind of reminds me of an interview by Daisy Ridley, an actress in Star Wars, [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/03/10/star-wars-star-daisy-ridley-says-that-rey-has-no-weaknesses/#536a04f04418][who shares the same perspective of "flaws are subjective".]]

  *"I don't really believe in weaknesses in people,"* Ridley said. "Because I think you can't decide what's good and what's bad in a person because everything makes the whole and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, as we know. I for sure think people can work on themselves, with things like anger and jealousy, maybe things like that, but that's workable, that's not something that's fixed that can't be changed."

...How do you identify what you need to do to improve yourself and learn to be a better person, if you don't believe in weakness?
