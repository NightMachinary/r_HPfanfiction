You can improve yourself without being a terrible person before. And what you're saying implies that either you are already perfect (unlikely) or you know that you could be better than you are and decide not to. Sure you can do that if you want to, but honestly that seems like a rather dull life to me.

And regardless of what you think is the right choice in real life, characters like that in fiction tend to be just not very interesting, at least as the main character. Either they are depicted as perfect from day one, which is supremely boring, or they don't learn from their mistakes, which makes the audience dislike them.
