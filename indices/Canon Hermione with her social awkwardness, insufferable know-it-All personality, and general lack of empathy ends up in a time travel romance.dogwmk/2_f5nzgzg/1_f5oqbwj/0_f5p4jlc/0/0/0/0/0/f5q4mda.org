You are of course allowed to like any story you want, including ridiculous wish fulfilment fics. And so is everyone else. And since there are people who write that drivel they at least probably like them too, so you're not even alone.

But that doesn't make it an interesting story to the average reader or a majority of readers or anything.

And this might be mean or intolerant or whatever but if you find stories that feature a perfect protagonist who never has to overcome any real obstacles /interesting/ then I just can't take your opinion on that matter seriously.
