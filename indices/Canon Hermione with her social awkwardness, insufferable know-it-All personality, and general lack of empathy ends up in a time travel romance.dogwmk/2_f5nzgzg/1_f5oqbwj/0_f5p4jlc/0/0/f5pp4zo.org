You don't need to improve yourself and learn to be a better person, as you put it. What a silly concept. That's not a requirement for anyone. The implication being you're a terrible person to begin with.

This is what happens when you don't think for yourself, you repeat the common wisdom and it's non-sense.

As for all that other critical theory you espoused above, I'm not even touching that. What a ridiculous way of looking at things.
