The closest people get to reading facial expressions is eye rolls, looking upward to not call someone an asshole/idiot, loudly sighing, or chuckling when their eyes are closed.

I know I close my eyes whenever I'm about to laugh at something innapropiate. I know I shouldn't be laughing but it just makes me laugh harder so I close my eyes lol.
