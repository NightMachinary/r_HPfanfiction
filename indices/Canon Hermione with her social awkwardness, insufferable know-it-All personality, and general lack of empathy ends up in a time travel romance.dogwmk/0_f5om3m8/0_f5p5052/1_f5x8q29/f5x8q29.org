Cant say I understand how this works in fiction but in real life sometimes tiny subtle changes are seen in people and often can serve as predictors of behavior. As a nurse I rely on these sudden subtle changes to serve as predictors as to whether or not my patient will remain stable or maybe crash. Example had a coworker who worked at our clinic and I noticed a very subtle change in her behavior something in her eyes or how she processed information that seemed suddenly off. (It was something I had seen before in a patient I had) Nobody else noticed said they saw nothing different in her behavior at all. However; I could not shake the feeling off so I insisted on driving her home. Mid way during the drive home she had a seizure and almost fell out car door I had to pull car over in heavy traffic while holding her with one hand and driving the car with the other hand to keep her from falling out the car door. (Called EMS got her to hospital and gave thanks that notice that subtle glint in her eye that seemed off) Noticing these very small facial expressions or ways people change pace of there speech all are early indicators of certain behaviors that you can predict in some cases. Sometimes even serve to anticipate if someone is targeting you or noticing if someone likes you or dislikes you. Often time this is written on person face. It can even help you predict what someone wants before they ask for it. This is actually a skill that can come in very handy as a parent. The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California at Berkeley has devised [[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/ei_quiz/][a tricky body language quiz]] to test if you can correctly guess what emotions people are expressing. Mind readers often are people with highly-developed /nonverbal/ decoding /skills./ Guess /poker/ players use that skill to predict if you got good hand or are you bluffing. So maybe there is something to that glint or twitch in your eye or mouth lol
