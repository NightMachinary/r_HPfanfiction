A glint is a reflection of light, and if your cornea is wetter than usual that would lead to a different refractive behaviour. That can happen as a natural response to certain stimuli like bright light, or when crying. So if anything, a glint in the eye might be indicative of crying. But your eyes can glint while they are "dry" too if the light falls on them in the right angle, so it's pretty much random.
