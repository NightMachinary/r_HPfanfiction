  And most importantly, where does the glint come from? Does every character in every fanfic have magical glinting eyes?

On the topic of light in characters' eyes, I've seen several fanfics in which Dumbledore's perpetually twinkling eyes is either because of a spell he uses to look more special/trustworthy or because it's a sign of his extreme power level (similar to Harry's freakishly green glowing eyes in many OP!Harry fics).
