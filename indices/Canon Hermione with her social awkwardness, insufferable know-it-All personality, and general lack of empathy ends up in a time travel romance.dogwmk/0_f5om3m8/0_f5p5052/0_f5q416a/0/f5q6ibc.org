Yeah I've read that too and personally I think he just uses a spell like that because he likes when his eyes twinkle because that's something he would do

But I can't imagine everyone in the wizarding world using spells like that, especially when it appears that this glint is the only thing that betrays their emotions.

Actually, I can see it if wizards and witches all were unable to read or express emotions and so they all spell themselves to show their emotions via glints in their eyes for better communication. Perhaps it's even a ritual that does it for the entire population. And the Slytherins all work to destroy the ritual or remove its effect from themselves so they can scheme without their eyes are glinting suspiciously. It's actually the reason why Voldemort hates the Muggleborn, because they don't have the telltale glint.

This actually sounds like something JKR would tweet.
