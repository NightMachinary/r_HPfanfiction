"intuitive to the slightest facial expressions"

Honestly, you've just described... All of fanon. It's one of my biggest pet peeves, and so widespread that it's hard to read a story without it. I swear every single authors favorite way of displaying emotion is a twitch of the mouth, which is miraculously interpreted by our hero to mean the exact right thing. I don't think I've ever actually seen someone's mouth twitch in real life because most people just laugh or smile like normal human beings.

Anyway, rant aside, I'm gonna go check out my library and see if it has any stories that fit the bill.

linkffn(One Hundred Sixty nine)

This is the only fic I have featuring a time travelling Hermione-centric romance, though I wouldn't say that it necessarily focuses on her awkwardness.

linkffn(Backward with purpose part I: Always and Always)

This one veeeerrry loosely can be considered relevant, but it and its sequels are so good that I'm going to link it anyway. Hermione herself is not a time Traveller, but she falls in love with one, and, from what I remember, is quite awkward (this is somewhat of a Canon rehash up to like 5th year, so beware).
