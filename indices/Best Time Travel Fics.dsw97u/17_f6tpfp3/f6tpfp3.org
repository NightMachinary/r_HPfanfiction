Hmph. I found that, while I have several time-travel stories marked, very few involved an adult Harry going back to either his own time or the Marauders era, as you asked for. I did have a few, though.

*Silly ones:*\\
Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281: linkffn(4536005)\\
Reunion by Rorschach's Blot: linkffn(4655545)\\
/"I'm gonna be really annoyed if I find out Neville's parents defied Snape three times," Harry replied, "really really annoyed."/

*Serious ones* (both Snarry, so skip if that's not your cup of tea):\\
Escaping the Paradox by Meri (aka Meri Oddities): linkao3(2060)\\
Tapestry of Fate by Minxie: linkao3(10140137)

/Edited to add: Well, that last one doesn't work with the bot. I noticed there's a little lock symbol on AO3 that might be the reason. You can still find it there, though./
