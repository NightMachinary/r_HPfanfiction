Mobile on ao3 doesn't mark progress on a story, doesn't show me which stories i'm following in order of updates, and doesn't have any helpful notifications when a story is updated, besides the email telling me there's a new chapter.

I haven't found an app that changes this either. At least if I have to use the fanfiction website i can go to my followed stories and sort by update time.
