Delenda Est is one of my favorites, and its linked in one of the other comments. I'd add:

linkffn(11053807) - Dumbledore has Hermione extensively train for the war using a Time Turner - the time turner is used multiple times. Pairing HGSS

linkffn(10772496) - A massive story with multiple arcs. The time loop is set up really well and connects the past with the future smoothly. It's a slice of life type of fic. Pairing HG/SB, HG/RL

linkao3(12801672) - Hermione is an Unspeakable who is still fighting dark lords after Voldemort with her friends. She ends up deaged into a fifth year in the 1940s in a time where Grindelwald is a huge threat. This goes very in depth into magical theory and how the changes Hermione makes will affect the future. This is also a slice of life with numerous characters involved. Pairing: Hermione/Tom

linkffn(13001792) Thirteen year old Bellatrix Black travels forward in time to 1993. She's very OP and crazy. Bellatrix is from an alternate universe and has a patron Goddess who she embodies. Lots of stuff about dark magic

linkffn(12132374) - Right after the battle in DH, something happens and Hermione is sent back in time and put into the body of someone who was previously dead in the original timeline- Cathal Rosier. The original Hermione also exists in this story. This is very character driven, and the "mystery" is what went wrong at the Final Battle for Hermione to end up this was. There's a lot of focus on pureblood society

linkffn(10610076) - really good MoD Harry
