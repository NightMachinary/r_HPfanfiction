Here are a few I like:

Tempted: Sort of a cheat, because Bella isn't a mom per se. Instead, she secretly corresponds with Tonks as a child and drives a wedge between Tonks and Andromeda, leading to Tonks moving in with Bella when she's a teenager. Initially the only reason Bella does this is because Tonks is a metamorphmagus and Bella wants to create her into a perfect tool for the Dark Lord. But over time, Bella grows to love her as if she were her own daughter---a dark Tonks story.

The Veiled Truth: AU in which Bella and Snape are together and have an infant son. Through a series of events, they are led to believe their son has died when in fact the boy was secretly given to the Potters instead. Bella goes psychopath crazy, Snape goes insanely bitter, and then the (200K+ story) goes from there. The story is a bit trope-y and melodramatic but it's an easy and compelling read if you like the characters and the setup.

I have a bunch more I'll post a bit later---my break is up now though but I figured I'd get you started.
