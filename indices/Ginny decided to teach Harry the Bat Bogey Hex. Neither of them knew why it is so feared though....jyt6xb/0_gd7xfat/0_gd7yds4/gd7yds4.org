I agree that consistency would be key. Sometimes overpowering a character is not so bad, as long as you maintain reason and logic. I was considering this idea for a crack/humour fic rather than a serious story. I cant think of any good magic system fics off the top of my head. Most runic fics are generally quite good. Runic Animagi perhaps? Or Steel Wings? Both are fairly good fics but as I remember they explore the magic system less and the nuanced/mysterious magical abilities more so.
