Remus' Wadiwasi in book3 is a good candidate. You can even science it up by saying it's a propulsion spell with an antifriction component. The second part could remove air resistance and whatnot and make the spell more... bullet-like.

The batbogey hex uses the target's on bogeys as the target of the transformation. Bogeys are really just mucus. There's so much mucus in the human body. Your sinuses produce it. Your digestive tract uses it as a lining. It's frankly a lot.

Imagine if the Slugs hex uses the mucus in the stomach as the target. And then you overpower it and it consumes even the stomach lining. Yeah, your victim is going to wish they were dead. Stomach Acid without the lining /burns/.
