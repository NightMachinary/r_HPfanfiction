Ah, I see an opportunity to talk about [[https://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]].

The aforementioned bat-bogey hex ends up increasing the size of the bats to the point that the victim's noses explode.

Bluebell flames, the spell that makes fire that doesn't burn things? Yeah, tell that to the hundreds of acromantula corpses.

The magic system in this fic is defined as spells having three categories.

1. Takes a fixed amount of power to cause a fixed effect. Such as Lumos or Petrificus Totalus
2. Takes a variable amount of power to cause a fixed effect, depending on the circumstances. Using Wingardiam Leviosa on a boulder vs a feather, one needs more power than the other, but the same effect happens.
3. Takes a variable amount of power to cause a variable effect. The variable effect is normally how strong the spell is. Examples include Expelliarmus (see Snape vs Lockhart,) and Expecto Patronum.
