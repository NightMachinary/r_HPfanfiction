Not many people know that but the bat-bogey hex uses the snot within your nasal cavities to form its bats. Which can get very tedious for the victim if they have a cold or other affliction causing a constantly dripping nose. But the real horror starts when the victim runs out of bogeys and snot before the spell has run its course. Few are willing to describe the experience afterwards but observers agree that agonised screams are usually involved.
