I tend to like â€˜H' names, and if it's a girl I think James would want a flower name like Lily's and assume Lily would also like that, so I like Holly, Heather, Hebe, Hellebore (maybe just Helle?), Hyacinth (might be a bit much. I feel like Petunia might use it lmao), hepatica...

anyway I generally go with Holly lmao
