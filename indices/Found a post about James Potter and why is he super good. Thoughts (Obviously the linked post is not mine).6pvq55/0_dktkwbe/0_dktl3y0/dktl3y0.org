  Snape was a dick. A horrible person, who apparently, in the end, did the right thing. He is still a horrible person. So is James.He started to bully Snape, just because Snape disliked the idea of going to Grifindor. We have seen how terrible James's bullying was. There are even theories that that is the reason Snape went dark. Plus you know, Sirius thought it would be funny if they tried to kill Snape using a werewolf. No wonder he turned out like that. I am not excusing Snape's behavior, I am merely stating, that neither Snape, nor James, nor Sirius was in fact, the Holy good guys. Their actions are inexcusable.

I think this comment (which is mine) perfectly summarizses James/Sirius/Snape goodness/character.
