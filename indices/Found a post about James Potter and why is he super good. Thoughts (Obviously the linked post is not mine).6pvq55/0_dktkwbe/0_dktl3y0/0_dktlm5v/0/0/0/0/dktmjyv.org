So essentially a glorified and partially ridiculous description of "nature versus nurture", then.

I personally disagree to a degree. Some people are born with inherent deficiencies in their brain that may cause a higher risk of conditions such as bi-polar and psychopathy. Other (individual) effects of these harmful mutations can include a lack of empathy, lack of remorse, cruelty towards other people, hurting or killing animals, an inflated sense of self worth to cover for their hidden deficiencies), a fake "persona" put up around other individuals, being manipulative, prone to pathological lying, mental and emotional shallowness, lack of ability to hold attention or interests(ex - jumpy, can not be in a marriage for long), and too many behavior problems to further list.

In essence, that theory is likely bullshit, given that the already damaged brain of a future psychopath is impossible to repair right now.

However, I do believe that theory is correct when referencing neuro-typical people. A damaged brain limits influence that does not fall within the damaged range of emotions from the person with that damaged brain.
