I can definitely agree with that.

I can't remember where I read it, but a possible explanation for extreme bullying by children is because children are by nature possibly sociopathic, but given that an accurate medical diagnosis can't be made until the individual is eighteen years old, experts aren't exactly sure about it. They do not understand the consequences of what they are doing, and thus are not accountable for their actions, given the fact little proper thought was put into the action - the action merely being the product of the child's anger or lack of regard for their victim(s).

Don't quote me or hold me to that, though. I could be remembering it incorrectly.
