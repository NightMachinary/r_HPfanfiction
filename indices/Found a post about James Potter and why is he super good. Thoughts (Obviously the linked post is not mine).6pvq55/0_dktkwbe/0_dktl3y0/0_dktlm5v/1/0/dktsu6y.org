My statement had no religious influence at all, I've been an atheist since I could consciously make the choice. I haven't read anything of Freud's other than that on psychoanalysis, which has no bearing at the moment.

What I've heard, read, and believe is, for the most part, similar to what you said. I stated that many kids are possibly sociopathic because, when they are angry with each other, they haven't learned that there is in fact, a line that can be crossed when it comes to getting back at their "attacker". The thought of their thoughts and feelings can be forgotten in a lust to get back at him/her. Hence why kids can be cruel bullies or do extremely embarrassing thing in that pursuit of revenge. When I was younger, I was bullied rather severely. The people bullying me /did not/ care about my feelings. Whether it is because they didn't know better, or are truly sociopathic, can't be said, because they are children. Children are unpredictable, irrational, and are still on the road to growing up. You just can't diagnose a kid with something purely off a behavior, hence why I preceded my earlier statement with /possibly/. It's not certain.

  Adolescents are also prone to what is called egotistical thinking (EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME).

Oh shit. Don't get me started on that one. The joys of adolescence.
