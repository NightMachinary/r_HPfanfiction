I wouldn't say that kids are sociopathic by nature. I've never heard that theory, although it does sound a little bit of a mix between religion (children are immoral until they are "saved") and something Freud would have concocted. The leading theory that is driving practice right now is eclectic (take the best from all the theories) as well as the biological-sociological theories (brain chemistry and environment, aka "nature vs nurture"). Hell, I would throw in peer pressure for bullying specifically. Kids can be vicious to each other.

You learn about the older theories in intro classes and such, but that was the last time they were discussed. Here are some other interesting tidbits about adolescence:

The prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain that makes decisions and such) is not fully develop until you're 25ish or so. The biggest impact that we see is on decision and planning. So while a kiddo might be super smart, they might not have the foresight to plan for events long down the road. Throw in the chemical cocktail that is puberty, and...well, you know. I had a professor in college that liked to say the prefrontal cortex is just turned off, ages 11-16. Adolescents are also prone to what is called egotistical thinking (EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME).

We don't really know why some people can go through shitty circumstances and come out fine while others completely bomb. It's called resiliency - if you wanted to look up some studies. You're right though. We don't give extreme diagnoses to kids younger than 18 because there are such extreme implications on something that is so imprecise.
