James wasn't shown to be bullied like Snape was though, so it's more understandable why Snape was so hung on the past. James changed, but he had no excuse for being horrible in the past either. The damage he did to Snape remains, just as the damage Snape did to the Potters and the students of Hogwarts remains.
