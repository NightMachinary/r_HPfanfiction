  We have seen how terrible James's bullying was

So apparently Snape is redeemed for his sacrifice but James who also sacrificed himself in a more meaningful way, who had not cast a single Jinx towards anybody other than Death Eaters since his Seventh Year of Hogwarts, who did not attempt to make Neville's toad die, who did not instill such fear into the poor boy that Neville feared him worse than death itself. Yeah, what an asshole right? This post is spot on about taking a single anecdote, despite Remus himself saying that Snape fought back plenty of times, and using it as a basis for someone's whole personality.
