I dont really get what your point is?

My view is that James was an arse and a bully when he was a teenager. He changed and stopped and grew as a person. Snape was abused as a child and bullied as a teenager. Snape then went on to be a Nazi, had a change of heart becuase the girl he was infatuated with could potentially die and the turn spy, at great personal risk. James dies protecting his family, Snape gets away scot free from being a millitant racist, and then becomes a teacher at the biggest school in the country. Snape then goes on to (as a 30 something year old) bully two 11 year olds where one is an orphan and the other is practically one as well. He then continues to bully/belittle them for 6 years, helps in the quest to defeat Voldermort and all is forgiven. Whichever way you look at it James IS a bully, but so is Snape the only differnece is that James bullies his peers and Snape bullies children.
