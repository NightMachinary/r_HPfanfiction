Meh. Rowling is not consistent. She needed a red hearing in book 1, hence Snape. She wanted to humanize Snape, hence James is a bully.

You can see it in a lot of things. Unless everybody suddenly became retarded over a generation, you had the marauders and Snape do some really cool shit that our protagonists don't really come close to, except for Hermione in some instances, and Harry with his Patronus. Inconsistent and incomplete info leaves a lot of room for pointless debate.

How people see James and Snape (and Lily, for that matter) is usually more a reflection of themselves than anything Rowling put down on paper.
