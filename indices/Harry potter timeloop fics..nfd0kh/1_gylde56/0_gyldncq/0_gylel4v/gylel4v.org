It's an old one, and I think it was unfinished, but it's the first one that comes to mind when someone mentions time loop and Harry Potter to me. My second choice was already named above (Temporal Beacon), it's just that Ron's loops in Groundhog Day are much shorter since she's reliving one day instead of resetting back to the same starting point at various intervals like in the Beacon.
