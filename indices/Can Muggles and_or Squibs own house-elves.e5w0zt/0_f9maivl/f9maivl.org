In the books, Ron specifically says that house elves come with large old houses and big properties. Hogwarts house elves also seem to serve Hogwarts more than any person.

I think you can argue that a muggle can have a house elf if they move into an old magical house or property, although they probably wouldn't be aware that there was a house elf there.
