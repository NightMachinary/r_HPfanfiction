If you go by what little we know from canon, than the squibs or muggles simply have to be aware of magic, connected to the magical world in some way, and have enough money or connections to get a house elf.

However I know many fics also imply that the person or entity that the house elf is bound too, must also have enough magic to sustain the elf or elves. If that is the case than the elf would not be able to bond. And my personal opinion is that, going by how the elves at Hogwarts function, yes there needs to be some element of passive magic involved with regards to the entity or person the elf is bound to.

So my opinion is that no an elf cant be bound to a muggle or squib due to lack of magic in the bond.
