In my headcanon, Elf-bonding was mostly focused on the Elf itself contractually. I have similar views on Time Turners.

As in, you don't need inherent magic to be able to interact with them to the extent where you need magic yourself. Obviously, Muggles are going to have a hard time getting an elf, but if they do somehow get it (inherited from a magical person who ended up dying or similar) and is aware of the Magical World, they're able to serve as Master/Mistress to them just like any other regular magical person would be.
