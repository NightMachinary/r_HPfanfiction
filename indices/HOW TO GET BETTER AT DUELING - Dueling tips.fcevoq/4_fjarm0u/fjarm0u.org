Dueling or fighting? If you're fighting then you need to be aware of your surroundings more so than in dueling, in a fight some other dude could just send a spell at your back

In dueling you could need the ability to sense magic, if you're blinded for example you can sense and dodge a spell that's incoming without seeing it

You could learn to cast invisible spells (if that's possible in your magic system ofc)

Point casting aka not needing to move your wand, point casting and silent casting together are deadly, if you can get invisible spells into that mix it's almost impossible to not hit unless you can't aim or the enemy can sense magic.

I did this by thinking of the wand movements and the incantation in my mind, to make the spells invisible I just will it to be invisible. Harry for example has it easy as he knows what invisible looks like (invis cloak)

God this is weird talking like I'm doing it

That's what I could come up with quickly
