Controlling the environment is, in my not so humble opinion, the number one advantage a wizard can have in a fight.

Dumbledore completely encases Voldemort in a sphere of water. A lesser wizard is just done at that point. Anyone that's ever been hit by a wave knows just how helpess you really are against a large amount of water.

He does this while simultaneously guarding Harry with animated statues.

Control the environment and you control the fight.
