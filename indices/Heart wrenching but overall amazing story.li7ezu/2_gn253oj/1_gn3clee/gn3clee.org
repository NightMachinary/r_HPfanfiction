No but I really liked the way they portrayed him an old man who made mistakes and was alone for a long time having troubles giving leadership reins over. He tried his hardest and tried to work hard to repent for his mistakes. I really loved how they handled his character. Snapes character as well only really had the usually Sirius hates him type bashing.
