This is a little bit of a different one, but I cringe when characters use each others names too much in dialogue. Like

"Good morning , Harry."

"Good morning, Ginny."

"Are you going to work, Harry?"

"Yes, Gin."

Like no. Stop. Nobody talks like that. In real life we only use each others names for emphasis, not at the beginning/end of every goddamn sentence.

Also, while we're at it:

"I love you, Harry James Potter."

"I love you too, Ginevra Molly Weasley."

STOP IT WITH THE FULL NAMES. Okay, done.
