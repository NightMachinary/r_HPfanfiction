For me Its very hard to read a fic when the dialogue is very stilted and formal, with minimal (if any) contractions and people (especially kids) are speaking like that. Its very jarring and awkward for me.

Like age 11 harry saying something like "Whilst I agree with you Ronald, I can not and I will not agree to such a proposal as it shows cowardice and is lll befitting a wizard such as I."

I'd prefer something like "Are you barking mad Ron? Yeah, its a good idea but it sounds cowardly to me."
