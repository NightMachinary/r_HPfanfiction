The moment Harry starts calling out Dumbledore in the great hall, I cringe. The moment adults agree with that obnoxious little shit of a character, I make a hasty exit.

Oddly enough my tolerance for "Know-It-All-Smart-Ass-Harry" seems to decrease as I get older. Back when I was 22 (when I first started reading fanfiction) I used to cheer on seventeen year old Harry telling Dumbledore to go fuck himself but now I just want to hit him over the head, tell him to shut up and sit down. I guess this is what being an adult feels like.
