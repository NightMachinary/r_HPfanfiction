I read a story recently and was finished after a paragraph. Every other sentence went something like "This, my dear readers, is the story of Hermione. You may think you've heard it, my darlings, but I guarantee you haven't. Listen closely, my sweethearts." etc. Hands down the most annoying thing I have ever seen and not one comment complaining about it.
