What really chaps my hide is when I take the time to read a story with pretty decent characterization and a pretty good plot, and then the couple finally gets together.

Yes! Hooray! At last!

And then the plot takes a complete back seat to endless sex scene after endless sex scene.

I think this bothers me more than most things because at this point I've already invested quite a lot of time into reading, but once it's just sex sex sex, I can't deal with it.
