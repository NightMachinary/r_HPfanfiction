Cringe is something I came to expect in fanfiction by now. Here are some of my favorites:

- Katanas.

Ah, the true weapon of the weaboo. Slices and dices the enemy like nothing else... except any other slightly curved blade. But sabers and kriegsmesser aren't wielded by the most fierce warriors that have ever slain countless farmers - the samurai. If you write this in your fanfic, I assume you also run like [[http://orig15.deviantart.net/fbcf/f/2007/287/a/e/sasuke_and_naruto___ninja_run_by_beethy.jpg][this]].

- Teen Witch Weekly intermission

"Here we see Harry Potter, wearing a emerald green robe with silver thread, accenting his eyecolor. His robe comes with a set of Hebridian Black skin boots and gauntlets. To his side is Daphne Greengrass, fitting in a light, silver summer dress......"

I hate shopping trips in my fic.

- The Underage Sex

I am undecided whats worse, the scene that sound like the author has never even seen anyone else's genitalia, or the one that obviously has had sex and is now imagining two underage teens doing it.

- Pagan rituals as imagined by the catholic church

As I grew up in a "pagan" family this isn't just cringey but also kind of insulting. We do not require our spouse to drink the semen of every male in the family to ensure fertility, thank you very much. We also don't slaughter little children - not even if they're annyoing little shits.

Seriously, this makes me pretty angry. If you have to include norse, ancient greek, celtic,... pantheons and rituals, at least do your research.

- Edgelord McShadowkiller

Basically, everything that sounds as if Reaper from Overwatch writes fanfiction.

- Any sort of romance kickstart

Soulbond, marriage contracts and whatnot. If you can't write a decent buildup to a romance, don't brute force it with a cop out.

  "Their magic links them together, literally enslaving their libido to function for only one person."

#+begin_quote
  "Why do they love each other?"

  "The sheer political clout and mountains of galleons coming with marrying each other by contract, brainfucked them into thinking they love each other... also love potion and built-in love compulsions, because finding feelings through drugging and altering your brain is romantic."
