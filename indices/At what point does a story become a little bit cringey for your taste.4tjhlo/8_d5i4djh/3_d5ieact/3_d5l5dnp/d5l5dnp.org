While I think that the whole age of consent thing is stupid as far as that particular issue goes, most 14-year-olds aren't even remotely prepared for the possible consequences of engaging in said acts (and I don't mean “oh they aren't adults yet, blah blah blah”; rather, they simply discard the possibility of it happening without thinking about it at all), so there's a whole lot wrong with it.

Also, it's more about people that age writing that stuff and releasing it to the net without warning, where it can cause issues for people who read it because of the law possibly being screwy ... or because it damages their sanity when written by virgins with ... particularly colourful imagination.
