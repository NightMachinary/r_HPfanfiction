It really bugs me when a story levels up Harry but no one else. I'm an anime fan so I'm totally cool with people going crazy OP- but if 17 year of Harry Potter can destroy the universe you'd better bet his opponent can too.

Also in fics where Draco turns good, it is completely cringe-worthy that people completely skip the getting to know each other part. Draco and Harry disliked each other from day fucking one, but magically now that they're 14 years old and /completely/ calm and rational adults they are best buddies at the drop of a hat?
