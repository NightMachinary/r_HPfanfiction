When there is no tension or actual plot. It can happen when it is just focusing character interaction with no opposing force, or there is the canon plot which is just knocked over easily to focus on the characters again. And the last type is having canon plot changed to have a different character do the same things as another character Examples: Harry's horcrux which is just removed cause of some magic bullshit. "Hey what is that book in Ginny's cauldron" Peter Pettigrew getting captured early in the story, then just happens to escape during Harry's 3rd year.
