Relationship/social interaction-wise, or anything?

Whenever I'm reading a story that starts describing every detail of clothing/hair/makeup/jewelry, I gag a little and stop reading. Give me just enough detail that I can get the "feel" of the scene, but don't describe every outfit in a let's-decide-what-to-wear scene in excruciatingly minute detail (or just leave the scene out altogether, for a preference).

Terrible dialogue and progresses-too-fast romance is pretty cringy as well. Anytime the author feels like they need to add something like "[Romantic Lead] couldn't believe how comfortable s/he felt around [Other Romantic Lead] already. They had only been dating for [ridiculously short amount of time, like three days or something], but s/he felt like s/he had known him/her for his/her whole life," or something similar, it should be a major red flag that their characterization needs some work.
