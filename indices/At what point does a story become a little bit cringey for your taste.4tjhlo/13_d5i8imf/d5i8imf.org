The main reason I nope out of stories is when they add too many layers to the story and it falls over (for me).

Like:

Canon Harry finds his mother's specially-prepared disaster trunk at the Dursleys'. It has a ton of information that Harry will find useful, as well as his mother's cool sword that she forged and enchanted herself!

And then they add on magic-binding, thieving (maybe?) Dumbledore, etc. This story is fairly popular. It lost me when... [[/spoiler][Harry happened to stumble across his still-living parents in Diagon Alley, along with their daughter, and they thought he was dead all along/they're obliviated/I dunno. I noped out before the explanation.]] It toppled over and I didn't look back.
