Ah, but you are forgetting that idealistic nonsense is Step 2. Step 1 is beating up the adult to be persuaded using the idealistic teenager's massive chakra advantage / magical core. It's rather hard to ignore a teenager when he's beating the crap out of them, and there's a good chance that whatever they were planning to do when he started beating the crap out of them, it's probably not a good idea to do any more, so sure, they'd turn in an instant.

In other words,

Teenage Idealism + Overwhelming Force > Teenage Idealism
