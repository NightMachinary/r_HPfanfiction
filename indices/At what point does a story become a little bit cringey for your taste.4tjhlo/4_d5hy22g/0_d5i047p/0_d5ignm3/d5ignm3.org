Amusingly enough, you can build characters that legitimately do that in Dungeons and Dragons. If you have a Bard with a high enough persuade score, you can use /a single conversation/ to turn an archenemy into a friend. It's commonly referred to as 'Diplomancy' and my headcanon is that Naruto is a min-maxed character being played in a pseudojapanese ninja campaign where pieces of D&D keep crossing over.

I mean, c'mon, most of the techniques they use are very similar to the list of spells in D&D.
