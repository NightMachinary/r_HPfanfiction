The Gryffindors are the crazy badasses, it's just the Hufflepuffs are good at war.

If you need a suicide mission completed more comparable to a movie plot than an actual fight, send a single Gryffindor. They'll come back after having killed that eldritch abomination. Gryffindors are the Richard O'Connells of the group.

Hufflepuffs are the Band of Brothers.
