/raises hand/ I have. I read it during my senior year at college, so I had to limit myself to reading once homework was finished. It made for a lot of late nights, but it was a good story. (: I need to go through it and read again; like you, I was sucked in and I just needed/wanted to finish. I had to get it read so I could focus on my thesis, but I want to re-read at a more leisurely pace.
