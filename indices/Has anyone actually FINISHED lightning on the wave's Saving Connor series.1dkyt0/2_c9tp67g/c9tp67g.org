I did!! They were sooo amazing!! I had never read fan fiction until then and now I am obsessed with fan fiction. It was awful for everyone else in my life when I was reading them, I didn't want to do anything else! So basically I could not pace myself, instead I hookwinked a couple friends into readint them with me. I am so glad I discovered them after college or I would have failed out haha
