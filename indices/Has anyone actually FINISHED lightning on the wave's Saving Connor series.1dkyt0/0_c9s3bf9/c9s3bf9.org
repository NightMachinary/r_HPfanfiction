I finished it earlier this year.

I ended up limiting myself to three chapters a day to stop it from taking over my life. Once I started limiting myself I found that I actually enjoyed reading the fic more because I had time to digest ideas and plot developments.

Even though it is an overwhelming read I definitely recommend finishing it, it is definitely one of my favourite pieces of literature of all time. I almost want Lightning on the Wave to pull a 50 Shades of Gray and publish it as original fiction just so that more people read it and she actually gets money for such a great work.

PM me if you ever want to talk about the series, I love literary discussion. :)
