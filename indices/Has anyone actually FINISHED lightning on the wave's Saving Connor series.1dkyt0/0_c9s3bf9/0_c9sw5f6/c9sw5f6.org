You don't know how relieved I am to hear that you had to limit yourself. I was wondering if I sounded crazy, talking about a piece of literature that was so amazing I was addicted to it. It's been two/three years since I stopped reading it and I still think about the thing, after all!

  I think I'll do that. In just two months, as soon as I am done with my externship, I will start reading it again. Oh goodness I hope I haven't forgotten anything vitally important. I remember having a list in my mind of mysteries that I was anxious to see if she answered, or forgot and became overwhelmed by her plot.
