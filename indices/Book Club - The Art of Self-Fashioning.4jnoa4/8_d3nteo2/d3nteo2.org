Review to The Art of Self Fashioning:

Note: I think someone should see as to how well the REVIEWS themselves are written, and they should have a proper format, like Prose; Concept, Pace etc.

Moving back to review itself: Prose: The story has been written decently, it doesn't have glaring grammar and spelling mistakes, but it can definitely use some polishing. The dialogue tags are, in some places, somewhat incorrect, and comments on how some things happen are somewhat odd; i.e.:

"His gaze went to Minerva's robes, before he straightened up and yelled, "FREAK!" The straightening part just doesn't make much sense, but I digress, the prose is decent, but not anything special and as such, I would rate the prose in itself 3/5.

Concept: The concept is as refreshing as can be with hundreds- nay, hundreds of THOUSANDS of fics out there. The idea of a Harry that uses transfiguration is once again somewhat appealing to me; as I remember quite clearly that in OotP I was shocked yet pleased that a seemingly harmless art could end in wizards being made legends. But once again, the concept has been taken into consideration many times, so it isn't OMGAMAZEBALLS but it does have it's own shine. 4/5.

Execution of said concept: It's not done so that- BAM- fuck all of you bitches that have studied this art for years and years, I'm gonna show all of you up- dear god no. The art is shown to be subtle and as such, is very appealing to me. 4/5.

Pace: I don't know, it feels to me that in the latest chapters it has wandered elsewhere from the path the author had originally set. 3.5/5.

All in all, 72/100 is the score I'd give.
