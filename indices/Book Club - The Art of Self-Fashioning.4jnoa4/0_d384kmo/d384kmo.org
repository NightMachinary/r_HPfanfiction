I like Self-Fashioning a lot, but it's starting to meander in the more recent chapters.

Harry experimenting with transfiguration is super neat, and teaching Yar to crush wand wands is clever and something I hadn't seen before. I like the characterization of McGonagall, although Dumbledore gets on my nerves a little (although that's probably the point because Harry doesn't like Dumbledore much either).

But like I said, I feel like the story is starting to slow down a bit. The subplot with Regulus has been going on for a couple chapters now, and not a whole lot has happened. More to the point, due to some revelations from Regulus, it seems as if it may in fact be impossible for Harry to return his parents back to sanity. I'm not even sure if the author realizes it, and ended up writing themselves into a corner, or if there is something else at play that I missed entirely.

I hope that it's the latter, but even if it something else, I can only hope that it isn't just a deus ex machina moment of, "oh wow I never thought to feed them lemon juice, they're cured!"

I have high hopes that this fic will end well as everything thus far has been great. Fingers crossed!
