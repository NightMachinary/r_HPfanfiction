I've held back on this one for a while, a DLP review soured me on it for some reason, and I just never got to it.

Well, after a day of utter boredom at work, I decided to give it a shot. I'm not quite sure if it was worth it or not.

Read it in a couple sittings, which gave me more time to digest it. I thought it was a good /attempt/ at showing a damaged child, but not really well done. I've gotta be honest, I didn't buy the idea of a super cold child at that age, barely even human.

That's the key here, and I think the story lives and dies on it. If you like the idea, you'll probably like the story. I didn't. I've seen damaged children before, and not once have I ever seen one come out so cold and in control. I've seen them needy, I've seen them angry and cut off, lashing out at everyone. But cold and focused like a laser guided missile? No, not once.

That's where it all breaks apart for me. I couldn't believe the character, so I found everything that followed hollow.

It's very interesting in its own way. The magic is cool, and the use of transfiguration is awesome. I just wish there was more to Harry in over 100k words.
