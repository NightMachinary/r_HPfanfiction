As a whole I focus more on the books, but if something suited my needs I'd probably use it.

I once got into an argument with a reader because I gave Daphne and Astoria blonde hair in a fic but Astoria was shown to be a Brunette in the movies.

So yes, I once had a reader tell me that I couldn't make a character blonde because the one off actress who got the part because she was fucking Tom Felton, had no dialogue and appears on screen for about a second was a brunette.

Yep.

Also from that conversation I learned that it's completely impossible to dye your hair in the magical world. So Muggles must have a stranglehold on hair style products.
