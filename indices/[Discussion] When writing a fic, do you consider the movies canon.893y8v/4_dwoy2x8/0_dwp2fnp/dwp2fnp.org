The wiki and games are great if you need names for background characters. I dug up Patricia Stimpson not even half an hour ago. Even though she is actually book canon, no one remembers her (the girl who broke down over the OWLs according to George) and if not for the wiki, I wouldn't have that blank character who will literally get one mention.
