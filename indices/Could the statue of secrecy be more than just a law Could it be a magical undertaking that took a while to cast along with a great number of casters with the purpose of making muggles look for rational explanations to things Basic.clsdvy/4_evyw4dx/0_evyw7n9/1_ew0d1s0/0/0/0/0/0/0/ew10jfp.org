Thanks for playing along. Mind, I enjoyed this thread. I have a variety of things that are headcanon that I love to share, especially with Rowling's references to mythology.

It's the reason why I think everyone should read Partially Kissed hero. It definitely gets racist, but it references so much mythology and has great explanations.
