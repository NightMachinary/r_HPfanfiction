While I do not think we can prove it it any way, it is a plausible theory.

We already know that the fidelius can, sort of, influence people remotely (people who knew of a location magically forget where it is) so it wouldn't be a terrible stretch to posit that some sort of magic is woven into the statute.

The concept is basically what's in the Percy Jackson universe: magical fog that makes 'muggles' see ordinary stuff instead of monsters, magic and such.
