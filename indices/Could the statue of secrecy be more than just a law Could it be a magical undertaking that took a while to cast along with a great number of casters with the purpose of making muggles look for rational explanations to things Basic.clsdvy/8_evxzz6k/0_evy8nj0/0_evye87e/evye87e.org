Witches, wizards, magic etc are all over history, even up to the time of the Statute passing. Isaac Newton practised alchemy and although he was born before the Statute he died after it. I think it's probably better to conclude the history isn't missing, but that Muggles just got most of it in relation to magic wrong (probably mostly due to wizards passing the Statute and being actively obstructive tbf) - Mr Weasley I think mentions something about lots of dinosaur bones actually being Transfigured dragons.
