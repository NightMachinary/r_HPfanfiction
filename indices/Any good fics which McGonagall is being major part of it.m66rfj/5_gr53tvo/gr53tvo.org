I assume you wanted Professor McGonagall, but since you didn't specify, I'll share one of my favorites. "Harry McGonagall" is a really cute story about Harry growing up with Minerva's relatives, though she shows up fairly regularly. It's got some really good friendships, a little bit of romance with Hermione, and has some really funny parts. linkffn(Harry McGonagall)
