You might enjoy browsing [[https://minerva-fest.livejournal.com/][Minerva Fest]] on LiveJournal. It features one-shots rather than multi-chapter epics, and it ran for four years before the mods wrapped up.

Minerva is also a frequent protagonist of [[https://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/][Hoggywartyxmas]], a seasonal fest that runs every year in December, focused on the Hogwarts staff and their contemporaries.

Here are a few fics I've enjoyed from those fests:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/151675][Being Expendable]] by redsnake05, McGonagall/Moody

[[https://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/20143.html][Ombra mai fu, Being the Beginning of the Very True Story of Minerva McGonagall and Elphinstone Urquart]] by tetleythesecond

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22282843/chapters/53215465][Sufficient Unto the Day]] by Squibstress, McGonagall/Snape, mostly in the background. The story gives us the POV of Minerva's father, visiting Hogwarts for the first time.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1018314/chapters/2024840][Circumstances of a Small and Accidental Nature]] by dueltastic, in which Minerva falls pregnant and Snape marries her. It's kid fic, and the author is dryly witty and (for the most part) unsentimental. The story is locked to AO3, so you can only access it if you have an archive account.
