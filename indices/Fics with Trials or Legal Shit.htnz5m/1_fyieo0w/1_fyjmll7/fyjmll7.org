First off, thanks for the warnings! I'm never quite sure if anyone actually reads my little boilerplate disclaimer thing - it's a little long for just "I'm okay with anything, but please warn me about smut and I apologise if I sound rude but I'm not I swear" :D

How much of a sin-washing do Lucius and Snape go through? Are they leather-pants-ed or is there some development from being Death Eaters? I'm imaging not much, from the tone taken on 'Death Eater' in the first chapter, but Snape and Lucius in post-war romances does tend to get accompanied by some big-time sin-washing. No complaint either way, I just like to know what I'm getting into in that regard. :D
