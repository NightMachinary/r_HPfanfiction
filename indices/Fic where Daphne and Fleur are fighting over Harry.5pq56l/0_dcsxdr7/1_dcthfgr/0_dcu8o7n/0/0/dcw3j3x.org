Actually pretty much finished the battle last night. Just a few details left to fill in here or there. Weirdly how deciding to approach it more like a quidditch scene than anything seemed to help. Having a beta review it early to see if it works as well as I think it worked.

After that it's just future Voldemort's plotting moving toward the Christmas Holiday. The battle scene will take up the vast majority of the chapter, so finishing it effectively means I shouldn't have an issue updating by the weekend, barring car accident.
