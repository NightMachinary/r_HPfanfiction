I don't really think it's abandoned either, I guess that he just has life stuff going on, as the story began during spring and went well into summer. I also enjoy that this is only his first fic, he has so far managed to make good of popularly used tropes, despite being new to writing. Although the corner is definitely visible, he made this "Shadow King" (Merlin) a little too powerful, and I'm unsure what else he could call upon to give Harry a boost, short of just making the Shadow King see reason and join him.
