Giving your enemy insulting nicknames is very, very common. I don't see why Harry shouldn't do the same to Voldemort.

The British had a mocking song for Hitler, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Has_Only_Got_One_Ball]["Hitler has only got one ball"]]

Seriously, what is with this "Harry has to respect Voldemort" stuff? Harry is snarky in canon, and gives lip to almost everyone. Why shouldn't he insult Voldemort?
