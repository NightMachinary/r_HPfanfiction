  Of all the cringe-worthy, groan-inducing monikers I've come across for Voldemort, "Tommy-boy" is the most perplexing of the lot. When it comes from Harry's mouth, it evokes an image of a deathly pale ChildSoldier!Harry with a buzz cut... cigarette in mouth and sidearm/bottle of Muggle whisky in hand, depending on the tone of the story.
