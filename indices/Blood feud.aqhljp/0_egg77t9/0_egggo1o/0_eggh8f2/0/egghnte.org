  And now the sheep are supposed to push him into continuing a blood feud?

And now the "smart" purebloods had waited for Voldemort and Dumbledore to throw their supporters into the meat grinder until just a few are left alive, leaving Britain ripe for taking. A bit of a stretch, but not nearly as far as a lot of fics out there.

Of course, you also have such concepts as magically binding oaths and contracts to play with.
