That's quite the departure from canon, though. And what exactly is the motivation for a smart pureblood to do this? Start trouble with the man who beat Voldemort and his friends, for what? Why would anyone go to bat for a blood feud everyone had forgotten? Against the Boy-Who-Lived? That's pretty much the dumbest thing you can do. Especially if said Boy-Who-Lived married into a pureblood family.

If you have contracts and oaths, why didn't they kick in earlier? Why didn't anyone know about this whole thing?

That's why I think Harry marrying a foreign witch, and getting dragged into an international conflict would work better for the more serious plots.
