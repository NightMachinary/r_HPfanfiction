That still doesn't answer how anyone could pressure Harry into continuing/taking up an ancient and forgotten blood feud.

Also, I don't see too many in canon willing to oppose the wizard who took down Voldemort - it's not as if they knew how exactly it happened. Voldemort scared everyone witless. Harry defeated and obliterated him. And now the sheep are supposed to push him into continuing a blood feud?
