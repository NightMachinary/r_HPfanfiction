  Why would anyone think they could pressure him into continuing a blood feud, or even caring about it?

You can assume a rift between Harry and the Weasleys should he not end up with Ginny. If the Girl is, for example, Bellatrix's daughter (from the first war, not Delphi), no one would want to support her. And unless they want to push an open revoltuion, there is not a lot of support for Harry left.

The Order is dead. Kingsley, a few Weasleys and maybe Hestia Jones are the living members. Compare that to the number of people who sit on the Wizengamot and you can easily tailor a scenario where the ruling elite (think Roman Senate) just sidelines Harry and makes Kingsley a figurehead to appease the "light" side while doing nothing more than a little lip service.
