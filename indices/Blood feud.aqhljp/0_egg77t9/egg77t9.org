You need to find a reason why Harry would give a damn about a blood feud he never knew anything about and which was forgotten by everyone else as well. Since he's married, he'll be the boy who vanquished Voldemort. Probably Head Auror as well. Ron might still be an Auror, Hermione will already be on the fast track in the Ministry, the Minister himself as well as key figures such as Arthur owe him their lives. Why would anyone think they could pressure him into continuing a blood feud, or even caring about it? Or keep him from merely saying "Alright, let's end this stupidity", and having the other family agree? Magic compelling him? Why didn't that happen sooner then? Peer pressure? He doesn't have many peers, and Hermione and Ron wouldn't pressure him. Social pressure? He's the saviour of Britain.

Since your main plot seems to be "Harry and his love have to see each other in secret because they are on different sides of a conflict", you might want look into simply making it so his love's family is fighting his own friends and family. But since that's likely to be "Harry and co. against genocidal bigot scum", there's really no reason the girl wouldn't switch sides - or Harry dropping her if she wouldn't.

So, I would propose to make him marry a foreign witch, and then have war break out between Britain and the other country - or at least, a serious conflict - and have that strain their relationship. Preferably a conflict that can't be easily reduced to "this side may not be perfect, but they're in the right and the other side isn't kitten-eating evil, but clearly in the wrong".
