"Magically binding" opens two plot holes:

First, why hasn't it kicked in before? Why not the first time Harry met a member of the "enemy family"? Why hasn't that forced the other family to attack him already?

Second, if it's magically binding, how did that come to be? And why can't it be removed? And if there's a loophole, where's the problem again? Apparently, it didn't force anyone to attack anyone for ages.
