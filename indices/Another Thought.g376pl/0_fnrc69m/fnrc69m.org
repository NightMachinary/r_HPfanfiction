Draco has some interesting character development in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7) and particularly its sequels (but note that the series is very long, so if you're just reading for that, don't hold your breath). Basically, his parents are both manipulators, and their various meddlings, some aligned and some at cross purposes, produced some tangled results.
