Well, if you mean Harry Potter & The Communist Manifesto, then yes, i do not consider it good writing, does it talk about real communism that isn't meme'd to hell? No, it doesn't, but does it make me laugh my ass off sometimes? Yes, it sure does.

Now, if you mean the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrieck Engles, then i assure you it has masterful writing, and is most denfinetly a brilliant read.

Many Thanks, Comrade Delta
