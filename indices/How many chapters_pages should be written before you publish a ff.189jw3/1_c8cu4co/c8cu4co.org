Hmm... I'm not sure how to answer the "where should I publish" question. I've been publishing on fanfiction.net simply because it is the largest site. I was hoping that would mean more traffic for my stories. However, it's also easy to get lost in the shuffle. I'd appreciate other people's opinions.

Right now, I'm working on two multi-chapter stories. I started both with detailed outlines . . . and the one I intend to be longer/possibly lead to sequels has a 25 page handbook to go with it. However, I've been updating the stories as I write them, chapter by chapter.

The upside to that is that I get instant feedback. The downside is that it can be hard to keep control over the direction your story goes--and if I mess up, then I've already got readers. Readers who will surely spot my mistakes . . . eek.

The best advice I've heard is that your multi-chapter fanfic should be completely written and carefully edited before you even start posting. Then, you release it chapter by chapter on a regular schedule. That way, you build an audience who is never disappointed by your lack of an update.

The other option is to write several chapters ahead. I would think that might lead to some of the same problems as the chapter-by-chapter approach, though.

My ambition is--once I finish at least one of the two multi-chapter fics I'm doing now--to write a fic from beginning to end before I start posting . . . That seems like the smartest choice to me, unless you are a very new author and know you need instant feedback to help you get your writing where it needs to be for a book-length fic.

There's my too-long answer.
