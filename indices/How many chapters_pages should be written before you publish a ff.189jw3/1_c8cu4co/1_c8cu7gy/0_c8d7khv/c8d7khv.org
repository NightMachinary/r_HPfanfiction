alexandersvendsen,

I'm a very new writer, too, so I have not taken my /own/ advice in this case. I wish I had. I'm doing the write-it-chapter-by-chapter-with-an-outline route. When you go chapter-by-chapter, if you get readers, you end up feeling pressure to finish chapters/update regularly. That can lead to anxiety/deteriorating work.

I know people get very attached to whatever form they write in, so I'm going to state this as diplomatically as I can, with the disclaimer that everyone does their own thing and the following is just my opinion:

If you are quite new at writing, perhaps it would make sense to try some longer one-shots. I've been surprised at the luck I've had joining challenges at HPFC on fanfiction.net. There have been several that have inspired some (I think) good short stories in various styles that I've linked to here. They've given me a chance to try to create different voices for very different characters. Two of the stories have been from the POV of people with serious mental problems (sociopathy and PTSD), which I'd never have tried otherwise, yet think will be invaluable for creating antagonists or layered characters in the future.

Doing that also allows you to practice making a well-structured story and getting feedback fairly quickly. It's a good route if that is what you need right now.

One thing to consider, though, is that challenges often lead to really short drabbles (under a thousand words apiece, or even around 100 words). There is nothing wrong with short pieces (I run a [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/66100756/1/][100 word challenge]], in which the point is to paint a vivid scene in as few words as possible so you can polish your writing). Writing super-short stuff gives you a chance to work on characterization/voice/style, which is important.

However, if you want to have an arc to your story (ie, a plot) rather than just showing a single event, you need more length (imho). That is not intended to negate the value of ultra-short drabbles, just an observation about style/form.

I've found that, to write a /structured story/ that has a real journey or even just a nuanced character, I (personally) require at least 1500 words (for a super-simple plot), on average between 2000 and 3000 words, and for my most complex and second-best received one-shot, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8918215/1/The-Wonder-Years-The-Diary-of-Hal-Dursley][The Diary of Hal Dursley]], 7,600 words. That is the story for which the most people have asked for a sequel--which shocks me, since it's entirely based around an original character/Dudley Dursley. Neither Dudley nor OCs are popular!

Don't be scared. Write. If you don't put your thoughts down on page, then you'll never get the story out of your head. Plus, if you don't write, you'll never get the practice you need to get better.
