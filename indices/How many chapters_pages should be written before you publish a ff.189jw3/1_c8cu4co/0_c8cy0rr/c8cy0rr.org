  The best advice I've heard is that your multi-chapter fanfic should be completely written and carefully edited before you even start posting. Then, you release it chapter by chapter on a regular schedule. That way, you build an audience who is never disappointed by your lack of an update.

This is my stance, for two reasons. (1) I realised that the stories I never finished writing were the ones I let people read before they were complete, so I've developed a superstition regarding that. (2) I'm prone to reaching later chapters and realising that I need to edit something in an earlier chapter. Point in case: the monster fic I'm working on right now was at 170K words/47 Chapters and almost finished when I realised that there was a huge plot hole that required me rewriting Chapters 3-10 to fix. Just yesterday I finished rewriting those chapters... only those seven chapters turned into thirty. I'd never have been able to do that if I'd been posting as I wrote it. (Subsequently I'm also freaking out a little because by the time I'm done it's probably going to upwards of 250K words and I've never written anything this long before.)

Also, as you said, having a finished fic that's released on a regular schedule allows you to build an audience who knows an update is coming, which keeps readers happy and happy readers (presumably) leave reviews. (Hopefully happy reviews.)
