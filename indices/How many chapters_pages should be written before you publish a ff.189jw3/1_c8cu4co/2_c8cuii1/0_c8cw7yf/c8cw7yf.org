Sorry if this is a silly question--but what kind of protocol do you have in mind? I think the two biggest things are:

1) Have a beta or two, or if you can't find one, edit, re-edit, and edit again until you are sure that you have cleaned up your story and it is in pristine condition. Then, even after you upload it, keep rereading it and fixing the mistakes. Cause you're gonna find them.

2) Don't hold a story hostage. IE, never beg for reviews or say you won't update/continue a story unless people give you reviews.
