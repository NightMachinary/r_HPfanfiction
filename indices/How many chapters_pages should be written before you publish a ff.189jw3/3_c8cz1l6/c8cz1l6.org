Since I have not written anything in half a year....until last night and today! I can comment on this...

My first story I wrote like 100k words in 2 weeks before I started posting, but that story idea had been simmering for over a year before I ran out of stuff to read and decided to try my hand. It ended up 560k words and 80 chapters long. I posted the rest of my chapters as I went...I tried for a long time to stay at least one chapter ahead before I posted one so that I could fix any small mistakes. But generally I needed the feedback as incentive to keep going.

Now I have multiple stories, WIP...and it drives me nuts!

Post as you go, Save up and Post all at once, whichever. But whatever you do...don't pull a GML and post several stories and then leave them abandoned for months. I'm mad at myself, I can imagine my readers are angry with me...

For anyone who is interested, as an aside, Hogwarts Shuffle! is getting a new chapter tonight or tomorrow.

btw: I write without any beta, and it shows....not sure if I want one, never had one, but if anyone knows my stuff and wants to give it a shot let me know.
