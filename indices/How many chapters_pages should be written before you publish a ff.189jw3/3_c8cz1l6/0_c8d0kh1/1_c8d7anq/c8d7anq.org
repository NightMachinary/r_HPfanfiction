Excellent advice!

The only problems with this method are that:

1) Readers could start to abandon ship without giving feedback that you've jumped the shark.

2) This may be just me, but I hate-hate-hate it when I see A/N's in which an author /begs/ for feedback OR asks the readers what direction to take a story. Unless a story is superbly written, I'd probably stop reading there with the assumption that the author doesn't have a plan or the story will die as soon as the author runs out of ideas . . .
