JustRuss- did you just put yourself forth as the model of bad fanfiction writing habits in the third person?

As for the posting options, the decision has to do with your writing habits. Do you have a clear idea and a sure sense of the whole story, but just want some clean up advice? Finish it first and then send it to a beta and then post it. You have the chops to be a published writer and probably should focus your next story to be original fiction.

If you're like the rest of us, you don't know what people like and what isn't clear about your style. Maybe you have several different paths to take and want to focus on the one that the audience responds to.

In that case, take advantage of the serial nature of fanfiction. Treat each chapter like an episode of a greater series. Some episodes will suck and others will rock and a few will simply be regarded as a comedy/fantasy spoof chapter and you can kill it for the bad idea it was. Betas will help you post work that is readable. If your English skills are awesome (or you have entirely too much faith in Microsoft Word's grammar/spelling checker), you can do without. Your readers will pop that bubble if needed, otherwise you can post as fast as you can write.

That said, your story will never be great if you don't have an ending in mind. Maybe you think a character will be better with extra powers or a difficult relationship to handle- great. But it's not really a story until the problems get resolved, and if you don't have in mind an awesome/epic/tear-jerking moment to provide the culmination of that story, you'll never get to it. That awesome moment is the carrot that both readers and writer have as a payoff for the effort put into reading/writing it.

short version: post when you have some chapters finished and know what the next ones will cover. That way your readers become part of the writing team. BUT Don't start a story if you don't have a plan to end it.
