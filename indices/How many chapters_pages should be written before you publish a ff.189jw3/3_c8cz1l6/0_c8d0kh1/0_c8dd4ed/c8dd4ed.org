The episodic writing style definitely works well for fan fiction, I agree with pretty much this whole post, except that if other people are like me...I watch entire series/seasons in a marathon (thanks to Netflix and Hulu and unfortunately do the same with fiction. It is terribly maddening for an author to start something amazing and then disappear for months...

And yes, I totally threw GML under the bus. I hate that guy sometimes!
