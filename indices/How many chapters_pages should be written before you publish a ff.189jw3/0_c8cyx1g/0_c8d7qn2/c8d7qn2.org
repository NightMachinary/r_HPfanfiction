  HPFF forums are quite friendly to newcomers, and there are a lot of fellow authors happy to welcome you into the community.

Seconded. However, unless you join a community/forum that is geared towards concrit, don't expect very detailed feedback from readers. It's rare and as valuable as gold.

Also seconded about finishing what you start. That's important--you want to build trust with your readers. Weekly or bi-weekly updates are best. If necessary, monthly updates work. Readers will understand if you have a life-emergency (I lost my job and spent six months extra-ing, which led me to take a hiatus from Even Unto the Seventh Generation). However, if you disappear for long periods of time /regularly/, they will get less invested. They'll forget what they read in the last chapter, or decide to wait and see if you follow through on the story/mark it complete.

Re: Serial stories--lots of 19th Century authors published serially and created classics. However, often when modern readers read them they struggle to get through the filler. ;-)
