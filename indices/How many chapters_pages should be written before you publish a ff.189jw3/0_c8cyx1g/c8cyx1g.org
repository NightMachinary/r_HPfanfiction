Also consider your time commitment and what you require in order to finish a story. Ideally, I would complete a story before posting, because I find that there's a noticeable cohesiveness to stories written completely before posting, but I know that that's not going to happen for me. I write serially and I've actually never written chapters in advance. I have a limited time for writing, and I just don't write enough to stockpile any writing, or else I still wouldn't be posting the story I started two years ago, because it's still not done. I probably wouldn't be writing at all if I made myself finish stories before posting! And that would've gotten me nowhere. Plus, feedback along the way is important for me, especially because I was a novice writer.

Note though: I also make sure to finish what I start - this is something very important to me - so if you go this route, /try/ to be confident that you're going to finish your story before posting.

I find that most people like weekly to biweekly updates, and when I started at HPFF, I posted every two weeks. Nowadays I try to post once a month, unless it's hectic at school. HPFF forums are quite friendly to newcomers, and there are a lot of fellow authors happy to welcome you into the community.
