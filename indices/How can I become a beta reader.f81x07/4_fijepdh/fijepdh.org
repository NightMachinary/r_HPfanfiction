Yes, you can!

I am looking for the Beta reader myself. Just read anything in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/]] tell me why it is a crap (PM me for the email address), and I will be very thankful for it. Yes, grammar checking is good as well, as is the brit-picking, but I would need somebody who can think about the whole plot (or lack of thereof), about the structure of dialogues, etc.

That's beta-reading, if I understand things correctly.
