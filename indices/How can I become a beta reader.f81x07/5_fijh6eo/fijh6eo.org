It might be helpful to look up or make a thread asking what beta readers and editors do, then seeing what of that you think you're able to do. Some people will want more, some people will want less, but asking a lot of people and checking a lot of sources will help you get a good average idea of what you'd be doing.

If you think it's something you'd be happy to do, the Fanfiction reddit has a beta-finder thread day (check the sidebar calendar there to find out exactly when that day is), FFnet has a beta-reader function, and I believe Dark Lord Potter has some functionality to place beta-readers with appropriate writers. You could also post again here and offer your services, then talk it through with whomever you get responses from in order to find the best match for you. Good luck to you, Overkaer. :)
