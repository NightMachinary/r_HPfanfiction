Hmm okay I might have bit off more than I can chew. I don't really have any qualifications. I don't have an English Degree although I get A+ on assignments in university in my home country. I never liked to write stories myself but have always loved to identify and correct plotholes, correct grammar / improve certain paragraphs - sentences and lay small eastereggs early on in a story to use later on.

I can see I am in no way qualified to actually be a beta tester. Well I might still try and see if I can start out as a really horrible one and then improve along the way.
