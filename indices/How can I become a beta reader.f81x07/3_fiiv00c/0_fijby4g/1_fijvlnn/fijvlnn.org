I don't think it's necessarily true that you're not qualified simply because you don't have an English degree. It really depends on what the writer needs from you. Some might just be looking for you to proofread and check for flow and consistency, while others might want a complete overhaul.

Imo, the most important qualification to have is strong knowledge of grammar and vocab, as well as knowledge of the fandom you're working with.
