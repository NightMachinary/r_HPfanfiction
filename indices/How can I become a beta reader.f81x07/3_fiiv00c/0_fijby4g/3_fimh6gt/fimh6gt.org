I didn't mean that all beta readers should have English degrees. It was more to see what your qualifications are. I've met some beta readers who really don't have the grasp of grammar in the English language.

Like I mentioned, you should be able to find fic's to beta easily, as they are always in demand. Just make sure you like the fic you are reading before offering to beta (or be okay with turning them down if it isn't your thing).

Practice makes perfect after all. Your skills will expand as you beta.
