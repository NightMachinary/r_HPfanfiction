What're your qualifications?

Do you have an English Degree?

Do you write?

What is your primary purpose as a beta? Just grammar or improving word choice, solving plot holes, etc, etc?

Beta readers are always in demand, as anyone wishing to improve on their writing will want one. You will want to be careful with who you pick, however, as it's awful to be a beta for a fic that you are not interested in, or because the writer refuses to listen to your advice (personally experienced this. It sucks).

Good writers, the ones you really want to beta for, usually don't need someone to look over just their grammar. They want someone who can actively improve their story beyond grammar. Making characters sound more in-character, solving plot holes, helping with word choice to make the reader feel more. That is true beta'ing.

A friend of mine just edited my first chapter in this way, and it's glorious. If you are interested, you can take a look. I'm always interested in beta-readers, especially as I don't plan on posting my story until it is complete (meaning heavy edits). However, I am looking for beta-readers that go far beyond grammar.
