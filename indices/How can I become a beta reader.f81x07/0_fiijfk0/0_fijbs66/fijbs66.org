I would love to give it a try but I just read Lindsiria's comment and I don't think I have the qualifications to actually re-write a fanfic. I might have bit of more than I can chew. I think I would be best to correct grammar and improve sentences or paragraphs and I do have stuff to add to a story / find, identify and correct plotholes.\\
But I would still like to try if you want.
