I'd be interested but only if you're ok with extremely slow updates. I'd like to finish the story before posting chapters because otherwise I feel like I'd end up leaving people hanging. I'm focusing on not coughing up a lung right now and my head is so stuffed that creative writing is difficult but I could get a chapter to you late next week. If this sounds too slow I totes won't take offense if you decide to beta elsewhere.
