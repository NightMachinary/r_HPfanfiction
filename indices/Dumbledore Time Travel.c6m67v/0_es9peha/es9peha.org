You know what, I don't think there are, and it would be interesting indeed, but I don't know if him going to his Seventh-Year would work. It's too early for most of his canon knowledge to be relevant. I mean, there could be an /interesting/ story, but it wouldn't be a time-travel-fic in the usual sense of the term; you could make something out of an attempt by him to nip Grindelwald's evil in the bud, but (unless you write him as making the same mistake again and persuading himself that he's set Grindelwald on the path of good when actually Grindelwald is still just as ruthless as ever) that wouldn't take up too long. Most of what Dumbledore would do after being sent back, realistically, is use his /historical/ foreknowledge to try and avert the World Wars.

Any and everything to do with Tom Riddle and the canon plot at large would be null and void to our time-traveling Dumbledore, because what with the butterfly effect, Riddle will probably never be born to begin with (neither, for that matter, will James Potter). Even if sheer butterfly-effect wasn't enough, surely one of the first things Dumbledore would do is give Merope a decent education and actively avert Voldemort's birth, which is the simplest and most humane way to kill him in his situation.

And besides that, any story with Dumbledore as a protagonist is an OP!Protagonist by definition, what with his being the greatest sorcerer in the world, but sending him a hundred years back in time would triple that. Not only is he a genius and one of the greatest wizards in History, but he'd have a hundred years' magical advancement in mind over the rest of the universe. Whoever the greatest warlock on Earth was in the late 19th century would be outclassed in the same way that a modern-day trained engineer would get Thomas Edison or whomever laughed out of the room if he went back to the early 20th century.
