There are a couple fics suggested [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xpdkt/request_ive_never_heard_of_any_fics_like_this/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3o148k/dumbledore_travels_through_time/][here]].

 

There'd be an enormous amount of butterflies from being sent back at the end of his seventh year, how he chooses to use his future knowledge, and how those actions affect the timeline. Can he do anything to help Ariana? Does he save his mother? Does he go on the Grand Tour with Elphias Doge? How does Dumbledore deal with Grindelwald? How does Dumbledore handle Riddle? Do other Dark Lords rise instead of Grindelwald or Voldemort? What else does he try to change? Are there any unintended consequences? I'd expect a timeline drastically different to the canon one. I'd also expect there to be some changes to future canon characters if a story were to cover that much time. Perhaps a character no longer exists, has a different name, a different personality, etc.
