I've read Hugo Award winners since The Demolished Man, which can be considered the great-grandfather of cyberpunk.

He certainly has the legion of followers to make a nomination happen, but I don't think it will get that far. HPMoR simply cannot match the quality or originality of non-derivative works. I strongly suspect that he is doing this for one reason: money. According to this [[http://hpmor.com/notes/119/][blog post]] he wants to publish HPMoR in book form. I'm sure it would sell a lot better if he could stamp a Hugo Award Nominee on the cover.

Edit: picked the wrong Bester novel.
