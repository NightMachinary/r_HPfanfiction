I wouldn't go this far.

I think the I may have mixed the legal and the colloquial meanings of "derivative [work]" in my original post. Colloquially, we use the adjective "derivative" to mean "unoriginal". The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work][legal term]] refers to a work that uses parts from another work or is based on it in some meaningful way: a film adaptation of a book, a fanfic, a audio sample in a mix, an encyclopedia entry using an illustration, and so on. I was unconsciously using its legal meaning.

What I contend is that practically every work --- and literally every mass-market work --- borrows elements from those that came before it. I don't know Mabinogi, but most of the Potterverse setting /is/ a recombination of elements from mythology, folklore, and fantasy; and I do not think less of fanfic for being more explicit about its sources.
