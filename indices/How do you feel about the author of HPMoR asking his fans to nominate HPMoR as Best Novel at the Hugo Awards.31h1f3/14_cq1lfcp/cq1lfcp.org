I am indifferent as to the "morality" of it. All works are derivative of what came before them to varying extents. In that sense, at least fanfic writers are honest enough to acknowledge whom they are stealing from.

Should its fanfic status automatically disqualify it? Well, would you automatically disqualify a Sherlock Holmes story, using characters' names and personalities, but set in a cyberpunk setting and having an original plot? The only relevant difference between that and HPMOR is time, and a decision by some politicians that copyright should last Author's Death + 75 years, as opposed to Publication + 5 years.

However, I think that HPMOR is, as a literary work, not very good. The author's goals --- like those of Ayn Rand in /Atlas Shrugged/ --- were primarily didactic, and everything else, particularly characterization and plot, was subservient to that. Nor was the quality of writing very consistent throughout the book. So, I don't think it deserves a Hugo nomination.
