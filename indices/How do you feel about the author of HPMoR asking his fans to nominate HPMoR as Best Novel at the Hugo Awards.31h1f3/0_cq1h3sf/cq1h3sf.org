It seems a little over-the-top, to me. People /have/ pointed out a lot of flaws in the book (e.g., [[http://np.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][here,]] by another accomplished writer of fanfiction). I'm not the biggest science-fiction buff--but, even though I like /HPMoR,/ I don't really think it's /quite/ up to the level of /Ancillary Justice/ (2014 winner), /Anathem/ (2009 nominee), or /Blindsight/ (2007 nominee).
