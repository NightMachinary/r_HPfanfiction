It is a proscriptive rule set, not a prescriptive one. Anything not explicitly disallowed is, it seems, allowed until rules are updated. I couldn't find any rules against novel-length fan writing in "Best Novel," or any other professional or media format requirement other than by date released or modified.

If such an explicit rule exists it would be great if someone could point it out.

But yes, that's clearly not the right category logically speaking, as I suggested. I was attempting to stay positive about the whole thing and make suggestions about how interested parties could proceed, but if it wasn't clear I think it is a bad idea that won't work as currently formulated.
