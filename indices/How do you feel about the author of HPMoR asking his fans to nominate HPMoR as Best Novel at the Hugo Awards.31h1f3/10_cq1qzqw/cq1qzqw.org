Is something like this allowed? Absolutely! Fan fiction is explicitly included.

From [[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-faq/][the FAQ]]:

  *Does “fan writing” mean “fan fiction”?*

  */Fan fiction is fan writing/*, but fan writing covers much, much more. Fan writing includes writing about SF and fantasy, writing about fandom and the fannish life, as well as pretty much any writing about anything that is written to appeal to fans. Fan writing is just about any writing fans do for other fans that they don't get paid for --- including writing this FAQ!

There is nothing saying a fanfiction of novel length /can't/ be nominated or win.

However...that's not the right category in my opinion. Here's a better [[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-categories/][category]]:

  *Best Fan Writer:* This is another person category. Note that it does not just apply to writing done in fanzines. Work published in semiprozines, and even on mailing lists, blogs, BBSs, and similar electronic fora, can be including when judging people for this Award. */Only work in professional publications should not be considered./*

That way, it is the author being voted on, not the work itself. Might avoid stepping on some toes and bringing up questions not best answered by challenges being brought against this specific work.

Too much self-pimping is usually frowned on, too, so don't expect a good reaction from the majority of long-time voters.
