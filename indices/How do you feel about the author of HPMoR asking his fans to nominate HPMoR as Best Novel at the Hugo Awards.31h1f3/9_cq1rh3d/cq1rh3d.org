I haven't read HPMoR, nor will I, but isn't it a little /cocky/ asking somebody to nominate you. Seriously, I don't know anything about the guy other than people occasionally complaining about him on here, but he should have just nominated himself in secret like a normal person.

Assuming fanfiction can get nominated, of course.
