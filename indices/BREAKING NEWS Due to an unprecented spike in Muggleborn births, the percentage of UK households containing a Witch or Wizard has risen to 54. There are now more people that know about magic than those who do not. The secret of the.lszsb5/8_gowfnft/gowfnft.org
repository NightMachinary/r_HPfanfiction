Do you mean muggleborn births in, for example 1980 was let's say 5% of all births but in 1981 it suddenly becomes 54% of all births?

Or is it more stretched out, as in 1965 5% of all UK houses had a muggleborn baby and over x amount of years muggles kept getting muggleborn babies in such a rate that, let's say 12 years later, 54% of all UK houses had a muggleborn living in it?

Is this spike happens only in UK or is it global?
