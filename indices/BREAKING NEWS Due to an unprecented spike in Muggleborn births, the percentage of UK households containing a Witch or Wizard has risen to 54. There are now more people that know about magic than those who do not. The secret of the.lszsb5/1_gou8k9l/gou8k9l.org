This could lead to a lot of problems. The first problem would be that the statute of secrecy wouldn't hold. They would have to come out to the world.

And if 54% of households now had a witch or wizard living in the home would mean a huge increase in the wizarding population. A population that was once in the thousands (in the uk) would suddenly sky rocket. Can the would even support that many wizards when it comes to supplying wands and magical equipment

No to mention the social effect that would be hand. Muggles would still out number wizards, and every country would be scrambling to take advantage of the fact they now have walking weapons available to them. Not the mention the laws that would be rushed through to control the wizarding population.
