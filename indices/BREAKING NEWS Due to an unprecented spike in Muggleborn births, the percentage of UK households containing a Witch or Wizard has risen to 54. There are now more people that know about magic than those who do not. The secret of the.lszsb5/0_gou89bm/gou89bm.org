Minister Hermione Weasley was a tough old bird as the kids would say.

In her 55 years of life (39 dedicated to her people), she had always primarily thought through situations with steely logic, analysing each scenario from three dozen different angles. She had steered her country through decades of incidents and turmoil with extreme efficiency.

Tonight however she was utterly stumped on how to handle this new situation. No matter what alternative ideas she attempted to formulate in her mind, she knew that there was one, inevitable outcome to the recent statistics on Muggleborn births. It had to be done.

With a flick of her wand, her otter Patronus materialized and was sent away with a message comprising of just two words

/It's time/

In less than a minute following her Patronus' depature, the fireplace crackled as her husband walked into her office, their best friend stepping in through the door almost simultaneously.

"Boys." said Minister Weasley. They weren't boys, hadn't been since they were 14. Their lives had been dark and difficult. Together, they would ensure no other magical child ever had to go through something like that ever again.

"The students are afraid. Their parents are afraid. It's December and we're still trying to track down a quarter of the Muggleborns given letters this past year." said Ron, uncharacteristically solemn.

"Bigot rats are assembling as we speak. They lounge in their manors, telling each other how these children are opressing them. That they need to be taken care of." said Harry, shaking sligthy with pure rage.

Hermione sighed. The world she had grown up in was about to be destroyed, for better or for worse.

"People will want us heads for this. May be years before we can go out in public again, in either world..." she said

"So be it." said Harry.

"Best not keep the man waiting." said Ron throwing the powder into the fireplace and shouting out the name of their destination.

Together, the Minister Of Magic, Headmaster of Hogwarts and Head Auror stepped into the fireplace and walked out in front of the Muggle Prime Minister. The man had clearly not slept for a long time.

"Hello Jack." said Hermione

The man let out a deep sigh that sounded as though it came from his the depths of his soul.

"Suppose this had to happen eventually." He picked up his phone. "Moira, schedule an emergency press meeting for the next half hour. Take over every ruddy channel in this country!"

It was time for magic and muggle to unite. It would be a long time before all was well
