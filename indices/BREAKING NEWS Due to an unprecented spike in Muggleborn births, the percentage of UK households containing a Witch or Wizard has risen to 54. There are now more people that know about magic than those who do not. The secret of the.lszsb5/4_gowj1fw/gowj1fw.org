We should have been prepared. The rate had steadily been rising - had anyone important cared to look it up. Even stranger were tangentially related reports (only some of which held up under intense scrutiny) of known squibs performing accidental magic. They'd become supremely good at hiding themselves, though - either assimilating completely into the wizarding world or completely vanishing into the muggle one.

As it always did, the wheel of politics refused to spin quickly enough. The problem was shelved, debated, fear mongered and finally it grew too large for any newly started measures to have any hope of containing it.

By the point the politicians noticed, wizards of "pure blood" were swiftly becoming a swindling minority. No amount of propaganda could radicalize a population against itself, and no measures to quantify the purity of muggleborns gained real hold. Yet still, no measures of integration were actually passed. The government simply carried on as always, even as the economy crashed around them - too little space, not enough liquid currency, no expansion permits for old wizarding spacws or construction permits for new ones.

And eventually, it reached the breaking point, and snapped. It happened almost exactly as one third of the world population was identified to be magical. Old institutions simply... broke against the might of the people. There is little one can do when one's power rests in a squad of 100 aurors up against a hundred thousand armed, starved, disenfranchised revolutionaries. The smart ones laid down their weapons and surrendered... the dumb ones were quickly subdued.

When the old government had been dissolved and its key figures forcibly retired, a new government grew from the ashes. Little remained of the old system - a magical democracy based on the model of magical switzerland's measures to emulate the muggle version was created, and britain's magical world experienced a period of expansion that was unprecedented. Thousands who'd been barred from work found jobs creating the new world - large cities were constructed under veiling magics, which was more of a courtesy for the rapidly falling Statute than any real concern for secrecy.

When half of all humans on earth were magical, with the occasional adult muggle developing arcane potential, a vote was put forth at the ICW and swiftly shot down. "It's tradition!" they cried, hiding their heads in the sand.

When the nation of Iceland reported that all its inhabitants were magical, the vote was reopened, and still shot down, but more quietly.

When three quarters of all humans were magical, and ninety percent of all humans were aware of magic, the vote was opened a final time.

The fallout was not as large as could be expected - one of the largest communities unaware of magic was a cult based in north america, which attempted to have its members commit mass suicide to escape their fate of becoming magical themselves, but was quickly dissolved and its members treated for indoctrination by the rapidly evolving police forces across the planet.

When the last human on earth began to show signs of the Seer Blood, humanity celebrated as one. The age of steel had ended; and the age of magic had begun.
