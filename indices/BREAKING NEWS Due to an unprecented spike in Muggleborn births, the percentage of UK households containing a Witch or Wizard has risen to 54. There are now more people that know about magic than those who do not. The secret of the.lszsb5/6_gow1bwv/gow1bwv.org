Okay, can someone make a no-maj-centric (but not no-maj-wank, more of a sidestory kinda thing) fic with this? My contribution is that the first gens of Hogwarts find this out and decide to take action to make their own pseudo-secret community of just families of first gen and no-maj-raised. Like the kids at Hogwarts come up with a universal system of passphrases to tell their parents to ask in conversation to see if the other conversational partners are aware of magic so they can talk freely with each other.

I say pseudo-secret because they don't particularly care if the wizards find out, but do have to abide by the Statute of Secrecy so they have to make sure it stays a secret from the no-majes.

PS-Yes i use no-maj while talking about a fic that is most likely set in Britain, I'm American so I'll use American Magical word conventions.
