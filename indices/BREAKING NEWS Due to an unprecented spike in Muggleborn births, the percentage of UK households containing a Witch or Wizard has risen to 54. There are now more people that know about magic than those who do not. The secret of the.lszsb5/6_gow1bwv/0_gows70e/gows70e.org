There's a fic called "A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking'" that's basically about this - some muggleborns, mad about the fact that most of their classmates who stayed in the wizarding world got killed by blood purists, tampered with a major sperm bank in the UK to ensure all the muggle sperm was swapped with magical sperm, with the end result of the year below Harry's year seeing the number of muggle borns jump from like 10-15 to a few thousand, radically flipping the demographics. The story is slowly updating and none of the kids are older than, like, 3 or so at this point I think, but it's SO GOOD.
