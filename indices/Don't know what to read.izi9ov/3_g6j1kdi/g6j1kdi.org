Linkffn(the Snape chronicles) a canon-compliant biography of Snape from his birth to his death. Author does a great job picking up on little details and side characters in the books and making them into fully fledged out plot points. A little more sympathetic to Snape than I'd generally go for, but other times really good exploration of motivations and stuff.

Linkffn(the arithmancer) or anything by whitesquirrel. Hermione is /very/ good at math. Goes into Arithmancy as a discipline, and one of the best written final battles I've seen.

Those are my favorite long and completed ones. My shorter favorites are

Linkao3(the kids who chose themselves) My favorite in a gorgeous series of one-shots exploring what the story would look like if one little thing had changed. Author has a melancholy and nostalgic writing style that really captivates me. Also check out their series on girls and women who should've gotten a better edit.

Linkffn(I know not and I cannot know yet I live and I love) canon-compatible exploration of Luna and snape's relationship (completely platonic, student teacher). Similar writing style. Treats Snape like the asshole he is, but also a human. Best written Luna I've seen, nails the depth of her canon character.
