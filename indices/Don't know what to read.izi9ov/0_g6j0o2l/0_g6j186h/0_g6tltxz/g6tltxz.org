Hmm, okay. Well, you might enjoy the Realm of Song series by Lomonaaeran. It's a bit of a weirder Goblin Harry than Harry Crow's was, but it's got a similar forthrightedness.

Might take a bit of work to get through the intro, but you'd probably also enjoy When a Veela Cries.

Probably Behind Blue Eyes. Gets to be a really good war story later on.
