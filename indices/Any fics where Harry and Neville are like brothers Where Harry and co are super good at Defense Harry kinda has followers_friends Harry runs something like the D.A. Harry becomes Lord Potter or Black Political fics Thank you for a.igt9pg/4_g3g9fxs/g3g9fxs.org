linkao3(24410095) This is my new favorite of Harry and Neville dynamic after Sum of Their Parts. Set on GOF when Ron wasn't talking to Harry and Hermione and they both get closer to Neville. Not quite brother, not yet, and yet their friendship is nonetheless precious here. WIP but last updated mere days ago and the author churned out 20 chapters in three months so I'm optimist.
