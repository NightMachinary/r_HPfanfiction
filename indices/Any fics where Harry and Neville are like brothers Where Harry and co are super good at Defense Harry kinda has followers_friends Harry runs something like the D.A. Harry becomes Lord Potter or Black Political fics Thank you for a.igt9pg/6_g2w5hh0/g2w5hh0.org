OH OH BOY! YOURE GONNA LOVE "HARRY CROW" Goblin raised harry, goblons are more warrior like culture with deep honor ties and a mary sue type of harry for the 1st year but the writing gets better as the story goes along. Harry doesn't take shit and actually uses rules and laws to his advantage as well actually bonding with Neville as a Brother/cousin. Warrior trained harry as well with Hogwarts literally loving Harry as a sort of school mascot for the castle.
