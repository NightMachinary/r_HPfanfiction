So, this series involves a lot of talk about the economy of the Wizarding world, and Harry takes an interest in that (grows to be a business/political person but largely due to his own work, not inherited), but it's a long series starting from before Hogwarts. Also is slash, has bashing and manipulative Dumbles (but there is actual character development so Dumbles realizes he may be in error), and is a crossover - the first book with Naruto and future books with Avatar the last Airbender.
