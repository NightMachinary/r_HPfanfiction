I just finished reading this and oh my god it was great. My favorite 'Severitus' story by far. There were 1 or 2 story archs I thought were dragged a bit too far, and it's missing 2 chapters in the last book (according to the author) that probably won't be added, but it ends at an OK point if you're into mildly sudden endings.
