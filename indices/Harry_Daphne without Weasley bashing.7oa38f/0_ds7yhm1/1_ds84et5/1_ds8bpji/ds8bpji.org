Thats the biggest criticism of legacy. But its a also one of the most interesting takes on common things like marriage contracts, how they deal with harry scar horcrux, the war or even just how Harry and Daphnes relationship evolves in a realistic way. It takes hundreds of thousands of words for them to even become friends and even longer to become more than that. At some points I even wondered how its a Harry/Daphne fic beyond them getting married, but later both of their behavior way that makes sense with both their personalities.
