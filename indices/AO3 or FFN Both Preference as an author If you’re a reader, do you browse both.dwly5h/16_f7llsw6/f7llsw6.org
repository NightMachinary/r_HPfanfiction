FFN as both a reader on writer. As an extremely picky reader, I can still occasionally find a new fic on FFN. The handful of interesting fics I find on AO3 are just crossposted from FFN and I have yet to see a good fic that is exclusively on there. It's not for lack of searching. The situation actually reminds me a bit of the HPFF site - everytime I found a good fic there I would later learn that it's from FFN.

As a writer, I still prefer the FFN audience. I'm established there, have been for over 10 years and have over 20 fics posted. I don't want to just be like many others and just crosspost, since it's not really about view count or anything like that for me.
