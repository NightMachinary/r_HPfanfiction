AO3's reputation for smut is a thing long past. Now it is comparably big with FFN to having all kinds of stories.

There is only one reason why anybody would go for FFN and that is perceived size of your readership. FFN is just so large, that many authors (I had this conversation with Northumbrian) have much response there. Everything else (comfort for authors, comfort for readers, support for mobile web, search, comment system allowing conversation; I don't do mobile applications) is just better at AO3.
