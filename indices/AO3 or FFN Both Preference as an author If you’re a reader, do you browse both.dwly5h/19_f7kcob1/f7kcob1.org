I'm a reader and I prefer [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. I dislike AO3 because it's full of underage and/ or non-consensual stuff. Normally, I'm no prude and don't mind sex scenes, but I draw the line at underage stuff. It literally costs potential authors nothing to have adult characters doing it and not kids. Now rape can be a part of a story that defines, changes, motivates, etc. a character. However, a lot of the stories seem to just consist of explicit rape that sounds like the author is living out some disgusting fantasies of his. And often the rapist gets away with it and/ or the victim falls in "love". Blergh. Just blergh.
