Yeah, underage stuff squicks me out. I'm not typically into kink shaming or judging people for using the creative process to explore taboos, but...

I've also seen a lot of stories tagged with incest in the maybe 4 days I've already been on AO3. I saw a tag “Arthur/Ginny” and just wanted to hurl.

Like maybe someone is reading that for an intellectual reason (I guess?), but someone somewhere is also getting their jollies from it, guaranteed.

That whole thing also makes me wonder, at what point is it really just hardcore erotica OF where someone decides to insert [any fandom] characters for the sole purpose of being edgy?
