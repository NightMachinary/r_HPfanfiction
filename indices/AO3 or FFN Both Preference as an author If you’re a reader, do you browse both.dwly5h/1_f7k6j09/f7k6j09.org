I dont know if I could label one or the other as 'better' for potterfic but I can share my experiences and why I now almost exclusively read on ao3.

To start off, I love the tag system. Yes it's not perfect and there is a /lot/ of unnecessary or slang tags present but that doesnt mean that you as an author have to use them all right away or ever if you dont want to. But as a reader the ability to find the specific kind of fic I want to read (a specific AU, time-travel, desi!harry, or anything else) without having to rely on that information being in a summary is great, not to mention that the ability to filter OUT content I don't enjoy (pairings as either a focus or side pairing, content, or yes rating) is often even more valuable. I also adore the series function that means I never fear missing a new installment in a fic due to not obsessively checking an author's profile. Kudos are a great way to send positive opinion without perpetually clogging up you bookmarks (just because I enjoyed your story doesnt mean that I plan on revisiting it regularly)

While the explicit content on ao3 is certainly a more obvious presence then it ever was on FFN or many other old archives that doesn't mean that non-explisit content is unappreciated or even in the minority between the 3 ratings of non-sexual content that can be selected.

As for FFN, well for me it's not my go to anymore. I have personally found that little in the way of what is published there currently interests me. Even here on the subreddit most of the recommendations for FFN stories I've noticed are all fics that were completed during the heyday of fic writing. Many of the fic I loved on FFN that I subscribe to have not updated in literal years and I have found that my desire to seek out replacements and the effort that would require with FFN's search system is too great for me.

But I encourage you to try both as a reader and an author. Maybe try posting on both and see if there is a difference is the receptions you recive. No system is made perfectly for everyone, but I will keep an eye out for you on the archive.

Good luck!
