Hey, thank you so much for this extensive response! I may give FFN a shot just to see how I like it. I felt like it might be too overwhelming to do both, but I think that once I actually finish revising and migrating my previous fics (there are about 20, including some with multiple chapters) it wouldn't be too labor-intensive to keep up each time I make an update.
