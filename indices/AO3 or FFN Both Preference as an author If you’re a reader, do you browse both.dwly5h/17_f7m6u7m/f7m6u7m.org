As a reader, I much prefer FFN, as while the filtering is much simpler, thats kinda all what I'm after, wordcount and Complete or not are all I really filter by, and if a fic piques my interest, its piques my interest, the rest is kinda irrelevant.

I'll read fics that are on AO3, if reccomended to me but I wont actively browse the site as honestly, the tags can give me a headache. Like, I get it, its a harry potter fanfic, no need to tag every single character that has been mentioned ever, in the history of the fandom. Maybe it's because I'm never really after anything specific, infact, im more likely to check out the author page of a person whose story i like and then check out THEIR favourites.

I also prefer the layout of FFN, even though they aren't too dissimilar for the most part, but I read on my tablet and AO3 tends to bog it down when loading.

I also avoid all the behind the scenes drama so whether one is better than the other, doesn't particularly affect me.
