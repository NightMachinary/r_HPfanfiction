FFN pros:

- Strict limits on summary length and character tags. Makes figuring out what a fic is going to be about easier than Ao3. (People still get around the limitations on relationship tags by spamming alphabet soup, eg. "HP/GW/DG/LL/HG/RV/FD".)

- Old site, 20 years of fanfic backlog to read.

- Mobile interface for reading on the phone.

- Large and consistent readerbase that has stuck around while Geocities, Sugarquill, Portkey, Livejournal crashed and burned.

- More in-depth reader stats for authors, showing hits per chapter.

.

Ao3 pros:

- Unlimited tags and summary length. Makes filtering for specific fic types, characters, relationships, story tropes, and timeline eras easier. (People abuse tags and have 20 lines of individual tags for the most minor characters, just to get the most hits in filter searches.)

- Newish site. Less content, but has mirror copies of fics that were deleted or transferred from other sites. No one has to worry about fics facing purges due to rule changes or lawyer-happy published authors, as FFN has done over the years for real person fics, explicit fics, "X reads the books", script fics, and fanfics based on books by Anne Rice or Anne McCaffrey.

- Legal protection for fanfic authors.

- No ads.

- Relatively engaged audience. Comment system allows open discussion, versus "PM to reply to reviews" on FFN.

- Fic uploading interface is better, doesn't have to deal with the "document upload" system of FFN.
