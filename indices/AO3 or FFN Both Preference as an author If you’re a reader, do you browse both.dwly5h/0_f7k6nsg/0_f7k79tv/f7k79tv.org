Thank you for this thoughtful reply! On the subject of AO3 legal protections, I did really enjoy reading that is part of their mission. Not something I expected to necessarily impact me personally since JKR is supportive of fanfic, but I liked the sentiment and dedication to writers.

So on FFN, you literally have to upload something like a word doc, rather than pasting the text?
