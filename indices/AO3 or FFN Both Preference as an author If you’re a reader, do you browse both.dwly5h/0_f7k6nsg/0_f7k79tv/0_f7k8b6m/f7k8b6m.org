You can copy-paste the text or upload a word doc, but each chapter has to be uploaded into the system individually, and it's a hassle to go through the edit-reformat-reupload when you're fixing typos on existing published chapters. The copy-paste process destroys formatting (line breaks, quotes, lists) if you wrote in Gdocs or Word, and they automatically censor certain words, characters, and phrases.

Eg, they delete anything that looks like a link. So if you write "Thanks for reviewing, user John.Doe.1990" in your author notes, FFN will automatically reformat it as "JohnDoe1990".

Super annoying and unintuitive as fuck.
