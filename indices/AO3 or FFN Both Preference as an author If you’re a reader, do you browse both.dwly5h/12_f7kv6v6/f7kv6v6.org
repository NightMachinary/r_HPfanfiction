Speaking as a reader, I much prefer AO3 but I do browse both. AO3's tag system just makes it a lot easier to find what I want, which due to my reading habits is often very specific. Also, in my experience AO3 tends to attract higher-quality writers. Regarding its reputation for smut, it's easy to steer clear of that if I'm so inclined. Other times I'll go looking for it.

One note though - I do think AO3 could do with some better moderation of some of its... let's say... less tasteful fics? There's smut involving teenagers, which can be controversial on any day... but then there's outright paedophilia. Applying certain tags to your fic should be an automatic ban IMO.
