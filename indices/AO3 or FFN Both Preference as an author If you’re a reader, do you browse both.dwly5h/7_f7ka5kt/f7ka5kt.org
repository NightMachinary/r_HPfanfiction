I use both fairly frequently. There's about a 50-50 split on recommendations from either site from various subreddits. However as a general user, I prefer AO3. I find it much easier to simply browse for something that interests me since I can just include whatever fandoms/additional tags that I desire. I've never found it to be overwhelming, but that could be because I started reading on Wattpad, which is arguably worse than both of them in some ways. As for disliking FFN, I honestly find it really difficult to find things that interest me outside of outright being given stories. The tags are confusing and as far as I know, I can't sort results like a can on AO3 (I like sorting by Kudos or Bookmarks usually).

Edit: just noticed your question about content. I don't browse much on FFN, but I do know that there are a lot of explicit stories on AO3. I can't speak for the comparison, but AO3 definitely has awesome fanfics that aren't explicit as well. I've found both experiences quite rewarding, especially since you can choose to exclude any ratings that you want, or search by only explicit if that's your desire.
