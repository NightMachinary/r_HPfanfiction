i personally prefer ao3 both for reading and publishing. i think it's easier to use and is a much more sleek and visually pleasing website than ffn. however, ao3's tagging system leaves something to be desired; i think it's generally a good system but people use way too many tags and often mistag things. that's my only real complaint about ao3 though. ffn just looks like shit and is old. i will say, though, that i've gotten a lot more views on ffn than on ao3, so that's an upside.
