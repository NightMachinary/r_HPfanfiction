FFN just kind of feels old next to AO3 to me. It lacks a lot of what AO3 has while not doing too much better than it. I find it way easier to categorize my work for people to find on AO3, and a lot easier to discover new work there as well.

People do, of course, abuse and clog up the tagging system, but it still gives you a much better way to discover content and search for specific things than you can on FFN. Especially because you can filter things OUT with as much detail as you can filter them IN, which really helps narrow down searches. And even without tags, the filtering on AO3 is much more comprehensive and flexible. Particularly for, uh, porn, AO3 really lets you find what you're specifically looking for at that moment, while FFN is more hoping the search algorithm gives you some good recs.

Also, some authors just kind of suck at summaries. Or sometimes a summary is just a random line from the fic, or an update on the latest chapter. Tags can really help show you what a story is actually about when an author's vague or flowery summary doesn't tell you much.

Overall, FFN doesn't do anything bad. But AO3's superior filtering, plus tagging and numerous additional features, all add up to make it the obvious choice for me.

All this is applicable to the desktop sites, I don't use the mobile ones at all.
