I'm probably in the minority here but as a reader, I prefer FFN over AO3. It has superior navigation and reading mode for mobile, the different font sizes and native dark mode are very useful. Most other people will say AO3's tagging system is better and while it is more comprehensive, I find it super messy most of the time.

When I find a good story on AO3, the first thing I do is look up if it's also posted on FFN.
