Just to check, you know ao3 has a darkmode too right?

Hell i hate the bright white pages enough i force darkmode on every site using my browser but both ffn and ao3 have options for it.

Also, i agree, ffn > ao3 for sure. ill read both but i would say 90% or more of the fics i read are on ffn. its just too annoying trying to find decent fics on ao3 most of the time. The majority of what i read there are recommendations from this sub.
