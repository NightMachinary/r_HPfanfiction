I crosspost on both sites and write for HP and MCU... Feedbackwise Marvel works better on AO3 and HP on FFN (at least for me). But my stories are mostly gen and I feel AO3 works better if you write smut. I think AO3 is more user friendly as an author. As a reader I use both but prefer FFN because I feel my search results are more relevant. On AO3 people tend to tag everything and when I search for Loki and time travel I want Loki centric time travel fics and not stories in which time travel is talked about and not actually done and Loki is a minor background character. If Loki is tagged on FFN you can be sure he really is a MC. If you write crossovers, AO3 is better...

So it really depends on fandom/genre/characters/etc which website is better. I'd say try both. Crossposting is not all that much work. Once you have a chapter written it's a simple matter of copy and paste and done in a minute. Then you'll see where your story works better and can still decide which you want to use.
