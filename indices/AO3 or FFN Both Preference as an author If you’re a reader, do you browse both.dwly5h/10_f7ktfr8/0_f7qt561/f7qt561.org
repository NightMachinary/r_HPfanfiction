I'm actually really glad you brought up the bitchy commenters, because I just had my first experience with that and I'm a little put off and wondered whether I'm crazy for thinking like this. I'm not some princess who needs to be coddled or complimented 100% of the time; I appreciate constructive criticism and hearing from people who disagree with me. But I don't understand the point of leaving a one- or two-sentence pissy, pedantic comment that only says you disagree with the entire premise of my story - which is what just happened to me, two days after I started using FFN.

A reviewer basically left this comment that said, “X character would never act in x way, and Y character doesn't deserve y.” And that was ALL. And the fic was very clearly a naive wish-fulfillment vision from Y's POV, so to say X would never act that way entirely misses the point.

Like..I don't go read fics featuring a ship I don't support and leave a one-sentence comment saying, “This ship would never realistically happen,” and nothing more.

It could certainly happen on any site, but by now your response here is not the only one I've heard about FFN having a reputation for bitchy comments. I wonder whether that has anything to do with the fact that there are no public replies by the author. Because you can just go shit on whatever you want and the only thing the author can do is privately message you, and that's just begging to turn into a pissing match.

Anyway.

I am also seriously unimpressed with the upload/ publishing process so far on FFN. The process you just described for making edits is wild.
