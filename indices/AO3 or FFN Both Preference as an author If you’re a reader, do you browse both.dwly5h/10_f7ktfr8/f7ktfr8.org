I do find AO3 more user-friendly overall... but also friendlier in tone. FFN seems to have a lot more bitching and sour commenters. Yes, AO3's reputation of having all the adult stuff not accepted on FFN is deserved... but being a bit of a pervy girl I don't actually mind this.

My personal experiences have been... well.

I started out on AO3... only have one fic there, and got a number of "You have to post this to FFN too!" requests-slash-demands. I wasn't really too keen... Even as a reader I vastly prefer AO3. FFN never sat quite right with me for some reason.

But after a few people had used the "but you'll get soooo many more readers on FF.Net!" argument, and at least two people in unrelated discussions declared their hatred for AO3 and refusal to ever read anything on that site, I relented. There was nothing wrong in posting my fic on both sites. Not like this is an exclusive deal, after all. So I signed up for FFN and started posting my fanfic.

It didn't really change my mind. Uploading fics to FFN is needlessly complicated and counter-intuitive, as is editing your content. All this Doc Manager nonsense and having to go through five hundred steps before the chapter is actually posted... who thought that was a good idea?

And don't even get me started on editing the chapters. Say you read through one of your fic and spot a typo that you'd somehow missed during the spellcheck or read-through.

On AO3, it's simple to fix the mistake. Go to "Edit Chapter," fix the typo -- boom, done.

On FFN you have to go to the Doc Manager, and if the document in question has expired you have to re-upload it to FFN again, before editing it, then going to "update stories," find the story in question, go to "Add/Replace chapters," choose the correct chapter and the correct document from drop-down menus, and then... I JUST WANTED TO FIX A STUPID TYPO!!

This wasn't the worst of it though. Turned out I'd signed up in the middle of a glitchy period. I very quickly got two reviews for the first chapter, but I couldn't view them because a glitch on the site (which people were complaining about on the forums) made the reviews inaccessible to read. I'd made sure I'd set up "e-mail me for all reviews" but that didn't happen either.

Now, I can forgive some glitches, and I realize I was a victim of bad timing more than anything else, but still, this did not make for a very good first impression of FFN as a writer.

Took a few days before I got to see the reviews, and when I actually did... two reviews were from the same person, accusing me of being a plagiarist who had stolen the story from AO3. I mean, I have like the same username on both sites, so I would have thought it was obvious I was the same person, but apparently not.

I also got PMs from some guy who wanted me to explain a loli-yuri-manga to him. What the...? I know I've made it clear my fic will eventually contain femmeslash, and yes, the protagonist is a young child in the early chapters, but surely there's a bit of a leap from that to "if you ever want me to explain the intricacies of some random adult-rated manga with underage girls, by all means give me a call!"? I SWEAR I never said that!

Now, fair is fair... There ARE things I have liked about FFN. I like how you can see how many views/reviews the individual chapters of your story has. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate the number of readers... one week up on FFN and I had almost half the views that the AO3 story got over three months. Also, being placed on the favourites and alerts lists of several people was satisfying...

But there have been several annoyances here that I simply don't have on AO3.

So yeah... I go with AO3 when I can.
