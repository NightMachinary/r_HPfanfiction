Personally except for GoT fanfics I've never come across good AO3 fics that aren't posed on ffn.net. But to be fair I haven't spent nearly as much time there as on ffn.net as I was initially put off with the amount of fucked up shit there is on AO3. Really smut is the only thing I use it for. There might be a lot of morally unacceptable smut on there but luckily there's a lot of regular smut as well.

This might be an unfair comparison but I've always felt like with the ridicoulous amount of horrifying stuff you can find on AO3, AO3 is like the 'dark/deep web' of fanction whereas ffn.net is just your regular 'internet' meant for a casual read.

Is AO3 friendlier? Yes. Maybe because it's used by an older audience eventhough it's just a 13+ website.

Content restriction? Well that's something I'm in favour of. And since I read an enormous amount of really good fics over at ffn.net I can't say it's made me miss out.

What I did notice is that there's a very large number of slash oriented fics on AO3 even more than there's on ffn.net. So if that's your thing maybe you'll like it?

Personally my main problem is that if I read something fucked up it stays with me whereas others can just shrug it off. So I have a mild case of archiveophobia.

I've learned that the only way to safely enjoy AO3 is to bookmark a page you created in advance with all those tags you don't like (underage, particular pairings,...) and use that as a front page when going through the search on a particular fandom.

But since writers aren't forced to use tags even that might be pointless...

The main thing AO3 has ffn.net undoubtably beat in is their huge filter/tagging system.

I love the 'community' option over at ffn.net though. You can just look up 'time travel' and you'll get thousands of stories some good soul already organized for you in a single folder :).

I also think that their crossover search system is way better than AO3's.

Anyway, hope this was helpful.
