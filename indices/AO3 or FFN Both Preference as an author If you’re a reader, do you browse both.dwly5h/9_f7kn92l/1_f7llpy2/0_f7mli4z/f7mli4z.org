So on the frontpage of ffn.net you see two columns for 'books', 'movies', ... If, for example, you click the second column 'books' and then 'Harry Potter' you get a new page filled with info of other fandoms and their exact number of fics that have existing crossovers with Harry Potter. Just click on something et voil√†.

To me it feels way more structured and easy on the eyes than doing it on AO3. In AO3 if you want to search for a possible crossover you have to write a particular fandom in the 'include tag' bar and hope you find something matching.

You should really try reading some crossovers. There's some really, really good stuff written out there. My personal favourites are HP/star wars and HP/GoT crossovers.
