As a reader, I prefer AO3.

- The fandom/site is friendlier to slash.
- I like that it has the download option right on the front of the fic.
- Images and videos can be embedded right on the page. This allows chapter fanart, fancomics/doujinshi, and other really creative things.
- Writing quality is higher for the fandoms I follow (although this may just be my perception). FFN's 20 years of Harry Potter fics means there's a lot of "My first fanfic" posts that never go anywhere.
- The tags, while they can be misused, give real freedom to be as specific as you want. The exclude system, which is a recent development, take care of most of the downsides. I do wish there were a way to specify a primary character/relationship vs background.

As an author, I prefer AO3

- There's no confusing document upload system. I just recently published on FFN last week and that threw me off. I understand it was made for an older internet era without dropbox/pastebin/etc.
- AO3 is less fussy about strange characters and embeds. I wrote an animorphs fanfic, where in canon characters communicating telepathically use < and > to punctuate their dialogue. FFN doesn't allow those characters in fics, and stripped them off my fic. Took some googling to find out why. AO3 just published everything verbatim.
- You can add co-authors, you can dedicate works to someone else, etc. It's better for collaborations.
- Making small edits, either to fics typos or to add/amend just a few lines to make sentences run snappier, is so easy on AO3. Click edit, make the edits, and done. FFN makes it a whole thing, and I now know why authors there refuse to fix typos from years ago.
