Not anymore. It is now so large, that there is everything there. Some thing I like (for example, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]) are decisively non-smut, or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102][smut is just a by-product of the story]]. And besides, with the working search, it is a way more easy to filter out whatever you don't want to see.

And BTW, despite their claims, there is plenty of smut on FFN as well.
