Definitely not most. Of the ~230,000 Harry Potter fics on AO3, ~40,000 are rated as explicit, while teen has ~70,000 and general has ~60,000.

AO3 just has the tools to find the specific smut you're after. If you want an explicit Hermione/Colin fic with spanking and bdsm and public nudity, but no f/f content and no blindfolding and no Draco Malfoy, you can search for that pretty easily.

They explicitly allow almost all kinds of smut, plus they give you the tools to find what you want specifically, so it is the best place to look for that sort of thing these days. But the non porn stuff is still a much bigger part of the site on the whole.
