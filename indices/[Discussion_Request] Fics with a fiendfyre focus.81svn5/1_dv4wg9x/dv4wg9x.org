Considering how fast it spreads in DH, it would probably torch Britain within a day if it ever got out of control on the outside. You could make some parallels to "The Cloud" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloud_(film)]], but I don't think a semi-sentient natural disaster would make a good thriller plot.

I think a Fiendfyre obsessed maniac similar to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Lxk8p43sA][Kilgore]] in Apocalypse Now would be a more interesting antagonist. Basically Bellatrix Lestrange but throwing Fiendfyre instead the torture curse around like it was going out of fashion. Since Fiendfyre spreads very quickly, the protagonists would have to choose between catching the maniac or stopping the flames, maybe even failing at both. There could be difficult choices, like do you help to evacuate the school or the hospital. He would not be as difficult to kill as Voldemort, but a lot less concerned about PR and recruitment, therefore doing a lot more collateral damage.
