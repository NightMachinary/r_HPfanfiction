I was thinking about revisiting one of my old ideas where Voldemort makes a magical cauldron that stores fiendfyre and keeps it 'alive', supplying it with energy like a battery so it doesn't burn out.

Maybe said cauldron could also be enchanted to work as a 'brain' for the fiendfyre, so it can intelligently ambush targets, evade obstacles, et-cetera.

As a side note, [[/u/suername][u/suername]] posted their theory on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t6fb2/lf_oneshot_where_fiendfyre_gets_completely_out_of/dliv8w8/][how fiendfyre works some months ago]]; basically, rather than being a semi-intelligent self-perpetuating fire, fiendfyre needs to devour magic (items, wizards, etc) to continuing burning, though it's hot enough to start regular fires. Sort of like a contagious magic-to-fire transfiguration.

...Huh, I wonder what other contagious magic-to-X transfiguration spells there might be? Turn afflicted wizards & witches into froggy squibs with magic-to-animal? Ultimate-nature's-wrath with magic-to-wood? I wonder how good you'd need to be at transfiguration to transfigure a spell in flight or target someone's magic in the first place? Or transfigure a ward, I saw that in Blindness once.
