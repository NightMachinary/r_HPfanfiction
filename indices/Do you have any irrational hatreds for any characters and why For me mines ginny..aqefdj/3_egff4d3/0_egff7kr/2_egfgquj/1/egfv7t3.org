While I'm not a fan of canon Voldemort, this...

  He got killed while trying to take back a high school!

... is more of a meme than anything.

Hogwarts, presented as the greatest magical fortress in the series. Defended by everyone in Britain willing to fight. IIRC, Voldemort was going to win if he didn't have another woopsy trying to kill Harry, which was again caused by magic that basically nobody knows anything about. And Harry still would've died if Rowling didn't decide that a blood infused simulacrum should count as a budget a Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills.

Is this canon?
