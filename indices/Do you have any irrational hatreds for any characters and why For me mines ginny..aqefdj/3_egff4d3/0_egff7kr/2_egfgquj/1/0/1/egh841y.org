  He pointed all of his efforts into killing/manipulating Harry from the kid's first year until his final death.

Did he, though? He tries to jinx Harry during Quidditch first year, but that was pretty obviously a target of opportunity without planning. He's just after the Stone, and doesn't particularly care about Harry until he literally butts into the Stone's final resting place.

Second year, he does nothing.

Third year, he does nothing.

Fourth year, he again goes after Harry, but only because he wants the blood protection nullified and that was the best time to do it.

Fifth year, he's actually after the prophecy and Harry is more of a means to that end, since only Harry or LV could take the orb.

Sixth year, he's targeting Dumbledore.

And, I mean, seventh year, yeah, that's all Harry, but who else was there at that point?
