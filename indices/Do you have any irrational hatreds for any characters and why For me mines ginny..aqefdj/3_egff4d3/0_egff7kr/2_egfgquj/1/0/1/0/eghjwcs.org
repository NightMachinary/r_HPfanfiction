The entire first year is a definite /im/pulsive move, so, 'kay. But if he really didn't care about Harry, he wouldn't have tried to kill him until /after/ he came back.

Main-part Voldy may not have been targeting Harry second year (probably too busy thinking over the blood protection), but Tom sure was after Ginny brought him up.

Forth year, Wormtail even says they could use literally anyone else, but Voldemort just dismisses it for the sake of bypassing the protection (hey, other than the convoluted, metaphor-inducing plot, it was actually sound to use Harry)

Fifth year, he focused on the prophecy, sure, but did he /really/ have to use Harry to do it? Means to an end, yeah, but it was obviously also a "two birds, one stone" plot: get the kid to get the orb, kill him when the opportunity arises. If he succeeds in killing Harry, the prophecy is redundant and can make for light entertainment with dinner.

Third and Sixth year, I'll give you those entirely. But he /must/ have been plotting behind the scenes of Two and Three.

But that's my take, and I'm not one to believe he spent 10 years reinacting "Springtime for Hitler."

BTW, if it seems like I'm taking this way too seriously, no way, I'm just having fun talking about this kind of stuff.
