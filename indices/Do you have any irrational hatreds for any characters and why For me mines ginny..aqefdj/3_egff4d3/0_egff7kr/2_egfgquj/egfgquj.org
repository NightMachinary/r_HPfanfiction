  I think part of it is I read so many stories where she's supposed to be the bad guy in a bunch of situations

So you let yourself be influenced by bash fanfics? At least you are honest about it.

I personally will NEVER let fanfics affect my perception of canon characters, including the Movies, although I might like or hate them in particular fics.

--------------

The only character that I absolutely hate in both literary sense and in-story behaviors is Voldemort. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

But even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. He got killed while trying to take back a high school!

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

And we should respect this pathetic character?
