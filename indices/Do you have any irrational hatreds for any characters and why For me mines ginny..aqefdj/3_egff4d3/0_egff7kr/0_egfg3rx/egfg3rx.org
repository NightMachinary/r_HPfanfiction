  I think part of it is I read so many stories where she's supposed to be the bad guy in a bunch of situations

If you're considering new looks at Ginny, I'd suggest stepping away from fanfic for a while and rereading some of the canon again.

  the other bigger is I'm not a fan of major fan girls.

While I sympathize with this position in principle (I for instance despise Romilda Vane), with due respect, from my perspective, Ginny stops being a fangirl halfway through /Chamber of Secrets./

When Malfoy antagonizes Harry as a fame seeker in Flourish and Blotts, Ginny rushes to Harry's defense--but she doesn't say that Malfoy is just jealous, as Colin Creevey would do. Ginny snaps that Harry didn't what Lockhart making a fuss over him--she recognizes that Harry doesn't want to be famous. He wants to be Just Harry.

While she is still shy around him throughout much of the next two books, I felt it read a lot more like a little girl crushing on her brother's friend than it does fawning over the Boy Who Lived. And by the time we get to Goblet, Ginny is having casual conversations with Harry--and isn't afraid to tell him off when she thinks he's being rude.
