Good grief, imagine what would have happened if Fred hadn't blabbed that.

/On the Hogwarts Express/

Fred: Hey Ronnie-kins.

Ron: Don't call me that!

George: But that's your name, isn't it?

Harry: Fred...and George, right?

George: Huh, he got us right.

Fred: Say, I have a question--do you remember what You-Know-Who looks like?

Ron: Bloody hell!

George: Fred!

Harry: Er...well, I remember green light but not much else...

Fred: Nothing at all?

George: /Smacks him upside the head/

--------------

/Great Hall/

Ron: Oh, mail's here.

/Errol flies in and plops in front of the Weasleys/

Harry: That's your owl?

Percy: That's peculiar, Mother doesn't usually write this quickly. And I doubt Ginny missed us that much.

Ron: Um...I think I know why...

Fred: Oh no!

Howler-Molly: FREDERICK WEASLEY!
