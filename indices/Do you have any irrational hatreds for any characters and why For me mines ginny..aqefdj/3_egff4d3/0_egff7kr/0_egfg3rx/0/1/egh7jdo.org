Ginny can't even look him in the eyes, stay in the same room, or speak to him without turning bright red. She routinely drops things or lets out abrupt squeaks when he enters the room.

Hermione starts telling him about the books that he's in, but then orders him and Ron to get dressed. Ron's pretty impressed, but has a normal conversation otherwise, and he even seems almost as interested in being raised by Muggles as the whole 'Vanquisher of the Dark Lord' bit. The Twins, again, are casually impressed, but hardly awestruck.

I'm not on the Ginny hate train - the character development saves her - but suggesting that they're on the same level is disingenuous.
