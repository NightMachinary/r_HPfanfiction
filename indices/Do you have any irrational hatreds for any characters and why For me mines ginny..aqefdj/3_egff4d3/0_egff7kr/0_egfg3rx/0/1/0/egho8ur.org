  Ginny can't even look him in the eyes, stay in the same room, or speak to him without turning bright red. She routinely drops things or lets out abrupt squeaks when he enters the room.

This is during the period when, as was said above, she is "a little girl crushing on her brother's friend", during /CoS/; so what you're citing to me is after her reaction to him changed significantly. I wasn't being disingenuous, I was simply comparing Ginny's reactions to Harry during /PS/ to those of the other characters. They were indeed all excited to see him, they simply showed it in different ways, consistent with their normal personalities (and Ginny was ten at this point, so it shouldn't be surprising that she was less mature).
