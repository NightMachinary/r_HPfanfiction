IMO read her core canon scenes, and read some fics where she's a strong, active character. She's far from a /great/ character in canon, certainly, but she also has strong points that you shouldn't overlook for the fanon banshee/fangirl caricature you see in some fanfics. "The Changeling" is popular, as is "The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond." Strangers at Drakeshaugh is more slice-of-life, but she's a fairly important character there. And there are plenty of fics where she's a fun background character- Prince of Slytherin gives her some nice moments in Book 2.
