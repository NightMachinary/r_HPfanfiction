Not really? There are some characters I have a mild distaste for, but I've seen every character done a dozen ways. I've basically become inured to the faults of the 'good' characters. And I'm insensitized to the faults of the 'evil' ones, so disliking their canon version has rational reasons, even for popular characters like Snape.
