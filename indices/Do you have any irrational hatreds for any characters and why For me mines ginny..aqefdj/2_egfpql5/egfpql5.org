I wouldn't say /hatred/ but... Hermione. Just a little. Please don't kill me. It's not that I hate her, it's just that fanon!Hermione can often times be so good and perfect and smart, and it's very frustrating when I liked canon!Hermione and all her faults. Her faults define her as much as her many virtues, and they make her a much more interesting character.

That said, it's also irrational because I tend to stay the hell away from any fics that she stars in, and almost automatically click out if she's a drivijg force in the plot and gets too perfect for me. I really should give it more of a chance +especially given my lenience with other characters+ but it's very frustrating for me.
