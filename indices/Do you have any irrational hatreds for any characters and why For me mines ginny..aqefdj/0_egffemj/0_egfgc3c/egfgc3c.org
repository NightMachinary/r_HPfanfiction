I'm with you. Though I'll go a step further and say I actually really dislike canon Luna, which I know is a super unpopular opinion. She's just...thin...to me? There's not a ton of character development and most of what she says is actually fantastical. It's sweet that she cares so deeply for her friends but she also seems weirdly disassociative, like when Hermione is tortured.

I find her quirky/annoying rather than quirky/charming.
