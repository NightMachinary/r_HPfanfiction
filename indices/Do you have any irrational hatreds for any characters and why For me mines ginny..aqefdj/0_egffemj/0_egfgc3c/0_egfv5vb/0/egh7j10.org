I don't have too much of an issue with either of them being essentially "introduced" fully formed (though I'd argue Ginny was developed into what she ultimately became) as far as the story goes. After all, its from Harry's POV so it makes sense for him to suddenly notice Luna and Ginny.

I /do/ take issue with people knocking Ginny for lack of development or coming out of nowhere but don't take even greater issue with Luna coming out of nowhere and lacking development.
