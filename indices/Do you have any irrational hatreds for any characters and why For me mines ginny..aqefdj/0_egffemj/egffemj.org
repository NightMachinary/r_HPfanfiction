People will hate me for this and I will probs receive many downvotes but... Luna. Not even because of the books but so many fics made me just dislike her so much. For whatever reason Luna becomes in fics this weirdly all-knowing girl with super wisdom. And there's barely a fic in which she doesn't make an appearance, tagged or no. Romance? Luna is there. Adventure? Luna is there. Smut? Luna is there. Super edgy dark bloody gore? Luna is there and makes it fun!
