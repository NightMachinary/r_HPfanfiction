I like Remus but people are doing him a real disservice as a character if they just focus on his good traits. He wasn't there for Harry, wanted to run out on his kid and kept his mouth shut about Sirius being an animagus which in the end was a good decision but if Sirius WAS guilty, he had information that could have led to his capture. He's self-hating and makes bad choices sometimes, why not explore that instead of canonize him?
