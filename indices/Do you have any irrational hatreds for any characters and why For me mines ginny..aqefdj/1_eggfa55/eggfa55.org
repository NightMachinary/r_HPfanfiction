To me, the twins. They think pranking people is funny, but their targets aren't. Neville, Ron, anyone younger than them.

Also Remus. To me he is a coward and a yes man. First he doesn't contact Harry at all, than in third year, it's almost half over before he says, oh yeah, friends with your father, than vanishes again for another year. Any time he had to step up, he ran.
