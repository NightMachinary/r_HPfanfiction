I might justwrite a crack fic.

Harry having his temper tantrum at the beginning of ootp causes Voldemort to rage against a random death eater in the exact same way. After beeing dismissed, Lucius Malfoy comments to Snape that their Lord seemed even more unhinged than usual.

After his plot to get the prophesy from the ministry failed and his return is exposed, pettigrew finds Voldemort throwing things in his office and screaming. "I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!" Wormtail slowly backs out if the office, turns around and walks away muttering about "crazy dark lords taking things too far".

After Snape gets a strange sense of déjà vu when "the Potter brat" throws a tantrum, he finally takes teaching Oclumency seriously. Because clearly, the boy is being influenced by the dark lord.
