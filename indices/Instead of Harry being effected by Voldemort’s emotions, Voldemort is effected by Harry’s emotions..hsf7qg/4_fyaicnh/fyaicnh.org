Nothing in my folders go quite in that direction enough for my satisfaction, but that sounds fantastic.

Let's give this man crushing despair with a side dish of survivor's guilt.

He just wants to punch Draco Malfoy in the face. He doesn't want to crucio him. He just wants to straight up clock him in the jaw.

He feels compassion for the first time in his life and gets violently ill.

He gets the full dose of adrenaline and joy from a successful quidditch match and the cognitive dissonance between that and the similar feelings he gets from cruelty makes him pass out.
