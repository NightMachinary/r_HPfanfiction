I've read a few stories similar to this, although most of them are more in the line of "Harry fantasizing about his female classmates or having actual sex causes Voldemort pain."

The only one I can come up with offhand that's anything like this (other than The Connection Reversed, which has already been mentioned) is linkffn(The Fair by The Blind Dragon).
