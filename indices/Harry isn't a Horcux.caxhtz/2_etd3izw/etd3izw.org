Not a Horcrux:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): James and Lily escaped.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were much better prepared.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Non magical AU, nice Harry/Ginny romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort AU, Bellatrix is a cynical Auror/detective and gets together with Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Voldemort used something different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Harry not being a Horcrux actually made their task a lot more difficult.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald rejected Dumbledore's theory that Harry was a Horcrux, and he turned out to be right.
