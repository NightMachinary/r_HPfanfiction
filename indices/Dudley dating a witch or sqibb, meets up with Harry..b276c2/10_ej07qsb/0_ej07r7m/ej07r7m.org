  After a year in hiding with wizards, Dudley Dursley isn't the same thug he was when he used to beat up kids on the playground. He's a world champion boxer now, and his life has its own rhythm. But the beautiful French girl at the club throws that rhythm off. Then Harry Potter reappears in his life, and Dudley has to face the world that he had tried so hard to forget.
