Hmm I'm pretty sure you're not mixing stories. There is indeed one where Dudley is with someone from the Wizarding world and indeed is surprised when she learns his cousin is HP. It may be a subplot in a bigger fic though. Not sure anymore but I'm pretty sure it exists. It certainly does remind me of something I read which isn't what was proposed here (that I read too).

EDIT: I'll also add that it's possible that Dudley didn't know his girlfriend was a witch until this encounter. Not sure though.
