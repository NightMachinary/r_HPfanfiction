That's interesting. I'd have thought a Dudley/a Hufflepuff would be far more likely - looking at Cho's boyfriends, she goes more for the good-looking, clever, sporty type. Dudley doesn't seem to be conventionally handsome, and is more beefy than sporty.

Actually, I'd like to see a Dudley/Romilda fic.
