Any division lower than super heavyweight tends to be a lot leaner than people think. They're ripped and cut as hell.

I once ran a 5k with Oscar de la Hoya and he did a high 15 low 16. That's blistering fast for anybody not a talented and super competitive distance runner-and in the pack with them. For reference, most of the high schoolers who finished around him that race went on run College track/cross country. Lots of combat sport athletes are absolute beasts of athletes. It's incredibly demanding.

I could definitely see boxers as sporty rather than beefy. Most of them are.
