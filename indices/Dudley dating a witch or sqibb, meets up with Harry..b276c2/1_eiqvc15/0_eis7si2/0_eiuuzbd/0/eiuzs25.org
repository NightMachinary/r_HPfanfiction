I guess, but Dudley was allegedly very obese, and Vernon and Marge are both large boned, on top of being overweight. Even once slimmed down, it's unlikely Dudley would ever have a slender build, the way Harry and Cedric were. During his boxing years, he was as big as ever, just muscle instead of fat. We don't know for sure about Michael's build, but all three were dark, and Dudley was blond. So, he still doesn't seem her type.
