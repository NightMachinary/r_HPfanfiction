It's funny but honestly Recnac Transfaerso and the sequel Flawed Perfection have a very solid Zuko redemption arc for draco, in my opinion. There's even a similar element of confused/conflicted feelings like when Aang asks if he and Zuko could have been friends once. The arc is extremely convincing, and maybe best of all, draco doesn't immediately get the trust of Harry's friends as soon as Harry trusts draco (same way katara takes extra time to trust zuko even after everyone else begins to accept him). For the non-draco elements, recnac transfaerso and flawed perfection are fantastic fics. I have yet to find another fic that matches up to the quality of these, but I'm keeping an eye out.
