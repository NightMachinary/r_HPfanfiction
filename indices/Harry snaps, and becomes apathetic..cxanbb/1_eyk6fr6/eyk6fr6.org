I had an idea for a story like this.

Like after being effectively imprisoned over the summer after the GOF year he just pretty much says F it and stops listening to anyone.

​

Goes to the Ministry Hearing and tells them he's quitting Hogwarts only to have them suddenly back off. Pretty much gives Sirius and the Order the middle finger by staying with the Dursleys. Doesn't go to classes.

​

It's not like they can really do anything to him. They've already effectively locked in up and he's always damn near death.
