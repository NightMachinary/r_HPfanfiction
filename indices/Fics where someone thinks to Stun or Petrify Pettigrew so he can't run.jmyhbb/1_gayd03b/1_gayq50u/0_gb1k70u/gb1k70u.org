Sorry for the delay. Well I thought it was ok but then again "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". I can say it wasn't bad enough for me to delete it from my drive. But I'm pretty tolerant with the stories I read.

Truth is I haven't read it in a while but it is in my updateable folder which means I check every couple of months to see if the author has updated.

My recommendation is to give it a try. You should be able to decide if after a handful of chapters whether you want to continue with it.
