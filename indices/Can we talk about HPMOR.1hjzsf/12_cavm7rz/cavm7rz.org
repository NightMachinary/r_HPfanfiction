Hm, I quite like HPMOR. It's not by any means as good as the original Harry Potter, but I still find it fun. I can certainly sympathize with people finding the preachier bits annoying though. I didn't know too much cognitive psychology going in so I found the "lessons" interesting sometimes, but I can see why they'd be a pain if you weren't interested or just wanted to get on with the story already. There was only one part that really ground on me (the part in which Harry argued with Dumbledore about the exitence of the soul), but I can sort of justify to myself why this would be of plot relevance in a story about Horcruxes.

I think the main thing I enjoy about the story is the way the author sets up "impossible" challenges for his characters and then resolves them without resorting to Deus Ex Machina tactics. I find the main character fairly deep and sympathetic (at least after about chapter 10 or so, when he begins to become aware of how obnoxious he's been and starts trying to change himself); he is obviously not, however, a realistic psychological exploration of an eleven-year-old mind.

One thing I don't like about the story is how the author tends to change canon at random (e.g., putting Lucius Malfoy on the Wizengamot instead of on the Board of Governors, inventing new spells and having them used very frequently) and his tendency to mix in elements from Dungeons and Dragons (which is a much sillier world than Harry Potter, not a more rational one).

The complaints about pacing are not wholly wrong. The bully-fighting arc in particular is a bit pointless and unnecessary (I think the author himself has admitted this) but since then the pace has picked up again and the story does seem finally to be heading towards a conclusion.
