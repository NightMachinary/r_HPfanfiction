I read it a few months ago (is it over yet?)

My main issue was that it went on for a LONG time, without resolving anything. I loved the experiments, and the analysis of the supremely weird Potterverse.

I don't remember my specific objections, although I wrote some other reddit comment a while back, but it was basically "here is a list of over a dozen mysteries and plot points that haven't been resolved, yet still more are being introduced and it's not even Christmas yet!"

When it's all over and done, I'll go give it a read.
