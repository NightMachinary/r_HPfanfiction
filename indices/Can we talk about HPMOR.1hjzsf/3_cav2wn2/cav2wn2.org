I found it intensely boring, clinical, and unbelievable from the get go. It feels very much as if the author hasn't ever work with children or has any experiences with gifted children/people.

However, what irks me most is that the characters are so bland in a sort of intelligence > personality way, and are used as mouth pieces for the author, mixed into that those who don't display a certain type of intelligence or ambition are written as lesser beings.
