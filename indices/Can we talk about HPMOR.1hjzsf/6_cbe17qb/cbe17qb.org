As an MoR reader... I really liked the commonsense and parody approaches taken initially. I liked the intelligence and craftiness in the middle. As we've gotten towards the end, I'm just kinda pissed off that nothing is ever getting revealed and Rational!Harry has gotten more and more overpowered when I thought the author was better than that.

If you enjoyed the early humor, have you already read /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/? My girlfriend said it was much more fun than MoR.
