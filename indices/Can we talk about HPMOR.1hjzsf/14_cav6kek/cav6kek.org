I think that the author of HPMOR has failed to recognize that he has failed to make an engrossing plot in his work.

The appeal of HPMOR is its humor and its philosophy. I think that the author could have made HPMOR with an engrossing plot, but he would have had to give up most of the humor (he's not good enough for all 3, and he wouldn't give up the philosophy).
