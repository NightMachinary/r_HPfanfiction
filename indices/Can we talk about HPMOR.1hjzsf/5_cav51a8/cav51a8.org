I enjoyed it - yes the focus is split between story and ideology in a way. But that's because here ideological motivations are the primary driving force behind all the major characters - which is frankly a fresh take on a fandom where the poorly described hormonal reactions and a rather stale conflict was the established norm for character development.

The strength of the story is how cathartic it is for people like myself - I despise poorly developed magic/rule systems and this aspect of HP world has always annoyed me even as others drew me in. HPMOR does a grand job of poking fun at trying to live in a world that makes no sense in its first chapters.

It also helps that there are a lot of shout-outs and fandom inserts from other popular fantasy and sci-fi works which warm the heart of geeks like me. For people who haven't spent 20 years reading those genres, a lot of that is going to fall flat.

The ages used are a major problem - perhaps it's just that I personally don't know any child prodigies. Than again - Hermione was believable to me. She is much more advanced compared to canon, but the story got there naturally for her character based on the fact that other main characters provided a stimulating environment for her. Draco and Harry are entirely OC but if I can believe that a 12 year old Herminone can behave/think/talk like that if she was properly challenged, than I can believe in 2 more genius kids. My biggest problem is the amount of books Harry supposedly read and the sciences he studied by 11. The author screwed up in this respect - it would have been more believable if all of this learning was still going on rather than being established at the beginning.

Frankly, the biggest problem for me is the soapbox against bullying that overshadowed Terry Goodkind in its anvil dropping. It quickly made me want to cheer on the "bullies", just because of how the author pushed his spiel on the topic. That and the author has clearly made them the underdog.

The sad part is that the author has split himself up so much and lost steam on the story. For me, the magic of that story has withered and died. I remember I once seriously considered doing cartwheels at news of an update. Now... "meh, a few crumbs don't make a meal".

EDIT: Crap I was wrong - I am still seriously obsessed with this story. I just read a few paragraphs of the chapter 87 and am already in that obsessive zone...

I think it's the immersion factor for people. I mean I read a scene from this story like this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Hermione," Harry said seriously, as he started to dig down into the red-velvet pouch again, "don't punish yourself when a bright idea doesn't work out. You've got to go through a lot of flawed ideas to find one that might work. And if you send your brain negative feedback by frowning when you think of a flawed idea, instead of realizing that idea-suggesting is good behavior by your brain to be encouraged, pretty soon you won't think of any ideas at all." Harry put down two heart-shaped chocolates beside the book. "Here, have another chocolate. Besides the one from earlier, I mean. This one is to reinforce your brain for generating a good candidate strategy."
#+end_quote

And to me that's hilarious. To another person, that might be just a flat joke - similar to petting someone on the head to lightly make fun of them. But to me - I know that this particular Harry actually does think like that. He is not joking when giving her the chocolate. And when I imagine all the potential hilarity of a boy who actually thinks like that trying to go through puberty and relate to a girl - that "potential" is just as hilarious to me as the ridiculous but entirely pragmatic scene that generated these thoughts.

For me, that's what makes this story great.
