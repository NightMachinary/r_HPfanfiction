Was that actually the author's intent, to make Harry deliberately unrealistic? Because that seems like an odd goal, but perhaps he had his reasons.

See, yeah, but not only is Harry unrealistic, McGonagall (and many others) are also unrealistic. Harry kind of seems like a Mary Sue (but male), with hastily written-in flaws.
