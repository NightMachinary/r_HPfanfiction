HPMOR!Hermione is supposed to be a realistic child prodigy. Best guess says that HPMOR!Harry /is/ Voldemort's horcrux, a copy of the adult genius Tom Riddle who's undergone childhood amnesia, lost all his memories, and been re-raised in a loving environment with mixed effects. He is not /supposed/ to be a realistic eleven-year-old and everyone in the story remarks on this, e.g. Professor McGonagall "Sometimes you just don't seem eleven years old or even all that /human/" in Ch. 6.
