I have experience with being a gifted kid, though obviously not prodigal. The short of it is - we're not like that. We're more like Hermione, soaking up knowledge and making intuitive leaps. Not really like Harry.

In response to your edit: I /hate/ that. I /hate/ that Harry, who's the same age as Hermione, is presented as this sort of godly, all-knowing figure that lectures her and gives her patronizing advice which she obediently accepts because she can tell he's so much better than her. No. Fuck that. Question him! Do things on your own! This is not realistic in the slightest.

Sorry. Arrogant people, I despise.
