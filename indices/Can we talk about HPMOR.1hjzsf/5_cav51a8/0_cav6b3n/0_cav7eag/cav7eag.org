About for gifted kids - Harry is not set up as simply "gifted" in this story. I view Harry in this story as someone from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_child_prodigies][the prodigy list]]. HPMOR made me look that up somewhere around the 30th chapter. This fictional too-adult Harry Potter, wouldn't actually stand out on that list of real people like Gabriel See. That helped me get over my misgivings about these kids being too-adult. If HP in this story is a prodigy by the standards of our world, which I know is actually possible as there have been many kids like him, than it would make sense that gifted kids who have to interact with a prodigy would profit from constantly engaging with him. Because kids do that. So the characters don't come off as too adult for me, giving the premise of the story (being centred around a prodigy)

about the edit: In this particular situation he does not come off as patronizing. Anyone else probably would, but he clearly explains the basis for his advice. It rather left me with an impression that if he was the one to first jump on that theory, he too would have given himself a chocolate.

As for Hermione's reaction - she actually handled it with greater maturity. It is one thing if there was an obvious hole in his reasoning (perhaps there is, but I haven't seen it so to me it is reasonable). Since I, as the reader can't find the fault in his reasoning, it becomes acceptable to me that Hermione can't do so on the spot. Questioning just to contradict is just plain petty. Unless you see a very obvious error in what Harry has said. Avoiding him - that would be even worse. First it would be cowardly - she can't "measure up" at this point in time so she should run away? Second, it would hurt his feelings, and it would be rather selfish of her to do that just so she can deal with her supposed inferiority complex better.
