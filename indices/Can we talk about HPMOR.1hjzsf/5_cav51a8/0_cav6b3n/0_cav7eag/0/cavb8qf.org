Yeah, having worked with 'prodigy' and more often gifted children. They don't act like adults, they act like very smart kids, and this is usually because they are gifted in a particular field. They often have very little social skills (cant understand why someone would forget something or not understand something they find simple) and get angry and massively frustrated, and devote a lot of their time one subject, learning all of it and moving on.

They rarely plan what they learn, and are primarily motivated by whimsy and obsession. But again, socially and emotionally, very underdeveloped. I would suggest that being isolated is part of this. However, Harry isnt like this at all, he's an adult in a child's body and its very frustrating to read.
