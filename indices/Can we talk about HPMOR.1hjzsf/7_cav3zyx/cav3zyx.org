It's been ages since I followed this story, but my memory matches the OP's take on things. It's basically an /Atlas Shrugged/-esque pill for delivering the author's philosophical drug of choice, and while the writing is not bad (he can string together grammatically correct sentences and his humor /is/ occasionally delivered well), it's also not particularly good, with inconsistent characterization and tone as well as a sense of disdain for HP canon, often appearing to treat the source material as if it were beneath him. Granted, it's fanfiction, so I don't exactly expect Hemingway, though one might wish that the purportedly most popular fanfiction story in the fandom were put together a bit better.

To be honest, much of my dislike for MOR stems from the distasteful antics of the author, whose checkered past includes several bouts of trolling fanfiction discussion sites, review whoring and hostage taking, a thin skin with respect to criticism (witness the various wiki wars in which he's participated), and a thousand and one different schemes to try to make a pile of money off what will always remain a derivative work. Even if the story were without flaw, I doubt I would be able to enjoy it because my feelings for the author would bleed through. I have the same problem reading Bret Easton Ellis.
