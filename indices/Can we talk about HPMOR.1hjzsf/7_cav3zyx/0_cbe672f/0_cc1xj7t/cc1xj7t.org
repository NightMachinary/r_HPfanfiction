The guy claimed his version of HP was more valid than JKR's and that her characters, setting, and plot were his intellectual property, not hers? And then he wanted to be paid for making what he considered a superior product. Donate to an amateur-hour faux-Institute which employs, as far as anyone can tell, only him (he of the self-claimed credentials) or he won't release any further chapters?

Yeah, get-rich-quick scam.
