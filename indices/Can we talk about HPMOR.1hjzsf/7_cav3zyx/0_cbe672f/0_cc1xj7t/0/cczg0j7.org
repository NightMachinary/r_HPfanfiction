Um, everything you said in that comment is factually false. He said that JKR owns all the IP, but is fine with fan fiction as long money is not made from it. He stated that anyone is free to use his writing in any way, because it would be hypocritical to make a derivative work and object to others doing the same to his. He stated that HPMOR is for adults, while JKR wrote children's books and writing for children is more difficult. He never threatened to stop releasing chapters. He made an offer to write much more quickly if a certain amount of money was donated by a certain date but the donations came no where close to reaching the goal.

It's fine if you don't like HPMOR or the author but at least do it for a true reason.
