I absolutely love some parts of this story. I read pretty far into it the first time around before growing super super tired of it. I have a word document with quotes from it that I adore, because I love the authors writing style and some descriptions ar just spot on. Almost a year after I tried and failed to read it, I tried again, and enjoyed it the same way for even fewer chapters. It just doesn't make sense. It's too unrealistic. It's boring. There's too much science and not enough story, and I love science. It feels like a lot of it is just shoved in there so the author can talk about the topic. I don't know. I wish it was better in the places I find it lacking, because I feel as if I'd really enjoy a story written by the author, but this monstrosity of an oddly dull action-packed tale is not it.
