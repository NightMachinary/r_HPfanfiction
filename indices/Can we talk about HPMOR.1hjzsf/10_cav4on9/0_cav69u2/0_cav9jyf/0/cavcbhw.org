Ah, yeah, I definitely agree. The premise is fantastic, with a Harry raised on science and being as intelligent as Hermione. I also like the Battle Magic idea.

The author definitely describes things in an interesting way, it's just that what's in between - the plot, the dialogue - is not, somehow, living up to its hype.
