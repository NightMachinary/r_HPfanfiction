I found many parts of it to be quite funny. For example the behavior of Harry as a General, and certain descriptions of situations or reactions. A lot of them made me laugh because I thought they were written in an interesting and strange way.

I like the idea of a hyper intellegent Harry, and I identify with a lot of the feelings the character has of not being able to fit in because of being more intellegent than my peers as a child. I think that in HPMOR Harry was made too unrealistically gifted, but I enjoyed it in the early chapters, before I got tired of it.

I love the idea of a Battle Magic class and am very interested in what becomes of Quirrel's character (I've only read up to the part with the Azkaban business, maybe a bit after). I want to know what's going on with him. I really liked reading about the characters and their battles, although the schemes I think we're a bit too complex for first years. But I think it's an awesome concept. Battle Magic. I just sounds so... metal. :)

Also, I think that the author describes scenes and people in an interesting and compelling way. I really liked all of the parts that didn't directly involve Harry doing things that I thought were silly or not reasonable or just plain boring to me (his transfiguration breakthroughs, the entire Azkaban plot line, the patronus...). I found most other parts to be pretty enjoyable. I guess if it was just about an exceptionally smart Harry experiencing the absurdity of the wizarding world and trying to rationalize it with science, while strutting about the school all strange and quirky and trying to change Draco and doing Battle Magic, I'd have no complaints. Haha.

I hope that explained what you wanted to know. I seem to have an interesting ability to say way too much and also manage to not say anything at all. Haha. I hope it's coherent. :)
