I concur. I read everything that was available, I think 83 chapters or some such many months ago, and it was okay. But when I went back to catch up when some updates came out, I just couldn't enjoy what little story there was.

Not a single plot point was resolved in 83 chapters and considering the author intends to finish the whole series in one work, I dunno man.

As to the unrealisticness, that's not a huge issue. I mean I'm reading a story where Harry has five wives at the tender age of 16. That's damn ridiculous, and I know it. However it's amusing and engaging so it trumps clinical writing any day, you know?
