I know what you mean, I've read and enjoyed way more unrealistic stories. I should have elaborated on that a bit- I don't like that no one has even had theories on or experimented with combining science and magic. There are plenty of Muggleborns and Halfbloods, and wizards are capable of learning about muggle things. But honestly I thats something I find weird in canon, too. I mean, why are they not even aware of Muggle things? It seems like someone would realistically try to use their knowledge of one world to better succeed in the other. I know that they are a secluded culture, but it just seems too severe. And as far as HPMOR is concerned, it goes from Harry being very very intelligent, to making everyone else seem absolutely lacking. You know what I mean?
