MoR was one of the first fanfics I read, and I find that the more fanfic I read, the less I appreciate MoR. It is pretty obvious to me that the author, brilliant though he may be in the realm of thought processes, has no clear direction for his story to go. Its been over 80 chapters and its still in the first year. I'll always have some affection for the story for introducing me to the world of fanfiction, but it is outrageously overrated.
