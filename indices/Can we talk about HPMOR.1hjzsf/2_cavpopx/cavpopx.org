I find it hilarious and awesome - the level of depth, nuance and complexity in the plot is quite incredible - but I don't relate to any of the characters (even though a lot of them are quite realistic) and didn't get terribly emotionally invested in it (the recent big development didn't draw that strong of a reaction from me). That depth doesn't transfer to all areas of story telling though. The author is a bit overly dramatic at times and has annoying phrases like "he gazed abstractly."

Harry is totally unrealistic as a character, but I think that has a good reason that will eventually be revealed. He has some flaws that might not seem like flaws because they resemble traits that poor author avatars/Mary Sues have, but is subverted when those actions have actual consequences (see Harry's first interaction with Snape, where he "wins). Hermione and Draco both seem to be realistic, possibly a little stretched in Hermione's case. McGonagall is probably the most frustrating character in how lame the author makes her.

As for soapboxing, yea. He does it. But not all the time. I can't remember exactly where, but there was one conversation between Harry and Dumbledore that had half the fans agreeing with Dumbledore and half agreeing with Harry. (the number that seems to be coming to mind is chapter 77?)

The Stanford Prison Experiment plot line was annoying because there is pretty much no reason for Harry to do such an insanely risky thing. He doesn't even know /why/ Quirrell wants to do it. Harry's risk seeking personality makes him incredibly unrelatable to me.

I wish he had written in an original world rather than abusing the HP verse so much. I think the story would be much more suitable if the characters were at /least/ 16 years old.

That said, the plot is magnificent (other than TSPE).
