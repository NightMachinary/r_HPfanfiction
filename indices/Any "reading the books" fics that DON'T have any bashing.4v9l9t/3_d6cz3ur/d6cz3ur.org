I don't remember the titles, but there have been some good ones where Umbridge gets her hands on copies of the series and decides to read them aloud for the entire school, as well as some key Ministry people, and it sort of backfires on her. They really don't have much more bashing of Umbridge or the Ministry than canon does, and even for the good characters, we get to see how other characters react to the actions taken in the books, or how Harry and friends have changed and grown by their responses to their own actions in earlier years.
