One of the very best one's I've ever read, it hasn't been updated in a while but the author normally does take quite a while anyway so I I'm hopeful. It's a fem!Harry take, but it's actually really well done.

I also know for a fact that some other sites like Quotev and Archive Of Our Own have some but they still don't beat 'Cris Potter's Life".
