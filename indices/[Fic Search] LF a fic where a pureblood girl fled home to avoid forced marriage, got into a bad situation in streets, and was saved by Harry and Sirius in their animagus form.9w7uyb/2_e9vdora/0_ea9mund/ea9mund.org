Okay I was extremely bored. I know the time of last update, and now HP/DG thanks to you. Added a word count filter, and found it without much difficulty. It's called [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9246516/1][Someone to Love]], so I was wrong about the name. And btw, you were right about the divebombing thing.
