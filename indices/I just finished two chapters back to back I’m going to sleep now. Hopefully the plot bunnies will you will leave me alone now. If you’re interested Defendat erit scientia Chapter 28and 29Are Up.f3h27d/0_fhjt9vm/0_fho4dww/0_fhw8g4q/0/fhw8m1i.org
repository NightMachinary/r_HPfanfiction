I feel you, no one really has enough free time. I suggest getting a friend to read over it and correct some stuff. I know i have issues when i write of just assuming the meaning of passages that arent actually that clear? just have someone else read through it if you can find someone. Its alot of work to write a good story, which is why so much fanfaction is trash.
