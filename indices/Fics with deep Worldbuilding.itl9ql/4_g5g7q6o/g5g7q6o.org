How about "Orders of Magnitude" which is a prequel/wrapper to HPMOR, going all the way back to Merlin's era, having some rather nice scenes set in 16th century Hogwarts, and going to 1000s of years in the future. I haven't read the whole thing; warning: I've heard that the ending is a let-down, but the parts I've read are good if a little disjointed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11840345/1/HPMOR-Setting-Primer]] is a quick explanation if the differences between the HPMOR universe and the regular HP one. I don't know whether HPMOR itself counts as deep worldbuilding but it does get into why some things are how they are.
