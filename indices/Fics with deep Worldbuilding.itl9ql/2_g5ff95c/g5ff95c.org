*Alexandra Quick* has some of the best worldbuilding I've seen in all of fanfiction, because it's set in a non-canon version of the States. But the way the society is set up makes so much sense, and best of all, it's super American, enough that Americana is the first genre that comes to mind when I think of it.

For magical worldbuilding, try *NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series* (not Vekin87's) and *The Phoenix and the Serpent* by Sanction. They're both spectacular AUs.

*The Pureblood Pretense* does everything really well, and its alternate universe is based on the unique premise in which Tom Riddle does not make a horcrux and become Voldemort, but instead becomes the Wizarding World's Mitch McConnell.

I also like the worldbuilding in *Pendant of Slytherin*, *Guardian of Azkaban*, and *A Second Chance at Life*, although those three aren't of the same quality as the first four.

EDIT: in terms of darkness, nothing I listed is super dark or super light, Alexandra Quick and Phoenix and the Serpent are probably on the darker side though.
