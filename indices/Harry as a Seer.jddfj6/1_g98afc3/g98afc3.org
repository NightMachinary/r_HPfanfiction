linkao3(The Emperor and the Star by wynnebat)

one of my favourite seer!harry fics. highly recommend for something light-hearted with some angst

linkao3(End without Sorrow by Aerlinniel)

unfortunately abandoned but I thought I'd link it anyway cause it is one of absolute favourites. goes deeper into divination theory

linkao3(Resurrection by Spork_in_the_Road)

in this one Harry isn't a seer but he does have a sort premonition/deja vu due to being resurrected. Might not fit your request but I'll recommend it anyway cause it's very well-written.

linkao3(Special Gifts by oldenuf2nb)

read this one years ago. It has a very interesting premise but the romance kind of dragged it down for me, also I'm not really a huge fan of clich√© drarry so maybe it's just that but maybe you'll like it. Also Harry is more of a medium than a seer.

linkao3(false prophets by tannintele)

This one is very eerie and dark but also kind of gorgeous. Harry is more of a clairvoyant instead of a seer so skip this one if you don't want that

linkao3(what happens to the heart by mossycoat)

Harry starts working for a seer and she trains him to be her apprentice. Mostly a romantic drarry story though with some angst.

EDIT: for some reason the fanfictionbot screwed up on the last one. here is the real link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25747555]]
