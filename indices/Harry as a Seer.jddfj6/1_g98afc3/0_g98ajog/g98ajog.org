  NEWT-level Divination student Harry Potter bullshits his way through a major arcana reading, best friend of the year Tom Riddle offers a marriage of convenience with no ulterior motives at all, and the wizarding world's changing future is much less important than the seventh years' love lives.

  He is the first seer the Potter family has ever had, but is it really as much of a blessing as it appears? Harry knows he has a chance prevent the horrors of the First Wizarding War from ever happening and set things right. Things don't go quite as planned, however, and Harry instead finds himself being part of a larger game with hidden rules. A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired pawn that is trying to survive the war that looms.

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after “dying” in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.

  Harry is clairvoyant; a genuine one, not like that fraud Trelawney or Madam Umbridge, who claims that the dead communicates by writing messages in her cat's litter box. It isn't fun reliving the deaths of strangers, but when the antique shop next door is placed under new management, things get interesting.(Read prequel for context.)
