Hiya! Since you have a lot of world building to do I think there's very little that I can do to help you with, but what I can recommend is watching this video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etNcsShL3F0]] (part1) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib1i-t5rLyQ]] (part 2. 20 minutes total).

It's an old interview with Rowling about the important roles of women in her story, and since your antagonist(s) is/are going to be female, you may be able to draw some inspiration from it. Especially the part where she speaks about Bellatrix. Hope that helps!
