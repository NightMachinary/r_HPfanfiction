We probably need more informations about the AU before making the scenario.\\
First of all, what is the connection between the Dark Lady and one of the character? Is it something like he is her children, of a old enemy like Voldemort and Harry?\\
Then, about the Dark Lady herself, what happened with her? Since she was not Voldemort, your universe could be extremely different. Did she still recruit with Slytherin, another house or all houses? Was Snape among the followers and did he steal become a spy then teacher? Did the Potter survive? Was Sirius Black sent in Azkaban?

For the scenario in itself, I guess it would depend of the characters and their objective. If they have to be "opposed" to the Dark Lady, countering her plans like with Voldemort might work. Something like "there are several spies of her in the Castle, you have to find them before they complete their mission" (Vanishing Cabinet, make an opening in the wards, hell you can even isolate the castle after an incident with No Hogsmead visits and intercepted OWL so the heros have until the hollydays to find them).\\
You could probably still do a Tournament Year, even if you characters are not the Champions. "International Cooperation" is something Dumbledore could come up it even without Voldemort, and having several Foreign Students coming into Hogwarts is an interesting starting point for multiple scenarios (new friends, enemies, romance and intrigues with the Tournament and possible cheating), you could even change the Year so it happens when your characters are older.\\
As a "Secondary story", you can gives a long term objective to one your character or all of them. For example (probably too close to canon to be of use but well), someone being obssessed with the Death of a Loved one and wanting to bring him back, that stumble on the Miror of Erised and later learn about the Hallows and locating them (depending of what happened to Voldemort, or Riddle, you could have the 3 Hallows in Hogwarts at the same time after all).
