I don't know what AU means haha

The Dark Lady is the mother of the main character who is aswell a girl, The Potters are still alive she has no quarrel with them as they aren't major characters, Sirius isn't sent to Azkaban as there is no reason for him to be there.

I do have a year for the Triwizard Tournament and different tasks that will happen and I feel like I want the year of the competitors to travel away from Hogwarts so they go to another school and compete there.
