They are some good events i'll take them into consideration, I think its going to take me so long to figure stuff and I really don't want to follow, the events from the books and movies I want them to be different because I don't want my players to know how to do stuff I want them to actually think about stuff and come up with it if that makes sense?

Well he isn't long term he's the DADA for the first two years, I do have other people as the DADA later on in each year except for the year where the Triwizard Tournament will happen as they won't be in Hogwarts they'll be in another school.
