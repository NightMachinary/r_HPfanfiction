I see, in that case of path of events you could do could be the discovery of MC mother. It could be something like :

- 1st confrontation with a low level follower of Dark Lady. It could be the Philosopher Stone or something similar. The artifact in itself is not really important since the point is that there is an artifact hidden in Hogwarts and that someone want to steal it. Also the whole "challenges" associated with teacher would be interesting from a player point of view. If PS too "cliche", you can just change the artifact (hell since Riddle is not Voldemort, maybe something about Ravenclaw diadem being found and dark Lady thinking about using it so she sends a follower, but since it's just one idea among others she doesn't send a too high ranked one). So Mc has a first fight with Dark Lady follower who just treat her as an enemy and try to kill her, only to fail and be caught or managing to flee (then punished way harsher than normal by Dark Lady).
- 2nd confrontation: with a true Inner Circle this time. The guy can be here for any reason (assassinate someone, getting informations, anything) who, this time, see ressemblance between Dark Lady and Mc and let her escape or at least leave some hints.
- 3rd confrontation: with Dark Lady who says her she is the mother (Dun Dun Dun). This one is hard because the only 2 ways for MC to be "kidnapped" and confronted by Dark Lady I can see are either totally random (someone throw a portkey at her while she is out of Hogwart's protection, while a Hogsmeade visit or during summer), or follow canon (tournament, she is in because why not, cup is a portkey).

Also another question, since Snape is the long term Defense teacher into your AU, how do you plan to introduce a new "opponent" if your scenario goes on several years. Rowling used the cursed position to introduce a new character each year that was always connected to plot and always put Harry in danger.
