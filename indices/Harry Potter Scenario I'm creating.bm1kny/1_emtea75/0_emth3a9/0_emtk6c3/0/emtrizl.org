Ahh okay fair enough

The thing with the Dark Lady and the MC is that the MC has no idea that her mother is the villain for the moment she only knows that her family she was living with is not actually her family as her family has been under the Imperius Curse for several years.

It looks like for the moment McGonagall is like her mentor I guess but I'm not too sure.

As for Tom Riddle, he isn't the DADA Teacher yet Snape has been for the last few years with Slughorn being the Potions Teacher, he never opened the Chamber and I would say she wouldn't be alive but to be honest I have no idea haha. I'm just trying to figure out the major events during the school years and their connections to the Dark Lady.
