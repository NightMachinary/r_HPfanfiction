AU means Another Universe, it used in fanfic when the world is really different from canon (like in your scenario since the Potters live and Harry is not the BWL).

Since the Main Character is the daughter of the Dark Lady, the 2 most obvious scenarios are :

- MC is estranged from his mother and is "good". Dark Lady wants her (either to have her heir or for something more sinister like using her for a dark ritual or wanting to possess her body . . .) and each year (or story) are the heros fighting her last plot.
- MC is with her mother, spends the first year just making connections and dodging suspicions, then is a kind of spy inside the school accomplishing mission while stile trying to maintain her cover.

​

I don't really know if roleplay has the same "rules" than fics, so I'm not sure for the rest. But it's comon for the MC to have a mentor to guide him (monomyth), with a "good" MC, Dumbledore is there and ready (doesn't have a Harry Potter to discuss with after all), but other character can play this role, like the Head Of Houses. If the character is "dark", the Dark Lady herself can do it if they have good relations or pretty much any lieutenant of her.

​

Now there is something I'm curious about: What about Tom Riddle? If he didn't become Voldemort is he the Defense Teacher? Or did he do something else? Did he ever opened the Chamber or is Myrtle alive?
