The main things I want to get figured out would be like stuff kind of like Chamber of Secrets like those kind of major events and a way to kill the main villain and I don't want it to be Horcrux's because its been used, and I don't want to have the major things to be like the books and movies because thats boring to me and the players would know all about it and how to complete it and research where as if its something different they actually have to properly think and act like their characters if that makes sense and if it helps you with coming up with some ideas I can send you the word document with what I have down for the years?
