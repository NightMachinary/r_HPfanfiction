Setting aside the somewhat over-the-top nature of your requests, there are some that will fit your request:

- linkffn(The Lie I've Lived): good chance you read this one, but six champions compete for it in many more tasks. As a teaser, at one point Harry rides through an obstacle course on the back of a rhinocerous.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Zodiac Charms): this one is a bit of a slog to get to fourth year, but in this case there are 12 schools from all over Europe competing in five tasks. Things are much more epic in scale, such that the first task is a survival match in the Forbidden Forest on Halloween.
- linkffn(Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond): this may seem obscure and an odd choice, but the over-the-topness of the tasks is pretty breathtaking. Bonus: a fantastically hilarious Dumbledore.
- linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise): this one didn't get far, but the scale of the first task is certainly a memorable read (if only for all the monsters invovled).
- linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): a long Voldemort AU, but at one point they have to go hunt down and kill a dragon. It goes exactly as well as you might expect.
