If you don't mind slash, check out Fate is a four letter word by Philo on ao3. I know I am recommending this fic over and over. But after finishing it, I could not read fanfiction or other published paperbacks for weeks bc the story is just that good.

It is about a 40+ Harry with almost adult kids. He is a carpenter, Ron is an Auror and Hermione is a public prosecutor. James, Al and Rose have graduated, but Lily and Hugo are still at Hogwarts.

To outsiders Harry and Ginny are happily married. Then Ginny gets murdered and things start crashing down. It soon becomes clear that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life. To the ministry it looks like an open and shut case of a love gone wrong, but Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives. They must now work to catch Ginny's killer and prevent the uprising of another pureblood supremacist movement, all while not knowing who is friend or foe.

It is an awesome who-dun-it with plenty of plot twists that keeps you on the edge until the end. But more important is the portrayal of Harry as a real adult with real adult problems, juggling the demands and needs of his moody teenage kids (especially James') vs his own needs for love and affection and his self-imposed responsibilities to the wizarding world as a whole.
