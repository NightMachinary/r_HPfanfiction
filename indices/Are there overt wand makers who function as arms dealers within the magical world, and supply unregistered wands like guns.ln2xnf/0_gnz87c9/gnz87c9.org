"Of all the wands in the vast arsenal of Gregorovitch, nothing was more profitable Voyennaya Palka model of 1947. More commonly known as the VP-47, or Palka. It's the world's most popular war wand. A wand all hit-wizards love. An elegantly simple 12 inch amalgamation of ebony wood and dragon heartstrings. It doesn't break or misfire. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do."
