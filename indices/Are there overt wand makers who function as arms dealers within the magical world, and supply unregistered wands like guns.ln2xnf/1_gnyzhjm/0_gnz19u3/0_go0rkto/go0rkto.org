Agree with the secrecy of wand makers, hence Olivander getting kidnapped and Gregorovitch being killed.

Since wands are so integral to the lives of wizards and witches, tracking the wand seems like it would be a really big deal in terms of controlling/tracking the population. The tracking could function similarly to how mobile phone data is monitored.

Lastly, I've read several fics where Harry or Sirius go to Knockturn Alley to obtain a wand that can't be traced. It always proves critical in giving them more freedom.
