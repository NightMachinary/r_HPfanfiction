IIRC, the Elder Wand is noted for being disloyal - I'm not entirely sure I'd count that as a bond. It's also supposedly a special case above other wands (not counting the Myth, just the functioning of the wand), so I'm not certain how it'd apply to regular wands if it did count as a bond. Good point though - my doubt aside, I had forgotten about that.

Whether the pieces count is an interesting question though - Hagrid could technically still cast through a broken wand with his umbrella, right? It'd be interesting to know if a wand 'died' when it got broken or just became technically unusable without some retooling. Like removing all the buttons and controls from a machine.

Important answers for this though - if the Elder Wand doesn't count and the pieces don't either, then Harry still only has one wand-bond - Draco's.
