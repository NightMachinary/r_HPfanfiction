I'm afraid to suggest "For Love of Magic" because it has a REALLY bad rep in this subreddit, with cause, but its smut heavy and has a fairly unique plot.

Of my suggestions, my favourite is Eclipse of the Sky, but while it has a few sex scenes, I wouldn't call them exactly smut. Its graphic but not explicit. I don't think there's even a "cock, pussy, clit" written on the whole fic, but its fairly steamy. For more smut but still with plot, In case of emergence and Ask Lavender would be your best bet.
