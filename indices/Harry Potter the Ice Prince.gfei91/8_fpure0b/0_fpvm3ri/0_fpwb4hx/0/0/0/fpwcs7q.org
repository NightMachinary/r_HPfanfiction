I'm don't think I'm better than you, nor am I trying to make you do anything. The way in which you're writing is incorrect, but it's your right to be so, if you so choose. I just wish you'd stop presenting it like some sort of alternative style when it is, in fact, just wrong.

* edit because I'm a dumbass: I was on mobile and my phone likes to make assumptions about what I /mean/ to type regardless of what I /actually/ type. The result was an unironic homonym in a comment complaining about someone misusing the English language. Y'know, as ya do.
