Harry's friendly with his dorm mates and the quidditch team(and later the DA). He speaks casually with several other students than Ron and Hermione. He turns down Draco because Draco is a massive dick. There's no indication that he's anything other than well liked(excluding of course, second, fourth and fifth year, through circumstances not of his own making). He just keeps a close circle. Nothing in canon supports him being in oblivious to social cues, if you discount Cho, who was being very difficult.
