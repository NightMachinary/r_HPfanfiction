But yes, the Alexandra Quick series is a series of novel-length fics which follow a cast of entirely OC's as they attend Charmbridge Academy, an American wizarding school. The books are very well written and have probably the best depiction of Wizarding America in existence.

Currently 4/7 books have been completed, with Book 5 seemingly just a few months away.
