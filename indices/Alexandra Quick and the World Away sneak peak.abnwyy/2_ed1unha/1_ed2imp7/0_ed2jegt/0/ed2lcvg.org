I second this.. I've reread aq just short time ago and there are some amazing and funny parts, that you won't notice in the first read because you don't have enough information. This one is my favourite:

“Why did you do this?” Alexandra asked.

Ms. Grimm eyed her appraisingly. “I thought you deserved to meet your sister.”

“Like hell.” Alexandra clenched her teeth. “Are you going to take me home now, or is there another sister you want to take me to see and mess up her life?”

Diana Grimm stood there for a long, thoughtful moment, but said only, “I believe it's time for you to go home.”
