Alexandra Quick is the greatest Harry Potter fan fiction I have ever read. It was also one of my first(I read his Hogwarts story first - strangely enough, I find it as lackluster as the other Hogwarts stories on this sub, doesn't compare to his AQ). I wish anything came even close. Maybe it's the writing style, and the author is certainly extremely talented, which makes him seem legitimate in a sea of amateurs compared to many other fics. Or maybe it's the fact that literally the only two things linking this to canon are one or two sentences in which Voldemort is mentioned, and the Rowling magic. This could easily have been a stand alone published novel, had it been allowed to sell books in Rowling's universe, and it would have done very well.

All that being said, I'm not sure I want to torture myself by reading just one chapter. Perhaps I'll wait until he posts all of it. It's certainly great that it's coming.

If the author ever publishes original work, I am sure it will be just as great, if not better. If he's reading this, I encourage him to do it. I suspect he'd have a lot of success. I've read a lot of popular original novels that were far less interesting and enjoyable than Alexandra Quick.
