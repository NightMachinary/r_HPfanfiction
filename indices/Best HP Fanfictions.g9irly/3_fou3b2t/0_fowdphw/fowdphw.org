Not the OP. I hate the cliche, bad tropes as much as any other avg reader. I just find it hard to digest fem!harry. Canon Harry is a guy through and through. How he behaves, his friendship with Ron, the camaraderie he has , his interaction with girls. The books would have been truly different if it was fem!harry. There is a scene where Harry and Ron talk abt Ginny and Hermione , that scene is so hilariously true because that is pretty much the most you talk abt to other guy about the girl you like. Also when he is going to give himself up to Voldemort he conjures up his loved ones using the stone and he asks one thing “does dying hurt” . That is such a guy thing. I mean you want to say so much and ask them so much but you have to tough it out till the end so that one question sums up all your emotions if you're a guy. Just as there are something's intrinsic to women, there are something's intrinsic to men. And Harry checks all those boxes.
