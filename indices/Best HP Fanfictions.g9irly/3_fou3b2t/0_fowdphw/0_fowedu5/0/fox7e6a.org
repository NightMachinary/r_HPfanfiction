  I just can't /imagine/ Harry as a girl.

Which is exactly the point, isn't it? What if this manly Harry suddenly wasn't the one? That's for the gender-bended!Harry.

Harriet-was-always-a-girl is very AU, I agree, and the author just has to write completely new universe (unless it is a porn, and she just want to get Harry to bed with Draco/Snape). linkffn(The Videus Charm by OfPensandSwords) is not completely horrific, because the author just gave up on the romance. linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) just makes completely new universe and so far it does pretty reasonable job about it (slightly too much failing into the dreaded Viscounts-and-Heiresses junk, but it has nothing to do with fem!Harry).
