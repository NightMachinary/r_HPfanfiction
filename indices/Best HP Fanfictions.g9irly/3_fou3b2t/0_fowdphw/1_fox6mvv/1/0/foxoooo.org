  But I definitely don't think that magic can change the culmination of experience as a guy which have been hardwired into the mind to think like a girl. It accounts to lazy writing in my opinion if that is how Harry is made fem!harry.

Completely agree. I haven't said that writing fem!Harry is easy and even less that most fem!Harry stories do it well (linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) did half competent job about the transition, and perhaps linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi), except I will never forgive the latter the name and it is just Drarry by other means).
