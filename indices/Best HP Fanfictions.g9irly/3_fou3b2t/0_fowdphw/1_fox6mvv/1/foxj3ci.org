I think that is the question to OP because Lord Hadrian Gryffindor Ravenclaw Slytherin Jesus and tropes just as similar are pretty shit for me too. It's true that fem!harry is AU so it should be treated that way. This is just my personal opinion . I find it very difficult to change Harry's gender. Also I get that magic can change the male body to female . But I definitely don't think that magic can change the culmination of experience as a guy which have been hardwired into the mind to think like a girl. It accounts to lazy writing in my opinion if that is how Harry is made fem!harry.
