Except all fem!Harry stories are AU, right? So, this argument is completely invalid. Moreover, it is exactly the point of fem!Harry (or genderBender!Harry), isn't it? What if this manly guy with all insecurities and fun of being a guy, suddenly finds himself/herself being a girl (sexual preferences and smut put aside: there is no reason why magic while changing reproductive organs couldn't change his mind)? How would he react? How would his friends react? How would his enemies react? These are legitimate questions which could be investigated in a story. And yes, of course, 95 % of all fem!Harry stories are porn (which is no surprise, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's Law]] still holds), but it doesn't invalidate that one or two stories which could be interesting. E.g., I am not completely persuaded that linkffn(Magical Metamorphosis by Eon the Dragon Mage) is the best story ever written (it is /too/ slow), but it seems to me like a honest story written by somebody who knows what he/she is talking about.

But even considering that there is no fem!Harry you would be willing to swallow, my original question still stands: why is this abomination worse (and the only one worthy of mentioning) than Lord Hadrian Peverell-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin, or Ginny-the-goblin-warrior?
