Alrighty time to list my favorites... again plus more

Make A Wish - linkffn(2318355) - Most original thing I have read, and I wish there were more stories like it. Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is original and a good read.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - Most touching fic in my opinion and one that is always going to stay with me.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - I just like this one a lot

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - This one is cute and I like to share it.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - One of the best Harry and Daphne fics out there and has good read and reread quality. Its sequel is just as good.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - A good crossover story that great for killing some time and is very touching and original in its execution.

Inspected by No 13 - linkffn(10485934) - A good fun crack-fic that is well done. One to be shared with others for sure

From Southampton to New York and Beyond - linkffn(12300252) is another great story and the author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass][Dorothea Greengrass]] a good few other interesting stories to read.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A well thought out and interesting world-building story that also delves more into the magical culture.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781) - A great Marvel x Harry Potter crossover that is really well done.

Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion - linkffn(11610805) Is also a good story done by the same other.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - A lovely story about Harry becoming a father.

Sigh, I really have an issue, I read way too much. I hope that you enjoy any of these stories and if you ever want more feel free to PM me for more reccomendations.
