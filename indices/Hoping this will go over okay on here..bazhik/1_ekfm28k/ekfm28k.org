I liked this. If I had randomly clicked on this chapter out of a larger story I would go back and read it from the beginning. I like the idea of Harry forming a larger friend group than Ron and Hermione (especially if it's the "Ministry Six" or whatever you want to call them) and I wish he did that in canon.

That being said, there are a few things I think can be improved on. These are my opinions so take these with a grain of salt.

-Cut down on the thought dialogue. You can show Harry's thought process without spelling out his internal monologue word for word.

-There a few times where you missed a paragraph change when a new character is speaking. Probably just typos, but yeah.

-Neville had a shield Patronus? There has never been a case of anyone having a Patronus that isn't an animal, why would Neville be the one exception?

-I didn't find the ending to be realistic. Sure they took down Umbridge, which /is/ awesome, but they were just tortured and thought they were going to get their souls sucked out by dementors. Most people probably wouldn't be that excited afterward. Also, referring to Umbridge as the Umbitch screams fanon to me, but I know plenty of people like that.

-Umbridge seemed slightly OOC. I don't think Umbridge actually thought Voldemort was back in OOTP, but when it turned out he was she just went with it. She was kinda quoting Voldemort at one point there, the 'there is no good or evil, only power, and those who like to use it.' I don't think that's her thought process. I always thought that Umbridge /thinks/ she's good, and that the authority of the Ministry is good, and by enforcing the will of the Ministry and fighting the scourge of the Mudbloods and Muggles, in her mind it made her a good, upstanding citizen.

-No need for the M rating. The language wasn't that bad, and your story will be more visible if you rate it T since ffnet is going to default to not showing M rated stories unless someone specifically allows it.

But yeah, I enjoyed this and would read it if it was a full length story.
