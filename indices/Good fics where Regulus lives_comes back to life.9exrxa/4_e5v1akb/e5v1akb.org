Hold my cup.

This is my list of Regulus Black stories. They also consist of Black Brothers fics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under there account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10627003/1/Tempting-Fate][Tempting Fate]] by GoldenFinches This is one of my favorites.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] by Tsume Yuki. This one is an AU where Harry time traveled and reborn as Sirius and Regulus' older brother. It's surprisingly a good story.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] by cywscross. The summary for this one: "Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well."

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11266645/1/Blood-of-Thy-Enemy][Blood of Thy Enemy]] by Jenkt5 is where Regulus went into hiding for about sixteen years.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11822457/1/A-Tale-Of-Two-Brothers][A Tale Of Two Brothers]] by riakida. The story has excellent writing and I like the concept where Sirius has to take care of Regulus when their parents passed away earlier.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring but it picks up to be something of an epic later on.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell is slightly slash, but the story itself is well written enough that it isn't overbearing. This is a time travel fic where Harry saved Regulus before he was drowned.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221773/1/Unlocking-Doors][Unlocking Doors]] by LaRadium. I absolutely love this story. The concept is just so original. Basically if Regulus is reborn as a Weasley. In fact he is Ron's twin brother in this story. Definitely worth the read.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/48618][Rewritten in Time]] series by ScotlandEvander. Draco travels back in time to his first year while Atlanta (an OC) travels to Marauders era and fell in love with Regulus (while another her is around Draco age). Fix it series.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12224847/chapters/27770244][Toujours Pur (of Heart)]] by Nillegible I started to tear up when Regulus cried. This story was really a emotional rollercoaster that I had definitely enjoyed. It's short and bittersweet, but had a hopeful ending to it for the brothers.

linkao3(12224847) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12963801/1/The-Good-Brother][The Good Brother]] by ALeighS is an interesting what-if story where instead of Snape being the potion master of Hogwarts, it is Regulus because he defected from the Death Eaters earlier.

linkffn(12963801) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12947527/1/a-new-life][a new life]] by belle parole is very short and definitely should've been a longer story.

linkffn(12947527) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12513801/1/The-Youngest-Black][The Youngest Black]] by nothingcoolavailable is mainly about Regulus' choices and reflection of his childhood and Hogwarts.
