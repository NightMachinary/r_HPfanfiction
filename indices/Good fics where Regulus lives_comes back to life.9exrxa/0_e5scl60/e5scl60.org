I know that there are several, but I can only think of three really well known ones and all are centered on Harry:

/The Art of Self-Fashioning:/ Harry-centric, Neville is BWL, Regulus lived and eventually teams up with Minerva of all people to help Harry. A pretty solid fic, even if my summary makes it seem odd. linkffn(11585823).

/Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is/: MOD Harry reborn as eldest Black brother. A fun fic, nice brotherly relationship with Sirius and Regulus, though Regulus is not the main character. linkffn(10610076).

/Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin:/ one of the most popular WIPs around right now. I think Regulus appears around ch. 90ish or so. linkffn( 11191235).
