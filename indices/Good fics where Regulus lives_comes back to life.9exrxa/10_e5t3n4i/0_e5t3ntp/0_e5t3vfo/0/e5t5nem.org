Call: ffnbot!refresh

Place: reply to the original post that has the ffnbot call you want to redo

Additional tips:

1) you probably should edit the original post, or it will be unlikely that re-calling the bot will do anything different a second time. Most likely you have a spelling error.

2) Alternatively, just change the title in the original call to the full url or the story ID number. Those are more accurate if you have the time to grab them.

3) at the bottom of every ffnbot post there is a "usage" link. Find this info and more there in the future if you need it!

4) once the bot refreshes, you can delete your ffnbot!refresh subcomment if you want and no one will ever know ;)
