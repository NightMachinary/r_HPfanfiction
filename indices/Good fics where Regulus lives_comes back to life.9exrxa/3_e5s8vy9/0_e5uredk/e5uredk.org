Second this rec. What's there is a great story, sad to think it will likely never be finished.

Imo, still well worth the read anyway -- and I don't say that often about (likely) abandoned works.

For for those worried about the bashing mentioned by others: from what I remember, it was minimal. A little exaggeration of character's canon tendencies that lead to some extra fights, but no character was made into a caricature in what's there. Even if you hate the bashing trope, I think you can still read and enjoy this story.
