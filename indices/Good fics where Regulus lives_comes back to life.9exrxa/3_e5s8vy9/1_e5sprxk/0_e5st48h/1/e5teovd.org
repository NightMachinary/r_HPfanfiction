Eh, Sirius's family was at the very least emotionally abusive (the portrait screams about how he's a waste of space, useless, etc.) and it's implied that his parents were the ones who wanted Regulus to join the Dark Lord when he was only 16. If your family is a bunch of emotionally abusive, racist assholes I think it's okay to turn your back on them.

It's definitely Regulus's point of view and it kind of makes it clear that it is his views coloring his memory, especially when it comes to Sirius, but it's textbook bashing when it comes to Hermione. It goes beyond her being bossy, to downright comically intrusive.
