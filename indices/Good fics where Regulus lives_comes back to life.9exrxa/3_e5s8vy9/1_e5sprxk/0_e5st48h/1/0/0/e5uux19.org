We're going to have to agree to disagree.

It does sound like Sirius gave a damn, and the portrait was said to represent Sirius's mother's attitude in real life (e.g. he quips something like how it is a realistic depiction of his mother's attitude, and if someone in real life used to scream at their 11 year old kid that they are worthless and a stain on their honor 24/7, it is emotionally abusive). Remember, his mother disliked him even before he was in Gryffindor, so this didn't start once he was older. Also, parents pressuring a 16 year old like Regulus to join the Death Eaters, a hate group that carried the risk of death, is extremely emotionally abusive.

So I strongly have to disagree on the Black parents not being emotionally abusive to Regulus and Sirius.

Various Black members were blasted off the tree for not being crazy racists, so it's possible Sirius picked up on how dumb blood purity was from Alphard (who left him a sum of money) or Andromeda, (when he saw that she was disowned for marrying a muggleborn).
