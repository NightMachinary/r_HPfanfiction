  the portrait screams about how he's a waste of space, useless
#+end_quote

A portrait, an inanimate object, screaming at someone does not count for emotional abuse. If you're going into assumptions, his mother spent her last days a wreck - one son in prison, and the other missing, presumed dead. That's enough to send anyone round the bend. Also, the house is infested with minor dark creatures and the locket - that could definitely have had an effect on the portraits as well.

  If your family is a bunch of emotionally abusive, racist assholes I think it's okay to turn your back on them.

The emotionally abusive part is a big assumption. All we know is that Sirius hates the place because of their beliefs in blood purity - which is very strange because children generally follow their parents and family without question almost all the time. Where this resistance to blood purity came from is anyone's guess.

It is also never okay for elder brother to allow his younger brother do as he pleases without even trying to dissuade him - and from what Sirius says in canon, he didn't give a damn.
