It isn't exactly bashing per se, it's Regulus' views of those people - and while Sirius has many positives to his character, turning his back on his family, including his younger brother, isn't one of them IMO.

The Lord Potter stuff is pretty minimal and is more to do with his financial estate than anything else - which is perfectly acceptable.
