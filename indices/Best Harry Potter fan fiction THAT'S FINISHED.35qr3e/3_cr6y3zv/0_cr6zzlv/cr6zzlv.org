Wow that is a fairly comprehensive list. Most of the ones I would recommend off the top of my head are either listed or their author is.

On that note I would look at both the silliest ways voldemort dies thread from a few days ago as well as the funny stories with plot from a few days ago. Both are great resources that are fairly up to date.
