I just finished reading this one this morning: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/811088/1/Not-Myself][Not Myself]].

AU started a year before OoTP was published.

  Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard...

~350k words if you remove author responses. Linked novel follows all seven years of Hogwarts, and there are four short sequels.

It's got some minor grammar/spelling problems throughout, but nothing that breaks the story. Handful of original characters, and some characters are quite OOC because of a different (explained) character background.

I really enjoyed it, and with how old the story is, it's really easy for me to not be annoyed by things that may be overused these days.
