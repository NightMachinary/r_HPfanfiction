Oh, I totally agree. Just to me, what the author has labeled as the epilogue fits in more as a final chapter and I would've liked a comprehensive epilogue that shows what the world is like after. The author's note at the end explains that the author had no interest in doing so, which is totally fair, but I wanted it.
