Did the author actually finish writing it? When I read it years ago, it basically "ended" with an author's note saying, "I can't finish writing the story, so here's a synopsis of what was going to happen." I mean, at least I know how the story ended, but it was kind of a cop out.

Edit: typing is hard, guys.
