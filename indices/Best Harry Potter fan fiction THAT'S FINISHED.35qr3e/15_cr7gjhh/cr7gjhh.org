[[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], hands down. It's described as "literally life-changing" over and over again for a reason: /it improves its readers' thinking/ (on purpose, no less) while still being fun to read. It's also epic-length (just over 660k words written over the course of 5 years) and has novel-length completed fanfics of its own, so there's plenty there to read.

Don't let the quality of the first few chapters or the fact that Harry doesn't act like a normal eleven-year-old deter you; the writing improves after the first few chapters and this Harry's not supposed to be a normal child (more like a partly-adult mind in a child's body, really). So take the author's advice (from the note at the start of Chapter 1):

#+begin_quote
  This fic is widely considered to have really hit its stride starting at around Chapter 5. If you still don't like it after Chapter 10, give up.
#+end_quote

Those first 10 chapters are relatively short (covering just up to and including Harry's Sorting) and well worth it to try out the fic. Just don't pick it up too close to when you plan to go to bed, or you might keep yourself up late reading.
