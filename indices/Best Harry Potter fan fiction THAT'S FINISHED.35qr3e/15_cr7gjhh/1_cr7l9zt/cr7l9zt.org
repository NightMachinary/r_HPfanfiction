Yes, yes, yes. For all the hate it gets on this subreddit, HpMoR is probably the single best fanfiction out there. It's fun to read, it is written well, but most importantly - it is educational. You learn something from it. You feel like you gained something. Its a fantastic piece of writing, truly.
