    It's described as "literally life-changing" over and over again for a reason: it improves its readers' thinking (on purpose, no less) while still being fun to read.

  This content was not only impressive from the perspective of an engaging story, but it taught me real, applicable things, and made my mind move in ways it hadn't before. ....

No problem. :)
