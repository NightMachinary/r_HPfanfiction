The [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/dumbledore.html#Skills][HP Lexicon]] indicates that AD spoke Mermish and understood Parseltongue and Gobbledegook. Being an inhabitant of the magical world, we can also infer that he's familiar with Latin. Anything else is strictly fanon.

YMMV, but for me it was so incongruous that I stopped reading. Many other people enjoy it and I'm happy for them.
