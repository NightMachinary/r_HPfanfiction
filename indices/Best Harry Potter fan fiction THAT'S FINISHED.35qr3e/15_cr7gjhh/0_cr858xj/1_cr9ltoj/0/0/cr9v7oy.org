interesting -- is there not a line in canon about how many languages he speaks? I think there is, but I think it might also be hyperbole/exaggeration from Harry or Hermione

The other point is that, obviously, Dumbledore displays knowledge of the languages the plot requires him to, and there's no limiting factor. But yeah

In any case, definitely. Each his own
