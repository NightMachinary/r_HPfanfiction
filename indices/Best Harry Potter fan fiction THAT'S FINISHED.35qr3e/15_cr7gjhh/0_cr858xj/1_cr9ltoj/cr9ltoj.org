that was what did it? an 80 year old witch knowing some hebrew? out of left field, sure, but not a stretch really. dumbledore in canon knows some hundreds of language or whatever it is. don't see why mcgonagall should be stuck with english. especially as most everyone in the story has some sort of intelligence bump.

anyway, i'm not sure what "that's a strong statement" means in this instance, but i'll corroborate the above as an anonymous second opinion -- hpmor certainly has impacted my thinking patterns, and i had fun reading it. it changed my life in a relatively major way.
