Hmm... an interesting question. While there are plenty of good finished fics that I like, all my favourite fics are WIP/abandoned. In my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][fic recommendations document]], for example, the top three are all incomplete.

If I had to pick one, I'd probably pick this one:

Summary: After Sirius's death, Harry devotes himself to learning magic in a desperate attempt to protect the people he loves. Warnings: Profanity, Extreme Violence, References to Non-Con -Not of Main Character-, Dark/Questionable Harry

/A massively underrated fic. Features lots of magical theory, a talented Harry and a fine depiction of magical guerrilla warfare. I think the reason why it's relatively unknown is the slow, and quite angsty start. But once it pulls through the first arc, the fic really comes into its own. Unfortunately the ending was rather abrupt -- it felt like the author closed things prematurely in lieu of abandoning the fic -- but it isn't a deal-breaker./
