[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer after the War]] and it sequel [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters after the War]] - These fics are novel-length, canon-compliant pairing-wise, kind of clich√© in that Harry and Ron are Aurors fighting evil, but have good characterization, a good mystery plot, and some great OCs. The first fics I read and some of the best.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/288347?view_full_work=true][The Rewards of Perseverance]] AU where Voldemort wins, absolutely devastating. Has a sequel as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] - Freaking hilarious, Harry is the laziest bastard to ever come to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] - Sirius breaks out earlier than expected and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. Has one complete novel-length sequel and a third in progress, but even just Innocent by itself is excellent. & FWIW, the WIP is updating currently and regularly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7008836/1/For-Love-of-Family][For Love of Family]] - A somewhat sappy fic where an adult Harry becomes disabled, canon-compliant, has a great mystery subplot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] - Year 7 from the perspective of Hogwarts, mainly Neville. Will rip your heart out, put it back, rinse and repeat. Like Innocent, has one complete novel-length sequel which is...a bit strange, but good, and an incomplete third, but in this case I think the threequel is abandoned. But feel free to skip the sequels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] - AU I guess? Set about a generation after the books in the United States. Has a very well-developed canon and magical culture, and a scrappy protagonist.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]] is an epic at 95 chapters, and worth every minute you spend on it. The author, Little0bird, also has a lot of one-shots, small vignettes, and short stories that fit into the same universe as the main deal. My favourite of these being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3957753/1/Firewhisky-Advice][Firewhisky Advice]]
