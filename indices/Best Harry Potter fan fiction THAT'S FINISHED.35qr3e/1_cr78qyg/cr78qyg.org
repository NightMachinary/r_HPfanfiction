There are others that have been mentioned, so I'll just name those that haven't, and that spring immediately to mind. I've left out oneshots, because I doubt you're interested.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Dissapearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] - simply beautiful elegance in scope of storytelling. All-but perfectly canon-compliant, and one of my favorite fics of all
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity is probably the best next-generation fic around. His Alexandra Quick series is not complete, but individual years are, and some of them (specifically the second one) are good enough to warrant a mention regardless
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by EmeraldAshes - for humor/crack
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure - Delightful worldbuilding, very canon-compliant, but suffers from the flaws of a realistic First-Year fic
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] by Sesc is a great thriller/crime noir novel.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] by MasterSlytherin is also amazing, with a great twist.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella is a canon-perspective story of what went on in Riddle's Diary, and a great thriller

I'll also second Renegade Cause, The Unforgiving Minute and The Skitterleap

There's always more, but that's what comes to mind.
