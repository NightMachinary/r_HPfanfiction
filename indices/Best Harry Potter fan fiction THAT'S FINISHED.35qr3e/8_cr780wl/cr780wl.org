[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is hard to describe. It is finished and it does set up an almost immediately abandoned sequel. It does stand on its own, however. It's not always brilliantly written, but the story and the characters are excellent. It's finished for me, because I imagine the last 500 words differently.

It's also an almost singularly unpleasant story at times, only equaled by [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]]. That one is complete, really good, frequently rage inducing, because it makes you care about the characters so much.

Both of those stories are Harry/Hermione.

Edit: also still the correct answer for everything: “Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them” by evansentranced.
