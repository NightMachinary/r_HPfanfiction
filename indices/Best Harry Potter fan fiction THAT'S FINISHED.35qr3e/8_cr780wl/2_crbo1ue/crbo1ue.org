I've always been a Harry/Hermione fan.

There are some really amazing stories from the LEGACIES series by The Dark Lord Nedved, too the author madscientist's books.

Unsung hero has always been my personal favorite though. Up to the ending i would have paid MeghanReviews. I honestly got choked up with emotion reading it for the first time all those years ago and it was an absolute pleasure with my only regret being i'll never be able to read it for the first time again. I'm yet to find a story as good with Harry/Hermione as the main couple.

I also would have ended the story differently but honestly its an extremely sad tale in my eyes worthy of being mentioned in this thread.
