Harry Potter and the Enemy Within. Mentor!Snape story, has a great Snape and is angsty without being emo. Lots of occlumency if you like that. Sequel is great as well.

Better Angels. Marauder Era AU where Snape becomes James slave. Great characterisation. Love James dad in this fic.

In Blood Only. Snape is Harrys dad, but still hates him. Very angsty, can veer into emo territory, but I still like it, because it's good.

Sita Z has some great fics. Cute, but with a touch of angst. I particularly like:
