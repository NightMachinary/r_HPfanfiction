Omg, based Harry Potter? Exactly what I've been craving since 2017. Stalin was a pretty cool and good dude, he's the reason why we're not all speaking German.

I commend you OP, I tried to make similar posts on here and they always get downvoted to hell. I bet my reply is getting downvoted as you see this.

Anyways, closest we've got right now is HP becomes a communist, a crack fic which is fun and entertaining, but undermines the importance of communism and a revolution against capitalism in general. I can't tell if the Author is a comrade with a good sense of satire, or a radlib who likes OUR memes.

After that, the closest thing are wizarding revolution fics, but I've yet to find one that's explicitly communist, let alone Marxist-Leninist.

I do recall a fic where Draco is given a copy of Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, and organizes with his housemates. He then goes on to break his own wand in opposition to his father, thus becoming a class traitor to the bourgeoisie. I don't recall the name but there was a thread on here a couple months back which you could try and search for. If not try doing a 'What's That Fic?'. It was on Ao3.

Edit: Found it, it's a series and it's a side plot point and one of the later parts I believe, but give it a read for sure, it's a great fic. The Secret Language of Plants on Ao3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]]

Good luck!
