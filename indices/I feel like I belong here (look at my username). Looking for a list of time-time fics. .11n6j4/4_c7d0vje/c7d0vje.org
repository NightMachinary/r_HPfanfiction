Have you read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]? It's a very good long peggy sue fic that's complete (282,000 words), and has an actively updated sequel (59,000 words).

TVTropes has a good fanfic recommendations page with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][Peggy Sue section]].
