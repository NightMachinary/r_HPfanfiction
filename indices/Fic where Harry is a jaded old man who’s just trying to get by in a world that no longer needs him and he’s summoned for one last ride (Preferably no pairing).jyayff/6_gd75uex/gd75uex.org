Ehhhhhhhh I can only think of one.

*Greater Than, Lesser Beb -* linkffn(6389009)\\
Warning: Weasleys and Dumbledore are of the manipulative persuasion.

ANYWHO~ Post-war Harry discovers the manipulations and Ginny tosses some time spell at him. Some interactions occur and Harry ends up in the past in his current body. He's not an old man, but his world was crushed with how everything turned out and recent revelations.

He treats it as the last ride, where he tries to fix EVERYTHING on his own. Society's problems, death eater problems, Voldemort problems, etc.

He treats it as a crusade and throws himself into it. The final battle was pretty neat too.

And this isn't one of those "harry goes into the past and rasies himself". Yeah, he removes Harry from the Dursleys, but he stays his distance.
