I personally find "mundane" to be just as insulting as "muggle" and less stupid than "no-mag". At least, if a muggle overhears a wizard calling them that, they can assume that the wizard finds them boring and leave them alone. If a wizard says "muggle" or "no-mag" around them, I think that it would invite more hostility than "mundane", or worse, questions.

I once toyed with the idea of writing a fic where the word "no-mag" was more of a PC word, used in newspapers and by government officials, and "mundane" was much more widely used.
