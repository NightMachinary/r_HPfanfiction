Mundane is definitely an insult. The first definition of 'mundane' in the Oxford dictionary is:

#+begin_quote
  lacking interest or excitement; dull.
#+end_quote

Now, this might even be true on a general population level: Muggles might be less interesting than Magicals, /however/ it definitely isn't true on an individual level.

Is Nelson Mandela more dull and less exciting than Ministry Clerk #324? Is Usian Bolt less extrodinary than that Hufflepuff we never hear about?

To call people like Albert Einstein, JRR Tolkien, heck - even /myself/ somewhat 'mundane' is simply an insult, because it basically says:

/No matter what you do, 'mundane' person, you will never even be as exciting as the most boring wizard./

And given the examples from canon that is simply an insult.

Muggle however is a 'new word', and while it sounds a bit funny at least it isn't insulting me.
