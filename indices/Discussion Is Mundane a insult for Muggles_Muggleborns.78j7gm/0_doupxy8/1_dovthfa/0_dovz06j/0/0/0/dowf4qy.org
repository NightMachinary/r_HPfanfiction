Eh, you're not really wrong, it does have something of a connotation along the lines of "boring," but mostly only in the context of being compared to something else. For example, someone might call you "a boring person," but they wouldn't call you "a mundane person." However, they might say you're pretty mundane in comparison to Mr. Exciting over there.

So in this case, when comparing a non-magical person with a magical one, since the magical one is arguably more exciting, it seems fairly reasonable to call the non-magical person "mundane." It's more factual than insulting, and certainly less immediately problematic than using a term like "normal." That said, someone could still reasonably take offense.
