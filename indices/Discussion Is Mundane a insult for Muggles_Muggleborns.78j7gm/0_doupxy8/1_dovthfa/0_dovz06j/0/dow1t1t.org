That's actually kind of what I'm trying to say; "mundane" has far more use in pop culture as simply an antonym to magical. It's use to mean boring or dull is almost nonexistent in modern speech, so trying to pin that interpretation of the word in this context seems specious; simultaneously ignoring the words etymology as well as its prevalent modern usage in order to make an argument.
