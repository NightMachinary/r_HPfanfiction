In my understanding, it is about character in-universe phasing out Muggle, so the exact etymology isn't that relevant - but it still is worth looking into.

Either way, a second definition is always heard when saying something, like with donkey / ass. You wouldn't call yourself "The asses", talking unirconically about donkeys and thinking "Yep, no one will notices that you could also see that as arses". Words do have connotations, and "boring" is a definite connotation of "mundane" in modern English, even if it means "of this earthly world".

The next problem is that this implies that magicals might be "heavenly" or have a connection to got, which a lot of Christian people would take offense to. Why is a wizard closer to God than I am?

No matter how you loom at it, it's insulting. If you really want something "less insulting" than Muggle, take "No-Maj" for one example (Although that is also defining a group by a disadvantage and not really PC, yet still less insulting than /mundane/) or better yet: Make up a new word without such problems.

"Sarper" is something that is (as far as I know) meaningless in at least three languages, that one might work for example. But mundane always will always be more insulting that Muggle, in my opinion.

Edit: In general, I dislike that in the current discussion it is often about 'what was literally said' rather than 'what was probably meant' and 'how could this be understood'. Mankind has hundreds of years of experience and history in loading words with more than one meaning, and playing with language, yet we discard that.

The reaoson why you had to write all these text-interpretations in school is because interpreting what a sentence and word can mean in context besides the obvious literal meaning is important in life.

And when we talk about a word like 'mundane' we obviously have to look at multiple contexts. "Mundane plants and animals" is probably fine, but as soon as you start calling individual people mundane it becomes quickly insulting, even if you /meant/ the 2nd definiton.

The first didn't suddenly become invisible, because most of us are able to see more than one meaning of a word at a time.
