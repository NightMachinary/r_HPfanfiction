You bring up a good point.

Calling them "normals" is kinda insulting to magicals, especially since muggle culture has historically taken the view that they need to be eradicated because they're not normal.

Calling them mundanes is kinda insulting to magic-less people, as if they're boring and plain.

Muggle, on the other hand, simultaneously implies a deep rift in culture between the two groups and doesn't sound like anything else. It's pretty good I think. When Lucius uses it it's a curse word, when Arthur does it's almost said in reverence, so it's completely in the ears of the belistener.
