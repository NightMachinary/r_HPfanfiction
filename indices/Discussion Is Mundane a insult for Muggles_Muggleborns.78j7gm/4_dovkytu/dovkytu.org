Honestly, I think muggle is a better term. Yes, its /etymology/ isn't flattering, but "witch" is a pejorative term in the muggle usage, so I'd say they're about even. At least with "muggles", the original sense is far from obvious, and most people just see it as "the word for non-magical people", not as an insult.
