If I don't use the word muggle I tend to use non magical folks/people just because I feel like that sounds a bit better then calling them mundane. Because yeah, to me at least that just sounds a bit like a insult.

Now of course the authors I've read that uses the word mundane don't seem to mean it as a insult, but that's how I personally would feel it to be.
