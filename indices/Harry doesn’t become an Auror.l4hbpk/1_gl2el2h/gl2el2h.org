- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face.... It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]], Malfoy and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. The consequences of Malfoy's petty act of revenge force him to actually engage with the world around him. Trust me. He hates it too. It is complete.
- Practically everyone has read this, but I would be remiss if I didn't include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It is almost universally beloved for its wit and originality. It is complete. Harry is basically a professional ne'er-do-well
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]], Harry is training to be a Healer and rotating through departments. He ends up in Chemical Dependence (basically rehab). An old rival is currently running the department and Harry is forced to face old wounds. It is complete
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] is a gem. In this amusing fic, Harry must buy a toilet. Who comes to the appointment but Malfoy, Lord of Toilets. (this came from a prompt). Harry is unemployed. It's a one-shot and, thus, complete.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying. It's a one-shot and, thus, complete.
- Edited to add: Harry sells crafts made with a kind of home-spun ritualistic magic in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I didn't initially think to include this because it's not post-Hogwarts, but it's my second favorite fic in the fandom. It is complete.
- Edited to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete. I didn't think to add it before because it's a Hogwarts rewrite and his non-Auror profession comes at the end, so it might not be exactly what you're looking for.
- Also edited to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions. This is similar to secret language in that it is a canon rewrite but Harry falls down a different path than defense.
