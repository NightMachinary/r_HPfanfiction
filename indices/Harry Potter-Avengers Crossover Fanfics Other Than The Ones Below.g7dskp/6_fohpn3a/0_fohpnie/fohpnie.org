  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.
