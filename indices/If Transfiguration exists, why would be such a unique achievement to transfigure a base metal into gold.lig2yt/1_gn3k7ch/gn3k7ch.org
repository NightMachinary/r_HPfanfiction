Gold, in old alchemist belief, represents the Ultimate Perfection (Life, Matter, Spirit, etc, the whole shebang). It's like the Nirvana of metals, basically. And in a lot of mythology, Gold has some odd effects and meanings - I think it's mostly Scandinavian Mythology, but there's also a pattern of curses being attached to Gold. Think Thorin and the Dwarf Gold in the Hobbit.

So, I can imagine Gold has some odd magical properties that make it particularly hard or draining to transfigure stuff into - because it's a 'perfect material', it's really difficult to get transfiguring it /right/ and the efforts can consume you (literally or metaphorically) if you do it wrong. Thus, the Philosopher's Stone is impressive for being able to do it automatically and safely, not necessarily for being able to do it at all.
