True, and it would make things simpler if that were the case. Given that Hermione is the first in her class (in a first year class) to turn her match "silver and pointy," you could say that the transfigurations were simply metallic. It's the Leprechauns that throw a wrench into this explanation. I suppose you can say that the Leprechauns conjure metals that look like gold (Hermione's fake galleons come to mind), but it all seems a bit hand-wavy.
