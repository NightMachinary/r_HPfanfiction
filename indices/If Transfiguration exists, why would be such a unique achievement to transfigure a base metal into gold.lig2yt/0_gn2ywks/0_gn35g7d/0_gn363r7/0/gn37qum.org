I'm sure there are several explanations that someone could come up with to explain the leprechaun gold, but they all bring us firmly into the realm of headcanon, and I'm not sure it's possible for then not to be hand-wavy.

The easiest solution is to probably just say that leprechaun magic works different than human magic. There's already plenty of support for the idea that different species have different types of magic (particularly house elves), and Gamp's Law could very easily be a description of the limitations of human magic, because that's all that most humans care about, and not the limitations of magic as a whole.
