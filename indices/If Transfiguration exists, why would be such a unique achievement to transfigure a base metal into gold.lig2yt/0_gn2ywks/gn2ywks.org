Because Transfiguring a base metal into gold does not change the past of the gold, ie. it remembers having been a base metal once (and can thus be Untransfigured). On the other hand, alchemy removes the history of the metal, and the gold is just that, gold. It cannot be Untransfigured because it does not remember being anything but gold.

I think canon supports this. Of note is the fact that Leprechauns can conjure gold, and Voldemort can conjure silver (Pettigrew's hand; silver shield), but like all conjured objects these will vanish. The former vanishes after a few hours, but Voldemort's conjuration (silver hand) lasts for 3+ years.

Edit: I don't think gold is an exception to Gamp's Law. Hermione states that good food can't be conjured, and Leprechauns conjuring fool's gold would directly go against a similar statement for gold.
