  If we simply assume "Untransfiguration" is just another transfiguration, the instances in Canon where this might happen still can be resolved, simply by assuming they weren't full transfigurations.
#+end_quote

It is important to note that you're creating a distinction here: Full transfigurations.

#+begin_quote
  And in the same way, one could imagine an almost-perfect transfiguration, and the "almost" part allows a skilled wizard to transfigure it back.
#+end_quote

Is this "almost part" a physical aspect or an intangible one?

#+begin_quote
  So it stands to reason they were only superficially transfigured, and kept, say, their brain, so McGonagall could transfigure Draco back, and Chair!Slughorn could transfigure himself back.
#+end_quote

I will argue that Malfoy and Slughorn were not superficially transfigured. We know it is possible for humans to retain their minds in non-human (more specifically, animal) forms (animagi), and that might be the case for Malfoy and Slughorn. I'm not sure whether there is a statement in canon that contradicts this (transfigured humans do not possess their minds in their transformed state, barring animagi). Therefore, they can be untransifgured because the ferret/armchair possesses an intangible aspect that remembers the untransfigured state.

  The transfigured wood is the same as any other wood, there is no difference in the quality of the matter, either physically /or/ magically.
#+end_quote

This is something I agree with- that the wood is indistinguishable from an oridnary tree that does not possess any exceptional magical properties (eg. wand wood).

#+begin_quote
  And that aside, if one at all needs magical residue, then I prefer Dumbledore's take: Magic leaves traces, yes, but on (or around) the object, not /as part of/ the object.
#+end_quote

And that is my point. I'm arguing that the transfigured object has a history and it remembers that history. It may be that the history is not part of the object itself, but is instead associated with the object, but it does exist.

#+begin_quote
  So for the gold, if one /could/ create it by transfiguration, that would be that, except one just can't. It doesn't work; nothing happens if you try.
#+end_quote

From GoF:

#+begin_quote
  Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came

  zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two

  smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goalposts. A rainbow arced suddenly

  across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and

  aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the

  balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering

  shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.

  Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it ---

  “Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and *heavy gold*

  *coins rained from it*, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the

  shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny

  little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or

  green.

Assuming this isn't a conjuration, and the DA coins were the product of a colour change charm or something, then it is a neat solution.
