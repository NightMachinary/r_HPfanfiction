Yes, that'd be me.

Anyway, right, the distinction of "full transfiguration" follows naturally for me, given that we see partial transfigurations all the time, unintentionally (say, the Former-Teakettle-Still-Steaming-Tortoise) and intentionally (Krum's shark body). And yes, the "keeping their mind" point is made w.r.t. Animagi; in Beedle's Tales, Dumbledore notes

#+begin_quote
  Animagi do not retain the power of human speech while in their animal form, although they keep all their human thinking and reasoning powers. This, as every schoolchild knows, is the fundamental difference between being an Animagus and Transfiguring oneself into an animal. In the case of the latter, one would become the animal entirely, with the consequence that one would know no magic, be unaware that one had ever been a wizard, and would need somebody else to Transfigure one back to one's original form.

In fact, I would cite this as tentative evidence for my entire point, given that it is specifically said to be "becom[ing] the animal entirely", and "transfigure [...] back", not untransfigure. Whether the difference between a full and a partial transfiguration needs to be a physical (if perhaps invisible) aspect is open to debate; I don't truly mind things missing some intangible aspect -- say, a sense of self, that wasn't transfigured away, in the case of Draco and Slughorn -- so long as /in principle/ it is possible to produce perfect transfigurations with no difference at all.

  And that is my point. I'm arguing that the transfigured object has a history and it remembers that history. It may be that the history is not part of the object itself, but is instead associated with the object, but it does exist.

Yes, and I got that, but to me, that is introducing a difference between X and Transfigured X by the backdoor. They aren't /truly/ the same anymore, because one has that history and the other doesn't. My distinction would be that the trace left behind could be removed from the object (or the object from the trace, for that matter). If it exists, it wouldn't be something that's tied to the object in any sense, rather something vaguely floating around and perhaps also eventually fading away.

.

Regarding the Leprechauns: I always regarded that as simply something else than gold entirely. Like, we have alloys that look like gold but aren't (e.g. fool's gold), and this is the magical equivalent, a substance called "Leprechaun gold" that in fact has nothing to do with gold, just looks like it, and eventually fades. Something like that you could transfigure all day long, of course.

But I will say that "it's real gold, but fades because you can't transfigure it" is a very coherent approach, if you consider that to be how transfiguration works. I didn't make that connection before now.
