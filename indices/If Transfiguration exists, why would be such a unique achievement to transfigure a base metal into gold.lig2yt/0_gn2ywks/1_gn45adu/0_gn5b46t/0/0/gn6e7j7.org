Pardon me; I've been quite vague when I said "full transfiguration." I do not use that term to represent the examples you've cited. Say, the fact that the transfiguration of Malfoy into a ferret was not "full" because it was performed by Moddy, but would have been "full" had it been performed by Dumbledore, ie. there would have been no trace of Malfoy left (not an "almost" perfect transfiguration, but a perfect one). I see you've adressed this in your next paragraph.

The passage you've cited certainly supports the point you're trying to make.

#+begin_quote
  I don't truly mind things missing some intangible aspect -- say, a sense of self, that wasn't transfigured away, in the case of Draco and Slughorn -- so long as /in principle/ it is possible to produce perfect transfigurations with no difference at all.
#+end_quote

I agree with this. It seems to tie up the loose ends, so to speak. So Malfoy, Slughorn and even Thickenesse the Sea-Urchin in DH would possess that sense that sense of self, but it would have been possible to transfigure them without allowing for the sense of self to exist in the transfigured state. The latter would, if it existed, be Dark Magic, I think. Perhaps, something similar to the legend of Quintapeds?

#+begin_quote
  They aren't /truly/ the same anymore, because one has that history and the other doesn't.
#+end_quote

And here I would insist on that distinction to separate Transfiguration from Alchemy. That is, the history would remain associated with that object and would separate it from a naturally occurring, identical object by virtue of allowing itself to be untransfigured. This is a difference in opinion.

#+begin_quote
  My distinction would be that the trace left behind could be removed from the object (or the object from the trace, for that matter).
#+end_quote

This, I think I would disagree with. Or at least say that the removal or perhaps obscuring of that trace would be Dark Magic and not simply a very skillfully performed Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  Regarding the Leprechauns: I always regarded that as simply something else than gold entirely. Like, we have alloys that look like gold but aren't (e.g. fool's gold), and this is the magical equivalent, a substance called "Leprechaun gold" that in fact has nothing to do with gold, just looks like it, and eventually fades. Something like that you could transfigure all day long, of course.
#+end_quote

Yes, and if true, Gold would fit into Principal Exceptions of Gamp's Law. JKR said that she had read up on Alchemy to write the HP series, and Gold is considered the perfect metal in alchemy. The counter-point would be that JKR uses silver quite consistently (primarily conjured by Voldemorty), and hence, I would presume that when she says gold, she does, in fact, mean gold.

#+begin_quote
  But I will say that "it's real gold, but fades because you can't transfigure it" is a very coherent approach, if you consider that to be how transfiguration works. I didn't make that connection before now.
#+end_quote

This a little tricky for me. When I say the Leprechauns' gold fades away, I say so because it is an essential property of all conjured objects. A skilled wizard like Voldemort could make nearly permanent objects via conjuration, but even his conjurations would vanish one day. This is from JKR's interview, paraphrased: "Conjured objects do not last."

On the other hand, if a wizard transfigures an object into gold (DA galleons which Neville supposedly showed off to his students during his years as a Hogwarts Professor), then the gold would be physically and magically identical to naturally occurring gold, but would possess that instrinsic property that would allow for it to be untransfigured.

#+begin_quote
  If it exists, it wouldn't be something that's tied to the object in any sense, rather *something vaguely floating around* and perhaps also eventually fading away.
#+end_quote

And this is what would separate (say) a transfigured golden needle from a needle forged by a muggle from naturally occurring gold. This would be a property of a transfigured object because it is uniquely inherent to it.

Additionally, this would also be what is truly remarkable about the Philosopher's Stone: the transformation of base metals into gold is permanent; there is no room for +untransfiguration+ the possibility of the transformation being undone.

The Wizarding World article on animagi says:

#+begin_quote
  *You do not adopt the life span of the animal you become*[[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/ron-weasley][Ron]] was always so bewildered that his pet Scabbers managed to live for so long; 12 years is a very, very old rat. That is, unless you're actually Peter Pettigrew masquerading as a rat, which in this case was true. This means you could theoretically be an animal for decades, far longer than the animal is supposed to live.
#+end_quote

The Philospher's Stone also produces the Elixir of Life which extends the drinker's lifespan. But we know that Transfiguration cannot be used to extend a wizards life (Taure's Lords of Magic headcanon not withstanding). Therefore, a wizard can transfigure himself to look younger, but his lifespan would remain unaltered even if he never untransfigured himself. So there must be a transformation induced by the Elixir which delays death (not aging, if you go by FB2, where Flamel is a feeble old man**). This supports the existence of transfigured objects having a property by virtue of which they can be untransfigured.

Something I once read online when I wanted to write fanfiction:

IIRC, and I'm very annoyed that I have been unable to find that source again, Alchemy occured in 3 stages:

- Firstly, the element would be transformed into a black liquid, where all the impurities would coalese.
- Secondly, the black liquid would turn white and possess no impurties (undesired properties or no properties at all)
- Thirdly, the white liquid would turn red/gold and acquire entirely new properties, before finally solidifying into a new element.
