I disagree with the Untransfiguration argument. I think it's complicating things, and it's not needed to explain what we see in Canon.

If we simply assume "Untransfiguration" is just another transfiguration, the instances in Canon where this might happen still can be resolved, simply by assuming they weren't full transfigurations. We know bad transfigurations are hybrids, like a mouse-snuffbox mashup. It would be rather easy to "untransfigure" that: What the item was is still clear. And in the same way, one could imagine an almost-perfect transfiguration, and the "almost" part allows a skilled wizard to transfigure it back.

And for the most noticeable cases of supposed untransfiguration we see, Draco and Slughorn, this makes perfect sense: We /know/ transfigured humans don't retain their senses, yet both of them clearly remember having been a ferret resp. a chair. So it stands to reason they were only superficially transfigured, and kept, say, their brain, so McGonagall could transfigure Draco back, and Chair!Slughorn could transfigure himself back.

The upside of assuming this is how (un)transfiguration works is that you don't need any strange magical memory: The transfigured wood is the same as any other wood, there is no difference in the quality of the matter, either physically /or/ magically.

And that aside, if one at all needs magical residue, then I prefer Dumbledore's take: Magic leaves traces, yes, but on (or around) the object, not /as part of/ the object.

.

So for the gold, if one /could/ create it by transfiguration, that would be that, except one just can't. It doesn't work; nothing happens if you try.
