  This would be similar to food in canon - you can Transfigure something to have the look and texture, but not really the taste or nutritional value (if I remember it right).

That's not stated. It's one idea people came up with how it works if you try to transfigure food anyway, but it's just that -- an idea. I prefer that simply nothing happens if you try (and you could transfigure a pig and prepare and eat it, that's the "good" qualifier in Hermione's statement -- a live pig is hardly something to take a bite out of.)
