Okay, here's my take.

You can transfigure something to take on the /color/ and /texture/ of gold, but not anything beyond the superficial - you couldn't give it the magical properties, electrical conductivity, that sort of thing. It wouldn't stand up to scrutiny as being actual gold, especially to most magical folk (/especially/ goblins, who don't appreciate being swindled).

This would be similar to food in canon - you can Transfigure something to have the look and texture, but not really the taste or nutritional value (if I remember it right).

The Philosopher's Stone, then, is a way to make /actual/ gold - having all of those properties that Transfiguring something can't confer.
