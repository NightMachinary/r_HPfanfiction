That seems the most plausible explanation. The concept of the Philosopher's Stone is not original to the HP universe and it had as main goal to reach a method of turning base metals into gold. You can paint stuff with gold paint but that doesn't bring its value to the same level as that of the gold. I think it's the same for transfiguration.
