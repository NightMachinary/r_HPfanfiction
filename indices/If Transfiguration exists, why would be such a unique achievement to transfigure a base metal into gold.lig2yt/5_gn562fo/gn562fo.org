IIRC transfiguring gold violates Gamps law bc it creates something of value (the reason you cant transfigure money), which is one of the many parts of canon that makes you go ??, what standard of value is non transfigurational, the capitalist ideas of supply and demand? the marxist interpretation that value is measured in hours of labour? Its a completely arbitrary concept, so to say you cannot transfigure value is like saying you cant transfigure something into being "cute" theres any number of factors to consider what makes it cute.

Anyway I became slightly sidetracked there, another reason for its special status, other than irl reference to the pursuit of alchemy, is (this could be fanon) transfiguration merely makes the new object resemble whatever was chosen, alchemy truly transforms it into something alike the Platonic ideal of the target material, if im making sense.
