The most simple causality works the other way round. /Because/ alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone is something special, you cannot transfigure (or conjure) gold.

And the "why" would be like asking why (not how) gravity exists. It just does. That would be how the exceptions to Gamp's work. In practice, I should think simply nothing happens if you try. Your block of wood stays a block of wood. So notably, you're not getting "fake gold", because Transfiguration, if it works (and the caster is capable), is perfect. (I don't agree with the Untransfiguration argument, there are other ways to explain that.)
