First, you're comparing two different branches of magic.

Secondly, we see in canon that magic can survive a caster: the Fidelius Charm and protections around Privet Drive survive Dumbledore. The protections Moody set up at Grimmauld Place survive him. The mirrors, map, and cloak all still work years after the deaths of their creators. The Chamber of Secrets. Hell, Hogwarts.
