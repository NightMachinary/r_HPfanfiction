Well it's pretty much told that you cannot transfigure food yet students still learn how to turn a desk into a pig. That's an indicator that the pig will probably turn back into a desk at some point and trying to slaughter and eat it would just leave you with splinters on your tongue or in your stomach. Also curses can be very long lasting (even if not permanent). Otherwise Bill Weasley wouldn't have a job breaking curses in ancient tombs.
