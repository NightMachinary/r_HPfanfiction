There's really two ways to interpret the word "permanent" and it's causing some confusion. In one interpretation, non permanent means that it reverses by itself after a while and permanent means that it lasts for an unlimited time. In another interpretation, non permanent means that it can be reversed manually and permanent means that it's irreversible.

To make true gold that could be used as currency you need irreversible transformation where it's impossible to tell that it's artificial.

Canon seems to be permanent in the first interpretation, but non permanent in the second. A transfigured object or person can be untransfigured.

Irreversible transfiguration is honestly pretty scary because the source object is completely destroyed. If you transfigured a person into something else using irreversible transfiguration, the person is dead.
