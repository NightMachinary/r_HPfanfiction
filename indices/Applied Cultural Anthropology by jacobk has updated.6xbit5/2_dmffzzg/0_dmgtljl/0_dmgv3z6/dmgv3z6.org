Yes. I've also been doing some original fiction reading and dipping my quill into original fiction of my own, but I plan on swinging back to fanfic writing in the fall.

Edit: I can't seem to write for shit in the summer. The weather exhaust me. Usually when things get busy in the fall (college resumes and stuff) and I have /less/ free time, I suddenly start writing /more/. Summer escalates my procrastination into untamed heights.
