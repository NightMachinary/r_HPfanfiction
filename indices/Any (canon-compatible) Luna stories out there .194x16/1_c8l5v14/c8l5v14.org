"[[http://margottenenbaum.livejournal.com/23310.html][Quixotic]]". Ginny breaks up with Harry for 9 months. Post DH, pre Epilogue.

"[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7611783/1/Pair-the-Spare][Pair the Spare]]". Luna Scamander reminisces upon finding her spangled-silver dress robes at the back of her closet.

Both of these are quite bittersweet, in their own way, but well-written nonetheless.
