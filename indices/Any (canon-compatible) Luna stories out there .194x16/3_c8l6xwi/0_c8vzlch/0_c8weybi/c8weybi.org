LiraSnape has long since stopped adding to her lists, but she has many lists of lists and all are worth perusing. Some may not like her taste, but it is a great place to find sub categories of genre for fics of a certain type. She did good work. The one above is specifically H/G/L, though I cannot remember which stories specifically are post Hogwarts (I'm sure the descriptions say so)
