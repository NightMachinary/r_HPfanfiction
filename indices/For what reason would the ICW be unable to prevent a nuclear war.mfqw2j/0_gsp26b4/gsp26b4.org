If it's a muggle only war, then I think it could be down to overconfidence. Maybe the ICW doesn't believe the muggle tech is strong enough to warrant breaking the Statute. By the time they finally realise how strong it is, it's too late.

Conversely, blood purists on the ICW could be actively helping the muggles, because they want to have the muggles all kill each other off.

Finally, it could just be that the majority of the ICW isn't in a country that can make a difference here. For example, if the ICW is led by Japanese and Indian wizards, they may not be able to help stop a nuclear war between USA and Russia.
