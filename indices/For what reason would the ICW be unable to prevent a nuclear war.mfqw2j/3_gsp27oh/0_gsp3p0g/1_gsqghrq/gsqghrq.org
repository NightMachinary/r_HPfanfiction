That can be easy. Magical defenses work... For a while. Depending on the needs of the story, a bubble head charm cast by a competent but not spectactular wizard would protect against the fallout for 20 minutes without collapsing. A wizarding standard "clean air" property charm (aka ward) would last a week at most.

Gives the wizards plenty of time to get below ground and plenty of incentive to do so -- recasting the clean air charm constantly is annoying. Better to move underground and use more potent, though smaller area, charms on the entrances so they'll last years.
