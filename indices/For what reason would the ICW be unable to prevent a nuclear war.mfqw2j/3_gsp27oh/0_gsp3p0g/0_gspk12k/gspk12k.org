So first two thoughts:

1) Magic can hold off the apocalypse: Wizards stayed above ground, but only in magic heavy areas like Hogwarts and Diagon Ally. This leads to a predictable split: Some wizards want to still interact with Muggle society and bring in Muggleborns, while others take a 'on their heads be it', and want to wash their hands of the fools.

This has some interesting byplay, as you can have the changing circumstances be an excuse for shuffling up the sides. Maybe some on the 'light' are fed up with Muggle destruction and want to leave them to the tunnels to rot, while some in the 'dark' realize how astronomically stupid it was to ignore them (and maybe want that world ending power for themselves.

In the background you can give Wizards a resource crisis: There is only so much protected land, and it is dwindling as magic users die/abandon land and the apocalypse overtakes them. Being much easier to maintain land than reclaim it back. No longer can wizards go into some field, cast some muggle repelling and space expansion charms and basically have all the room they need. Also can't just walk into a supermarket and steal from the muggles. And then you have the 'dark side' which may not adjust well to not having any targets around.

2) Magic can't hold off the apocalypse: Wizards retreat to Gringotts and the Ministry Basement and maybe Hogwarts. Wizards end up in isolated pools, maybe they can communicate but not connect. Thus driving them to connect with the muggle underground as a way to connect the wizard underground enclaves.
