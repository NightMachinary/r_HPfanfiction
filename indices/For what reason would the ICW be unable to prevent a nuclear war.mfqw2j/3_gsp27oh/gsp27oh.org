Easiest: Wizards don't really understand muggles.

Sure, they may have heard of nuclear weapons, the internet, world-level environmental threats, or the term "8 Billion", but wizards as a whole have never really internalized how close to the precipice they have come.

You have a couple who have tried to wake the wizarding world up to these uncomfortable truths, but they never really woke up the public. Not exactly surprising given the narrow-minded view of the government's and incompetence of the wizarding press.
