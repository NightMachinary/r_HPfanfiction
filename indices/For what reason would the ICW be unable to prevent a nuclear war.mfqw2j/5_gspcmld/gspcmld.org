In my opinion, some "Internal Interferences" could be a good justification. For some reasons, a group of wizards from the ICW are working in the shadows in order to let the war happen : maybe they wanted to "weaken" the country that was first bombed, thinking, incorrectly, that they could prevent it from responding with one of their own bomb, or maybe they just wanted to created this post apocalypse world for whatever justification they could have (Muggle extermination, monopoly on ressources . . .).

Anyways, this group first worked from the inside in order to diminish the risk of a Nuclear War, before actively delaying any action from the ICW to stop the war, even trying to fight and/or kill the wizards sent into the country to stop the war, until it's too late.
