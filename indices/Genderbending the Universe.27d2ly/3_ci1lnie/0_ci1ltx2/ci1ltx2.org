That is pretty interesting. So it was a matricial society instead of patricial. As much as I want to explore this, it doesn't feel...idk, fresh. Crosses and Naughts is like this but with race [oppressed whites, black people in power, etc] but it still felt like a non-escape. There is nothing that separates their world from ours and as much as I am for writing what you know, it makes fiction, especially fanfiction boring. That's why I avoid high school AUs and even muggle AUs since there is nothing aside from the novelty of 'ooooh new scenery'.

If I did write this, there would be a change. Take the Malfoys. Lucius would be the wife while Narcissa is the husband. In canon, Narcissa is the society wife while Lucius is the trust fund baby with some dabbling in government [I would kill to see a fict where he has to deal with Mycroft Holmes from BBC Sherlock]. In my universe, I don't see Narcissa as one to rest on her laurels, even as the third son/daughter, [s]he's more ambitious than that so I would have him/her become a private healer with rich clients. Lucius may wind up as the arm candy/trophy but with a nudge, [s]he would do some government things like Amelia Bones.
