Funny I just told that to someone. The personalities [and looks] are more or less the same to be honest. I have gone far enough to morph a genderbend into original characters and stories but I know the line and can toe it.

It still boils down to 'harry potter genderbent' with the same events in canon but there are some little twists here and there. Fem!Vernon I doubt to be as violent as her male counterpart [unless I go down the same road as Precious but that is a fict for another day], for example.
