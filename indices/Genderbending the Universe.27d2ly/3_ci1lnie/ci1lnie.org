I've read a story where Harry gets transported to an alternate universe where everyone is the reverse gender, including a female version of himself.

Without going too deep into the plot, the author had a very interesting take on how a reverse gender univer worked. in his world the roles of men and women were reversed. Not biologically, so men can't get pregnant etc. but socially.

For example, in this world Harry was very surprised at how promiscuous the girls were and how easy it was for him to have sex. Until Orestes (male Hermione) points out that boys weren't supposed to have sex with everything that moves and that it essentially made him a slut. He was also constantly underestimated as "just a girl" and people were extremely surprised that he acted as aggressive and self-confident as he did.

In a world where everyone changes gender, essentially no one does since they still keep their same place in society.
