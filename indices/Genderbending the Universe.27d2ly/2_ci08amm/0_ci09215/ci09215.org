You are kind of missing it. I don't care about FIRST names I care about SECOND names. Snape becomes Prince but will there even be a snape to begin with if tobias snape, snape's dad, is a female? What would Tobias' maiden name be if his, now her, parents were gender swapped? Deep thoughts here, deep thoughts.

I could give two figs if Harry becomes Harriet, Halliey of Hannah Montana, the story I want to know is if you genderbent Harry's parents, what becomes of Lily Potter who is now Lilan Evans, bookish person who was kind to the Slytherin outcast, Severina? Would James Potter be as big of a bully as a female? Would Dumbledore still be Headmaster or would it go to McGonagall? Ask MORE questions.
