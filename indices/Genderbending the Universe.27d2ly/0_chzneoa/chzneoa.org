Is the similarity of names really that important? I've read some genderbent AUs (granted not any where every character was a different gender). In the girl!Harry ones, sometimes the author names her Harriet with Harry as a nickname, but I've also seen Rose (playing off the flower name thing), Haesel, Holly, Hollis... and it doesn't make much of a difference to me as a reader.

I'm not sure what your question is about Tobias Snape. You want to make him a female and Eileen a male, so you have Eli Prince marrying, say, Tabitha Snape. Easy. Why does it matter who the parents were? Unless you're saying that the last name would need to be different since it would be coming from the other parent. Like if in canon Tobias's parents were John Snape and Mary Snape nee Jones. In your genderbent AU it would be Jane and Mark Jones, so Tobias would be Tabitha Jones... is that what you're getting at? If so, then I think you're causing yourself a whole lot of unnecessary pain and suffering. Just go back as far in the family tree as we know exist from canon. Why agonize over characters that are never even mentioned?

EDIT: And your question about the fate of Tom Riddle Jr. if Tom Riddle Sr. were actually Thomasina. If you're going to be as purist about genderbending as it seems -- like, every single character in the universe, central or not -- then that's only the tip of the iceberg. Take Merope. Man-Merope would have a mother and a sister instead of a brother and father. Would her mother speak Parseltongue if she wasn't born a Gaunt, descendent of Slytherin? Would that change the family dynamic, if they had to converse in English? Make them less isolated? Would Tom Riddle Jr. even be born? And Dumbledore. Would Alba Dumbledore's life have been different if her mother went to Azkaban for attacking muggle children in defense of her son? In the late 19th century, with how few options women had and how rigid gender roles were, losing the husband/father would have different effects on the family than losing the mother.

This is pretty interesting, but I think eventually you'd just need to stop going back that far in family trees, or else change the way society works in your AU. None of this would be an issue if your world was more matriarchal than patriarchal. The last names would all be the same as canon, because men would take their wives' names upon marriage. Mrs. Dumbledore going to jail would have pretty much the same effect on the Dumbledore household as in canon if traditional gender roles were switched.

It's fun to think about, but I think you'll have to decide how different you want the world to be. If it's pretty much like canon except the genders are different, then I think to prevent headaches you'd have to draw the line somewhere, and keep the genders the same going back two or three generations.
