I really don't think I am going to write it but if I were going to, I would make it through and epic. My name question is with the last name, not the first. I can reasonably think of genderbent names of all the characters but the last name though is a killer.

If I wrote this, it would be a massive epic that would change the universe all the way back to Merlin if I could. Even the smallest families would be effected.

Case in point, the Blacks. They name all their kids off of Stars. In story, we have 7 named Blacks [or Black named] people that have roles in the story: Sirius, Regulus, Narcissa, Draco, Bellatrix, Andromeda and Nymphadora. I would ahve to switch their names around because you couldn't have a man named Bellatrix. A lesser person would just rename him to Beau, not thinking of the naming scheme but someone who is as anal as me would switch it with a male character so Bellatrix become Regulus or Sirius or even Draco. Well Regulus is taken now so Fem!Regulus needs a name and the process starts all over again.

The thing with Merope depends on how I want to write her...er...him. I could write him as a Neville-like character bullied to near squibhood which is close to canon OR I can write him like that but underlay his personality as a magnificent bastard that willingly lets his daughter be raised in an orphanage so she will cultivate a hate of muggles or even going further, he rapes the charming Tomasina because he wanted that beauty and charm in his bloodline and knew that a little bit of blood will make his darling daughter strong.

I want to go back because this stuff is FASCINATING and fun to think of. Even if I can't be assed to write it, it's great to discuss and who knows, someone will be motivated to write it or collab with me so this idea doesn't die.
