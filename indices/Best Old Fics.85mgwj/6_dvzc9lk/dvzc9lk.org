I always enjoy a chance to recommend linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). Unfortunately unfinished, but it's a healthy length and does wrap up a decent amount of the plot, with some fascinating divergences from canon because of when it was written (pre-OOTP to pre-HBP). It's essentially a massive AU from 5th year on and I think the author did a great job of keeping magic /magical/. It has my favorite "Power he knows not" of any fic I've read and some amazing side characters: Moody gets fleshed out very nicely, there's an amazing villain in the OC Gallowbraid, a highly original Nicolas Flamel, and more! I really can't recommend it enough.

For a less effusive recommendation, you could check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded). I just finished this recently and will hesitantly recommend it. It has some very cool ideas, but wraps up the story poorly and doesn't follow through on the potential of most of the ideas the author laid out. It's also needlessly dark by the end of the story. However, the execution is technically sound and it's another interesting look at how someone writing pre-HBP fanfiction viewed the HP world.
