I have to second this recommendation with far more than a simple upvote can provide. This fic, and the trilogy as a whole, has a far more realistically mature feel to it than probably no less than 90% of fics currently being written. The plot has more nuance, polish and planning to it than all but one of the 91 fics that have been updated in the last 24 hours (that appear in FFN based on my filters). There is a proper building of mystery and suspense leading to twist/revelation leading to climax.
