Well your options I have seen tend to be:

- Tent fics, where they get together in the tent after Ron leaves. Usually play out the rest of the book from there
- Final Battle fics, where Harry confesses right before the final Battle when he thinks he is going to die. I find these better as angst/drama fics instead of fluffy/happy fics.
- Secret relationship fics, that start later but have H/He secretly dating during regular events of canon. I usually find these to be poor quality Indy!Harry shit, who secretly finds Dumbledore manipulation or Evil!Ron
- After end fics, where the relationships start as written but get shifted before epilogue. Usually something like "Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione relationships fall apart and they pick up pieces." Or "Harry objects at Ron/Hermione wedding" or "Harry was actually doing all the work in the Ron/Hermione relationship, gift buying and remembering dates,".
- Post Epilogue, which usually end up affair or abuse fics

Which one?
