I don't see the situation changing much. Arthur and Molly don't seem to place importance in wealth so they wouldn't be the type to flaunt it if they have it. If anything I see them using anything they have to help others wether it be their kids or friends who are in a tight spot. While bill and fluer's cottage was nice it was still sensible. despite what some fics portray I don't think fleur is the overly pampered rich girl who can't survive on a curse breakers salary. I think they'll live comfortably but nothing grandiose. Charlie is Charlie and unless he can buy a dragon the money won't make a difference to him. After his reconciliation with his family i think Percy will be subdued and try to emulate his father. While I don't think he will work in the same department I think he will find something he is good at and enjoys and not be as power hungry as before and living a humble life style. George will probably be withdrawn and have trouble after losing his twin all his money will probably go into the shop or booze. If hermione doesn't keep Ron in line he'll likely piss any money away very quickly. Harry not caring about wealth will probably reign in any outlandish ness for Ginny.
