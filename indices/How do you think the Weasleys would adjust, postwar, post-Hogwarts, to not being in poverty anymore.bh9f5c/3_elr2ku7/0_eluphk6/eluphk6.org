“the kind of poor people who immediately spend all the money they earn and have basically no saving.”

You mean people whose entire income goes to necessities? Because there's some decent research out there showing that when they get more income and know it's a status change, not a one-time windfall, they tend to invest in things that will lead to permanent improvements in their lives, either by creating new revenue streams or by fixing deficiencies in living conditions.

The one-time prize situation is different: They replaced Ron's wand (investment), but as a one-time windfall, they (rationally) prioritized something they would never otherwise be able to do and took the family to see Bill.

Fred and George used the unexpected money from Harry to build a business that generated a fair bit of income, but that's slightly different in that they already were building the business and needed a capital infusion to really launch it at scale.
