Honestly, I dont think much would change for them. They seem to be the kind of poor people who immediately spend all the money they earn and have basically no saving. We see that with how small their vault is and with the way they immediately spend all the money they won. So even though they have less expenses I will assume that their day to day life wont change that much. But I could see their children being able to adapt because they have their partners and probably have less experience with spending money at all.
