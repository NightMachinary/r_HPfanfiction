I can see Bill and Fleur arguing over money. She points out that they can afford luxuries, no problem, but he's used to being frugal.

Charlie doesn't care about money as long as he has dragons.

Percy tries to turn the Weasleys into the next Malfoys, using whatever wealth he has to gain influence. He does this as a minor character in my story, The Last Pureblood Malfoy.

George enjoys being a rich eccentric, with absurd, grand publicity stunts.

Ron puts Hermione in charge of the family budget. She makes sensible investments for retirement, gets full tax deductions for their charity contributions, and gives Ron an allowance for fun.

Neither Ginny nor Harry have any clue about how to manage money. The wizarding world showers them with gifts.

Whatever money Arthur and Molly have, they spend on parties and presents for their grandchildren.
