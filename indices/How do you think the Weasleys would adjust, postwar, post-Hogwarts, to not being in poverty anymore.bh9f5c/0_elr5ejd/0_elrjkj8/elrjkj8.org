I more or less agree but I don't think they would take it that mindlessly. I mean after so much time without it I think they would know the value of money.

Fleur isn't shown as a princess but quite a down to earth woman in the 7th book so I don't think she would be too hard about this to the point of argument and at the same time, neither would be Bill against it.

Percy would more likely try to still help his family by guilt over his previous behaviour and I can see him trying to use the money to improve things in the Ministry.

George. Eccentric I can see easily but also helping people with his money.

Arthur and Molly would indeed think of their children/grandchildren and wouldn't over-indulge but I think they also would live less on the edge as they were. Ron may go either buying without thinking because now he has money (not necessarily to show off but more because of what he couldn't have as a child). Or he could be the mature person JKR tried to make him in the end and be conscious about it and not over indulge. Either way, Hermione wouldn't use it recklessly and this could or couldn't make some stress in their relationship depending Ron.

Ginny and Harry. Not knowing what to do about it yes but I can see Harry donating a lot to help people or change things in the Ministry.
