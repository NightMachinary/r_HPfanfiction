A few days ago, there was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iy7tp5/lord_voldemort_comes_to_the_potter_on_october_31/][a prompt about all Marauders being present]]. Most commenters think Voldemort was still going to walk over them. But I think it would take quite some time for Voldemort to do that, and Dumbledore could arrive in an instant with Fawkes and under the Invisibility Cloak.

Then your scenario can be kick in easily.
