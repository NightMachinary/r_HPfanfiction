There were two sudden bright flashes in the front garden. James ran to grab his wand and threw open the front door, yelling to Lily to take Harry and run as he did so and-

Voldemort was on the ground, as was Pettigrew.

Well at least he now knew who the traitorous rat wa- he really should have seen that coming.

There was a swirl and Dumbledore appeared from underneath an invisibility cloak.

His invisibility cloak.

Huh. So that's why he wanted to borrow it.

Dumbledore, looking somewhat smug, stroked his beard. "It appears, James, that like most dark lords he was vulnerable to being cursed in the back."

James stared at Dumbledore. "What."

"I must thank you for the lend of this invisibility cloak. It was a lot easier to sneak up on this one than the last."

But the last one would be...

"You defeated Grindelwald by sneaking up on him and cursing him in the back, didn't you."

"That is a distinct possibility"

"But everybody knows about the duel you had with him"

Dumbledore sat down on what turned out to be a disillusioned comfy chair.

"Ah yes. You see... If I had cursed him in the back, I'm just some bloke who got lucky, and his lieutenants take over from him and probably try to break him out. However, if I was to best him in a duel, then I am obviously stronger than him and they must surrender to me due to their whole 'might makes right' philosophy."

"Oh"

Dumbledore took a sip from an invisible glass and put it back down on an invisible table. His glasses twinkled in the light from the still open door. "Now, how do you want to spin this?"

"I... I think we'll take the Grindelwald approach."

"Very wise. Lemon drop?"

Dumbledore held out an invisible dish, presumably filled with lemon drops.
