Some saw Dumbledore as the kindly if eccentric old headmaster of Hogwarts. Others saw him as a senile old fool. Still others saw him as the scheming manipulator, plotting to destroy the wizarding world from within. The truth, of course, was all of those and none of them. But one thing that Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore had learned very early on was that when the stakes were high, there was nothing wrong with a little cheating.
