I guess you'd say it's "the one with Human!Hedwig in his harem", and for the record the other one you're describing is linkffn(Blindness). But I don't think it's fair to describe /Barefoot/ as a "harem". Yes, he is more or less in a relationship with Tonks and Human!Hedwig at the same time, but that's the extent of it, and Harry even begins to question whether that much is really a /right/ thing to do.
