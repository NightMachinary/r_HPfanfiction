Maybe WIP linkffn(The Life He Leads) where Harry uses Norse magic. Or incomplete linkffn(0800-rent-a-hero) where he uses divination. Or linkffn(Barefoot By Zaxamarus) where he can feel magical traces. Possibly linkffn(A Black Comedy) where he largely gets by with just 4 charms. In linkffn(The Art of Self Fashioning) he's super at tranfiguration (complete). And in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series she's a boffin at potions and mind arts.
