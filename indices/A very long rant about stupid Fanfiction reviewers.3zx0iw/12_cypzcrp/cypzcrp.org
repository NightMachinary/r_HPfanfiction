I don't mean to offend anyone, but reading fanfiction makes me lose faith in humanity more and more. Either that or the fandom attracts the craziest of people, because the huge amount and popularity of soul bond, marriage law, and mpreg fics indicates a vast, collective loss of sanity. I shudder to think that your average Snarry soulbond mpreg shipper could be your inconspicuous coworker.
