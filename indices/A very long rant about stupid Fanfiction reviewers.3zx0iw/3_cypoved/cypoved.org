I'll just say: yes, but honestly, you can't do anything but either get annoyed or shrug at it.

On my part, I only leave a review if I see I can provide feedback that would be useful and would be more than “great story, update soon”. I don't do it often, I admit, but there were people who made changes to what they wrote because of my feedback; the sad thing is that this seems to somehow place me in the minority of reviewers because giving a useful review isn't really all that hard if you can use your head.

But oh well, I just shrug; can't do anything to change how it is.
