I'm sure someone has said this already but I'm tired and can't be arsed to read all the comments before I go to bed, and I really wanted to say that part of that is that some authors absolutely flip the fuck out if you so much as point out a missing comma in a message literally delivered by a Canadian apologizing. If it's not "this is great" it's a flame and you should die. Or if you truly think it's awful, you shouldn't comment anyway, because why waste your time? Some people hate when their misspellings are pointed out, others don't and will correct it, and others don't care at all. Some people don't like having their characterization or dialogue or plot or setting or any other little nuanced part of their story looked at askance. So what you see in the comments is people who want more of what you got, or hate it so much they want to flame you. Everyone else can't be bothered.

Also people upvoted your shitpost because it was a shitpost that didn't totally reek of trying too hard. It was ironic and humorous. But you're ruining the joke.
