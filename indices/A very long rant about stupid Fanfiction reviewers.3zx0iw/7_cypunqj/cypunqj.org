But seriously, while I hold every review on my fics in high regard, since it simply means someone read the bull I produce, I do not think of them as valuable criticism. I may take some pointers from them, but that was about it. Some reviewers take a lot of time to put out feedback worth a damn, but those are the almost non-existent minority.

Problem solving? The Dark Lord Potter forums do that. They'll take your story, lift it up and then try to break its spine over their knees over and over again. If it holds, its deemed worth a second glance. But honestly, I wouldn't even be able to deliver on this level, so I'll stick with my simpler audience.
