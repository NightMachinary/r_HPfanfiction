  Why not? I'm not a DLP user. I'd just like to know more about why you feel that way.

Can't speak for OP, but myself? I found it entirely too full of edgelords, who themselves forgive and gush over anything where Harry is a hard mofo NRA-member with a love of underage blowjobs.

If you want a through answer, read this mess of piling on and massive wank that follows this tree of comments. What dickery. DLP is the 4chan of the Harry Potter fandom, both the good and /especially/ the bad parts. I'm glad it exists, so those that like it exhaust themselves to some extent inside it's poo-covered confines.
