    I don't personally consider myself to be 'elitist' though I imagine some members might wear that as a badge of pride.

Certainly.

In the end, though, the "culture" is pretty simple. You can go anywhere by being a) intelligent b) rational c) using common sense. The problem is that nowadays, especially on the internet, the general IQ seems to have decreased to protozoon level.

Or to bring it back to the OP: Those kind of reviewers are exactly the kind of persons who will be run off the site within a day, and I couldn't be happier about it. "Being stupid" is a ban reason (while "using offensive language" is not), and this simultaneously shows in the level of the discussion and makes me miss that kind of regulation when I'm elsewhere.

Starfox was a bad fit for the site, and we (and I presume he as well) are a lot better off going separate ways.
