The constructive criticism gets accepted just fine -- if you don't happen to be called Starfox5. The problem is not us, it's you, which is why you are gone and the thread is not.

I don't particularly care if anyone starts insulting me on the internet of all things, /however/, funnily enough, this has not happened ever since I joined over seven years ago -- /so this is no issue to begin with/.

At the stage where you draw that kind of reaction from the forums it's better if you're not there, which is really all there is to say.
