DLP's harsh criticism /is/ what makes it more valuable than what you would find here. Unlike in the majority of the fandom, stupid shit is highlighted and called out as being stupid rather than being buried beneath three dozen reviews of "more" and "I love Harmony XD". Bad writing and poor characterization are called out as well. If the criticism is bad, then it too is called out. And anyone who shows a genuine desire to improve and respond to feedback is welcomed.

As for the quality of DLP, it has always held itself to high standards and DLP authors produce a great deal of the best works in the fandom because of those standards and in large part because of their attitude of honest, blunt critique. As for credentials, I'm fairly sure there is an actual editor or two among the active users, but its mostly people who have read a lot of fanfiction, know what good writing and story concepts are when they see it, or are good authors themselves (usually all three). It might be subjective, sure, but when its almost universally agreed that DLP produces extremely good fics, provides useful feedback, and only praises solid works, then there is considerable weight to be lent to the opinion of DLP users.

And of course, most of the people who you find disagreeing with this are usually people tiffed at the caustic attitude of DLP or are unable to take criticism if it isn't strawberry flavored and sugary.
