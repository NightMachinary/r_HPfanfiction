I disagree with you on a fundamental level regarding deleting or 'marking' offensive posts. If you look at the wider content of DLP you'll find that 'offensive' posts are in the significant minority.

There are almost 850,000 individual posts in DLP to date. There are less than 100 posts that I'd consider to be particularly vitriolic. That's less hundredth of a percent, so, I'd say our policy has worked out pretty well.

Posts on DLP are rarely deleted unless, as said previously, they're spam, troll or pointless. Even tangential posts are split off into separate threads for the discussion to be continued.
