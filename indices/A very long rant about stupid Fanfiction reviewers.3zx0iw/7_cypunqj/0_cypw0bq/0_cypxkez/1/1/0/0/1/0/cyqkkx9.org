And the purpose of deleting or at least marking offending posts is to reduce the number of similar posts by other posters. By not clearly marking rules-breaking posts, you deliberately make it harder to adhere to the forum rules. You effectively present new readers with examples of posting that they will think are acceptable, but are actually in violation of the site rules.

That's pretty much common sense.
