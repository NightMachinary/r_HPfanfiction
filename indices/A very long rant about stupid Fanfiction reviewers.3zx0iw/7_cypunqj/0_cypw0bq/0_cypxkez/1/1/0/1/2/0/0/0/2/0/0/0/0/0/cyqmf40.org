Why is that a "shitpost"? It directly concerns the tone of reviews you can find on DLP. It's on topic, and responding to another post about DLP.

Also, why do you think there was any name smearing going on? Numerous DLP posters confirmed what I said - that such insults will not be deleted by the mods. That leaving such insults standing without even marking them as against the forum rules is the same as condoning them is obvious.
