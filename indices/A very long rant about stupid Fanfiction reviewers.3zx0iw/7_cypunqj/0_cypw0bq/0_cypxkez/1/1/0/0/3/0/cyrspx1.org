Sesc, why are you quoting Jon to me? I wish I'd never gotten involved. I have nothing against DLP or it's culture so long as it stays on DLP. There was a lot more to the story than I'd originally thought. I get that now. Mea culpa. I've learned that there's really [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zx0iw/a_very_long_rant_about_stupid_fanfiction_reviewers/cyqkg16][no difference]] in the quality of your site's reviews and [[/u/hpfanfiction]]'s. Just different cultures.

But when [[/u/bobo54bc]] makes posts with DLP drama in threads specifically created to get /away/ from the fracas, [[/u/__Pers]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zx0iw/a_very_long_rant_about_stupid_fanfiction_reviewers/cyqmtfv][whinges]] about this subreddit's downvotes of DLP-centred topics, or [[/u/surarrinoj]] obliquely tells [[/u/EnglishHedgehog13]] to drown himself over his opinion of your community, it lowers /my/ opinion of every user I've stamped with an RES tag of "DLP Enthusiast." And that's not fair to the really wonderful members of your community - such as Taure and [[/r/Dromeo]] - that frequent this subreddit, but thems the breaks.
