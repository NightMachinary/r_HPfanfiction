The only reason it didn't get more thumbs up was because not many people read that thread. It deserves more, to be honest.

This /is/ tame. Starfox5 became, in his time on DLP, very well known for having extremely mediocre writing skills, refusing to take accurate criticism, not improving upon his writing skills, and bullheadedly defending extremely poor, cliche, and downright idiotic ideas. His most popular fic was awash with unrepentant bashing and mugglewank and then he had the audacity to act like it was a legitimate, quality work.

The user, like most members of the site, can be extremely vitriolic when responding to people who show signs of such stupidity with no desire to improve or take criticism. Which is exactly what happened.

He'll probably have a good laugh when he hears you called him a ticking timebomb though.
