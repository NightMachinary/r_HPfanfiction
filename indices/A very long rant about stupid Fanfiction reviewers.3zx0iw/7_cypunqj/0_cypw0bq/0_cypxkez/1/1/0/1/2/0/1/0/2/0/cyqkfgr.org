  The fact that DLP generally has a higher standard of quality than any other fanfiction site on the internet, for one.
#+end_quote

I have found stories in your C2 that I did not enjoy, so the claim that the stories DLP enjoys are of an inherently 'higher quality' rings hollow to me. Tastes are subjective. One man's 'higher quality' is another man's Twilight.

  The fact that DLP actually does have published authors posting regularly, for another.
#+end_quote

I've seen this claim repeated by no less than four different users. The fact that someone gets published is in no way an indicator of the quality of their work. This appeal to authority means nothing.
