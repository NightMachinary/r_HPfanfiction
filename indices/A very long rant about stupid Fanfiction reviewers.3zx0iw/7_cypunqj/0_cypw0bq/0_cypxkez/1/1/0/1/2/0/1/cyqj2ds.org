That's kind of the point and part of the general atmosphere on DLP. Harsh criticism is the norm, and if you're an idiot who refuses to take such criticism and improve upon it, or hold stubbornly onto story ideas/concepts that your can't support or defend, then you usually get harsh insults along with it.

Now, if you show a genuine desire to improve and respond to feedback, then DLP is extremely welcoming and one of my personal favorite communities, having been a member for over a year.

The user I responded to is a member of the former group, and I actually remember the incident he is discussing from right near when I first joined the site.
