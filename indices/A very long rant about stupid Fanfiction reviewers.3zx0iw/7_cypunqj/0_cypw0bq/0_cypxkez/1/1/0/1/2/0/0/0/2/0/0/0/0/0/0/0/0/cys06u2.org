You know, there's a reason DLP has an archive called Hall of Shame, where particularly dumb threads go. Somewhat related to this, as it shows the state of DLP's culture. If you do stupid shit, they are going to laugh at you, if you say dumb homophobic slurs in ways that offend people, they are going to call you out on it.

In this case, someone called you out on doing stupid shit, but broke the rules by doing so too harshly, and was therefore infracted. I can't see what the problem is. Generic insults are generic insults, I don't understand why you consider it homophobic to leave them up as a "this is how you don't call people out".

Refer to the thread where Giovanni calls out another guy for a similar case that saw no infractions coming his way (AFAIK). Calling people out for being dumb shits is what happens when a bunch of people with high standards start a forum and expect those standards to be upheld. I have no issue with it, as I have faith in DLP's mods to do their job properly and stop anything that goes too far.
