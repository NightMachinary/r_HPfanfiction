For a forum that prides itself on "high standards", there's a blatant lack of knowledge about the way to formulate constructive criticism so that it'd be accepted, and how to create an atmosphere that encourages open discussion.

Insulting the recipient is never a good idea, it promotes resentment. Anyone who claims that he is offering constructive criticism but adds insults is a liar or a fool.

A forum that lets such posts stand sends a clear message of what kind of standards they have - and it's not "high standards".
