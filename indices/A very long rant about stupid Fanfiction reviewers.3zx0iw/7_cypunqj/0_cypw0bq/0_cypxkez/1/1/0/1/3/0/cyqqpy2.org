Did you miss that there's no sign at all in the offensive post that someone was punished for it? There's no transparency at all - no one but the mods and the poster knows about the punishment. Do you really think someone will see the post and go "oh, I assume that's a violation of the rules and the poster got punished for it, I'll better not post the same things"?

Christ, a big part of my criticism is that the transparency you mention is not there, and that people cannot learn from those mistakes!.
