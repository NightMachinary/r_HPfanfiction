You're missing the context: Starfox was one of DLP's top 5 all time trolls. By the time that post came about he had already received multiple temporary bans for said trolling.

Starfox didn't quit the site, he was banned (a ban that has now expired). He now makes it his mission to seek out conversations about DLP all over the internet and talk about the injustice of it all.
