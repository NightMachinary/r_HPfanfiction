If posting such sexist and vulgar flames were not allowed, then they would have been deleted. By leaving them there the admins cleary condone and support such insults.

Just imagine someone would get an infraction for sharing WbA stories, but the threads with the links were left alone - makes no sense, right? The same goes for insults.

Admins who leave that kind of posts standing clearly show just how serious they are about posting rules and the quality of posters.
