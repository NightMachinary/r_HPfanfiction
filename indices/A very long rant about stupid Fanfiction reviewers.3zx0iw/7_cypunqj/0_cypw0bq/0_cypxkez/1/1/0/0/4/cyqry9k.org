Hi, I'm your friend, the ticking timebomb.

I told Starfox he was an idiot because, if you followed the link in my post in that thread, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hermione-granger-and-the-marriage-law-revolution-harry-potter-complete.324623/page-18#post-16287913][I'd already explained rather nicely that his fanfic was terrible.]]

That argument went on for about 20 posts, and covered a /swathe/ of ignorance. Starfox proceeded to claim that not only was I wrong about purebloods and they did in fact hate all muggleborns, but also that Luna has PTSD, and that Hermione would be totally onboard with starting a fascist regime to end Pureblood Supremacy by having them all wear a little symbol sewn to all their clothing.
