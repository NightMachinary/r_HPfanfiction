I found [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28242][that thread]]. The infraction must be posted elsewhere, because /seven people/ gave a thumbs up to the user's bizarrely incoherent rant about HPatMLR.

I see a lot of misdirection on this subreddit that generally goes like, "People who don't like DLP haven't been there since 200X, so they don't know that it's now quite tame."

This was eleven months ago and IMO [[/u/Starfox5]] didn't even post the most hateful part of that person's speech:

  Are you a gibbering ignormaus, or a mindless tool who just can't comprehend the idea of something as simple as magic? This isn't fucking Introduction to Algebra, [...] This is basic logic. [...] God. I hate you so much.

Since 2/3 of our mods are DLP members I hope they can tell us if this 'Frantic Author' is here on [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. I feel like we have a right to know if one of their mates is lurking like a ticking timebomb.
