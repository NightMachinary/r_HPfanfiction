The harsh but accurate criticism came first, and after your lack of response to it, general desire not to improve in any way shape or form, and stubborn clinging to frankly idiotic points and ideas about canon and storytelling is when the personal insults began.

The criticism was constructive, mate, it was you who was the problem. But keep telling yourself otherwise.
