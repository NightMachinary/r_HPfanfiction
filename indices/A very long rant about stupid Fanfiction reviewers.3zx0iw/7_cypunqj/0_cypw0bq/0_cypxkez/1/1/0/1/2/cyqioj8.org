Mods only really delete posts that are completely worthless or trolling. It's a far different philosophy of moderation than the one you seem to be trying to impose upon the site. At DLP, the mods simply try to make sure discussion remains mostly on-topic. Insults and harsh criticism are somewhat expected and almost encouraged due to DLP's holding itself to a higher standard. It doesn't believe in being a hugbox, and people speaking their opinions, however harsh, is encouraged as long as it isn't completely without merit, repetitive, or trolling.

In your case, Starfox (since I am personally familiar with your presence on the DLP forums) the insults levied in your direction were not completely worthless or trolling. The person who called you an enormous cockgobbling faglord actually had a very strong point.
