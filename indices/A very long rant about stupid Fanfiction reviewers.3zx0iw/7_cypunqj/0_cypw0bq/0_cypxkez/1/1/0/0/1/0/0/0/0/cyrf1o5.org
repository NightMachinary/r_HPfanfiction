I'm going to preface this with: I'm not by any means saying 'your opinion is wrong, so shut up' so if I at all come across like that I apologise.

I think it boils down to DLP being a different culture than what you and others who share your opinion are used to. Frantic was perfectly within his right to be an asshole to Starfox based on what that specific user had done and posted previously.

The very point that people 'thumbed' his post in agreement speaks to that much. The staff didn't agree with how he said it, it was a basic consensus that he went too far and we made him aware of that via infraction and discussion with him about it.

You guys keep talking about 'how it sends a message'. But, that's the thing that's hard to get across to people who don't understand. DLP's Culture is self moderating for the most part. Incidents like this are significantly far apart and few in between, it simply isn't worth publicly lambasting a user for their behavior.

You argue that it needs to be done to 'inform other users whats unacceptable' but in regards to DLP you're wrong. The average member is smart enough to know what will be tolerated and what won't.

The members who aren't simply don't last. You may say 'that's horrible!' and that's an opinion that you're allowed to have, but it works for us and our members.

That's whats important---not attempting to appease people who wouldn't fit into the culture anyway.

DLP has never pretended to be anything it wasn't. When people join they know exactly what they're getting into, and if they don't then they soon find out and can decide they like it and stick around, or that they don't, and leave.

Then you have the other type of users like Starfox who stubbornly go against the forums culture, and then get upset when the user base lashes out against them.

I'm using 'culture' as a catch all term for expectations of behavior. People have repeatedly spoken of Starfox and the issues he had with the forum and the members, so I'm not going to rehash them.
