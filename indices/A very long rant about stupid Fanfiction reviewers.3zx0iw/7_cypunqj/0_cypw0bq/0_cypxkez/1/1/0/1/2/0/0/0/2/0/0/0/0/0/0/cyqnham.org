So what this whole thing comes down to is that you want us to remove a year-old comment because it insulted you.

I realise you have a differing view, but we just simply /don't/ censor people by deleting their posts - deletion is a tool for when there's little alternative. If someone insults you, it's not getting deleted. If someone insults a mod or an admin, it's not getting deleted either.

How it /was/ dealt with was by the usual, typically very effective method of infraction. Perhaps because /you/ personally disregard infractions and continue shitposting until you get banned, you consider them ineffective - for normal rational people, however, they get the message very quickly.

So no; we're not going to delete the year old post insulting you just because you're complaining about it now. And no, repeatedly claiming that we're 'condoning' certain behaviour just because we're not going to bend over backwards and retroactively rip down posts for you does not magically make it true.
