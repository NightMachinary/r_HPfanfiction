Oh. I fear that's simply me not being used to the reddit style, sorry. This wasn't meant to be directed at you specifically, but the thread in general. I much prefer the flat style of the forums ...

But yeah. People will be people, and if you personally conclude for yourself from the impressions that there are some you like and some you don't, it seems to me reasonable enough.
