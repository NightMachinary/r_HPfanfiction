If he starts pulling up year old ordeals with a forum, I'm not surprised they respond in kind. Seems perfectly reasonable to not want your name smeared by some guy who was, according to members of DLP, considered too dumb to be on the site, especially a year after the argument on the site itself ended.

Edit: am posting too much apparently, but [[/u/Starfox5]] My bad, you didn't insult anyone, merely a shitpost about a year old argument.
