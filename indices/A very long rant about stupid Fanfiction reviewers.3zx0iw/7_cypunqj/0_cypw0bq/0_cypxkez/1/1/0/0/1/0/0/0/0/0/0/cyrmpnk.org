  The one who got insulted should be informed that the one insulting them got told off; that the whole situation was noticed and there was a response at all, in other words.

  Now, if the one being insulted basically goaded the other person into insulting them? Tell him to not do that again while you notify them of the other's infraction, or better yet give them both an infraction and mutually notify the other to let them know to either stop fighting or shut up altogether

Unless the person who is having the issue with another member personally brings it to the attention of staff, then no I disagree that they should be told. Members for the most part are mature enough to deal with these issues on their own without needing a third party to slap them on the wrist.

There is an expectation of members these days of a certain amount of maturity. I always find a small little amusement when I see people refering to a DLP that for all intents and purposes stopped existing when the membership grew out of their teens. All that 'Dark!Harry edgelord' bullshit that's more of a stereotype by people who pride themselves on being ignorant of the forum and its content. DLP stopped taking itself seriously a while ago, though there are still users who exhibit that type of 'personality' and that's their choice. To be honest the reputation that DLP has probably benefits us more than it is a detriment since it does prevent people who would otherwise find the culture to be a shock to the system due to the expectation by the staff for the membership to deal with its own issues like an adult.

With that said, when interpersonal issues arise on the forum do arise from time to time---semi recently we had an issue of one member harassing the other on a regular basis. I brought them both aside and had a personal chat trying to get to the bottom of the issue. The instigator of the attacks said 'it was just a joke' and was warned that if it continued then they'd be removed from the forum.

They since have been removed from the forum due to directing this behavior at other users.

With THAT said, even if Starfox had straight up come to staff complaining---and he might have, it's been a while and I can't remember if he did---it's unlikely that any serious effort would have been made to 'correct the issue' due to Starfox's own behavior. If I'm being honest the whole situation was that Frantic said what everyone else was privately thinking, perhaps with significantly more vitriolic then most would have used.

By DLP's standards the members were obscenely patient with tolerating Starfox when he made a concerted effort to reject every effort they made to help him with his story and seemed to be 'proud' of the fact that he had.

  Because it's not about thick skin, really. And it's not about not appearing as something different from what you are. Well, that is unless you are a bunch of elitist self-entitled jerks (and “elitist” in a decidedly non-positive meaning), because subtle things like that make many people see you like this. Which, I hope, is not really how you want to be seen.

Like I said above, the reputation does have some small benefit for all parties involved. It keeps those who are unsuited for culture away. Of course occasionally you have people slipping through who aren't prepared to be thrown into the deep end---people who are used to homogeneous safe spaces. 'There is no war in Ba Sing Se.' so to speak.

I don't personally consider myself to be 'elitist' though I imagine some members might wear that as a badge of pride. I'm pretty inclusive and I encourage other people to be open minded when dealing with new members who don't 'fit in', even if they wouldn't be a traditional fit (eg: see syed). Most of the time it works out with either a new person deciding they like being treated as an adult, or simply deciding they just don't like it---either of which is perfectly fine and within their right to do.

Occasionally however, there are cases where someone will have an adverse reaction who decide to stick around and make a nuisance of themselves out of spite.

  (something which, if Starfox really has a history of trolling and really goaded the other party into insults, should probably have happened anyway, and to be honest if he refused to learn for however many messages then I'm not sure why people continued to waste effort on teaching him when he didn't want to learn)

Because despite all the decade old evidence to the contrary, DLP is a big softy at heart who wants nothing more than to help people who come to DLP seeking help. With that said, DLP is definitely a firm believer in tough love and is against coddling, both at an interpersonal level as well as a writing level.

I'm pretty sure I probably repeated myself a few times on certain points and sorry if I did. I'm in the middle of painting my house so this was more of a stream-of-consciousness post than anything.
