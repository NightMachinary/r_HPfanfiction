Your entire "criticism" was "you don't follow canon, so your story is terrible".

And I said "In this story, I don't follow canon like that". After which you proceeded to not only claim you couldn't have a parliament without democratic elections - ignoring the House of Lords in Britain as the most prominent example of such a body composed of inherited and appointed seats - but also demonstrate you never read the story at all, since you claim purebloods had to wear a little symbol were executed for being purebloods, ignoring the fact that only those who had committed or allowed murder or rape were executed (which, once again, saw a lot of historical examples after WW2) - and ignoring that many British and other purebloods fought for democracy and the new regime.

So, basically, you called me an idiot for not following canon in an AU while you either never read the story or lied about.

If that's the quality of reviews one can get from DLP, well...
