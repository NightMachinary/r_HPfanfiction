The justification of it aside, I think it still is kind of wrong to go at it that way with the infractions. I mean, in general it might be different, but in this particular case you had one user deliberately be insulting, past what one would think is the threshold for not being an asshole, towards another user, and even if they did get an infraction for it the very fact that the post got upvotes and the infraction went unknown to the one who got insulted makes it wrong.

Because it sends a certain kind of message to people, you know. For all the insulted party knew, the person doing the insulting did not get punished at all, and it's not their fault that they think this way.

And yes, I know there's more to this argument. But it's the wording that is the issue there, not the context. Though honestly, as someone who is not a member of that forum I really don't care one way or another.
