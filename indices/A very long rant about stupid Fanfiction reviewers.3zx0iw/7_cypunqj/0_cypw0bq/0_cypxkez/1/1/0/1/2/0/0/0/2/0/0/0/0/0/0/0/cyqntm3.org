What it comes down to is that on DLP, insults no matter how vulgar or sexist will not be deleted by the mods even if posting them violates DLP's own rules.

That says a lot about a forum culture. As I said before, it's up to each individual reader to decide if they want to frequent and participate in such a forum, or not.

But if some posters actually believe that the mods leaving such posts up without any sign of disapproval is not the same as condoning them then that casts some doubts on the quality or honesty of their reviews.
