And I am going to preface with this: it's not “you guys”.

Because you replied as if I was a uniform part of the whole that is this subreddit. I am not, and though I did agree with the other side this time that something is off, it kind of throws much of your reply into the metaphorical garbage bin due to it being directed not at the person you were replying to but rather at the unseen masses that probably aren't even listening.

That being said, I assure you I took no offence in any part of your message.

And this is because I am used to harsh critique, to both giving and receiving it; even more so, giving harsh critique to new workers is a fairly significant part of my work. So I know that sometimes strong words indeed are the best way.

However, there's one thing that serves as the line between giving harsh but fair critique and being a self-entitled jerk: making it non-personal.

What Starfox did do or did not do aside (and seriously, the situation with him here is a no-win for you anyway unless you were to basically link the highlights of his alleged troll career from your forum so you are probably just wasting time reacting to it anymore now), the thing with the message this is about is that the insults made it personal and the fact that the one getting insulted did not at all learn that the one doing the insulting got told off (the infraction, that is) means it did not stop being personal. And that's just bad.

Now, I do get your policy of not deleting or changing posts unless they are really out of place. And you know what? I can respect that; even more so, I think /that/ is a good policy to have. And, I like to think fairly obviously, Starfox's words about how you not deleting that means that you condone it are just a display of inanity to be ignored.

But if you want it to be harsh but not personal, as I think it should be if you are liberal with what words are being allowed and what words aren't, then the one who got insulted should be informed that the one insulting them got told off; that the whole situation was noticed and there was a response at all, in other words. It doesn't have to be public, even; heck, it's way better to just send a pritave message saying that there was an infraction and that's it, and if the public doesn't know what's acceptable and what isn't without public notifications then the public is stupid anyway. Now, if the one being insulted basically goaded the other person into insulting them? Tell him to not do that again while you notify them of the other's infraction, or better yet give them both an infraction and mutually notify the other to let them know to either stop fighting or shut up altogether (something which, if Starfox really has a history of trolling and really goaded the other party into insults, should probably have happened anyway, and to be honest if he refused to learn for however many messages then I'm not sure why people continued to waste effort on teaching him when he didn't want to learn).

Because it's not about thick skin, really. And it's not about not appearing as something different from what you are. Well, that is unless you /are/ a bunch of elitist self-entitled jerks (and “elitist” in a decidedly non-positive meaning), because subtle things like that make many people see you like this. Which, I hope, is not really how you want to be seen.

And the message I was talking about was about how the fact that the one insulted didn't know about the one doing the insulting being told off gives them a (false, but they don't know that) message that nobody cares if it does get personal, either against them or in general. That was my point; it's not about appeasing people who wouldn't fit (although I'm sure you could make a case about why Starfox wouldn't), but about telling someone who got hit with insults “yeah, we saw that, told them to back off, don't provoke them or something”. Because if you don't, some of the insulted ones will just shrug and get on with it but some others will decide that it had to be personal due to the forum being “elitist self-entitled jerks” and then basically try to annoy you the way Starfox does.

But, once again, I really don't really care since I'm not a member of your forum and honestly I'm only on this subreddit by chance (led here by Google while searching for something). It's just that a small thing like that makes people's opinion about it much worse, which may spur people into doing things like plagiarisng works from your forum, excusing it with how allegedly horrible you were because of stuff like that. Basically, those who have thick skin don't care either way, but those who don't ... some of them probably badmouth you just because they experienced something like that and thought that getting personal is allowed, and this does make some people act contrary to you just because.

Also, no insults were intended in this message either. Sorry, I couldn't find a place to put it near the beginning so it's the very last thing in the reply.
