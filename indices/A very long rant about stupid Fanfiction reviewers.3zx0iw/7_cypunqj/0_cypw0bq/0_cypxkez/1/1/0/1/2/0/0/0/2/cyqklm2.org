No, that's not what he said. Nitpicker coming through here, he said "It [Frantic Author's post] deserves more [likes], to be honest."

That's completely different, as it may not be about the fact that they agreed with his assessment of Starfox5 as a cockgargling faglord, but rather that they agreed that he was a mindless tool, a gibbering ignoramus or too dumb to figure out a revolving door.

But, perhaps when you consider that Starfox5 has gotten banned multiple times... you start to wonder.

In fact, I'm rather on [[/u/Naeblisecho]] and [[/u/Taure]] 's side in all this.

Personally, as a third party, I think they both come off as squabbling children, but I can understand if you get pissy when someone continually shitposts in what amounts to a snobby book club with the temper of 4chan.
