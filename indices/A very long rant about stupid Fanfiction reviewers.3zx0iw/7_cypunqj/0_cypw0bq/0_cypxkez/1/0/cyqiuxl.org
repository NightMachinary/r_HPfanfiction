  Can't speak for OP, but myself? I found it entirely too full of edgelords, who themselves forgive and gush over anything where Harry is a hard mofo NRA-member with a love of underage blowjobs.

I think your experience has been twisted by the fact that you wrote a Hermione wank fic. Of course if you take every positive attribute Harry has and give them to Hermione, in addition to her many pre-existing strengths, then people are going to review your fic as lacking an insufficiently strong Harry.
