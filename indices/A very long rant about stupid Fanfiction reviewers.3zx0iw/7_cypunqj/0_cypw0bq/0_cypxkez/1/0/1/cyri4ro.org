I...wasn't aware I was reviewed on DLP...as I am not a member and have never submitted anything to them for, you know, group review.

Not sure where /that/ came from. I'm basing this opinion solely on what was popular with the masses and linked from public threads in 2008-2012 or so, when I gave a shit what DLP thought and read their rec lists.

*edit

I notice no actual logical or factual arguments against my opinions, as well. Hmm.
