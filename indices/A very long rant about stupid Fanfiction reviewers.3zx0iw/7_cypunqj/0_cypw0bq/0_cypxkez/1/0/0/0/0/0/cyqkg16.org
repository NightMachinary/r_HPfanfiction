  I'm still not seeing how this is any different than this subreddit, lacking some of the rules of the sidebar.

I suppose the best of this subreddit is roughly equal to the best of DLP. The difference is in the average. DLP has a rule against "shitposting" whereas this sub does not. That means that DLP members who consistently post using bad English (unless it's their second language) or who consistently just write one-line opinions without any novel point of view or justification get banned.

There are two other main differences.

The first is that of focus. DLP moderators are very active in keeping threads on topic and substantive. Posts are regularly deleted/moved if they are too tangential to the thread topic. Threads are regularly closed if people are just repeating the same opinions without adding anything new. Arguments, while they're allowed to go on for a while, are broken up if they show no sign of stopping. The result of this is a high "density" of substantive content - you have none of this phenomenon on other forums where threads get interrupted for pages at a time by personal conversation between individual members. This thread, for example, would not exist on DLP. The whole discussion about DLP's standards and culture is a massive off-topic tangent and would have been shut down by a moderator early on.

The second is that of atmosphere. The liberal attitude towards insults is not culture-neutral. It helps generate an atmosphere that encourages people to speak their mind. Where a site has a "be nice to people" rule, it inevitably leads to people pulling punches with regards to content.
