  Unless anyone on DLP can provide bona fides that they are a professional editor or literary critic, the best anyone on that site can offer is an amateur's subjective opinion.

  What makes the DLP Brand of opinion inherently more valuable than what you would find here?

Because DLP does not go for the idea that all opinions are equally valid. You have to justify your opinion with argument, and if you don't, someone will call you out on it - vigorously.

When I review a fic I never say "this is bad because I don't like it". I always give /reasons/ for why a story element is bad. By explaining the reasoning, you don't need to take my word as an authority, as you would a professional critic. Rather, you can see that my reasoning is either good or argue the point.

An example from the Cadmean Victory thread:

  The criticism is "why would the author choose to make that part of the story in the first place?" not "that doesn't make sense within the story world". Any author can justify something within their world, because they have complete ability to arbitrarily determine people's beliefs, knowledge, character, magical law, etc. But that doesn't make it a good decision from an out-of-universe position.

  For example, with regards to Harry's jump in skill: yes, you can justify it in-universe by saying he was like that all along and this is an AU, but that doesn't explain the out-of-universe question: "why you would choose to declare your character as more skilled than canon rather than show them developing into someone who has more skill?". Character by development is simply superior writing to character by declaration. Whether or not the character is logical given that fictional universe's arbitrary axioms is irrelevant. It's the choice of axioms we're criticising, not the logical deduction that follows from them.

  Similarly, having Hermione be shallow and one dimensional and completely renege on her friendship with Harry. Sure, you can justify that in-universe with sufficient events and AU changes to her character. But again the question is: why would you want to? Why would you want to turn a reasonable, relatively 3D character into an antagonism machine that doesn't act like a human? Again, having characters who act like people is simply superior writing to having characters who act as plot devices.

  Also, with regards to clichés, there's another misunderstanding. People don't dislike clichés because they're common, they dislike them because they're bad. Some ideas are just intrinsically not good, because they require certain conditions to persist. For example, the idea of portrait!Salazar in the Chamber of Secrets tutoring Harry. It's not bad because it's been overused, it's bad because:

  1. If portraits had enough knowledge and sentience to teach magic, Hogwarts wouldn't need teachers.

  2. The story doesn't explain how Salazar Slytherin can speak modern English.

  3. The story doesn't explain how the books are written in modern English.

  4. It's too convenient for Harry. Good hero stories create conflict; convenience for the hero is anathema to good hero writing.

  5. It requires significant amounts of backtracking/reinterpretation of previous events which definitely happened in this AU (events of CoS).

  And here's the thing: even if you create in-universe reasons to explain all these points away, it's still not good writing, because the very fact that it's going to require heaps of exposition to justify means that it's weighing the story down. General writing maxim: if an idea is so at odds with the rest of your story that it will require a load of justification to shoe-horn into the plot, you shouldn't include it. If a writer is trying to justify something to the reader, they've already failed. Good writing doesn't need to justify things to the reader, because everything already feels right.
