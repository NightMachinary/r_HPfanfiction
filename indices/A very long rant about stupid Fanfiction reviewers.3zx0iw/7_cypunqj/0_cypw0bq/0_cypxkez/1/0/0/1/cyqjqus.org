DLP has multiple writers who have published professionally and at least one who makes a living off his writing. The site also has at least one publisher/editor and (though it's been awhile since he posted) at least one professional literary critic.

The site also has several professionals from other walks of life--attorneys, physicians, scientists, engineers, teachers.

Make of it what you will. I've been far more impressed with the level of criticism there than here.
