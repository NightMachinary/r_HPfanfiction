  Because DLP does not go for the idea that all opinions are equally valid. You have to justify your opinion with argument, and if you don't, someone will call you out on it - vigorously.

  When I review a fic I never say "this is bad because I don't like it". I always give reasons for why a story element is bad. By explaining the reasoning, you don't need to take my word as an authority, as you would a professional critic. Rather, you can see that my reasoning is either good or argue the point.

I'm still not seeing how this is any different than this subreddit, lacking some of the rules of the sidebar. I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xldgx/book_club_alexandra_potter/cy62wq0][a review]] of one of your stories indicating that I had several problems with it. I also made certain to tell anyone reading my review that my criticism only reflects my own taste. My review was just as scathing as 'Frantic Author's.' I just chose to stick with criticizing the story's lack of merit instead of descending into a personal attack.

The Cadmean Victory review you posted comes across as logical and coherent. I have every reason to believe that this is the normal flavour of review on DLP. It's all well and good to say that Starfox had been trolling for a long time, but the fact that you're all here dogpiling on him a year later just comes across as an obstinate 'He deserved it.'

Two wrongs don't make a right.
