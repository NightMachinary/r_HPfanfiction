When I last used to visit the site, the HP fanfiction threads had devolved to essentially Joe Hundredaire and his merry band of sycophants waxing long and tedious over whatever Joe wanted to talk about, which was usually femslash in the HP and/or Buffy universes or stream-of-consciousness blather about whatever new story JH was thinking about maybe writing someday that involved femslash in the HP and/or Buffy universes. Any attempts to discuss any other topic were routinely shouted down.

Oh, and the one other popular topic was bitching about DLP. (JH was, years after the fact, still licking his wounds after having been banned.)

It was rather similar to [[/r/hpfanfiction]] in this last regard, except without all the passive aggressive downvotes. I'm glad to hear that the complexion of the SB site has changed somewhat over the years.

Edit: missing word; also, added a sentence.
