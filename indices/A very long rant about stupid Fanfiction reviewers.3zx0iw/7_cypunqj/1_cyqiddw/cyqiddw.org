Agreed; posting your fic to a fic forum is a good way to get feedback these days. If you want people who are tough but fair but don't have DLP's particular biases, the three sister-sites [[http://forums.spacebattles.com][Space Battles]], [[http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com][Sufficient Velocity]], and [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com][Questionable Questing]] are worth a look. (They do have biases of their own, of course, but my sense is that there is more diversity of opinion. I also find their forum software to be a much better user experience than DLP.) The latter (QQ) also allows NSFW content, if that's what you are writing.

They are not dedicated to HP, but they (especially SB) have active HP fanfic discussion threads, and you can start your own story thread to solicit feedback as well.

For that matter, from what I've seen, this subreddit is a pretty good place to get feedback.
