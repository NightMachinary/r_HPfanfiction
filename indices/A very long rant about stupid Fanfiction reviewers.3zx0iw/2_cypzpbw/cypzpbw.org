The best reviews I have gotten in fanfiction are for my worst stuff. People LIKE thinly veiled torture porn that became rape porn between a sorcerous villain of great power versus a completely mundane human, written while drunk and tired.

People don't apparently like cerebral battles of wits between two wizards.

People like memes.

People dislike deconstructions of canon decisions.

People like romance.

People dislike romance that actually acknowledges their character nature and how they think.

Fanfiction has a strange audience, or I'm trying to make things more complicated than they need to be.
