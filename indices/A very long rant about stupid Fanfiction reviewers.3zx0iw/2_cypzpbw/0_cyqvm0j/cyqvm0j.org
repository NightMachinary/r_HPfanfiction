People like things that make them feel understood, in control, needed, or powerful. People don't like things that make them emotionally conflicted, embarrassed, or fearful. Fuck yeah moments, instant and perfect love, protagonists who have an answer to every question and rub it in.

Lots of fan fic, HPMOR and Robst and Perfect Lionheart being good examples, take advantage of that fact. This doesn't apply to everyone, but purely based on the numbers from fan fiction.net, it definitely seems to a thing in the ff community.
