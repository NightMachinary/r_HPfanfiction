My big problem is that when I try to search for something new to read, I sort by number of favorites (because it gives marginally more promising results than sorting by most recent) and then I end up with pages and pages of the sort of thing you linked because so many readers actually enjoy it. Trying to evaluate a story by the number of positive reviews is essentially useless for the same reason.

I read the fic you linked, out of curiosity, and I don't know how someone could read it and not cringe. I was optimistic for the first two sentences and then that went away very quickly.
