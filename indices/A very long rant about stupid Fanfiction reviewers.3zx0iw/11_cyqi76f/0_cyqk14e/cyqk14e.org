I'd argue that, for fanfiction.net itself, adding a rating system is a bad idea.

FF.net is a good place for first time writers, often young people, to try out creative writing. It'd probably be really demoralising receiving bad ratings on the first ever thing you made, and would put a lot of people off writing more! The current system is much more 'positive feedback only' - the people who review are the ones who care enough to leave a genuine comment about it. It's much more of a friendly environment for writers to develop in, even if it isn't the best for readers.
