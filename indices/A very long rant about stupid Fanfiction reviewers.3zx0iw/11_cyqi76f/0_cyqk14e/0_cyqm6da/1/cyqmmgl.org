I completely agree with you - as a reader, having some sort of rating/review system is invaluable. We actually do have this, if you didn't know - at DLP there is a forum called [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][The Library]]. Readers submit stories they think are worthwhile, and then reviewers rate them and leave typically fairly extensive reviews.

You don't need to be a member to browse - come have a look if you're interested. The only downside is that there are definitely certain types of stories that you may enjoy more that the community at DLP doesn't - you'd very rarely ever see slash recommended, for instance. But overall it's an excellent place to get find a lot of truly excellent stories, or the more fun [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=41][guilty pleasures]] if you're interested in those too.

There's a pretty cool feature worth mentioning - there's a system that learns from what ratings you give stories and uses this to recommend you other stories that people who share your tastes really enjoy too. You can find that [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/recommended.php][here.]]

I'm a moderator the the DLP forums, so feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any questions.
