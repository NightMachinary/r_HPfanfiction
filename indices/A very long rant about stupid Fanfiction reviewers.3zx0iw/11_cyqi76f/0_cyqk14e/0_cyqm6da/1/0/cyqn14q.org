I've been lurking DLP for several years, and there is a number of reasons I've chosen to not participate, some of them pertaining to DLP and its issues and others pertaining to me and my issues; I don't want to get into that here.

Indeed, I would count the DLP Library as an extended Favorites lists useful for a particular subfandom, and it's good to have a place where at least the best of /that/ subfandom is crowdsourced, even if it's not one to which I belong. (Again, I don't want to get into /that/ discussion.)

The adaptive recommendation engine sounds intriguing. I'll definitely take a look.
