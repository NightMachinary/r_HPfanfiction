Perhaps it's my self-interest as a reader speaking, but reader time is precious. There is, currently, more HP fanfic on FF.net that could be read in a human lifetime. A system that does not provide some useful way to figure out what /not/ to read is a system that is failing the readers. Some rudimentary filtering is possible, of course: 'ships, summaries, word counts, but they are only indicative of the subfandom in which the fic resides, which still leaves too many.

And, I don't think that it helps beginning writers that much: I know I have come to rely on either personal recommendations or favorite lists more than reviews --- and I know that I'm not the only one --- and this means that rich get richer: the better a fic is known already, the more likely it is to be recommended here and elsewhere. A robust review and rating system would allow a reader to draw on the proverbial wisdom of the crowds as well, perhaps even control for such factors as how long a fic has been around.

Furthermore, I've outlined how the current system discourages critical reviews --- so how is this hypothetical new writer going to improve without feedback as to the areas that can be improved?

I don't know exactly how one might set up something like that on FF.net, but I believe the benefits would outweigh the costs.
