Ah I would counter that with the number 265. That is, there are 265,000 stories marked complete on ffnet, of which 94k are below 1000 words, 122k between 1000 and 5000, and just 3700 fics over 100k. At 200 words per minute, I estimate on the high end it would take 30 years just doing some quick math.

also it was a joke.
