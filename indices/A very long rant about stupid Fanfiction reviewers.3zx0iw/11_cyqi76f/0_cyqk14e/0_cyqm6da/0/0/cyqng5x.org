I don't need faith when I have data: HP section currently has 732 thousand fics, which, if one is able to read fanfic for a very generous 90 years of one's life, comes out to a bit more than 22 fics per day, every day. Assuming one can dedicate 16 hours a day to reading the fic (with sleep and bodily needs taking up the rest), that's 1.4 fics per hour. Unfortunately, here, I don't have data on what the average length of a fanfic is. It might be doable in theory, with very generous assumptions.

Of course, can a person who does nothing but read fanfic still be considered "human"? Discuss.
