I think that part of the problem is that there is a review system, but there is no rating system, and review count gets used as a proxy for endorsements --- how popular a fic is. This is not intentional on anybody's part, I don't think, but it just emerged this way. So, someone who doesn't like a fic might be more reluctant to leave a review, since once it scrolls off the first page of reviews, it'll just add to the total "popularity" count.

Add to that that there is a sizable constituency that regards any negative comments about a fic as bullying or worse, and it's easier to just move on and look for something better to read.

I think FF.net might benefit from an Amazon-like way of displaying them: let the reviewer indicate whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral, and then show

1. How many of each kind there are.
2. The top (or the most recent) reviews of each kind.

Such as system would not be immune to being gamed, but it'd be better than nothing.
