When I'm posting reviews, I usually just want to show the author that I read and liked the story. If I don't like a story's concept or basic plot, I rarely post anything, since that's a matter of personal taste in my opinion. If I like the plot/idea, but dislike some part of how it's executed (grammar, plot hole, etc.), I may add that to a review, though depending on the exact criticism, I might as well write a PM - if I notice for example a spelling mistake or a weird translation, I don't think that should be left in a public review.
