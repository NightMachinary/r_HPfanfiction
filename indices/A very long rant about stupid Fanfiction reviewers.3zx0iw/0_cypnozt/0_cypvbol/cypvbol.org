This. This is the thing I hate more than anything. Forget the blanket positive reviews, forget the flames. Update soon/more please/new chapter soon are my biggest 'AAAAARGH' moment because for some idiotic reason, I get 3 of them within /minutes/ of posting a new chapter on my main fic.

I honestly think they wrote a bot to do it.
