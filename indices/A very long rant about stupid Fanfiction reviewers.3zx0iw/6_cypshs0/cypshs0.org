If you're writing fanfiction to improve your writing skills, I guess reviewers who don't help are absolutely worthless for you, but if you're only writing fanfiction because it's fun and not for skills, reviewers who point out every flaw in your writing must be quite annoying. I see authors asking for criticism, and authors who tell us they don't want criticism. Both are okay. Both should be okay. You're getting great feedback and improving, good job. You're having fun and other people who read your story had great fun too, good job.

I think it's a simple matter of telling people what you want, and people being polite about it. If reviewers are going against what the author asked for, then they are stupid, yes.

I personally refrain from reviewing when I read anything by someone that seems to be serious about reviews. Surely the author wouldn't want a review from such an uneducated reader like me. Seriously, I haven't enough grammar in my head to write a review, let alone criticize a story. I will, on the other hand, try writing what I liked about a story, if the author is okay with simple reviews like "hi I liked how you described this".
