I don't think the point was that they don't offer constructive advice, more that they seem to offer blanket (and even over-the-top) praise where it may not be earned. Far better to say, "I like this!" than to say "Your use of in-character decisions and believable interactions is superb!" when maybe they aren't qualified to give that feedback.

Anyway, as OP noted, it's a rant. It isn't really a call to action or a suggestion on how to change it.

You're right of course -- it's kind of the standard reaction. People that love the idea / pairing / etc, will gush about it and you won't generally get good beta/editing feedback from the average reader.
