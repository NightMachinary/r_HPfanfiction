I'm not quite sure what the problem is here. You seem to be blaming stupid and ignorant people for not offering advice on things they know nothing about, such as characterization and story structure, and other things of that nature. One would think that this is a good thing, as any advice they give would likely be severely flawed.

In other words, get a professional editor if you want a comprehensive review. Go on FFN if you want reaffirmation.
