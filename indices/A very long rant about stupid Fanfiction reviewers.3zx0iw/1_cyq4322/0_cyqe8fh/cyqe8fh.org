Strangely enough, the last review for my story was:

#+begin_quote
  I hope you die a painful death/;
#+end_quote

I mean... as soon as you put something up on FFN, you're opening the floodgates. I think "Reviews" should really be called "Comments" or something, since that's essentially what they are.

I've gotten, hm, maybe a dozen-ish reviews that made me actually tilt my head and re-think something in my story? I.e. "useful" reviews. The rest is just... gravy. Getting a really motivational review where I can tell the reader really felt something, really enjoyed what they read and wanted to reach out, that's cool, I like it, it's motivational. There's tons of chaff, too. The odd "wtf" comment. Really, though, reviews are just kind of ... there.

Like, if I were counting on the reviews section of a FFN piece to provide actual insight for a) the writer or b) a potential reader as to "is this story good", lolno.
