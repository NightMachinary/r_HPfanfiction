The last review I received (yesterday) was, quoting:

#+begin_quote
  lets put my cock in your ass
#+end_quote

This was on a 1000+ review story that's been generally well received over the years.

I just roll with reviews, good or bad, informative or not, taking from them what I can. Some are great and make me wish to write more, some are attempts to rip me down and make me wish to take down my stories. Some are astute, yet some others so completely missing the point that I wonder if the reviewer has even read the piece. I've a handful of cherished reviews that completely changed how I approach the craft of writing (nonjon, e.g., left a two-thousand-word review several years back on one of my stories when I was new to writing that was probably the most substantive I've ever received).

My best writing is lightly reviewed and not well received. (Hell, my very best writing is an original fiction novel that remains unpublished.) One of the schlocky, bog-standard, fanfiction pieces I barfed out early in my fanfiction writing has a million hits and thousands of favorites. I've a story with one review per 2.2 words.

But none of it matters in the end. Reviews are part of the dialogue, of the culture, of what makes fanfiction special and distinct from original fiction, but they really aren't all that. (See MoR.)
