I get this. Now, if I am really into the story, I will tend to use the review button as a way to give the author on how I feel about where the characters are going, my own personal way to rant at the characters stupidity, kinda like yelling at the telly when your team fucked up or trying to get the idiots to get the fuck away from the crazy people. I will give critiques when I feel the absolute need too, like really shitty stories that I gave a shot or stories that pull you in and you are dying for more. Though nowadays, I tend to leave a note for those authors that are being completely lazy and sticking with Dorea & Charles as James' parents, ugh, the evidence pointed away from these two even before the truth came out.
