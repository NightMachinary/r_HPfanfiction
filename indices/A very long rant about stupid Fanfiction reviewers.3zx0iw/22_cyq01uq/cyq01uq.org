This is sometimes a problem for me, too.... Not that I read much FF, but for the crap I write, it makes me wonder, is my story really worthy of this praise? Or are these people just saying this because I'm writing something that fits their particular headcanon or hits their happy button or whatever? But I always put that any kind of feedback is welcome, and there's nothing more I can do, so most times I just shrug it off. After all, a little criticism would reassure me, but the threat of DLP-level soul-crushing snarky teardowns (which I probably deserve but don't want) make me feel this is a 'be careful what you wish for' situation....
