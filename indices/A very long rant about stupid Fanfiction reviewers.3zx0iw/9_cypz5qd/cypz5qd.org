Personally, I only give my reviews a cursory glance because I don't really care about them. And because most are just iterations of "I like this" (which is why I love that AO3 has a kudos button because it limits these inane reviews to a minimum). I look to my beta readers to give constructive feedback.

I'm convinced that this is partly a problem that was created by the desperate fanfic writers that go on and on in their author's notes about reviews, practically begging for them, if not outright demanding reviews in order to continue the story. These people only really care about the number, not the quality of reviews. They just want you to stroke their massively misplaced ego.

In my experience, most of the fandoms I'm interested in are saturated in fanfic written by people who act like this and so most of the fanfic in that fandom as a whole appear to be subjected to shitty reviews.

And /that's/ the way the cookie crumbles.
