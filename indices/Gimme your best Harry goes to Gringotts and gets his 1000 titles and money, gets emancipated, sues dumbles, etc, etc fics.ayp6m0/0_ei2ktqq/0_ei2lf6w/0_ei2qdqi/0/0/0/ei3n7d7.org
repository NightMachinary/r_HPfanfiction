In Best Served Cold --- linkffn(12149140) --- Harry time travels back to the past; he briefly mentions how Neville was his supplier. There's a couple other mentions, and it becomes a slightly minor plot point, though it's not a huge point of the story. Saying more would give away the story.

It's abandoned, unfortunately, and takes a strange turn towards the end. But it has its moments.
