I've just finished this. In my opinion it does really well with not making the kids overly smart but still well above average and making Harry work for his powers even if he doesn't use all of them. (but hey, Ravenclaw, right? Knowledge for the sake of knowledge. If he sought skills for an ultimate goal he would've been a Slytherin.) ;)

Thank you again for the rec!
