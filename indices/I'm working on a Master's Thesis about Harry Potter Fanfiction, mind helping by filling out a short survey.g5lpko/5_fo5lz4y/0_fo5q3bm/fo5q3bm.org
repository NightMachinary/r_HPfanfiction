You're right, though. The design of the survey prevents people responding along the lines that they do not believe there is a concrete characterisation of Daphne/Susan/Tracey but rather authors can write them however they like.

It's assuming its own conclusion and preventing people from giving responses which would disprove that there is a "fanon characterisation".
