I kind of wish you had more dynamic personality options. Kind of like snooty, suspicious, paranoid, anxious, conformist, opportunist etc. There are some options that I looked for for some characters and were a little sad they weren't there, as it made the options I did pick seem shallow for a character. Also I think adding in a length of time the person has been reading HP Fanfic may have helped your data.
