There seems to be an error in your survey. The instructions say something like 'if you are not familiar with a character, don't put anything' but all characters are counted as a 'required question', making it so that choosing nothing is impossible. This is especially odd for the questions about Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis, since those two are basically non-entities in canon. Did you intend for people to give their impressions from fanon rather than canon?
