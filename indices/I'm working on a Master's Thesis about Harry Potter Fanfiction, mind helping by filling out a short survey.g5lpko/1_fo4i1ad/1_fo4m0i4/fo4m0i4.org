I've always loved that we have concrete fanon interpretations of characters within our own fandoms and wanted to examine the phenomona in greater detail. It's hopefully leading into further research on Fanfiction including studies into how tropes evolve and cross from one fandom to another, how fanfiction of fanfiction arrises, and then also categorising fanfiction genres and subgenres with academically backed definitions.

Then there was also an ongoing interest in what does and does not class as fanfiction, as the medium has been looked down on for a significant period of time and derived as not being 'real literature' which I would look to debunk by postulating that a large number of 'Great Works' are in fact fanfiction, such as the Aenied, Dante's Inferno, and Paradise Lost
