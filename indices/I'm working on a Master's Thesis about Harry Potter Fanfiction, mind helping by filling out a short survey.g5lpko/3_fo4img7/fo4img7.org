Done. Seems to be a lot of redundant synonyms in the characteristics e.g. mean/nasty, neat/tidy, clever/smart, etc. Also felt like "principled" was missing as it's an important trait of several characters.

Also the Daphne/Susan/Tracey options are kinda flawed. There's no option for "I am familiar with who this character is but I believe them to be a blank slate with no characteristics." So I just selected "not familiar".
