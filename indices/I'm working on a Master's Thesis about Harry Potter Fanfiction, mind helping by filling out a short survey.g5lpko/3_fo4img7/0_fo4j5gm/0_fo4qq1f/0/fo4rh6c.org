Perhaps the more common form of that type question in surveys:

"On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is mostly X trait and 5 is mostly Y trait, is the character X or Y?"

However, part of the problem I had when choosing traits for each character is that none of them are so black and white. The characters change significantly over the course of the books, and they exhibit one set of traits towards their allies while behaving with the opposite traits towards their enemies.
