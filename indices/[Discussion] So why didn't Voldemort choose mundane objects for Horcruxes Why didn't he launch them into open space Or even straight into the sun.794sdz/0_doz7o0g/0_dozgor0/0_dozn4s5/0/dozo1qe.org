Well, maybe. We really don't know the levels of protections on horcruxes. It might be that they could destroy them with thermite, and it might be that they can't even be destroyed by a blue star. Since they never did experiments in canon there's just no way to be sure. (Btw thermite can get nearly as hot as the sun's surface)
