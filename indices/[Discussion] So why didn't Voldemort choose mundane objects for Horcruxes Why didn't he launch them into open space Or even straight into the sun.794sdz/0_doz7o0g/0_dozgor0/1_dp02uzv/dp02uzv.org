I'm reasonably sure JK did say that a bullet would penetrate most non-physical magical shielding we see in HP, so with that logic, maybe magic works by â€˜it seems like sufficient force'.

So, while leaving a Horcrux in a heavily irradiated room or bombard it with radioactive particles or wavelengths might not do much, but a recogniseably devastating effect on it like a Nagasaki-level A bomb feels like it should, so it would.

Throwing it in a normal fire wouldn't work because fire is something we can mostly control nowadays, but maybe a few thousand years ago the magic would have allowed you to toss it into the fireplace, because fire was still this slightly supernatural thing?

My fanon has always been that the caster shapes the effectivacy of the spell, and it might apply when magic collides: whose belief is stronger? The horcrux maker or the attempted breaker
