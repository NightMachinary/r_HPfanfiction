Cool fanon but I have a questions...

#+begin_quote
  non-physical magical shielding
#+end_quote

Yeah wouldn't it make sense for a physical object to be able to pierce a non-physical shield? Did she ever say anything on the effect of a bullet on physical shielding?

EDIT: did you mean non physical like protego would be non physical while a literal shield made of metal and then enchanted would be a physical magical shield?

Also remember Voldemort grew during WW2 so he would know plenty about bombs ... Maybe not nuclear ones unless he kept up with muggle news, but that isn't entriely impossible since he had to go back to the orphanage every year.
