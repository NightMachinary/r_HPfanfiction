Well I don't recall it saying the diary wasn't magical before he used it. It wouldn't surprise me if it was magical with some spells on it to protect it from being damaged by water or something most young men or women might be worried about, mind you I am not saying it was made magically or sold to him magically but he may have put spells on it after getting it.

As for launching it into space, he would possibly have been able to with spells but unlikley. Also he would want to know where they where and their status in the event he thought he might need one. It would have been more intelligent to simple take one like the ring and go to a muggle construction site and put it in a area being filled with cement, or better put it in a muggle safe charmed and protected by runes and wards before having it dropped into the ocean near the south pole.

As for the sun, it would destroy it. It also would be at risk of being destroyed with reentry or risk of being destroyed by any number of space debris and the like in space.
