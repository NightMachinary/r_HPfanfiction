My theory is that the creator must have some emotional attachment to the object made into a Horcrux. This is clearest with the diary and Nagini, but even the founder's objects and the ring jade a strong connection to home and/or family to Voldy. The foil to this theory is the accidental scar Horcrux, but he still felt a combination of fear and hatred towards Harry, which might have been enough.
