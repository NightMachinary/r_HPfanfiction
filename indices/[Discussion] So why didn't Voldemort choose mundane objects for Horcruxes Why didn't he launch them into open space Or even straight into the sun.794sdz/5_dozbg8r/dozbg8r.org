A piece of fanon I like is that Horcruxes need to be objects of significance. That can be personal significance---e.g. Riddle's diary---or magical artifacts. But a random rock or whatever lacks the metaphysical power to anchor one's soul.

The alternative is that Voldemort is really dumb, which doesn't make for a good story.
