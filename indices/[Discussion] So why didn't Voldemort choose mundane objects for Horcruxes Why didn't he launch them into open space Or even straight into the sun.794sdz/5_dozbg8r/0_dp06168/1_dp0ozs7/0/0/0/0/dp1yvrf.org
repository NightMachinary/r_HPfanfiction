I think in hp magic it's really up to the caster what is a thing and what is not. Some magic is about emotions and those are highly subjective, what Harry thinks of to cast his patronus is different from what Umbridge thinks of. So, most people wouldn't be able to think of a living being as a thing, but someone like Riddle probably would.
