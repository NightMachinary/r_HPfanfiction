HP metaphysics implicitly put a pretty high price on human life. Biological immortality through the Philosopher's Stone is just as priceless as all of the gold that the Stone could provide; and if nothing else, human lives are valuable because you have to snuff them out in order to create Horcruxes.

The act of murder is (symbolically and magically) important; it splits your soul because it puts you on the road to devaluing other human lives, and the road to putting your own ends above the lives of other people. That says a lot about the true value of a life, if it's (literally) wholesome to hold human life in esteem, and depraved or (literally) unwholesome to put it down.
