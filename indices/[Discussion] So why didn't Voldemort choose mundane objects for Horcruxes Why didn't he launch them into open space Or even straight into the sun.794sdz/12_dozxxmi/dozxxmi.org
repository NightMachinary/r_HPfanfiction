Thing is....it's something WE'D think of, and that Harry and co would think of, but before Voldemort, who really knew about them? I gather it was extremely obscure, and not often done. It was regarded, I suspect, as an ancient evil, a historical thing, not something done today. And who would think of multiple ones? It was unheard of. Herpo only made one. Even if someone did think, hey, he's not dying, I wonder if he has a Horcrux, they'd never think he had seven, let alone two.

Only reason they knew was Slughorn. Dumbledore suspected, because the Diary was killed, but Voldemort still lived, and he suspected Harry. Before Diary, I don't think he knew.
