In the fic I'm writing, one of the caveats of creating a Horcrux is that the item needs to have significance to the creator. Hence, Voldemort turning a personal diary, a family heirloom, three artifacts belonging to the founders of the institute he considered a home, and a snake, with which he surrounded himself with the imagery of. (Harry isn't a true Horcrux, but he does sort of fit as being a potential threat.)
