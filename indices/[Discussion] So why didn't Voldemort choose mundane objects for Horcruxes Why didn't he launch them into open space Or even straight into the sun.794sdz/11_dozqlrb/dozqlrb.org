We know that making multiple horcruxes is something only Voldemort figured out how to do. Perhaps him being sentimental about it is actually the reason why he can create so many. In fact, this may be true of all horcruxes in general. If you're going to place a piece of your soul in something, it makes sense that it would have to be something you care about.

In fact, this could be a very crucial weakness to horcruxes in general.

Also, a diary may be physically mundane, but it would have more meaning to Voldemort himself.
