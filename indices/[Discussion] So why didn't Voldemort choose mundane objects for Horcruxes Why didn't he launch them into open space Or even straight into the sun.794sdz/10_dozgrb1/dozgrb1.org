I was under the impression that the diary was at least partially an accident, but even so it was probably his most important possession at that time in his life outside his wand. The ring is proof of his wizarding heritage which traces back to Slytherin and in some ways a chance to mock the family that abandoned him, at least in his eyes. The locket, cup, and diadem are all founders objects and it would show immense amount of intelligence and ability to even locate the three of them much less corrupt them with his dark magic. They are also less likely to be destroyed by people who come across them even if they recognize the foul magic that has corrupted them because of their connection to legendary witches and wizards.
