I think you're misunderstanding something important --- the Hocruxes don't "develop" a mind of their own. They naturally /have/ a mind of their own, because /they have a soul inside them/. Riddle's Diary didn't have more power because it was an "early" Horcrux, either, but because Voldemort spelled it that way because unlike the Locket, he meant for his diary self to be an ally to him, with the whole "lead another to finish Slytherin's work" thing.
