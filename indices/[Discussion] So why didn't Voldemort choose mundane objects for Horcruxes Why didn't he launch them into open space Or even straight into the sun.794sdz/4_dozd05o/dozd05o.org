Horcruxes are not justs sock-portkeys (and those have a meaning still: they are both travel-related).\\
They are both a part of yourself and a mean to immortality.\\
My head-canon is that, regarding such a potent act as the creation of a horcrux, everything has a meaning: the place and target of the murder, the item used, the place where it is stored, defenses around.

A diary is an item in which one pours his soul (figuratively), and that is not read by other before one's death. A person still remembered a millenia after his death has attained a form of immortality, and their relics are a proof of their existence as well as a conduit for their immortality (locket, cup, ring, tiara); it is said that immortality can only be reached through one's children (Harry); and the snake is a reference to the ouroboros, an eternal cycle.\\
The murder of Myrtle stands for life stolen : the sacrifice of a young life against continuation of another; his paternal family allows him to detach himself from the anchor of family; Hepzibah Smith represent immortality through children obtained (she is descended from Hufflepuff), and as a mirror, Lily and Harry represent the struggle to reach said immortality through children.\\
The cave where L.V. discovered his power over others; the school where he grew into said power; the house of his family, forgotten for his quest of immortality; the house of another family, one with an old name, ever remembered; the bank representing at the same time power and stability, not in his own account but in the one of a family he uses in his quest (leaching the life and power of others); at his side, always, for the rebirth symbol after his own rebirth.

Magic is highly symbolic (see: first year transfiguration); you don't just create a horcrux murdering a passer-by, with a stone, and let it drown in an oceanic trench, there's not enough meaning, no meaning at all. That's why Dumbledore seeks the way he does, through a study of Voldemort's life : he is seaking what means what for L.V., what acts, places, items, people, have an importance for him. That's why it is easier to create a boot-portkey, that's the 3 brothers tales moral for adults (fables always have had several level).

That's may not be canon explanation, but it makes canon much less non-sensical.
