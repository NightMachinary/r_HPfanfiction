In addition to what you wrote, the object that would be chosen for a Horcrux may have to be magically powerful. The Ring contained the Resurrection Stone, and probably was powerful in its own right. The Locket and the Cup were Founder's artifacts that although we don't know anything about, very likely had some importance (for the Cup, think chalices and their connection to life or death), the Diadem granted great intelligence, Nagini was definitely a magical snake, or else Voldemort would never have chosen her, for the diary, as brilliant as Tom Riddle was, it is fairly likely that he could have made it into a magical artifact, and Harry Potter was either magically powerful before or because of the prophecy.
