It is an interesting subject but when I consider it a little I could not stop imagining the Weasley house, like the cartoon called "The Loud House" and for a few moments I put Ronald in place of Lincon and it really made me laugh, they think a semi crossover, with the Weasley family instead of the Loud?

Maybe Ginny instead of Lincon, but for some reason I find Ronald instead of Lincon funny and seeing what crazy things happen, does anyone find it interesting to expand on it?
