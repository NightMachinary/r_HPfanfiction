Since canon Weasleys named their sons after (British/Germanic) royalties, they would name their daughters that way too:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain][Anne]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine][Eleanor]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I][Elizabeth]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_of_Normandy][Emma]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Matilda][Matilda]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria][Victoria]]

--------------

Chronologically speaking, Ginevra/Guinevere would be the first, followed by Emma, Matilda, Eleanor, Elizabeth, Anne, and Victoria. Eleanor and Elizabeth would be the twins. Anne would then be this world's Ron.

So when canon Ginny wakes up in this new dimension, she becomes confused when Molly calls her Victoria. "But I'm Ginny, not some Victoria!"

"Oh here we go again, Vicky. You just can't stop pretending to be your favorite big sister!" Replied Molly bemusedly.
