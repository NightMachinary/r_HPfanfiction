The library at Nineveh in 700BCE had a catalogue. Its clay tablets were organized according to shape. The library at Alexandria also had a catalogue. I know that the magical world is behind the times where sense and sensibility is concerned, but 2700 years should be long enough for them to accept the idea.

But it would be thematically inconsistent. HP-verse rewards the search for knowledge. Anything readily accessible can't be powerful.
