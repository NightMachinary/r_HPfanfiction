Your question presupposes Hogwarts exists to provide an excellent education to the population of Wizarding Britain. I'd argue a compelling argument can be made that this is not the case. Hogwarts exists to /socialize/ the population and to give everyone a basic education sufficient for them to function without breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Beyond that a Hogwarts education seems laughably limited. Magic is steeped in a tradition of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow]["Things you're not meant to know"]] and the magical powers that be have little incentive for any more than an elite few to really delve deeply into the arts of sorcery. (And what is sorcery anyway? Mentioned in Dumbledore's titles in book 1 and never again...) The library is deliberately set up to make obtaining dangerous or powerful information difficult, and Mme. Pince is one of the gatekeepers of the power elite of British wizarding society.
