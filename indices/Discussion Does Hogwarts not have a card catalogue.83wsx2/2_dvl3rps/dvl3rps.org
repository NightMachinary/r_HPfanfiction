Well, I was going to discuss the history angle, but it appears that though the Dewey Decimal system wasn't invented until the 1800s, central categorization system are older, so wizards would have known of them in the 1600s, when International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was signed.

Most likely, the library didn't have a card catalogue because of plot reasons, and because JK didn't think of it.

I can't think of a real reason why the Hogwarts Library wouldn't have one.
