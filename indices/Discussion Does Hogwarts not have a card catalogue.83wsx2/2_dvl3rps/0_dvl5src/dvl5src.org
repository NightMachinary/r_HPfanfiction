  so wizards would have known of them in the 1600s, when International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was signed.

You're acting like the Hogwarts Library was /made/ in the 1600's. There's no reason to assume it hasn't been around since the Founders, and if so, then I would actually be more surprised if Hogwarts /had/ followed the times in /some/ way for a change. Wizards just don't like change as a culture, and if they all fondly remember their Hogwarts years with that sweet old messy Library as part of it, then no one is going to listen to that stuck-up Percy prat who says the system should, what, /make sense/? What a laughable Muggle idea.
