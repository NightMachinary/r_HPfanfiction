I agree. The only reason I can think of that might explain why they don't have a similar system set up at Hogwarts is if there's some magical way of catagorizing the books that required Madame Pince's help or in some other way left a record of the search. While this would be a terrible system for a school, it could be supported by the fact that Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew that Pince could have helped them in a second, but they intentionaly didn't ask because they wanted to keep their search secret.

  Most likely, the library didn't have a card catalogue because of plot reasons, and because JK didn't think of it.

I'm leaning more towards intentionally left out for plot reasons. I find it hard to believe a Classic Literature major would forget.
