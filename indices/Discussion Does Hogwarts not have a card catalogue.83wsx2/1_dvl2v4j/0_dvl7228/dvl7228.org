It's worth noting that Pottermore implies that you can use the Summoning Charm as also a searching Charm:

#+begin_quote
  *When you can summon any book, instrument or animal with a wave of the wand and the word Accio!*; when you can communicate with friends and acquaintances by means of owl, fire, Patronus, Howler, enchanted objects such as coins, or Apparate to visit them in person; when your newspaper has moving pictures and everyday objects sometimes talk to you, *then the internet does not seem a particularly exciting place*. This is not to say that you will never find a witch or wizard surfing the net; merely that they will generally be doing so out of slightly condescending curiosity, or else doing research in the field of Muggle Studies.

You can summon books, therefore the internet (which is strongly associated with searching for information) is not interesting to wizards. The fact that these two are considered causally linked implies that the internet provides nothing new or better compared to the Summoning Charm. While it's not explicit that you can use the Summoning Charm to search, the implication is pretty strong.

So fourth years and above would have a much easier time of locating materials.
