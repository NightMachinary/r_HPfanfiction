In theory you may be right, but from canon it doesn't /seem/ like books are cheap as dirt. Note that the Weasleys, with their tight budget, opt for handed-down textbooks, which I don't think they'd bother to do if books weren't rather expensive. I assume the fact that /Gemino/-multiplied objects decay faster is involved, and maybe wizarding editors charm their books to be unduplicable just to be safe?

P.S.: IIRC you /can/ multiply food, though, for the record, you just can't create it out of nothing.
