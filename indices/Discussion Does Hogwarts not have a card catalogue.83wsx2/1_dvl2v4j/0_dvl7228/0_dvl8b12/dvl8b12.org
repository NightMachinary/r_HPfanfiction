That's true. Isn't that the way that Hermione got all of those books about Horcruxes before they left Hogwarts? I still think a card catalog would be useful for summaries if nothing else. Why Summon a book that's not going to be useful? I kind of miss card catalogs from my days of working in the library in high school. Though more often I'd get in trouble for reading the books I was supposed to be shelving!
