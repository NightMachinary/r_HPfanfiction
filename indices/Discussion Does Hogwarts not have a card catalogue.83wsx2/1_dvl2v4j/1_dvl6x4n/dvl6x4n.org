Maybe I could get around it by having the card catalogue not be obvious or look like a muggle one. Hmm... then the OC could ask Hermione why she didn't look in the card catalogue for Nicholas Flamel and Hermione could have an amusing reaction...

As far as canon, maybe there is one but Madam Pince doesn't let the students use it because she's a control freak?
