I agree that it seems weird that there wouldn't be a card catalog, especially a magical one. I don't know what mechanism you chose, but I could see one where you pull the card or tap it with your wand and the book flies through the library to you. Plus, it's a lot of work for Madam Pince to go hunting down all of the books that the kids want or need.

As far as I know, the Dewey Decimal system is used in the UK and it would be interesting to see a magical spin on it. I think the lack of a card catalog was JKR needing to find a way to delay discovery of the Flamels to serve the plot she'd created.

Regarding your creation, don't feel like you have to take it out because it's not strictly canon. It sounds like a fun thing!
