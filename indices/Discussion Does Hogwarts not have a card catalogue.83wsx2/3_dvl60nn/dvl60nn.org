The answer is simple: tradition. There's no reason to assume the Library hasn't been around since the Founders, and if so, then I would actually be more surprised if Hogwarts /had/ followed the times in /some/ way for a change. Wizards just don't like change as a culture, and if they all fondly remember their Hogwarts years with that sweet old messy Library as part of it, then no one is going to listen to that stuck-up Percy prat who says the system should, what, /make sense/? What a laughable Muggle idea.

And to supplement this, again, wizards and logic are distantly estranged relatives. The same wizards who think time-travel is a valid solution for a scheduling issue, Lucius Malfoy was /clearly/ innocent, and their students' sports tournament to promote international goodwill should be a rivalry-fueled blood bath, would /not/ grasp the concept that an orderly Library would be preferable. They would accept the messiness of libraries as an integral part of libraries, without which a library would not be a library.
