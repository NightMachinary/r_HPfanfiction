It would be thematically inconsistent.

In the Potterverse, a lot of magic is readily accessible: you're going to learn a good set of charms and a decent range of transfiguration as a student. You have to make a pilgrimage to Hogwarts, of course, and endure the elements of the Scottish winter, but it's a good amount of power for work that's normal and feasible for schoolchildren.

Beyond that, you can increase breadth by inventing things, like the Weasley twins. And you can increase your power by hunting down old, usually forbidden knowledge.

If the book's just available and easily accessible and findable inside Hogwarts, that doesn't give you the hunt for forbidden knowledge. So as a compromise, since the plot can't have schoolkids running across the country hunting for libraries and forgotten grimoires, Hogwarts doesn't have a card catalogue.
