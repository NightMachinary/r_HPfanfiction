Not really what you are asking for but IIRC in a Cadmean Victory, Death Eaters attack the Longbottoms while Harry was visiting.

Augusta was pretty level headed there, and although she was grievously injured she did put up a fight.

As I am writing this, I am starting to doubt if she fought against Bellatrix or her husband/husband's brother.
