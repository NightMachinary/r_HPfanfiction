I can't remember the title, but there is a Ravenclaw!Harry story in which James Potter lived (Lily died) and Sirius is in a coma, leaving Harry obsessed with healing his godfather. There is faerie magic in it, and Harry is dealing (and consuming) magical drugs while his Auror father is trying to catch the dealer. Sorry I can't remember exactly which story it is, but its on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. I liked the darkness of the magic in the story.
