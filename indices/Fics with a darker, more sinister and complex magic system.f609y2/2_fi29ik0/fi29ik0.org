There's Silently Watches' /Black Queen/ series which is dark as fuck in more or less all aspects you could think of. I won't link it because there's some screwed up shit in there. Grammar is good though (in fact it's quite well written despite the demented stuff going on). Lots of Voodoo rituals and human sacrifices and things that could as easily kill the caster as the sacrifice.

Also worth noting is Ebenbild's /Basilisk-born/ which is all the way at the other end of the grammar scale from the Black Queen series (Ebenbild's first language is very clearly *not* English and it unfortunately shows, they need a good beta to go over the whole thing desperately) but the story telling is just as good. The magic system used there has a focus on ritual which can quite easily go wrong and kill somebody, but which isn't quite as sinister as the Voodoo in the Black Queen.

Edit: Typo fixed, thank you [[/u/VenditatioDelendaEst][u/VenditatioDelendaEst]] for pointing that out. It's been some time since I read one of his fics.
