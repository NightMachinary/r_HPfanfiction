I can't speak as a writer, but I hope some of the authors that request their fics not be downloaded are aware that there are many visually impaired and blind FF readers and others with reading disabilities. Being able to download fics and convert them to your preferred format or device can make a huge difference in how readable and enjoyable a story is, especially if you're pulling it off of a less accessible website.
