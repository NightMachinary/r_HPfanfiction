It doesn't worry me at all but I wish there was a way of seeing how many people download it. It does seem to imply that a reader likes it enough to want it on their own computer.

I do think it affects the number of reviews because I very much doubt that a reader would make the extra effort required to find the fic again just to leave a comment, no matter how much they liked it.
