The books and movies depict traditional gender roles as still being relevant in the Harry Potter universe (women are depicted as homemakers instead of men for instance, and "purebloods" obviously care about continuing on their family lines via intermarriage), so in fact identifying as male or female would have a noticeable impact on the shape of a character's life.
