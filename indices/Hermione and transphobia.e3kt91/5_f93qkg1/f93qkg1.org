Well, Rose is her child so I think Hermione will love him/ her/ it no matter what. A more interesting point would be Hermione's reaction to an unrelated third party- say she comes across a girl being bullied/ harassed/ beaten in Diagon Alley and helps her, only to find out it's a boy. And anyway I don't like mixing fiction with politics. I read fiction to get away from all the crap that is broadcasted daily on the news.
