If ony parents did "just love their kids no matter what." Being someone's child doesn't mean you're loved or cared about. Sometimes it just means you're an attachment they can use to hurt and spit at to make themselves feel good. Those words have no inherent positive meaning to them. The relationship is only as good as the person wants it to be.
