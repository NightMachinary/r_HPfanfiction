  I don't know why you think writing about a trans character is inherently political?

You specifically brought up the political aspects of this topic in your post when enumerating what you want to discuss "more generally". If that's not something you want to discuss, then you should probably clarify your OP to say otherwise.

Your words:

  We all know Hermione's *into social justice* (SPEW). In a lot of fics I've read with a trans protagonist, the author interprets that detail to mean she's their *biggest advocate*, somehow connected to the muggle LGBT world as a preteen in the 90's.

  (...)

  Or, fanon also likes to see Hermione as a *feminist*, an interpretation I agree with. Maybe this translates to her not understanding why someone would transition and adopting a *"TERF"* mindset, much like the *British feminists* JKR follows?
