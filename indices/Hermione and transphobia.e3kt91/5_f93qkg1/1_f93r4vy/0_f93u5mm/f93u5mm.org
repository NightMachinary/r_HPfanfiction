It's political, but it's no more political than the slavery, racism, tyranny, and fascism displayed and discussed in the 7 book series. Fiction, at all levels, from P&P to Percy Jackson, is /full/ of politics

As for your Hermione question, in canon, she seems to dismiss the idea that centaurs and humans can mate and accepts things that fit her worldview. I think she'd try to talk with Rose about social aspects of and try to understand her change, but come off rude when questioning the magical aspects, if you create those that is.
