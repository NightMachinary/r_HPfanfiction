An interesting question, that as a cis straight white male I am not qualified at all to answer.

One thing to keep in mind is, despite the fact that Hermione is based on Rowling in ways, they definitely aren't the same person. Hermione loves arithmancy, Rowling doesn't understand math, like at all. Taking any glance at the economic worldbuilding will give any economist a seizure, none of it makes any sense.

So, in essence, Hermione's views don't have to mirror Rowlings.

Hermione does seem like the type to do plenty of research, so might find studies on gender dysphoria? I honestly don't know though.
