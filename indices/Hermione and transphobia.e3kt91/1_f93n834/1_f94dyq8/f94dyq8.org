An argument can be made for her either way.

It's the '90s, but Hermione loves the downtrodden. However, she's also doesn't necessarily empathize with them.

I dislike fics that outright ignore the allegorical elements of Harry Potter in favor of saying it outright, if that makes sense.

Her stance doesn't really need to be known, but look at her stance on house-elves, or any other disparaged being.
