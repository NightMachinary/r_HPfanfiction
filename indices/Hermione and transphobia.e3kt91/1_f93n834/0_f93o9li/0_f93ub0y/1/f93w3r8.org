A lot of people do associate being trans with those type of things though. They genuinely believe identifying as a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth is more ludicrous than a faked moon landing. I'm not saying Hermione would be the same, just that in canon she's prone to not truly accepting things she doesn't understand.
