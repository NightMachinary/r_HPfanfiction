That might or might not be the case, but citing Luna as proof that Hermione isn't accepting of other stuff isn't a good argument because her theories are simply stupid. And divination tends to be rather self-fulfilling all things considered. She was rude to Lavender throughout the series, but that is a different story and due to lacking social graces.

However, keep in mind that Hermione was the only one who took issue about the enslavement of another sapient species. She certainly has the ability to see and caring to stand against injustice.
