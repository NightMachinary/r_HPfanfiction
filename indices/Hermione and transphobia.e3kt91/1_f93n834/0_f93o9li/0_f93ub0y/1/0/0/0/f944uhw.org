I think that if you were to add in a transgender character into the 1990s, Hermione probably wouldn't understand, because all things said she does have a slightly narrow view of the world. I think that because in that time there hadn't been anything big in the media, she'd lack the comprehension she would need. As we can see from divination, she is cynical of anything she doesn't immediately understand, as you've pointed out.

However, since the transgender character you want to introduce is Rose, and I'm going to guess that she won't transition to a he until at least the age of 8 or 9, possibly later (I may be wrong though), Hermione would have a much better understanding of LGBT issues by that point. Considering that this would be in the mid 2010s by this point, and I can't imagine Hermione ignoring muggle media, she would be a lot less cynical, and at least try to be understanding, or supportive even if she can't understand it.
