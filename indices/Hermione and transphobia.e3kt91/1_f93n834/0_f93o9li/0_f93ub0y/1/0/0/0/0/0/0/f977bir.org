In my fic outline, Ron gave up on his auror career to take care of the kids (& George/the joke shop) and has always been the emotional centre of the family compared to the kinda high-strung/ambitious Hermione. He became more mellow after becoming a stay-at-home dad. And like you said, he accepts everything rather quickly even if it takes him a bit longer to understand exactly what it means. I like the idea of him being so encouraging it ends up becoming additional pressure. I hadn't thought of that and it fits my interpretation of Ron so well.
