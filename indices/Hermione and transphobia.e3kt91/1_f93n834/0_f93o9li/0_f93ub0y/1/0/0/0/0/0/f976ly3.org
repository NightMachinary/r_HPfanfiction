I think Hermione can be a very confusing character, because you can see that she's very stubborn in certain beliefs, while clearly open to others (the existence of magic, for example).

I think this can mostly be attributed to how much the individual things that she is trying to understand explain about the world. For example, I'm sure that Hermione had noticed some unexplainable things in her childhood, which magic offered an explanation to, but divination never clears anything up.

With this in mind, having rethought, I think that Hermione would be initially confused by Rose's behaviour (before transformation), and become frustrated with her, possibly causing pain to Rose, but once Rose is able to make it clear that she, or now he, is transgender, then for Hermione it would explain everything. I think the fact that Hermione would now have a reason for her (former) daughter's strange behaviour would make her accept it, and embrace it. Even if she doesn't fully understand it, she would try, and it would probably lead to frustration with herself.

I don't know if you're interested in how Ron would react, but unless you've written him as abusive or in other ways a bad person (which I hope you haven't), then I think he'd be initially shocked at the change, not having foreseen it at all, in a very Ron-like fashion, but after getting over the shock I think he'd just get on with life and accept that he now has two sons. However, I also think Ron would advise rushing into anything like gender reassignment surgery, before Rose is 100% sure that s/he wants to go through with it.
