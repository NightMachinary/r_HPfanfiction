Up to you. I've never really read anything like it, so I'd be interested to see how you go about it, especially as you say you are transgender yourself. I tend to avoid similar things normally because LGBT protagonists often have bad characterisation, since their personality is solely that they are gay/bi/trans. However, I don't think you'd have the same issues if you've experienced what the protagonist is going through.
