  Luna

You have to keep in mind that Luna is the magical equivalent of a conspiracy theorist, and not just cute stuff like obscure animals. She genuinely believes in secret Ministry armies of demonic creatures, a sports league rigged through sabotage and torture, a government conspiracy of biological warfare and so on.

I mean, I like Luna for how insightful she can be, but she is also a total nutjob. Basically a "secret Nazi moonbase", Chemtrail and "Lizard people" believer. Hermione not believing a single word and even dismissing her is probably how most of us would react to Luna if we were exposed to her directly.

Which is the reason Luna does not work as a main character unless you rewrite those parts of her character, but that's another debate.
