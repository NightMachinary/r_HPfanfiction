Omg, this!

I went to school during the 90's- 2000's and most of the world was blatantly homophobic until like the mid 2000s. Imho, Hermione might have a lot of struggles with Rose being trans, but this would force her to not be so rigid in how she views other people since it now hits closer to home. And luckily for all of us, people CAN change from their toxic beliefs for the sake of their loved ones, so even if you make Hermione struggle, there can be a possibility for her to change for her child's sake.

Op I'd love to read your fic once it goes up.
