I feel at the same time though Hermione also doesn't really understand things that don't fit her world view (her relationship with Luna, divination) and I feel like the concept of being trans might qualify under the umbrella of things she doesn't get.

I mostly asked this question because she's a school girl in the 90's and it seems off that she would be as instantly accepting (or at least, as knowledgeable) as she is in most trans! fics. She might do research and eventually come around, like you said, but it would take time.
