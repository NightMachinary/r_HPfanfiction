Hmm. Good question. There might be several answers... the canon story doesn't go into trans issues at all, much less what Hermione might think of it. Well, she did once take Polyjuice Potion to adopt a male form (she was one of the seven Harry Potters in DH) and didn't seem to have a problem with temporarily being a boy, but of course that was a disguise and probably doesn't say anything about what she might think of transpeople.

If I'm to speculate, though... I don't think Hermione would go full-on TERF. That's not to say I think she would immediately be on-board and accepting, like some fanfics portray her as. Hermione is overall a kindly individual who at least WANTS to be inclusive and accepting, and when she sees people who need help, her immediate instinct is to help them... but she sometimes has her own ideas about what the best thing to help them would be, and she has an unfortunate habit of TELLING you what you need, rather than LISTENING to what what need. So it's not at all a given that she would immediately understand the trans person's wants and needs, because they are different from what she's used to. Hermione isn't very good at recognizing when people have different wants and needs than she does.

I kind of think Hermione's immediate reaction to a transperson, or hearing about a transperson, would be "oh, don't be silly" and change the subject. I doubt she'd take a very strong stance for or against the issue, at least not on the same level as, say, house-elf rights or blood bigotry. Partly because she doesn't quite get it (and she has a long history of either ignoring or dismissing things she doesn't get) and partly because I doubt she'd have any sort of insight into trans rights or even realize there was a problem.

If a person she just vaguely knew came out as trans, I think she'd largely just ignore it. Maybe she'd make a couple of dismissive or even slightly disdainful comments if they were brought up. She wouldn't rally against them or anything; she'd probably be polite to the person's face, even using their preferred pronouns when talking about them, just as a courtesy... but she wouldn't go out of her way to be an ally either.

If, however, a close friend or family member came out as trans, that would force her to take a stance and get more involved. After her first "don't be silly" reaction, her SECOND reaction would probably be more like "are you sure?" and then "but why?"

Eventually, I think she would land on the decision that this person has a problem, and if someone she loves has a problem it's her job to help solve that problem. It's a little up in the air what exactly she might end up believing the problem IS and what the best way to deal with it would be, mind... she'd definitely want to do a lot of research and read a lot of books on the subject, so here it would depend a lot on exactly what books she managed to get her hands on and what they said.

Worst-case scenario, she might just decide that your problem is that you suffer from some kind of delusion and/or have problems accepting yourself for who you are, and as such she might try to solve the problem by "making you see the truth about yourself," trying to get you to accept that you ARE the gender you were born as and that's perfectly okay, because it's fine for a girl to have masculine interests or dislike makeup, that doesn't mean you're a boy, you don't have to conform to gender stereotypes... and so on, and so forth. If she is set on this path, then it's going to be very hard to get her to change her mind. She won't be mean about it or anything, and she'll definitely be sympathetic, but she will probably get frustrated that you just won't see what's best for you, and won't follow her advice when she knows best.

Best-case scenario, she comes to the conclusion that the problem is with your body and not your mind... and probably with society at large. If the sees examples of transphobia and discrimination against transpeople, she'll be disgusted at it and very likely she'll become a strong advocate for trans rights, protesting against transphobia and discrimination and INSISTING that everyone treats you with respect. She'll be one of your most stalwart allies and defenders, though she MAY end up getting carried away in fighting your battles, being more vigorous about the entire thing than you really want her to be.

Hermione means well, but she doesn't always make the right choices. She certainly doesn't always know the right things to say. While I can certainly buy her as being ultimately accepting and supporting of transpeople, turning her into the "perfect ally" who handles the issue with the skill and grace of a trained therapist seems to go a little overboard.
