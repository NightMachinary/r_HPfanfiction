  The wizarding world would have far more effective transitioning strategies, so wizards would probably be more accepting, at least 20 years ago back when being trans wasn't as talked about.

It's possible, but not necessarily the only way the wizarding world could deal with trans people. Maybe the traditional way they're treated is to use mind magic/legilimancy/something to simply go into a person's mind and eliminate their gender dysphoria. Perhaps that could be a potential point of conflict for your story--Hermione/Ron could want to take Rose to a mind healer, but Rose doesn't want to, and would consider that to be changing who they really are.

I'm not sure I buy JK Rowling's line about the wizarding world being more accepting of LGBT people. With how obsessed purebloods are with bloodlines and heirs it seems more likely to me that they'd find some spell or potion to 'fix' gay people rather than just accepting that their kids won't have blood heirs.
