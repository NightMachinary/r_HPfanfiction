  We all know Hermione's into social justice (SPEW). In a lot of fics I've read with a trans protagonist, the author interprets that detail to mean she's their biggest advocate, somehow connected to the muggle LGBT world as a preteen in the 90's.

Well, I'm not too familiar with Britain in the 90s, but by the time Rose goes to school, it would be some time in the 2010s wouldn't it? An adult Hermione in today's Britain would probably be reasonably progressive. I also don't think JK Rowling's views should matter at all when writing Hermione, just extrapolate from the Hermione of the canon HP books.
