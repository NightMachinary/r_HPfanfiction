I want to clarify that I don't agree with the below position, I am just trying to provide the explanation OP asked for.

From a TERF perspective, they spent so many years carving out women-only spaces for themselves and fighting to have places to go where they did not feel vulnerable or second best to men. Added to that, they spent many years fighting against gender norms and the suggestion that if they didn't love all things twee and pink and wanted to be an obedient housewife that there was something wrong with them. They fought for butch lesbians to be accepted as women, and they fought to be allowed to enjoy and be good at things traditionally thought to be purely the realm of men. They have had YEARS of trying to get people to understand that gender is a social construct influenced by society, and that men and women are socially conditioned into gender conforming roles.

TERFS struggle to wrap their heads around moving from that to individuals genuinely and strongly feeling that their gender doesn't match their body. They cherry pick suggestions from trans individuals and organisations that would appear, at shallow glance, to suggest that gender non-conforming people must be trans. They find individuals, like Robert Webb, who point out that they were gender non-conforming as children, but now feel secure in the sex they were assigned with.

For someone like Hermione, who might have grown up reading old school feminist books, she might be extremely confident in her assertion that gender doesn't really exist, and that Ron might simply be a gay or gender non-conforming man. She might mean well saying "well of course you can wear a dress of you want!" But feel uncomfortable with his assertion that she is a woman, because she doesn't feel that Ron can ever understand that lived experience, or that she is entitled to be part of the space that generations of feminists fought for.

Edit: misread Rose as Ron, but my point still stands!
