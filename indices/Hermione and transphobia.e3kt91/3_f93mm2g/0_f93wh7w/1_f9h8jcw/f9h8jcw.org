Gender is this amalgam of ideas, roles, norms, etc. that are socially constructed and are assigned to people at birth based on what their body looks like. So part of that social construction includes ideas about the physical characteristics that people of that gender are "supposed" to have. A transgender person is someone who does not identify as the gender they were assigned, often, but not always, from a young age. It is consistent and having the gender they don't identify with forced on them causes distress. Not all trans people experience body dysphoria, and those that do don't all experience it with the same intensity. Not all trans people feel compelled to medically transition.
