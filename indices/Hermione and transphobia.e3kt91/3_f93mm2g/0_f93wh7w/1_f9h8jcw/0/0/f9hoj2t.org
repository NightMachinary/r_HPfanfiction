There isn't really *a* feminist position. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgender_topics][There are a lot of different strains of thought about what feminism is and thus what the feminist position on transgender people is.]]

TERFs are sex-essentialist and tend to reject the very idea of gender. They like to call themselves "gender critical". The very existence of trans people refutes their worldview. This makes them very mad.
