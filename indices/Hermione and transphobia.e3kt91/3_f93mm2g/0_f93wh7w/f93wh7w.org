  They have had YEARS of trying to get people to understand that gender is a social construct influenced by society, and that men and women are socially conditioned into gender conforming roles.

  TERFS struggle to wrap their heads around moving from that to individuals genuinely and strongly feeling that their gender doesn't match their body.

How /do/ you resolve the conflict between "gender is just a social construct, not governed by anatomy" and "someone's body needs to match their gender"? Those seem contradictory to me.
