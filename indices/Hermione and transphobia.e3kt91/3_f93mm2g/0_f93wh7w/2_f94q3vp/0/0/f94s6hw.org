Governed can imply control. "Gender isn't controlled by your anatomy" and "Someone's body needs to match their gender" would be contradictory /if you were ignoring the context/. Determined on the other hand can be defined as establishing a fact. Anatomy isn't the deciding factor of your gender but it is a factor.
