The comment I originally replied to was specifically about how "trans exclusive radical feminists" came to be, so no, I haven't shifted the goal posts. All along I've been essentially saying, "I don't see how radical feminists can /avoid/ being trans exclusive, can someone explain this?" I've just phrased it several different ways, is all.
