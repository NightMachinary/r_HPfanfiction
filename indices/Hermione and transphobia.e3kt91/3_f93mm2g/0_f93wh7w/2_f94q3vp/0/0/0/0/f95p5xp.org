The trait of a sapient being is close enough. By the way you've changed the goal post from "these two ideas don't match up" to "This doesn't align to radical feminism" gives the impression that it isn't actually you trying to reconcile ideas you actually feel are conflicting but are instead trying to nitpick in order to justify a belief in radical feminist ideas.
