  Governed can imply control.

When we're talking about a non-sapient "actor", I really think that there's not really any such implication and the two terms are very much equivalent.

  Anatomy isn't the deciding factor of your gender but it is a factor.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure that's still not compatible with radical feminism and "gender roles are just social constructs."

If it seems like I'm quibbling here, the point I'm trying to make is that there doesn't seem to be any way to make all sides happy. No matter what position I choose, /someone/ is going to decide that I'm on the wrong side of history, politically incorrect, disrespectful, etc. I guess I just pick my poison?
