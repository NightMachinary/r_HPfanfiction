Yeah, your interpretation is similar to what I was thinking. Mom!Hermione is a workaholic and believes she's "failed" as a female role model for her "only daughter", if that makes sense? I could see Molly kinda pushing that and making it worse.

She understands legal protections and what not, would work with a trans coworker, etc. She just doesn't understand why /her/ child is trans.
