I imagine it depends on Hermione's relationship to Rose (you mentioned time-travel, so Hermione wouldn't simply be a mother). She might become a rah-rah ally, maybe obnoxious at times, but really into history of transgender wizards, ready to recite it at any point Rose's gender was questioned. Hermione loves history, and our real world gender identity is so dynamic through the ages and interesting to study that I'd assume its magical counterpart be similar.

I can easily see older Hermione changing, losing her passion for justice in favor of her career (being the best is important to her), and letting her reputation dictate more of what she believes. I don't think JK's position is that important, ultimately - she is inconsistent, you are the author of your fanfic, so if I were you I would study Hermione's character in the scenes I find relevant and ignore what Rowling writes/endorses beyond the published books.
