Did some quick research, turns out that "dolorem ipsum" is Latin for "the pain" according to Google Translate. (So take that with a grain of salt.)

Thus, the spell inflicts pain.

Turns out the spell is a dark curse that was the inspiration for the Cruciatus curse. Aurors rush into the scene and berate the kid for both messing with unknown spells, wasting a bunch of ministry funds, and casting a dark curse.

The kid is let off with a warning.
