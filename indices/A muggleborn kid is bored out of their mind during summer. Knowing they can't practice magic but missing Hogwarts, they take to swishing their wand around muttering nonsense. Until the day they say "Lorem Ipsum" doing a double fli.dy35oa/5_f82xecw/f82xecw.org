The spell creates a void in reality the size of the student's hand, which just stays there spewing gibberish and slowly growing. When they come back next year, it's as big as their head. The year after, it's as big as a cat. By their seventh year, the void could encompass a house, and the world just twists and stretches around it to make room. They have tried to remove it, to no avail. Them one day, they incant "Control-C! Control-V!" And the rift is replaced with a copy of their house.
