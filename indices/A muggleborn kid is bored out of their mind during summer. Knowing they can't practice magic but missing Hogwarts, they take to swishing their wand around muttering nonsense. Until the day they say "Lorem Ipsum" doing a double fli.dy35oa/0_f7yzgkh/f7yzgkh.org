A stand-in spell that can be replaced with a real spell later.

The spell is inserted in to the timeline at the moment Lorem Ipsum was cast, essentially allowing you to send spells back in time, or from another perspective, open a window to receive communication from your future self.

Also handy if you don't know the right spell for the current situation, but can go practice it later.
