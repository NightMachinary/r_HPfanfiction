Sad to say that this is not just fanfic authors. An actual published author (dozens of books) whose work I otherwise admire does this. After a certain point in the series, each book's main character gets raped. I've been told that she was attacked herself and this is her way of coping with it, but my problem with it is that it doesn't contribute to character development at all; it's just a way to torture her characters. In storytelling, everything that happens to your character is supposed to affect them in some way, for good or ill.

What these people don't realize is that they are normalizing rape as something that "just happens."
