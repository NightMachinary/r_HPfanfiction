While using rape for cheap angst and turning someone insta-evil isn't good writing, we have to remember that these are amateur "writers". Many professional writers have trouble doing this topic justice.

I think the glamorizing of Draco, Snape and Voldemort is way worse than casual use of rape. At least in the latter, most of the time the author is aware that rape is bad.
