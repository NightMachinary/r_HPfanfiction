I truly don't mean to be insensitive when I ask the following:

Does it not factor in for you that in dying you would lose the ability to live and to be with your loved ones? And also that you dying would cause your loved ones more pain than you being raped would? (I know that I would much prefer my sister alive even though you may think that selfish of me).
