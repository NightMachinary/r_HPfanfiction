I am not entirely sure I could handle that again without it breaking me. And I don't think my family could handle watching the aftermath again. It's not a simple injury. It's a violation. Rape isn't about sex but it is about control. Anybody who thinks it is as simple as healing some torn tissues really has no clue.

But I'm not sure. I don't know my family's opinion on it; I only know mine.
