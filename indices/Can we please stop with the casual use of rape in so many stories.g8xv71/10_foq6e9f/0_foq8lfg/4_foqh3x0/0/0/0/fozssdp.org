Please enlighten me. As I touched upon in my original post, the differences between sexual and non-sexual violence all arise from the modern social norm that sex is special and holy.

To put it in baser terms; Sexual crimes only have more power insofar as we give them significance. It IS because we worship the sanctity of our sexual places that society so demonizes rape. In human history rape was seen as much more peaceful action that maiming and especially murder and woman were much less adversely affected by it than now. Rape (and the servitude of women in general) was societally accepted at certain times (war, conquering, payment).

Clearly there is a huge society influence on how we view rape and how victims are affected - this is something we can change if we wish. And why wouldnt we wish it? Why give rape more power over us than it needs, when we have shown time and time again that positive thinking does improve our capacity to resist and recover from evils?
