I did not say that murder or maiming weren't terrible things. My post was in response to your remark that the only reason people make a big deal about rape is because of notions of sexual purity. I found this extremely troubling, so I thought I'd respond. As to your question about the difference between sexual violence and nonsexual violence, I would /really/ recommend some hard thinking if you can't understand the difference.
