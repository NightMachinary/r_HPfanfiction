Being murdered removed all of you agency. Being beaten and crippled removed more/comparable agency than rape (unless the rape also involves brutal beating but that is besides the point as they are seperate actions).

The arguement of agency is a crucial to understanding the negative impact rape can have but that arguement applies even better to murder/maiming.

Please tell me; What is principally differrent between having a knife in your gut and a penis in your vagina?
