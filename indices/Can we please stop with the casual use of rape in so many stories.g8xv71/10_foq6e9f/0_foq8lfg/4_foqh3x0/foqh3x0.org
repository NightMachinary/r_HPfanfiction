  I honestly think that this reverance that people still ascribe to the vagina and the feeling they have about how horrible it is to defile it is sexist as fuck.

Jesus christ man are you fucking kidding me? Rape isn't evil because it defiles the sanctity of a vagina; it's evil because it destroys your agency -- being raped means being treated as a /thing/. It undermines the basis of your humanity and traumatizes you for life. I would have hoped that was something most people understood.
