I've done a lot of healing, but I appreciate the support. It's always nice to be validated.

It was 14 years ago, and I can still remember the sheer terror and disgust..... it's a scar now instead of an open wound, but I am marked for life from it. So people who have no concept of how soul damaging rape is for both men and women kind of trigger me.
