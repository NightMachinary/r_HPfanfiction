Rape isn't bad because it damages vaginas.

1) Anal rape and forced oral sex are both rape. 2) Someone who is drugged may not have any physical damage from being raped.

It's not about the damage to the body. It's

1) the mental damage like other torture. The loss of control the being at someone's mercy. 2) it's turning someone's body against them (the vigina that you are so obsessed will orgasm from physical contact wanted or not). Rape victims often feel betrayed and disgusted by their bodies bc they frozen in fear or their body orgasmed. 3) and it has no reason outside of someone being a rapist. If a bad guy needs info from someone he will do the bad guy thing and torture or kill to get it. Torture has a purpose to the bad guy - he can't kill the person with the info but he must give them reason to give it up. But choosing rape over torture is just because someones a rapist. Bad guys can kill and torture without enjoying it.

You can compare rape to the imperious curse, and it's close especially with the discribed floating happy feeling discribed in the books.

But no getting beat isn't worse than being raped. If given the choice I would much rather be shot or stabbed or beaten then raped.
