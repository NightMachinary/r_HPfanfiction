That is a moronic way of thinking only supported by people with twisted moral principles.

"I'll emotionally hurt someone in the worst way by killing their children/wife/family. I'll cause them the worst physical/magical pain possible (the cruciatus curse is literally defined this way).

"But I WONT rape them". Even though rape is strictly less physically painful than being cursed by esoteric/dark spells. Even though it is strictly less emotionally painful/scarring than seeing loved ones die -- unless you argue that a mother would find the brutal murder of her children easier to bear than being raped?

What I have said applies to real life too. Being raped is NO LESS invasive and damaging than being brutally beaten and is definatally not any worse than being murdered.

I honestly think that this reverance that people still ascribe to the vagina and the feeling they have about how horrible it is to defile it is sexist as fuck.
