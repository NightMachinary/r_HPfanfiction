I'd rather be killed then raped, at least I'd be dead. With the rape there's so much other thing then the damage of their vagina that we'd have to deal with.

For Pete's sake! People can get STD's, people can get pregnant, the mental scarring of afterwards, making you feel worthless, fearing that the rape will happen again, et cetra I can't even begin to imagine how that'd feel!

Also you keep bringing up the "damage of their vagina" You do in fact realize that men can and do sadly get raped as well, correct? It's not as talked about, but it does in fact happen.
