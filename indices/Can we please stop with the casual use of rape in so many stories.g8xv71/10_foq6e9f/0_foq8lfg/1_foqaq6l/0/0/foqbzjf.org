You are comparing physical injuries without thinking about mental injuries. The rape is all about robbing the victim of its agency regarding their own body, and that can leave mental trauma that can be as bad as the one suffered from a beating.

Btw, I agree with you on the fact that it's stupid that people that use imperius willy nilly or murder others act as if they superior to rapist; they are on the same level of scum.
