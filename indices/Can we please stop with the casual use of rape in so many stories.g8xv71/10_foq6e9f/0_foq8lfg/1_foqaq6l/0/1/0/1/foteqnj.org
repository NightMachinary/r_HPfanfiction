So you're saying that the feelings of raped people are like.. babboons? What? The thing about the concensus about black people was that it was not made /by/ black people. You're more like the whites in this analogy: you think you know how someone feels better than they do. The truth of how hurtful something is is determined by the hurt party, as they're hurting, every day, not you speaking from your chair talking about something you think is probably never going to happen to you.
