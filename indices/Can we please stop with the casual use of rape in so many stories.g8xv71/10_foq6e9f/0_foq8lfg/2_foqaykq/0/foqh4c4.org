This argument makes not a lot of sense since we are not talking about justified self-defence or stealing food to survive (there are laws to deal with those cases). Rape may be vile, but death is final. As long as you are alive, there is a chance of recovery, of coming back from traumatic events. You cannot recover from death. Therefore death is the worst fate.

  From a societal standpoint, murder and torture could in theory be justified (murder in self-defense, torture in the pursuit of life-saving information). There is no such mitigating cause for rape

There are many historical examples of justifications for rape. To give one example, my history professor explained how Greek colonisation worked. A few hundred Greek men would get on a few boats, sail somewhere and start building a city. As for why they took no women with them? You could always find some "barbarians" (anyone not greek) and worst case, you forced them to have your children. It was systematic rape common throughout basically every Greek city.

The rape of the Sabine women would be another example of this form of "growth".

By modern standards, it is deplorable behaviour. But it used to be quite common, even amongst "civilised" people.
