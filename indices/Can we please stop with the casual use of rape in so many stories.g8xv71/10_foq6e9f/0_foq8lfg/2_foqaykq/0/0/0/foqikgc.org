  But we don't live in those societies, do we?

That is the basis for every "marriage law" fanfic there is. The Ministry forcing rape upon the general population for the sake of population growth/sustainability. And that trope is quite popular for some reason. Nevermind "Voldemort Won" AUs where the defeated Muggleborn are used to breed more wizards.

And obviously we live in different times than antiquity, but given that slavery is widespread in the magical world (House Elves) and that they separated from the world we know in 1692, they obviously have different standards. And even the fandom has very twisted views, just look at the aforementioned marriage law fics.
