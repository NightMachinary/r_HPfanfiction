Point me a marriage-law fanfic where average readers won't feel that the marriage-law-related rape is a Bad Thingâ„¢. Go ahead, I'll wait - in most cases it's pointed out in-story that it's "awful but necessary", and the cases where it isn't is /exactly/ the kind of fic the OP complains about.

The case of house-elves, too, isn't exactly treated as something the reader's supposed to feel is entirely normal - nor is it really all that similar to most historic examples of slavery by the simple fact that the vast majority of house-elves /want/ to serve, for its own sake, to begin with.

Note the keywords /the reader/ that I keep using every. Single. Argument. It really doesn't /matter/ what other societies, in-story or no, feel about anything in particular - what matters is what is conventional for /the person reading/.
