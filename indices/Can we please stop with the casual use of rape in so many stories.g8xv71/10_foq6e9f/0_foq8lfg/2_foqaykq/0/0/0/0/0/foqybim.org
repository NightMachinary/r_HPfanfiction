Given that marriage laws are usually set ups for romance, I feel like almost all of them qualify.

And look at how pretty much everyone, be it in universe or reader, think that SPEW is a stupid idea and nothing ever comes out of it. Yes, Hermione went about it the wrong way, but for some reason she was the only one in canon concerned about systematic slavery and most fics which Touch upon house elves either completely ignore the issue or turn it almost romantic with Dobby bonding with Harry, it being a good thing and no thought spared about the other elves.

I mean, just look at how many downvotes Starfox gets when he mentions the topic.
