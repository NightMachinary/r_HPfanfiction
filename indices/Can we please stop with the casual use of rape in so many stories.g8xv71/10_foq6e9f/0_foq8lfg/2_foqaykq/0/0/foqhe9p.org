It's not actually the point that these justifications are /true/, it's that they /exist/ at all, and are valid in the society we live in. That affects how they're viewed on some level.

Also, arguably the worst fate is to be alive but /wish you weren't/ - which the trauma associated with rape and torture can definitely do. A chance of ever feeling better doesn't diminish just how awful a victim feels for what might be a very long time.

  There are many historical examples of justifications for rape. To give one example, my history professor explained how Greek colonisation worked. A few hundred Greek men would get on a few boats, sail somewhere and start building a city. As for why they took no women with them? You could always find some "barbarians" (anyone not greek) and worst case, you forced them to have your children. It was systematic rape common throughout basically every Greek city.

  The rape of the Sabine women would be another example of this form of "growth".

But Harry Potter fanfic-writers, and more importantly readers, don't /live/ in those societies, do they? If you can find me a fanfic on AO3/FFN/whatever-website written by an ancient Greek, by all means.

Even the benefits of the time no longer exist in our world. It's now no longer a prohibitive burden, if you were building a city, to just bring spouses and children with you even if they couldn't do any of the building.
