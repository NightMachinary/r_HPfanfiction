I'm going to copy and paste from TV Tropes here.

  The logic behind rape being qualitatively different from other crimes runs something like this.

  We have created a hierarchy of evil, based on what does greater or lesser damage to the social contract but mitigated by necessity. Killing another human is the most destructive and in pretty much every society therefore punished the most harshly. But it is possible that killing another human being can be forgiven from need; self-defense or the defense of others. Even the violent suppression of a rebellion or the killing of an insolent underling by a leader can be construed as attempts to preserve the existing social contract.

  People may:

  - steal to feed themselves or their families.
  - torture others to obtain information which can save thousands (although this one is a very dubious and questionable justification at best).
  - kill someone in self-defense, to preserve their own life.

  These are all actions which are normally punished if performed for their own sake, but which may be treated less harshly if performed "for the right reasons"---personal survival, the survival of another, or the survival of the group. Constructing a situation in which rape becomes necessary for personal survival, the survival of another, or the survival of the group is extremely difficult, if not impossible.

  It is in the top tier of the hierarchy of wrongs, because of its ability to have permanent effects on the victim and those around the victim, along with torture and murder. That also means that any attempt to justify it instantly begs the question of why the use of the other two, particularly torture since both leave the victim alive, wasn't a relatively superior solution. Also unlike torture or murder, it has the possibility to actually create an additional victim(s) of the crime (a female victim being unwillingly impregnated, especially if getting an abortion isn't easy for her).

What TVTropes doesn't mention is the psychological impact. Yes, being tortured is a horrific experience, but at least what your body is telling you matches up to what's being done. With rape, it /doesn't/ - it has the exact same purpose as cold-blooded torture (putting someone underfoot) but some part of the victim has no choice but to feel unwanted /pleasure/ in that moment. That's a /horrific/ mental violation with potentially longer-lasting effects than any amount of pain.

TL;DR From a societal standpoint, murder and torture could /in theory/ be justified (murder in self-defense, torture in the pursuit of life-saving information). There is no such mitigating cause for rape, and any attempt to do so would only beg the question of "why not just torture them?" - especially in the Wizarding World, where curses exist /specifically/ for the purpose of making torture easier. All of that makes it /very/ easy to see rape as the worst deed possible.
