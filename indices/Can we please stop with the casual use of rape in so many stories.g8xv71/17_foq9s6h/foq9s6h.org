It doesn't bother me, honestly. It usually doesn't start until the second paragraph at the earliest, and by that time such story has usually discouraged me from further reading.

I mean, there are times and places where such a theme would be appopriate. Adding evil points to a character is not one. Reading a story that does that is a rare thing for me because it's usually preceded by a plethora of warning signs.
