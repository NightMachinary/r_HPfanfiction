I've never been able to subscribe to this theory, but I may be wrong. I hear this argument used for pedophiles all the time. "Better that they have sex with virtual kids instead of molesting real kids!" But with my experience in life, being around something constantly and thinking about it constantly tends to make me more comfortable with the idea. I feel like if I had an unsafe or disgusting fetish, continuously exposing myself to it in fiction would normalize it for me.

I dunno; that's just my thoughts on the matter.
