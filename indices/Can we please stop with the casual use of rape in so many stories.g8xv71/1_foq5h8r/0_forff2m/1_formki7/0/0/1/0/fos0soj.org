I'm not sure whether you mean to say "things aren't necessarily a gateway drug to other stuff" or "some things are a gateway drug to other stuff" and honestly, I can see both arguments being valid in certain cases. Like I said; I'm really not sure and I can't speak from any experience except my own. I'm just saying that I hear child pornography (virtual or real) defended all the time because "at least they aren't raping kids." And even if it's "better" than the worst alternative I'm not sure we should be supporting the other alternatives that are still bad.

I'm totally open to hearing other perspectives on the matter, though.
