I don't necessarily disagree, but why are things like torture and mass murder fine to casually put in a story, then? Torturing someone into insanity and slaughtering hundreds of people are objectively worse, so why isn't it "cheapening" or bad/lazy writing to have a character do those worse things just to show how evil they are?

And is the issue that it's offensive and the subject of a particular taboo, or that it's bad writing? If it's the former, why is it more offensive than writing about worse things? And if it's the latter, why do people get so upset about it when they don't get upset about other kinds of bad/lazy writing?
