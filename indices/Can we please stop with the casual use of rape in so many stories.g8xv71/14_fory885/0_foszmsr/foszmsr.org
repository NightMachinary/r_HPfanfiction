Another poster had a remarkably similar question, so I'm going to give you the same answer! Hope you don't mind my parsimony.

  Most people know someone who has been raped or sexually assaulted. For some of us, it's either ourselves or someone we care deeply about. So it's not just that it's one of the worst things that can happen to someone and that the authors are using it as a plot device, it's also that it's deeply, cuttingly, personal.

  I can't think of anything else that's quite in the same boat -- most cheap writing tends not to either be as awful or as personal. Most equally awful and personal things tend not to be used so cheaply.

As an example, mass murder and torture I rarely see used in a "cheap" way. When they happen, authors will take the time to talk about the consequences. The Longbottoms were tortured into insanity, so Neville grew up with no parents. Voldemort's a mass murderer, so he must be stopped. When they're brought up, it's because they matter to the story. Rape, on the other hand, is often just used as a prop, having little importance to the story outside of one or two scenes. This sort of writing is upsetting not because it contains terrible things, but because it contains terrible things treated as if they're really nbd.
