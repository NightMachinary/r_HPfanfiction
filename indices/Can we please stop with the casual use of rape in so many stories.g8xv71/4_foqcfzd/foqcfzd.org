THANK YOU! I had to stop with Outlander because of all the rape. Unless rape is an ESSENTIAL plot point (like "For Someone Special" by Lady of the Masque.... a fantastic read). But all the bullying in the hall that's rapey.... not needed! There's other ways to bully someone. There's other ways a Death Eater can torture someone. Let's stop being desensitized to sexual assault.
