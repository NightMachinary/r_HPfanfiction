  Have you read the outlander books? Is it as much rape in them as in the series?

I've never seen the TV show, but there is plenty of rape and dub-con in the books.

First book: One of the earliest protagonist sex scenes is dub-con edging reeeeealy far over the line into spousal rape. The narrative paints it as non-rape because they both exhaust their anger in the process and end up loving eachother more afterward. Compared to most mass-market romance novels, I'd say it's... not terrible, but it's still pretty iffy.

Also in the first book, near the end one of the main protagonists gets raped and is left with crippling mental trauma. The process of healing from that trauma afterward is a major part of the plot. The pivotal moment in that healing process is another dub-con sex scene imposed on the victim.

Second book: I don't specifically recall any rape, though there probably is some off screen (so to speak). There's one traumatic scene of dub-con near the middle that has a major impact on the plot, and once again an eventual scene of Sexual Healingâ„¢ makes things all better.

Third book: There's one scene of coerced dub-con near the beginning. There may be other scenes with rapey vibes, but that's the only one I specifically recall.

Fourth book: A relative of the protagonists in the first two books gets raped and later decides to keep the baby. There's probably other scenes with rapey vibes, but that's the one that stands out most in my memory.

Fifth book: A protagonist gets captured and is repeatedly sexually assaulted before rescue comes.

Also of note: The portrayal of homosexuality is overwhelmingly negative in the first few books, with the only examples of gay men being a pedophile and a sadistic rapist. Later in the series the author writes some gay men who are good people, but I don't know if that about-face is really enough to make up for the earlier issues.
