I've only read/seen rape potrayed realistically a few times in fiction in my life, one instance was in the Night Angel Trilogy where the main male character was raped a few times throughout the series and it effected him throughout, the other time was in Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel and it didn't even show the rape just showed the characters reaction to what might happen.

Fanfiction writers don't know how to write it properly and while I'd rather not read it, I do know just like Murder or Cheating it is a powerful tool to get a reader invested, but again fanfic writers are shit at writing and conveying a message most of the time.
