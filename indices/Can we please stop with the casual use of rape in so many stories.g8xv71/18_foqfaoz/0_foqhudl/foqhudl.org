I feel like it would not be out of place amongst the crowd who deported an entire people into hell on earth and had death squads roam the countryside in combination with unleashing biological weapons for the fun of it (the werewolves under Greyback).

Rape works when you are describing the overall brutality of what is basically a genocide in an abstract way (not happening to a specific character). At Hogwarts though, the trope is really awful. Especially when Harry is the only one to do something about it or when it is a set-up for romance. That is simply vile.
