  they use rape to show slytherin house as evil

Yeah, definitely not a fan of the Slytherin rape house trope. Pretty much every time I run across it it's a set-up for Harry to save a Slytherin girl from it and I can't think of a single time that it's actually stopped by anyone, though I stop reading fics if they are full of awful tropes (haven't read a Sirius will reading in years now, don't even make it that far on those fics if I even open them up).
