  Maybe it's because I'm actually a pleb from a third-world country whose opinion is hilarious to you, dear sir/ma'am, but I do not "try" to "ascribe essentialism" to Hogwarts Houses.
#+end_quote

I find it really interesting that you think "third-world countries" don't have boarding schools, when actually whether a country has a boarding school culture or not is more a factor of if it was colonized by Britain or not than of its GDP or alliance in the Cold War. For what it's worth, I'm from the "poverty capital of the world" and that is where I went to boarding school, and I guarantee you that many of the people I know that went to a boarding school are far poorer/more of a "pleb" than you are.

And yes, what you are doing /is/ ascribing essentialism. "These are the qualities the Founders drafted for their Houses, therefore children sorted into those Houses should necessarily be showing those qualities" is essentialism.

  What, then, are we even discussing? The hat is a big deal in the book. It's, like, omnipotent or something.
#+end_quote

But it very blatantly isn't. It's a hat charmed to be capable of Legilimency and that is pretty much it, plus it can be flat-out wrong about people (I don't care how many pretzels people try to twist themselves in to explain it, Peter Pettigrew isn't "brave" by any stretch of the imagination). It gets about a minute to read the mind of an eleven-year-old child and decide where they would best fit based off that and that alone - the point is not that it's "stupid" and "hilarious", the point is that one minute of Legilimency on a prepubescent child (that's even subject to challenge by the children themselves - Harry made the Hat put him in not-Slytherin, and he'd hardly have been the first or only one in a millennium to do so) will obviously be outweighed by the actual environment they end up entering and the sheer fact that children simply grow and change.

The point is that pretty much nobody is that brave or loyal or brilliant or ambitious at age freaking eleven, and moreover it makes no sense for the population to be neatly divisible into four along those lines. What /does/ make sense is that those traits are supposed to be */nurtured/* by the staff and students in the house you're sorted into - this is backed by the Hat itself phrasing its sorting as "you'll do well in X", not "you /are/ X". It's made pretty clear by the narrative that Slytherin House had drifted away from whatever hotbed of cunning and ambition Salazar might have initially envisioned to focus almost exclusively on his pureblood ideology during the time period of the books. And that's what got nurtured /by the actual people in the house/ instead.

  why do the books even have it and give so much importance to it throughout the whole thing?
#+end_quote

I mean, Rowling pretty much spends seven books /deconstructing/ the idea of Sorting, not holding it up as a perfectly working prescriptivist system.

Also tbh she's not that great at thinking through the implications of the stuff she writes.
