  You don't need to have gone to a boarding school to not "ascribe essentialism to Hogwarts Houses," which, no matter how many times you tell me I do, I don't.
#+end_quote

For someone getting so hot under the collar, you do seem completely incapable of grasping the fact that I was talking about my own personal reasons for not being a House essentialist. You can continue to get as offended as you like over whatever imagined slight you think was involved there, but that really is your personal problem and not my business.

#+begin_quote
  That is how it should be, because the books are basing a lot on the premise that the "a mad old hat sees your essence and groups you with a bunch of similar people so you can reach your potential" system is not just Dumbledore having a giggle, right?
#+end_quote

Imagine arguing so hard that you're not being essentialist and then turning around and literally saying, verbatim, that "That is how [things] should be". You've spent paragraphs and paragraphs of comments effectively saying that there is/should be some essence to each House that people sorted into them should necessarily demonstrate - why, exactly, are you so mad when I summarise that train of thought instead of writing it out verbatim every time?

And like...I'm sorry but you keep doing this "if it's not a 100% working system then it's for shits and giggles" which does make it hard to take you seriously. Like, this can't possibly be the first institution you've encountered that doesn't work the way it's intended to.

#+begin_quote
  "You will do well in X" does not mean "I randomly send you to that house so they can make you brave/loyal/intelligent/Satan wannabe,"
#+end_quote

But that is precisely what it will end up being - because, again, the population doesn't magically fall exactly into 25% brave, 25% loyal, 25% intelligent and 25% Satan wannabe as completely dominant traits, /especially at age eleven/. A system that actually worked the way you want it to would have like three each of Slytherins and Ravenclaws and maybe five Gryffindors if you squint, with literally everybody else in Hufflepuff for lack of where else to put them. But the Sorting Hat still makes its equal quotas, so obviously it's mostly bullshitting for some kids, or (if you want to be charitable) making a deliberate decision about which [weakly] present trait they have that it should emphasize. And it's very easy indeed to make a case in hindsight that X was the right choice all along when a child has spent their formative years growing in X.

Plus I am not sure why you keep insisting on the omnipotence of the Sorting Hat. It's literally just a Hat capable of Legilimency (into untrained eleven-year-old minds at that), where on god's green earth do you read omnipotency out of that? Is the Fat Lady omnipotent because she can talk?

#+begin_quote
  So, in that case, the sparks of Slytherin nature the hat saw in all those kids got stamped out by their changed house values the moment they stepped foot in the common room? All of them? Not one kid with some cunning/ambitious potential chose their own way?
#+end_quote

You can exaggerate all you like for snark, but obviously this is a process that occurs over /literal years/. Full grown ass /adults/ get radicalized all the time by the /internet/ - have you /met/ eleven year olds? Children around that age are literally the most impressionable little shits ever.

Plus there /are/ Slytherin children in the canon timeline that "chose their own way" (which I assume here means pursuing ambition or indulging their cunning or whatever). You're just choosing to ignore them to be facetious. Not to mention - /why/ would any actually precociously cunning and ambitious non-pureblood supremacist eleven-year-old attending Hogwarts in the 1990s /allow/ the Hat to place them in Slytherin?

#+begin_quote
  Somehow Gryffindors are adventurous rule-breaking little bastards from the get-go, they don't wait for Percy Weasley of all people to teach them ways. Somehow the un-Gryffindorish prefect and strict McGonagall don't manage to nurture their nature out of them. It's only Slytherins, the most impressionable bunch of all. Makes perfect sense.
#+end_quote

Did...did you even read the same books? /Did you even read the sentence you just wrote/? Is Percy Weasley not a Gryffindor? Is Minerva McGonagall not a Gryffindor - the literal Head of House even? If even /she/ is not an "adventurous rule-breaking little bastard" - how on earth are you complaining that only Slytherins don't match their house traits?

Plus like...even among the people in Harry's year, how is /Neville/ an adventurous rule-breaking little bastard to begin with? Almost as if he grew into one because of the friends he made in Gryffindor. How is Dean one? Or Lavender and Parvati? Almost as if the characters we see as adventurous and rule-breaking are so because they're the main characters and they need to move the plot along, or as if the vast majority of people aren't actually particularly brave or intelligent or cunning or /anything/ really beyond perfectly average plonkers. Or as if we mostly see Gryffindor's antics because Harry is in Gryffindor, which is exactly why I mentioned myself attending a boarding school at first - quite a lot of the shit we see them get up to is pretty bog-standard boarding house mischief, albeit with magic thrown into the mix.

Like have you /met/ people? Most of them aren't actually shit.

#+begin_quote
  If the sorting is nonsense, do we get at least a couple of Slytherins who managed to think with their own head and not allow themselves to be turned into every other guy from their House--the useless bullying brat? Please don't say Snape.
#+end_quote

In Snape's generation (and these are the characters that were relevant enough that their Sorting is known):

- Regulus Black
- Andromeda Black (literally married a Muggle-born)
- Dolores Umbridge (think with your own head doesn't mean /good person/, and Umbridge literally plays her way to a near untouchable position after Voldemort's return despite not having credentials worth shit)

We barely know the Sorting of most of the adult characters, even in the Order of the Phoenix. So really your whole gripe is with Slytherins who are literally still lunkhead kids Sorted at a time when the House had been completely overrun by pureblood supremacists.
