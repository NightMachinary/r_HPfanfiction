Maybe it's because I actually attended a boarding school, but I find the essentialism people try to ascribe to Hogwarts' Houses rather hilarious.

They're eleven year old kids when they are sorted and shockingly enough like most children their character development is heavily influenced by the people they have around them, not by the whimsies of a freaking /hat/ that meets them once for like two minutes or the desires of founders that lived over a millennium ago.

  But that is my point, most Gryffindors in the books are actually brave even if they have their faults, Ravenclaws are nowhere to be found so I suppose they actually read all the time, and most Puffs are being Puffs.

In reality, most Gryffindors in the books don't actually exhibit any particular amount of /bravery/ (as opposed to hotheadness and childish stubbornness) besides the ones that are obviously major characters like Harry or Neville, and they do so because they're /major characters supposed to be advancing the plot/ not because of their house. On the other hand, the Goblet of Fire considers Cedric brave enough (amongst other qualities) to select him for a tournament with freaking dragons and whatnot. Luna is as "brave" as any Gryffindor in the Department of Mysteries. And so on.

Most Ravenclaws are not actually going around calculating the date of the heat death of the universe or whatever. The canonical character who's obsessed with books and reads all the time is /Hermione/ and she is, shockingly enough, in Gryffindor. How many times is Luna shown to be reading something that's not the Quibbler? Are books even mentioned in relation to Cho, compared to her Seeker position and relationship with Cedric? Speaking of, that's one bit of fanon that flat-out doesn't make any sense: the whole "Ravenclaws are so bookish and nerdy and don't like sports". News flash - they (like every other house) have a freaking Quidditch team that plays games and takes them seriously.

Most Hufflepuffs are not actually the fluffly balls of goodness and cheer that people seem to think they are. Tonks is a Hufflepuff but Rowling could have said "she was in Gryffindor" without changing a single thing about her characterisation. I've already talked about Cedric. Ernie is more pompous than anything else (although he mellows out). Zacharias Smith is an annoying twit more than anything else (and doesn't actually seem to show loyalty to anything at all, not even the DA he's a part of). Newt is also a canon Puff but again could as well have been in Gryffindor without changing a single thing about his canon characterisation.

Why then would you expect Slytherins to behave exactly like a Sorting Hat song?
