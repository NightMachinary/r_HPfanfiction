slytherins publicly express their pride/ dignity together with their cunning/ ambition by electing the biggest and meanest in their house to play quiditch and encourage them to play as violently as possible. Some examples of prominent slytherin plots: 1. Meet me in the trophy room at midnight, unless you're scared 2. Bet you're to chicken to fight me in front of Snape 3. Hey look, it's longbottom, let's hex him in the back.

As far as I can tell they're a bunch of brutish bullies, some of which like to tell themselves that they're special, pure, cunning or whatever.

Although it's an uncomfortable topic and most stories don't benefit from adding it, I don't find it hard to imagine that rape is an issue in wizarding Britain/ slytherin.
