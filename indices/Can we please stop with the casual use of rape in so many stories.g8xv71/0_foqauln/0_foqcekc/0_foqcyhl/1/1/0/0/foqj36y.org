No, my point is that while you can obviously use the cruciatus, the imperius would be just as magical to demonstrate your superiority, for example by using a group as people as a vile puppet theatre. Or even a simple levitation charm to defile someone. With magic, you don't need to touch someone to rape them.

And I can easily see Tom Riddle do some Ramsey-level of shit with various curses once he is "reunited" with his former fellows.
