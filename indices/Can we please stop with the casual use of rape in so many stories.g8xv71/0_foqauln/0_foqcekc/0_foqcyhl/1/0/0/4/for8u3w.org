Accidental magic is a thing too. If it activates when you feel a bit of fear or anger, then you can bet your ass that it'll activate when someone tries to rape.

And like, maybe half the people just use it to escape, but the other half /will/ attack. See how well you can rape when your wiener is severed. Or your testicles explode. Or your joints are reversed.
