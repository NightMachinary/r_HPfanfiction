  You can make generalities about it being all sorts of women, but in doing so, you're saying nothing, and pretending you made a point, because a population distribution being nonzero at all ages doesn't contradict the fact that young women are targeted much more.

I was rather gently trying to point out that the onus is on you to demonstrate that the general target of rape is /young */and/* attractive women/. To be very blunt, frankly ugly people get raped all the time and there aren't even that many attractive people in the world in the first place. What's your explanation for that?

  Identifying the notion as coming from a "feminist" is useful information because the reader can understand it's not coming from somebody such as a social scientist, who might be attempting to make their statements correspond with reality. The notion here came from an activist.
#+end_quote

In short, "I think feminists and activists are inherently unreasonable and I assume everyone shares that bias". To be blunt once again: that is ad hominem that doesn't actually address the substance of the argument.

And yes, the vast majority of arguments are just "making stuff up". Pretty much all of philosophy is just "making stuff up". Bluntness again: you only scoff at the "made up stuff" that /you/ don't agree with.

  Let's do a thought experiment. If some guy is going to date-rape a woman at a party, but then realizes he forgot the roofie, but she's totally into him and wants to go back to his place, do you think he's going to back out because it defeats his end goal? No, he isn't. That's because the end goal is to have sex.
#+end_quote

Wow, I actually refuse to believe that you are /this/ bad at missing the point.

Literally nobody has ever said rape is not an act of sex. The point is that the end goal is to have sex with someone /whether they also want to have sex with you or not/, and that you cannot actually divorce that "consent is optional" predicate from the act of sex in rape. You are the one pretending like "whether or not" automatically implies "or not". To put it in other words, people who do not enjoy having power over someone else /don't set out to drug them in the first place/. I don't know what confession you'd like to make here buddy but I and many, many people have never been so sexually aroused by someone that we thought "hey, I'm going to drug them and then use their near-unconscious body".

To draw a comparison to another crime, it is completely fair to say that theft/robbery is rooted in (varying levels of) disregard for the norms of ownership. Retorting with "oh yeah? well people steal money because they have an inherent desire for money!" betrays a certain childishness of thought, because we /all/ want/need money but people who are not thieves by and large regard /other people's money/ as off-limits. Stealing at least has the caveat that you genuinely can be so hungry/broke/etc that your actual life is in danger, but even in that case that's simply a threshold where perhaps the ultimate desire - preservation of self - overrides one's regard for the norms of ownership (and /even in that case/, many starve or suffer bankruptcy rather than steal). Rape on the other hand has no such caveat.
