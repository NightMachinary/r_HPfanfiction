You can make generalities about it being all sorts of women, but in doing so, you're saying nothing, and pretending you made a point, because a population distribution being nonzero at all ages doesn't contradict the fact that young women are targeted much more.

  And this is precisely why I asked if you actually read the argument

Saying a bunch of words and calling it an argument doesn't mean you aren't making stuff up. If rape were about power or intimidation, try and explain why reality is the way it is. It makes sense if you think rape is about having sex. It doesn't make sense if you think it's about power.

Identifying the notion as coming from a "feminist" is useful information because the reader can understand it's not coming from somebody such as a social scientist, who might be attempting to make their statements correspond with reality. The notion here came from an activist.

  it's a statement that the violation of consent - doing something to someone whether they like it or not, rather than participating in an activity with them - is the actual end goal and not merely the means. And that's what all rapists share in common - the disregard for and desire to override a person's will (plenty of rapists rape as a punishment, for intimidation, in cases where the victim isn't even the gender the rapist is attracted to, etc)

See, this is where you should stop and ask yourself, how this information got into your brain and came out your mouth. You didn't look at the universe and come up with this stuff.

Let's do a thought experiment. If some guy is going to date-rape a woman at a party, but then realizes he forgot the roofie, but she's totally into him and wants to go back to his place, do you think he's going to back out because it defeats his end goal? No, he isn't. That's because the end goal is to have sex.
