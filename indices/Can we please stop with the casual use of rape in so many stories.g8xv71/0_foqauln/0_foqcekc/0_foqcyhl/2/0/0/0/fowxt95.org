  But rapists generally target attractive young women.
#+end_quote

Actually rapists tend to target all sorts of /people/, and even among women victims there is a diverse range in targets, including literal children. And they're certainly not all "attractive".

  If it were about power, that would not be so. They actually just want to have sex, a desire evolutionarily ingrained in them.
#+end_quote

And this is precisely why I asked if you actually /read/ the argument rather than dismissing it out of hand because it's by a feminist and you think feminists have cooties. Apart from a handful of asexual people, we /all/ experience sexual desire, but we don't all go around raping people, so it's blatantly obvious already that /attraction/desire aren't */the/* cause/ - unless you'd like to argue that you rape people.

"Rape is about power" isn't a statement that [most] rapists don't experience sexual attraction to their victims, it's a statement that the violation of consent - doing something /to/ someone whether they like it or not, rather than participating in an activity /with/ them - is the actual end goal and not merely the means. And that's what /all/ rapists share in common - the disregard for and desire to override a person's will (plenty of rapists rape as a punishment, for intimidation, in cases where the victim isn't even the gender the rapist is attracted to, etc)
