Depends on how its used. Because so much fanfiction is written by inexperienced and unskilled authors, many tropes are often used badly. Except when rape is badly used in a story its much worse because its /rape./

There are exceptions though. An Hour of Wolves is really good. Romilda Vane uses love potion to rape Harry in sixth year. Obviously can't link it, but I'd highly recommend.
