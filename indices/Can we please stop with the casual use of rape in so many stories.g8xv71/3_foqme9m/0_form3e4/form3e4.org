I'm of the theory love potions in general are akin to date rape drugs. I was horrified when Ginny and Hermione were giggling about them, and that was before I was assaulted myself. That tiny section was in PoA, in the Leaky Cauldron, right before returning to school if a remember correctly. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the location.
