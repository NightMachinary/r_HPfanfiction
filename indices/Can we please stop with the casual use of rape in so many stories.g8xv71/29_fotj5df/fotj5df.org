Maybe this is mind blowing but.... RAPE IS NOT PLEASURABLE. I've seen plenty of rape in fanfics that went well with the story and tons that haven't. Don't read the story of you don't like it or skip that part. The only ones I've read that I didn't feel comfortable with it were the abused Harry stories. The Dudley's sucked but they weren't that awful. Plus the stories usually do an awful job reflecting behavior of people who actually go through it.

With these stories I either dropped it or just keep reading. It's not the authors job to change the story to for your needs. 1. Tom riddles mom 2. Umbridge in the forbidden first
