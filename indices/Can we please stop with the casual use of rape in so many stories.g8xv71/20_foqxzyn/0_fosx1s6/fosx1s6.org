  what I want is to understand why do people think it should not be used out of all the many bad things that are written about? ... How is the description of rape different from all the other overused and misused taboos?
#+end_quote

Most people know someone who has been raped or sexually assaulted. For some of us, it's either ourselves or someone we care deeply about. So it's not just that it's one of the worst things that can happen to someone and that the authors are using it as a plot device, it's also that it's deeply, cuttingly, personal.

I can't think of anything else that's quite in the same boat -- most misused taboos tend not to either be as awful or as personal. Most equally awful and personal things tend not to be used so cheaply.

Shock value isn't necessarily bad (think of Joffrey killing Ned, for example.) But rape for shock value is almost always the wrong choice, IMO.
