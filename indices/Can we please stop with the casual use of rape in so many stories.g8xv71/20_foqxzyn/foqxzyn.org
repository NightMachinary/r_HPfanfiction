I'm neither denying nor supporting the statement that rape should not be used or written about in FF, what I want is to understand why do people think it should not be used out of all the many bad things that are written about?

Is it because it appears too often? It always makes me wonder because people are "fine" with almost everything out there, but the moment they hear/see "rape" it's like some invisible wall slams into place.

How is the description of rape different from all the other overused and misused taboos?

And is using something as shock value bad in general? Is shock value bad? Or is using rape in particular as one?
