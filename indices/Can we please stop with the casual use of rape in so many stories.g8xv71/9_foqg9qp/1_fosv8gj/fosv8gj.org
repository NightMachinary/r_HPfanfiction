[[/u/wordhammer]] ' s Holly Evans and the Spiral Path has a rape scene in it, but it is not at all treated lightly. It's a hard fucking read, but I think is one of the cases where I'm okay with it.

Starfox's The Dark Lord Never Died has a serial rapist in the form of Draco Malfoy, which is fine but doesn't really get much focus, & therefore veers a little towards what OP is talking about.

The absolute worst offenders are the many stories that use rape to establish how abusive the Dursleys are, which I feel is generally beyond the pale.
