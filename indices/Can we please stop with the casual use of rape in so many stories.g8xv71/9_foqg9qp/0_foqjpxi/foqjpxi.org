I don't think I've read one where a rape was completed on screen, but definitely several attempted rapes that were stopped by the hero in time. Also many other stories alluding to the fact that in Slytherin the older males in charge are abusing their power over other members of the house thus Harry can easily hate and kill them justifiably.

some other non obvious examples are love potion stories, typically Molly and/or Ginny are potioning Harry to make him Gin's boyfriend and He eventually finds out and gets angry at the Weasley family - any intercourse under such circumstances is definitely rape.
