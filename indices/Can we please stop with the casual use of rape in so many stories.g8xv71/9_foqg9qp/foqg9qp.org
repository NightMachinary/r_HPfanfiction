I have not actually come accross this myself, do you have some examples of stories which use this?

Broadly speaking, I thik that rape is a perfectly ligitimate tool in an author's arsenal but it should not be treated lightly. I think that the Firebird Tirology does this quite well. Rape is treated as quite casually by many characters in the story but it is made very clear that this is one of the things which is so fucked up about the world in which the story takes place and it is something which the main characters are fighting to stop.
