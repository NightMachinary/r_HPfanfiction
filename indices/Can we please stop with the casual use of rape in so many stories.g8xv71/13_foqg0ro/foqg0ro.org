It always baffles me when you see people commenting on rape in fiction that it isn't that big of a deal while at the same time saying it's crucial to a story to demonstrate how evil a character is. You can't have it slice both ways. If it isn't a big deal, then it isn't needed and is just a lazy writing.

I personally feel one of the reasons for its prevalence is that most male writers only know that rape is bad but they've never been associated with the lifelong trauma that results from it. So it became a trope (and a very lazy one at that) because it was already used so much in fiction. It became shorthand to introduce both an evil character and a character with some nebulous trauma in the background. So thus you get legions of readers and writers that only know rape as this hazy bad thing that allows you to get tons of information conveyed without ever fully understanding /why/ rape is such a big deal.
