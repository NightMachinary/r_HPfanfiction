I agree with your point about dub-con and/or non-con. It's something that's been bothering me a lot lately.

I keep stumbling upon popular fics with scenes that the authors think don't qualify as rape. Many authors seem to think that if a character gets physical pleasure from what's done to them, then that counts as consent regardless of how much the character says "no" either before or during the act. To me that is extremely disturbing in light of what real-life victims experience.
