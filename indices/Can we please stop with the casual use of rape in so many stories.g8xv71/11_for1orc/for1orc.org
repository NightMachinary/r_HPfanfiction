Wait, this is your problem?

Between "Dubious Consent or non-consent glorification" (ie, rape or non-consent that is portrayed positively) and "Use of rape as villain development" (ie, rape or non-consent that is portrayed negatively), I find the first uncomfortably common and under thought out in fanfiction, including HP Fanfiction.

The second doesn't seem to be that much more common than its use in media as a whole, maybe even a bit less common (since HP is a bit less dark than some media). True, in fanfiction it tends to be more hamfisted or under thought out, but that is sort of the nature of fanfiction....
