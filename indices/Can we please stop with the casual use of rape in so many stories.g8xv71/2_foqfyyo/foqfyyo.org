The problem is the fics these usually end up in - Harry saving and creating a Harem of Slytherin girls - are usually written by preteens or people that don't exactly get out, and want to be edgy. Rape is a terrible thing that can work in stories if it's earned. Most of the time it's just there for shock value, even in real mass market work.

If rape shows up in a Harry Potter fanfiction, I just close out of the story, no matter how far in I've already read. I've never once read an HPFF where it's earned.
