AO3 has a very few mandatory tags: graphic violence, rape, etc. Any story with rape either needs to be tagged for it, or the author needs to use the “Choose not to use archive warnings” tag as a general warning if they feel that the specific tag would be a spoiler. Stories missing those tags can and should be reported.

Tags like M/M and character names are optional.
