Pretty sure you can't report people for not tagging their fics. I looked under terms of service, and there's nothing to report people who fail to tag a fic M/M, or when it's Harry/Hermione fail to tag Harry and Hermione separately. If someone rates a fic as Gen or Teen or something when it's really supposed to be higher you can report them for that, but that's pretty rare. They also won't rate unrated fics, which is one of the things I'm complaining about, because I think the benefit of inclusiveness for such things is less that the utility derived from properly rating and tagging it. Basically you can only complain to AO3 when they tag/rate a fic wrong (to an extent, they let people tag future things all the time), not when it's missing it altogether.
