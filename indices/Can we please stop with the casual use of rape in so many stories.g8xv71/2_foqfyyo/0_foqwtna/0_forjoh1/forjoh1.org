I wish AO3 would go about forcing proper tagging and ratings. I know it's their policy of inclusiveness but I disagree with the need for such encompassing inclusiveness to the detriment of the ability to use the site. While you can filter out fics that authors have chosen to not use warnings or not rate, I do not believe there is much benefit to hiding fics behind such things when it would better serve the community to openly show what kind of content lies within.
