Rape as a character development tool is so classless and unnecessary. Especially Harry getting raped by Vernon is such a bad trope.

The worst thing is that stories that try to deal with rape realistically are mostly too angsty and boring, while stories that gloss over it are otherwise good but have that one stupid element that's only there for shock value.
