What do you mean by “even worse it often goes unpunished”? In real life, rape is a common crime, and an awful lot of it goes unpunished. A writer who writes about privileged criminals getting away with crimes is being realistic. It's not the job of writers to give every story a happy ending where the villains are brought to justice.
