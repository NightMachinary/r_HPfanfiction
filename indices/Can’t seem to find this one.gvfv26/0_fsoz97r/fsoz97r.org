The one you're thinking of is linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) .

"The Garden" is their secret clubhouse where they hatch their Space Program idea, to take the world's magical population and colonize a planet of their own.

It's a five part series. I just read it recently and totally loved it, it's also an Avengers crossover (only slightly).
