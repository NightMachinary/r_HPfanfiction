Hermione, because it's rare (in comparison to others), to say the least.

The Twins, because they're just bullies. Also, somehow it's okay for them to bully Percy and Ron, but Ginny gets a free pass? And the twins can bully Ron but Ron can't do the same to Ginny? Double standards but whatever.

Arthur, because not even trying to get a better-paying job when you have seven kids is selfish af. Yeah, yeah, I know they have food and a home and everything else, but a few extra Galleons would have gone a long way in terms of material comfort. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524997/8/Must-Be-One-of-Arthur-s-Boys]]) gives a plausible reason why that might have been the case, though.

Molly. The constant combo of smothering/emotional distance reminds me of my own mother.
