Snape, Ron, Umbridge, most of Ravenclaw and Fred and George.

Snape because he's just a pathetic man who bullies children and I don't care if he redeems himself at the end it doesn't make it better.

Ron is just a bad friend in my opinion and was given way too many chances.

Umbridge for obvious reasons.

Most of Ravenclaw because they treated Luna horribly. Also I can't remember if it was specific students that were bullying her but others had to of known.

Fred and George because pranks aren't always funny and could be considered bullying I suppose.
