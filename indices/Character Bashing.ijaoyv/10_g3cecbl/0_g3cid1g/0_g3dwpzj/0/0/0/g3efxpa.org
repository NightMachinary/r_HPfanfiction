Just because the Wizarding World is as batty as a box of frogs, it does not excuse child experimentation with potentially harmful products.

And Hermione's parents are muggles who are likely not aware of most of the dangerous shit going down, muggles don't have many rights in a bigoted, terrorist-run government, they're opinion wouldn't count for anything. They wouldn't know anything Hermione doesn't tell them about or she would have been withdrawn from Hogwarts immediately after Halloween.
