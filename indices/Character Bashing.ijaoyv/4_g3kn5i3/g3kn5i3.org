Dumbledore - cuz he deserves it for legit everything.

Regulus - cuz he's worshiped for being nice to his slave and doing the bare minimum that just ended up making Harry's life harder.

Narcissa - cuz she's worshiped for telling a measly lie and the fandom treats her like a goddess for it.

Molly - cuz she has some pretty big canon flaws that aren't criticized.

Minerva - cuz she also has some canon flaws that need addressing.

Often times, the only way I'll get to see this is in a bashing fic so to bashing I will go.
