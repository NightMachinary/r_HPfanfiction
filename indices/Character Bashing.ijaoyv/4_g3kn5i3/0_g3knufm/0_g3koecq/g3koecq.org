More of just frustration over Tumblr Potterheads writing looooooong speculative posts about what a Good Person he was and well, all of his actions(being a Death Eater, having a slave, never sticking up for Sirius) can be excused because he found a Horcrux and tried his best to destroy it. 100K notes.

Usually in the same posts, Narcissa will also get a long 'feminist-positive' rant about how Good she is and how she obviously changed and people who don't like her hate women. It's all more speculative headcanons than anything of substance.

Basically, I'm sick of certain Death Eaters getting worshiped for doing the bare minimum, and all of their faults being excused by a significant portion of the fandom. So I seek fics where the characters I've become most annoyed with, get dragged.
