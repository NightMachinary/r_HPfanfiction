Oooo I love this question because I really like bashing stories!

In no particular order

- Hermione. I feel like she gets treated like some mary sue is because of the actress.

- Molly. She severely annoyed me in the 5th book

- Ginny. Even book!Ginny seems dull to me so I enjoy seeing her bashed

- James Sirius Potter (I've only read one so far but it portrayed him as a spoiled brat and idk, it's something new to read)

- Sirius Black
