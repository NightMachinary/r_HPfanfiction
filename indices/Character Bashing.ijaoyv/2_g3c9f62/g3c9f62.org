In no paryyicular ordrr:

Umbridge, but it's low hanging fruit.

Hermione, mostly because its rare and she has her faults, too.

Fred and George (counting them as "one character unnit" here). I am not overly fond of them, and as they are often the only ones /not/ bashed in Weasley bashing stories this is at least somewhat different.

Snape, but, again, low hanging fruit.

The adult Dursleys. If I had to choose only one of them, Vernon.

--------------

Honestly, not a fan of bashing stories, though. Apart from the castharsis of just screwing over abusive adults in that series, I guess.

I do like stories thst dont shy away from showing character's faults, but that's because I LIKE characters to have faults. I dont consider that bashing.
