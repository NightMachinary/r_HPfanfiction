Just going through the most popular Harry/Ginny fics, there are these two.

Quite a few more have Hermione as part of "manipulative Dumbledore's" network of spies where she reports everything he does. Sometimes she wisens up and is redeemed, sometimes not. The worst have her betray Harry for some rare books or something equally stupid.

Or they go down the reverse of potion queen Ginny and have Hermione do the potioning. I remember reading too many arcs like these.
