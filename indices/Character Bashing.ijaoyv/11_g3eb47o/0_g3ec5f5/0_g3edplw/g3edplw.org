why make a discussion if you are going to get insulted by it? like what the hell? am I not inclined to have my own opinion? the marauders were bullies and that's canon. if you can't take other's opinion, then don't make a discussion here. smh.

Lily gave a goldfish to Slughorn and everyone knows what kind of person Slughorn is. he was talking about the fish to Harry in HBP. from the looks of it she was his favorite student. she was obviously a teacher's pet.
