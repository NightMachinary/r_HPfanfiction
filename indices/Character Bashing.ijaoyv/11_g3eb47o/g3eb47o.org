you don't need to bash Umbridge. ... ??? lol. that's like Voldemort bashing. it's canon!

mine are: Dumbledore (manipulator), McGonnagall (didn't do shit), Sirius (bully), James (bully), Lily (teacher's pet), Remus (coward), Cho (because she took Marietta's side) and because if you need Harry's love interest bashed, Cho is a better option than Ginny. though I don't mind Ginny bashing that much mostly because of movie Ginny.
