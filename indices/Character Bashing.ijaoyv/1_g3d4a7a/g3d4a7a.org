Not that I like bashing at all, but if someone hypothetically puts a gun to my head...

1. Snape: Because fuck this "/I'm okay with infant murder as long as my childhood obsession survives/" bastard. So, /SO,/ many fics give Snape a pass, or even make him somehow a victim for god's sake. Snape does not deserve any forgiveness. He was not a good person.
2. Draco: Fandom loves him because he's played by an attractive actor. That's it. Seriously. The fact that somehow Dramione(basically a Nazi paired with a Jew) is one of the most popular ships in fanfiction community is mind numbing.
3. Hermione: Because she gets too much wanked.
4. Weasley twins: They get left out from Weasley bashing stories because they're funny(supposedly). But I feel like sometimes their practical jokes go too far and they need to be called out on that.
5. Neville: Because I'm tired of seeing him as either "Better Ron" or "Good Draco".(I still believe canon Ron would kick his ass).
