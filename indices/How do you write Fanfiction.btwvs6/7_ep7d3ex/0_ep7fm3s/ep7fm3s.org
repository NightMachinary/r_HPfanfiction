Fyi, as a reader i stay away from fics like this. Chapters under 2k lenght is not chapters, they are scenes and i get annoyed when its so darn short. If you write 15-20 "chapters" before posting, why not combine them so you get a good 3-8 k length chapters? I never unstood why anyone would read or write 1k chapters unless its oneshots, its just way too short
