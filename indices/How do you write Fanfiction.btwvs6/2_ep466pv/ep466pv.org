I always wrote, rewrote, and edited the whole thing (then I could iron out discrepancies and plot holes and work in plenty of foreshadowing), got it betaed before posting, then posted chapters twice a week until it was complete. But that certainly didn't do me any good in terms of attention. Had I been in need of validation from reviews in order to continue, I would never have got past the first chapter of anything. It depends how important it is to you to finish your story.
