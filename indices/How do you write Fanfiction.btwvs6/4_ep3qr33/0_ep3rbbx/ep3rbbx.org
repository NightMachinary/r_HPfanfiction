Yeah, that's what I usually do, but I was reading Steven King's book, "On Writing" and he said that if I wait and don't show it to anyone until I finish at least the first draft, it will work out better for me.

(Not to mention it's way less stressful trying to write something that only I know about as opposed to trying to write a new chapter for a group of people on a regular basis)
