I like to finish the whole thing first before posting. Then I'll read it, reread it, edit it, edit it more, fix plot holes, etc etc, and then post the whole thing on some kind of loose schedule with updates maybe 2x a week or so. Otherwise I worry I won't finish it, and I'd hate to leave it half posted and abandoned. I did that back when I was a teenager making my first attempts, and that was lame. Sitting on 11 chapters and not posting them is hard though! But I shall keep going. haha
