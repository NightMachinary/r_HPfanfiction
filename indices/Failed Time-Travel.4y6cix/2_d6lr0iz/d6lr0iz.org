I have a few Drarry recs that kinda fit your request and one Snarry.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/989537][Annus Mirabilis]] - This is a really interesting fic where Draco and Harry accidentally travel back to the first year of Hogwarts (like 1000AD). Even though only a few minutes pass back in the present, they live there for eight months and start a relationship. Their relationship development was just okay, but the historical details - especially the wand making - were really cool and unique. This was a twist on a time travel fic that I haven't seen done before. I really liked it!

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/245875/chapters/379160][Fast Forward Two Steps Back]] - This was a really unique time travel/romance fic! Usually time travel fics are told from the perspective of the time traveler, but this fic is from 27 year old Harry's POV as a professor at Hogwarts when 17 year old Draco comes from the past. I thought this was really cute and well written. I loved Harry's (mostly platonic) relationship with Neville too.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/936002/chapters/1822648][If Only I Could Turn Back Time]] - This is a HP/DM time travel fic where adult (early 20s?) Harry and Draco accidentally travel back in time years rather than days. They end up in 1991 - their first year at hogwarts - and have to figure out how to get back. The time travel parts were good and the author used the causal paradox really skillfully. However I am really neutral on this fic. The author desperately needed a Beta as well as less cliches. Almost every Harry Draco relationship cliche is in here - seeker games, oblivious Harry, bed sharing, fighting turning to kissing etc. Even the smut was so unbelievably unoriginal - I felt like I had already read every sex scene before in another Drarry.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756/chapters/4040178][Tempus]] - I loved this fic and definitely wasn't expecting to based on the summary. Most basically, it's an EWE canon-compliant, tightly written, time travel fic with a (somewhat) believable Harry/OC romance (the Draco in this is Canon Draco's great grandfather). In this, IIRC, Harry accidentally time travels back to 1920s era hogwarts. Also there's an awesome mystery, a bunch of action and other plotty awesomeness. The description of the Slytherin common room was also unique and unusual. A definite favorite!

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox]] This is an incredibly popular time travel Snarry where a 23y/o Harry goes back to 1971 (snapes first year) and can't get back to his time. He becomes a hogwarts professor and a mentor for Snape. If you like Snarry, you might like this, but it just wasn't well done IMO - but tons of other people loved it which is why I am recommending it here.
