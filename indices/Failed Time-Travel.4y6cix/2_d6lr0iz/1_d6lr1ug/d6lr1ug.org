  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.
