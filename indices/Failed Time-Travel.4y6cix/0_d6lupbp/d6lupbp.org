I don't remember the name of this story, but I'll describe it as best I can. Voldemort intends to help himself towards victory by sending Harry back in time. Don't ask me why, it has been long enough that I don't remember the train of thought. Somehow Draco gets caught up in all this.

V originally intends to send H and D back 200 years. Somehow he only sends them back 20 years instead, and hijinx ensue.
