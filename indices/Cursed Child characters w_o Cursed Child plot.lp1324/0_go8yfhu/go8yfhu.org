There are plenty of next-generation stories, which are based on this premise. E.g., “Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox” linkao3(373224), “Roses Trilogy by Realmer06” starting with linkao3(837413), “Inter Arma... by Pitry” linkao3(369727). “The Divide by Beedle” linkffn(13022404) is not exactly that (only main characters from the Weasley clan are Hermione's ones), but it is so lovely story, I will recommend it nevertheless.
