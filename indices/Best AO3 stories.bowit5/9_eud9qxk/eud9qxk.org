Your best bet might be to search in bookmarks, rather than works - you can even specify only bookmarks with comments. Some comments are minimal and unhelpful, but some tell you exactly what you need to know.

Or check out the bookmarks of authors you enjoy. Oh, and if you like Keira, check out the collections from the challenges she runs: [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/RoughTradeNaNo13][Rough Trade]] and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/thequantumbang/profile][Quantum Bang]]. Both are multi-fandom, but have plenty of HP content.

Speaking of collections, people have also created rec collections if you want to look for those. Like [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/SweetSadisticSynsHarryPotterCollection]]. Those are usually bookmark collections though, so they aren't indicated on the actual story, you can't find them that way.
