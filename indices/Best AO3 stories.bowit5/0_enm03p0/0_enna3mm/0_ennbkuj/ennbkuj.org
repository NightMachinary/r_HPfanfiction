This! This is my problem with ao3... ff.net only has the option of tagging 4 people (I would love to exclude more than 2 though) but on ao3 they tag everyone, from the mailman to the person who delivered your baby. And the story tags are ridiculous too. ‘I'm tagging this as the best story I've written' ‘and every thing that they don't need to tag.
