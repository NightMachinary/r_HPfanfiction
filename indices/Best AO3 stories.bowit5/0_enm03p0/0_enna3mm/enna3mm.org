The frustrating thing about AO3 search is there is no differentiation between a tagged character or pairing that is the focus of the fic vs. one that shows up in the background for a few scenes. This becomes a huge problem when searching for less popular characters who are commonly tagged in other fics.

A search for Fred Weasley centric stories will bring up all kinds of fics that have him tagged as a side character. At the same time I can't exactly exclude characters like Harry and Ginny from the search since they likely will be tagged in Fred centric fics as well.

The problem is just as bad for major characters like Ron or Luna who are usually present in many fics but are not the main character/focus of the fic themselves. AO3 is great for finding specific tropes though.
