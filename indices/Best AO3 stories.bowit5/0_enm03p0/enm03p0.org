I find it just the opposite, I can search AO3 easily and choose to rely on rec's for ffn.

Play with the search function, go to a fandom you like [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]] and start with the simple search on the right side. You can exclude many things. And start with sort by kudos, you'll get the stories that people have liked. Once you find a fic you like, check the authors page and see what the author has favorited.

I'm at work now, I'll see what I have bookmarked and post my favorites
