Oh, sorry, thanks for the clarification. Over tagging is a real problem on AO3. I love Keira also and haven't found anyone who writes those long epic stories like she does. Lady Ra has some good stuff, but her longer ones are SG-1 and multi-fandom type stories.

I have a couple HP stories on my kindle I really like and re-read periodically, I've not used the bot function before, so hope it works.

Gypsy Caravan by Witchdragon? Harry is adopted by a band of gypsy's when he's young. linkao3(3397283)

Trichromatic by Scarlet_Gryphon time travel fixit, Neville/Draco/Harry
