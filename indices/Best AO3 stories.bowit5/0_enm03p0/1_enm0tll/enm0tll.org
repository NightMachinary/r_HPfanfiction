I know how to search ao3, done it for years. :) my problem with ⚯͛ is that it's chaotic and tagged with every unnecessary thing. Better to just ask people for favorites instead of wading through the headache that is ⚯͛ fics on ao3 :) other people have favorites that I wouldn't necessarily have stumbled over before :)
