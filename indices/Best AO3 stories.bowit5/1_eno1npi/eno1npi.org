*The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles*

linkao3(14695419)

Miss Harriet Potter (and Lady Black after Sirius's death) finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the fate of war and magical Britain.

One of my favorite stories. I enjoyed reading about Voldemort who is at the same time possessive, narcissistic bastard and someone who has valid reasons to try his hand at conquering wizarding world. Dumbledore is manipulative, full of "for the greater good" attitude, but also believable as a character. I especially enjoyed few chapters detailing Snape's pov and his attempts to understand on-going changes to conflict (another well-written character).
