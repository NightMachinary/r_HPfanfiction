Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]]). The first book covers all 7 years of school, and the sequel is regularly updated. Features a really interesting Harry and Snape dynamic (not slash) and a cunning Draco. No pairing yet.
