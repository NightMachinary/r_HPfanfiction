When? He's the same horrible POS he is in the books through book two. Draco is also worse. What could they possibly do to make up for their behavior? Can you share that, or are you just one of those do you think their actions are excused and that's why you like it?

I can't even like Harry that much since he excuses all the abuse Snape gives him just because Snape is good at potions. I'm up to chapter 22 at this point (I read fast), and I hate pretty much everyone in this story.
