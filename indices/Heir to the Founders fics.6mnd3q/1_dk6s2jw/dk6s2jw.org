Linkffn(Wish Carefully) Has it mentioned that Harry, Hermione, and Neville are the Heirs of the Founders, which lets them strip Hogwarts bare, including taking the "Heart" that gives the school its magic. (Harry is the Heir of Gryffindor by blood, and Slytherin via the Scarcrux, Hermione is descended from a squib branch of Ravenclaw, and Neville is the Heir of Hufflepuff.)
