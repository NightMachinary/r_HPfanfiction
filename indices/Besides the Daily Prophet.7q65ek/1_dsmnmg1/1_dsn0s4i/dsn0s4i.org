There's probably a quarterly magazine for each subject, e.g. Anals of Arithmancy, but I would expect a low circulation for most.

So that gives you one each for: Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Charms, Defense, Herbology, Transfiguration and Potions

Astronomy, Divination and history I believe wouldn't have a circulation simply out of low interest and content.

Then you've got your main newspaper, The Daily Prophet, as well as The Quibbler, Teen Witch Weekly and Witch Weekly for human interest stories and gossip.

Rather than having a specific occupation circulation, I would presume, say, a cursebreaker would suscribe to potions, runes, arithmancy etc.

Lastly, you have to ask yourself if Playwizard and Playwitch exist. There are plenty of reasons they both would and would not, but it's up to the individual author's world.

...just because something was omitted in canon doesn't mean there isn't a hole where it should be.
