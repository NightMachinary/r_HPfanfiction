linkffn(in bad faith) SI/OC is reborn as Draco's younger sister. It's really good!

linkffn(disenchanted) SI/OC is reborn as the younger sister of Sirius and Regulus. She's trying so hard to save her brothers from their horrible futures even as a baby. This also has a lot of Pureblood themes. This is amazing and I highly recommend this!

linkffn(scourgify) SI/OC is reborn as the twin of Vincent Crabbe and she was positively repulsed by it. It's not a story in James or Lily's time but it has some Pureblood themes.
