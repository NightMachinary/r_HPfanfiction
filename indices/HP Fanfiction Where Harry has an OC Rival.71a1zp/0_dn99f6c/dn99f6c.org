[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7863744/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-Changes][Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes]] -- I have not read this in a long time. If I remember correctly, Harry is eventually paired with the OC, but has her as his rival for a while. He's an ice elemental while she's fire, or something. This could be the wrong story too, I just remember the one I'm thinking of had the word 'Elemental' in it. linkffn(7863744)

It could also have been [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4118383/1][Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power]]. It was deleted from ffn, but found it on fictionhunt. Someone please confirm which one I'm thinkng about.
