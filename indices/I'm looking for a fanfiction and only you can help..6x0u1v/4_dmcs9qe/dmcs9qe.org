This story may have a few errors and is somewhat short, but I immensely enjoyed it and I wished I hadn't finished it so fast. It has a concept that isn't written about enough and is irredeemably AU and some characters may act OOC. There also may be things that may be impossible, but I read this fic when I had second degree burns (my own stupidity) and it was so good, it took my mind off the pain.
