Overlooked good fics? Happy to help.

I hope you like Luna, since that's primarily what I got.

If you want something that's of medium length (as far as fanfics go), and sticks close to canon, then say hello to /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ This is Luna's /Order of the Phoenix/ and it's very good.
