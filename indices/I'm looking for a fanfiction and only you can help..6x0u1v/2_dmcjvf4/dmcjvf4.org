Anything by Slide. She's such an amazing author, and hasn't been recced nearly enough. An astounding amount of worldbuilding in her two years, especially the greater European magical community. If you're worried about writing quality, she's a published original author.

She has 2 separate series that I'm a fan of. The first shows the last 3 books from the point of view of 4 slytherins in the year above Harry's. The characters all have depth and solid interaction.

The second is a sequel to the first involving the next generation. Revolves mostly around Scorpius Malfoy, ALbus Potter, & Rose Weasley. Featuring Slytherin!Albus
