Ooh, time to raid my favorites list! I generally don't keep things that are less than 100k words, so... here's a library. I tried to keep it varied.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11210022/1/An-Unexpected-Predicament][An Unexpected Predicament]] - The very first Neville/Harry I've read, and I really liked it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry begins Auror training the September after the war ends. His partner is Neville Longbottom, his old friend, but feelings arise that cause Harry to question not only his relationship with Ginny, but every other aspect of his life. As he tries to deal with confusing feelings for one of his best friends, he's also struggling with PTSD... Harry/Neville.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul][Broken Mind Fractured Soul]] - really interesting series, does include some questionable psychology but entertaining nonetheless

#+begin_quote
  What if there was a darker truth hidden in Harry's story? Summer before third year, Harry begins to question his memory blanks. What happens when he finds himself before Snape for help? includes mentor Severus, MPD, child abuse, protective Remus

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11059561/1/Charms-Can-t-Fix-Us][Charms Can't Fix Us]] - First not-one-shot fic I've read that addresses the characters right after the end of the war. I thought it was well done.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over and Hogwarts still stands. A few "eighth years" choose to come back to finish their schooling in peace, to mentor war-weary children, and to patch together the ends of their teenage years. Hermione learns what she was missing while out with Harry and Ron, Neville flexes his newfound confidence, Parvati brews a perfect Amortentia, and Draco lets go. "M" to be safe.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] - Really long (I mean that) like basically saga that will make you get attached to people and places and rip your heart out and stitch your chest back together. It does say 4pt series, but that's because there's like 4 "Acts" in the story. It's all one piece.

#+begin_quote
  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10725232/1/Key-Limes][Key Limes]] - Really cute Muggle AU Jily. Short by my standards.

#+begin_quote
  In which Academy Award winner Lily Evans discovers the periphery of internet fandom and the existence of Prince James's gold star system.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Marauder]] - I cried first time I read it. There's so much to it. I love it. Hermione/Remus eventually.

#+begin_quote
  In the wake of the war, Dumbledore's portrait gives Hermione a task that could change the course of history if she succeeds, but unravel time itself if she fails.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - Spy fic, has an out of character Hermione, but I think that's redeemed simply by how the story plays out.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger, master spy, and Severus Snape, spymaster to the Order. An unlikely partnership, forged to defeat the Dark Lord on his own ground. But to do so, they must confront their own darkness within. Spying, torture, angst and love. AU after fifth
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] - I loved this series, unfortunately the last 'book' in it was not completed, though it did wind down for some closure if you check the author's blog linked on her bio. Has some extreme AU things, but I liked how it was done.

#+begin_quote
  Year six and Harry needs rescuing by Dumbledore and Snape. The resulting understanding between Harry and Snape is critical to destroying Voldemort and leads to an offer of adoption. Covers year seven and Auror training.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/811088/1/Not-Myself][Not Myself]] - Forgive some of the cliches in this story, since it was started back in 2002. I think it's allowed for a story that old. Very long, has a handful of short sequels, complete series. You'll get attached to some of the original characters, and there's a decent bit of character development all around!

#+begin_quote
  AU fic. Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard...
