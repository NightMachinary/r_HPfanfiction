Predicament- seemed fine, short enough to not really have that issue

BMFS - I don't remember too many serious tangents, at least not in the first story (the one linked). It does follow canon timeline to an extent (let's call that the plot) so the recurring subplot dealing with the 'broken mind' does get slightly repetitive, and there's some annoying arguments that probably could have been done without.

Charms - it's short enough to not have that issue I think, but there is quite a bit of dialogue. It's a group of those who return to the school helping each other heal in the short term.

Debt - while it's insanely long, I don't think it got -too- rambly. the first part does follow canon events /somewhat/ but only through the last battle. Lots of mods there. The bulk of the story is during the first war/Marauder years, I thought it kept moving, but it might be stretched out too much for your liking.

Limes- only like 20k words, not a problem. Cute though.

Last Marauder- gets a little rambly, but not overboard I think.

Lioness- I just finished rereading this like yesterday lol. There was some repetition in regards to Death Eater activities, most of this was original development though. The few pointless subplots that I'd prod at helped the romance and angst along, and ended the overdone 'ignore feelings do job' thing that happens sometimes.

Resonance- definitely repetitive (within itself) and tangent-y, frankly I think you'd be fine just reading the original story (the one linked) and not the sequels. The sequels I think were what brought on my mental fatigue because it was a lot of the same. Because I read the whole series end to end, I can't recall if this first one itself was particularly bad with this or not.

Not Myself- lots of dialogue, I don't recall too many 'pointless' subplots, but you might be annoyed with one part of the bloodline thing that happens (I can spoil that for you via PM if you'd like, it seemed unnecessary, and I can't remember the spoiler code off-hand at the moment). There was plenty of original development though, which I attribute to the fact that it was started so early, so it only had to many of the books to parallel at the time. You might hate the way the author wrote the way Harry speaks (accent), but it was done for a reason (I was annoyed with it).

Of what I listed, I think you might like Charms and Lioness, and I think you should give Not Myself a try up through the 7th chapter (Halloween of 1st year) before deciding you hate it. Edit: Also Predicament if you're cool with Slash, I don't think it got graphic though. I also read it at like 3am the other day, though, so my judgment on that one might be impaired.
