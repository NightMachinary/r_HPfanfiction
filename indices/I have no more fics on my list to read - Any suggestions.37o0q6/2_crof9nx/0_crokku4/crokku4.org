Stories that are both long and marked as Friendship/Adventure/Romance often have a tendency of containing large chunks of inane writing (pointless dialogues, pointless subplots, repetition of the original storyline with almost no original development, etc), which I just can't stand. Can you advise if I should/shouldn't read these ones?
