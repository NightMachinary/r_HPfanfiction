Why jump through hoops like that?

The blood protection in Philosopher's Stone expressed itself as fire, burning Quirrelmort. Keep that expression. Use the idea that the scuffle awakened the protection, having come into contact with Tom again, and it actively protects him as magical fire. Someone attacks him with magic? The fire manifests and absorbs the spells fired. Something physically attacks him? Burn, baby, burn.

A limitation is that his magic becomes 'tainted' by the fire, and always has an incendiary component to it, greatly limiting his utility with it in comparison to his peers. Another limitation is that the fire isn't super strong, or at least not at first, not capable of absorbing powerful spells or burning magic resistant things. Of course, the more powerful his fire gets, the more it expresses itself in his regular magic. It could get to the point that he can't actually fight alongside anyone or protect them, because his magic is so explosively burny that his friends/lover/family runs a very real risk of being incinerated just by being near him while he is using magic. His fire protects him alone without regard to collateral damage.
