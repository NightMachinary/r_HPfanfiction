You know that you can communicate about these things, right? All that fannish next-of-kin does is make it possible for your FNOK to get access to your account if you die, assuming that both of you informed AO3 that the other person was your FNOK.

Maybe you want that person to finish your stories, maybe you want that person to be able to fix typos, it's all up to you. It's exactly the same as just giving somebody your pw, except that the exchange only happens upon your death so you don't have to change your pw if you change your mind, and your FNOK doesn't have to worry about keeping it safe and hidden in the interim.

All this does is give people more options.
