I know you can, I misread what the link was about; I thought it was more of a someone can take over your account based on how they see fit rather than an orphaning/deleting/per serving type thing. I was just explaining my thought process when I wrote that comment. But I'm pretty sure my comment does say that if it was for that then I'd be okay with it?

And someone close to me died recently so I'm sorta in a mood about death? Sorry about that.
