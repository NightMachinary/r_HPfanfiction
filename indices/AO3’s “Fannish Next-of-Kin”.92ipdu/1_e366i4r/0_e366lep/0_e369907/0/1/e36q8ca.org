Actually, no. It's horrible to me because of several reasons, none of which are the “perfect illusion” as you claim.

It's horrible to me because if something happens to an author, I can see the FNoK breaking the trust of the author. Like maybe the author only told them to write notes on their stories if they died, and the FNoK decides to continue it on anyways. Or maybe the author only wanted the FNoK to continue their stories, and instead they put them up for adoption as soon as it happens.

It's also horrible for me because I see this as a way for authors to continue on others' stories if they die, even if they aren't FNoK. Can they just claim that the author was going to make them it? Provide a photoshopped email? Or maybe they won't even claim they're FNoK, but thanks to this they think that they can take over the author's work anyways?

And I guess it's also a little horrible to me because the anniversary of someone close to me dying occurred recently. Fine, sue me for being human. But most of the reason as to why I'm upset is in the two paragraphs above.
