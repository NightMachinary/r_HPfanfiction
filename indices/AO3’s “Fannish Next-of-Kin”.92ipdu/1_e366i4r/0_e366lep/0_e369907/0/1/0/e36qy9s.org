  It's also horrible for me because I see this as a way for authors to continue on others' stories if they die, even if they aren't FNoK. Can they just claim that the author was going to make them it?

Pretty sure, they'd have to have been 'flaged' by the real author for them to be FNoK (I don't know much about FNoK, so don't take it as a fact)
