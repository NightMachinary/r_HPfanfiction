That has literally nothing to do with the matter at hand. If anything, it just shows how ridiculous your concern is. Yes, we had a plagiarizer on FFN. I'm aware, as one of my stories were taken.

But that's exactly the point. This FNoK thing doesn't suddenly allow people to plagiarize or whatever. People do it anyway. So there's no reason to have a problem with FNoK. It doesn't give bad people a tool to use. They can lie and plagiarize either way.

Seems like you didn't bother reading what it was actually about, and came here immediately instead to complain about it. It's a good feature, and the only way it could possibly be abused is if you picked an untrustworthy person to be your FNoK.
