There's nothing stopping someone from claiming a dead author wanted them to continue the story either way. Even on FFN, it can be done. Someone could easily photoshop a conversation, or even use Inspect Element to edit a conversation and make it look like the author gave them permission to continue the story. So your fears aren't necessary. They're a little silly.
