It's sort of a grim idea, but I think it's actually pretty nice. Authors dying mid-story /has/ happened, and many artists (me included) would much rather their last work be completed if they ever die than to have it hang around unfinished, forever tainted by their unfinished-ness being a testament to the tragedy, never mind that it may have been a light-hearted comedy.
