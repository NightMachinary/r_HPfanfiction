Of all the things I was expected to get torn up at, this wasn't one of them, either. I can just see this FNoK getting abused by people in so many ways, and it's horrible to think that people would do something like that when somebody else dies? Do I know it happens? Yes, of course I do. But that doesn't make the idea any sweeter.

And yes, I did take a look at their FAQ on it, but that didn't really offer me any solace on the problems I have with it.
