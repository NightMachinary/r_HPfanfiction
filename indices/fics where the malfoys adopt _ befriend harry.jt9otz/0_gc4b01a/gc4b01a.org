In Royal Ward, they befriend rather than adopt. The basic premise is from a short that the author expanded, where Harry protects the Princes when Di is at his school and Dudley tries to bully them. One thing leads to another and he becomes a "Royal Ward" because the Queen's advisor says taking him from the house would be dangerous to him and that's a way to ... manipulate things.

Anyway, the Malfoys start out as classist and elitist, but not evil per se, and they slowly develop and get better to the point where Draco goes to the same school as Harry because he's interested in the Muggle World.

It does a good job in humanizing the Malfoys without making them uber-goodie. They're classist (but getting better) but they're not utterly evil.
