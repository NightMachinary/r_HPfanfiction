I'd be very curious to find a canon-believable, realistic take of this.

We know Lucius is a Death Eater, a man who has no problem signing children to their deaths (he fully expected Diary to cause Muggleborn kids to die). He is constantly surrounded by other Death Eaters who re still in the free. They are still semi active at terrorising - e.g. after the Quidditch World Cup, we can bet Lucius was at the epicentre there.

Lot of stories seem to think that Harry's life would be fixed, his childhood suddenly amazing, twin brother to Draco, adopted and given Malfoy name. Suddenly having every luxury imaginable.

In reality? I think Harry would immediately be treated no better than Dobby, likely even forced to live with Houseelves. Punished and mistreated on daily bases, forced to do houseelf work, with no magic. Other death eaters that Lucius surrounds himself with would never accept anything less than absolute abuse of the boy.

I can imagine him "accidentally" locking the boy out, on a full moon night, when Good Family Friend Fenrir Greyback just happens to be nosing outside in the gardens ...

Yeah in short, I do not think it would be a good thing for Harry to be found by Malfoys.

Any stories like that?
