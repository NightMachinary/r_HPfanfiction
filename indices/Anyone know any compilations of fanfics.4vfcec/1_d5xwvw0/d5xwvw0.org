The only compilation site I know of is Painless J's. [[http://painless-j.net/blog/category/hp-recs/]]

There are two things, though: It's oriented heavily towards slash (there are categories for both gen and het) and it hasn't been updated in nearly ten years. Many links are dead, but a search by title usually finds the story. If I were ambitious and knowledgeable, I'd try to create something similar with fics that have been posted since 2009.
