Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty has an original character drawn in to the HP universe from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e.

I was not too familiar with DnD when I first read it, but I enjoyed it so much, I began experimenting with other DnD things. Now I'm an avid player and im even a Dungeon Master to four of my friends!
