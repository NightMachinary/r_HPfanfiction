I love me a good crossover. A couple of my favorites:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/6972218/1/Rediscovery]]

A Star Trek: TNG crossover which errs in making the future wizarding society a bit too much a carbon copy of the 20th Century British one, but otherwise good. Feels very true to both the Potterverse and Trek settings, and somehow manages to merge them very well. Complete.

Stephen Colbert (in his Colbert Report character) teaches DADA. Short fic, also complete.

And a shameless plug for one of my own:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/12769170/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gargoyle-s-Curse]]

Harry Potter/Gargolyes crossover. Unfinished. Not the only Potter crossover I've written (or, rather, started and not finished, for which I do apologize), but in my own humble opinion my strongest work to date.
