*Mischief's Heir* - linkao3(4629198) First novel in the series (completed)\\
HP/Marvel Blend.

It looks like bashing, but it's plot elements. Except for Ginny. The first 2/3 books have a shadowy bad guy behind everything in canon HP. The rest are about trying to maintain the statute of secrecy, and watching Shield/Hydra fight.
