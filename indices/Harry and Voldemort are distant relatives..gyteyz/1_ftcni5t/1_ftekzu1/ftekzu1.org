I've read a few stories that have used the rite of conquest. Most of them had Harry become Slytherin's heir by defeating Voldemort three times (as a toddler, Quirrell, and the diary), but one took the position that TMR died in 1981. Sure, he didn't pass on, and Voldemort was resurrected some years later, but Tom Riddle was dead, and thus, no longer the heir of Slytherin.

Not that long ago, I read one that had Harry become the heir of Slytherin, and stated that the inheritance had to be tracked up from the Gaunts to the second Peverell brother, then back down through Ignotus back to Harry.
