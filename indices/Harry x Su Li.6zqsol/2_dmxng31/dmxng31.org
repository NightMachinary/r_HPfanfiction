I can only think of one right off the top of my head linkffn(The Cult of Dionysus by Ynyr)

Fair warning, It's a Harem fic. Honestly, though, it's one of the better-explained harems I've ever seen. It gives a semi-reasonable explanation as to why so many women are willing to put up with one person.

It's a crazy ride but It's been on my favorite list for about three years, worth at least trying.
