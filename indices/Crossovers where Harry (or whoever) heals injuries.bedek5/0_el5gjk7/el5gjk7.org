I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] and really enjoyed how the Jedi react to Harry's Magic. Magic is used to heal injuries, altough may be not what you're looking for. Harry saved a bartender from a blaster blast, Ventress and Master Fay from a lightsaber stab.Harry is OOC, but then again he has lived for 1700 year at that point. You could argue that his personality will be different from his teenage years. He's similiar to Harry from Black Comedy, confident and has a perverse joke.

You don't need to know much about Star Wars. The setting is between Episode II and III, right after Ashoka Tano's trial. I only watch the movies and I know the rest from reading the wiki.
