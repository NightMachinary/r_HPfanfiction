There was this one family at my high school that was homeschooled for elementary and middle school... They were all super popular, all three made valedictorian, and the youngest brother was Homecoming King AND Prom King even though he didn't play football... In Texas. I'm not sure what homeschoolers you've met, and my anecdotal evidence doesn't count any more than yours does, but let's say that at least they cancel each other out.
