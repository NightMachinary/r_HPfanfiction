when it comes to personal experience like that, important to remember that home-schooling takes skills and discipline that by far not every parent can pull off.

I actually considered trying home-schooling my kid after looking over research regarding academic/professional outcomes (which basically mostly conclude that unless you are Ivy League family, home schooling is much better on average), but when I did research on how that's to be done properly I realized that neither I nor my wife are disciplined enough to do it right and don't feel like trusting that I will 'learn on the job'.

But to further clarify a bit about home-schooling, keep in mind that in vast majority of the cases, it does not mean 'the kid stays home, only talks to parents, never sees other kids'.

More often how home schooling is practiced is parents who want to do that form little clubs - so the kids learn from one or a few parents within the group in what amounts to a class of like a dozen kids or less, studying together in home environment. Obviously in such a case they each get a lot more personal attention from adults vs. public school, and their days tend to be more closely overseen and organized.
