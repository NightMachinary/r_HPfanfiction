Parents are I think Catholic, but they're not really religious (never had to go to church and never really forced their religious beliefs on me). My parents chose to homeschool me because they did not want me to be part of the school system and after my experiences with friends who have chosen to go to high school i'm actually pretty happy with their choices. I did not have to study for external exams because I started taking concurrent enrollment classes at a community college at age 16. I currently have an AA degree from that college (I'm 19). Absolutely, i'd call it abuse if you are not having your kid go out and socialize. In my case there were various homeschool groups around and I spent time hanging with kids there. Overall, My parents really let me make my own choices for what I wanted to do and let me learn at my own pace which is great. Sorry for the delay, I don't log in to this account too much.
