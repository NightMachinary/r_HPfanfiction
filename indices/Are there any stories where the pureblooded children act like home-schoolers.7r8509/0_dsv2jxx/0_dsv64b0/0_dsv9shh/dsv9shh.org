I think you are kind of prejudiced here regarding effects of home-schooling.

Research tends to point the opposite way in fact - home schooled kids tend to have much better social skills (and academic skills) which shouldn't be that much of a surprise since they tend to spend a lot more of their time socializing with adults.

Here is a summary article on the topic which mentions studies and some sources - the social aspect is examined in the later half of the article.

tl,dr - acting 'like home-schoolers' would normally translate to 'acting like kids a few years older than they actually are as compared to skills going to public school'.

Granted, OP is correct that to a public school kid, a same age kid that's acting more maturely than the norm would seem weird
