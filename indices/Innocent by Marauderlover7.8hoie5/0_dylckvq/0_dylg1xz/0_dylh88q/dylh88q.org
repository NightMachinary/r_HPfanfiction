Huh I never really gave the name much thought. From [[http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/hydrus-constellation][this site]] :

#+begin_quote
  Hydrus is also known as “the lesser water snake”

I wonder if the author chose the name based on that meaning, implying Hydrus is the lesser snake (in a cunning Slytherin personality-wise way) to Draco?
