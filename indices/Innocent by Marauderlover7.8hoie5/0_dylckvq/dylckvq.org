It's been a while since I reread the beginning of the series but I think the characters are referring to Draco's brother who almost died in childbirth but lived, so people refer to him as "the boy who lived". The moniker (when referring to Hydrus) doesn't get mentioned beyond that first chapter, if I recall correctly.

Edit: because I didn't make it clear... Innocent is NOT a WBWL story.
