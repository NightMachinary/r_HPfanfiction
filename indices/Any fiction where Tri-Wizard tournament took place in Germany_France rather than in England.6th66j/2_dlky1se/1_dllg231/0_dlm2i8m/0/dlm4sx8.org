I suspected that Durmstrang enrolled students from multiple countries (even Lucius considered sending Draco there); I still don't know which country it's in exactly. Just because there are German students doesn't mean the campus itself is in Germany, although it's a possibility. (Tbh, I feel like a lot of people are assuming Durmstrang is in Germany because it furthers the "Grindelwald=Hitler" allegory.)

Here's another question that I don't think has been raised in the thread yet: what would be the Hogwarts students' means of transportation if they were traveling to another country? We know Durmstrang had their ship and Beauxbatons had their flying horses and carriages, but what would Hogwarts have had?
