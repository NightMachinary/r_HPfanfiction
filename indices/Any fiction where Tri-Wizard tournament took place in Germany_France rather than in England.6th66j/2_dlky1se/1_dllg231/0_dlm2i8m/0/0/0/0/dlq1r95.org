Which bothers me though is, that there is no completly german wizarding school. So many ppl in the eu are speaking german (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Swiss, some part of Poland and Netherlands). So that doesn't make sense at all. There are millions of speakers with their own dialect but it's the German native language nonetheless.
