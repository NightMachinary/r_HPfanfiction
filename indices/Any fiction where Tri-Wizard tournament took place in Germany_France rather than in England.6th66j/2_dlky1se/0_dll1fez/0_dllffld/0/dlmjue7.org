What Krum says in GoF imply northern Scandinavia, Rowling also said at some event that that's where it is. But the recent Pottermore map seems to place it around KÃ¶nigsberg/Kaliningrad. I'm not sure if we are supposed to read it as it being there or just as a representation of how unknown the location is. I remember that [[/u/Taure]] placed Durmstrang in these parts even before the map, but I don't know what was his reasoning for it.
