Hogwarts would arrive in seemingly self flying carrages with most if not all the 7th years plus dumbledor in attendance.I imagine them staying in tents such as the world cup, or maybe an inflatable castle to mimic hogwarts. I honestly can not figure out why Harry would be dragged along to this which would make the rest of the questions moot. (I wouldn't mind reading an actual tri wizard fic without Harry or Voldy.) But in the case with Harry going obviously Dumbledore would of invited Ron and Harmione in order to bring Harry along. I can also see Crouch paying the Durmstand Headmaster a visit since the tourny is hosted there.
