You're right on the aid and Crouch Jr raking whichever form he wants. It could definitely help close some plotholes if utilised properly.

Say Dumbledore does bring Moody to keep Crouch Jr as Moody for simplicity's sake. It is realistic and logical for him to bring his DADA professor It still brings up the issue of: Harry is clearly not there at all. It becomes a different situation than at Hogwarts. Say Dumbledore knows Moody is Crouch and wants to allow Harry to compete like in GoF. There is no way he'll be able to realistically convince the other staff members to allow a boy, who never even saw the goblet, compete in a competition that he is also too young to compete in. Especially since he's not at the host school. I highly doubt Madame Maxime and Karkaroff would be as willing to accept this as they were in GoF (and they were still very unwilling). There is pretty much no feasible logical argument Dumbledore could give and the others would immediately know that the goblet was tampered with.

It becomes a whole mess of plotholes. Why would Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Bagman and co allow Harry to compete? They have zero reason to accept it and have a higher chance of either canceling the tournament or bringing in Ministry officials to check out the Cup. Plus, it would not even be the Ministry of Magic we know, but most likely the Ministry for the host country. So now Dumbledore has to convince the host school, host Ministry, and other visitor schools to allow this strange act of clear favouritism and allow for Hogwarts, a visitor school, to bring in a student that wasn't even there to put their name into the goblet. Even the best orator in the world will have a difficult time achieving this.

So then, how does Dumbledore properly convince them? Why even bother with using the tournament if Moody/Crouch can just stay at a Dumbledore-less Hogwarts and have easier access to manipulate Harry? It would actually be easier for Moody/Crouch to stay at Hogwarts because it was really only Dumbledore who discovered his identity at the end of GoF. Maybe, instead, we have Snape discerning his identity and teaming up with McGonagall to catch Crouch Jr. Which could provide some really fun paragraphs or Chapters. I would love to read a well-written fic that dealt with McGonagall and Snape teaming up to "play spy."

Btw, in case it doesn't show, I'm loving this discussion we're having. It's been a while since I've been able to have such a long and good discussion about Harry Potter.
