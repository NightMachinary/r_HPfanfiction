I remember plenty about the canon. I am just pointing out some serious plotholes that would emerge. I understand the binding magical contract. I understand that Harry would not physically be there but would have to the BROUGHT there.

But I also understand that Dumbledore had to talk Karkaroff and Maxime into a) not leaving because they thought he was cheating (pg 244 GoF) and b) allowing Harry to compete. The process of convincing them becomes even more complex when the person isn't even physically there to put their name in. Also note that we're not 100% when exactly Crouch Sr was put under the Imperius Curse. So he may have been cursed here to make it easier for the others to accept Harry into the tournament. This would be easy seeing as Mood/Crouch Jr was in the room at the time and the book describes Crouch as older, skull like, and standing away from the group half hidden in shadows (pg 243). And when he steps into the light, Harry notes that he looks sickly (pg 246) Plus Moody is the one to convince the others that Harry's name was not out in for cheating, but rather to have him killed.

Even after convincing them, Maxime and Karkaroff are described as "glaring", and "livid". (Pg 246).

I get that this is a defining moment and GoF is one of my favourite books. I get that this process helps Harry grow, learn, and develop, and eventually culminates into the rise of Voldemort and Harry developing some form of PTSD after Cedric's death (which is shown via his words and actions in OotP). I am just pointing out some major issues that would arise and that someone would need to really explore and properly explain them in order to a) avoid being torn apart for creating major plotholes and b) to make the story flow with a certain logic and sense.

So please don't question my knowledge of what I remember of canon, when I am just bringing up a valid issue. I also just thought that I was having an interesting discussion with [[/u/UrTwiN]], but apparently not. They make a valid point about the Goblet contract and they are right. By the magical contract, Harry should be brought there. But, I feel that I also bring up a good point in that the Karkaroff and Maxime would be even more against having Harry brought to the school to compete. It's only logical, especially after their reactions in GoF (pgs 242-246 in the book).

I'll just leave it at that. Because apparently I'm just upsetting and angering people and making them question my knowledge of canon, rather than having an interesting discussion. Valid canon-based points were brought up by UrTwiN, which I agreed with.

Sorry for the walls of text. And sorry if I upset anyone
