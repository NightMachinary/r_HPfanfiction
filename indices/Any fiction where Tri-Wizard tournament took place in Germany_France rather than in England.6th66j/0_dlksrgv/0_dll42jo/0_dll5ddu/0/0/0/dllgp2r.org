Another problem, though, is how do they think his name got into the goblet if he isn't there? I can see Dumbledore, Crouch Senior, Bagman, and co putting a total halt to the tournament and bringing in Ministry officials to check out the goblet because it was obviously tampered with. Plus Moody/Crouch Jr would not even be there to put in Harry's name, because, from what I read and saw, only the Headmaster/Headmistress of the visiting schools went.

It just becomes this big plothole that only a fantastic expert writer could try to tackle. And even then, we've seen how well some "expert writers" are able to write fanfiction (i.e. Cursed Child).

I would love to read a fic like that, but someone would need to spend a lot of time developing a 100% proper reason for Harry being brought to the host school. Although, imho, this paints a perfect opportunity to write a fic where Cedric is the only champion for Hogwarts and how he deals with that and being in a foreign place. All the while, Harry has to spend a school year in a Dumbledore-less Hogwarts with Moody/Crouch trying to find a way to kidnap Harry. Would definitely make for an interesting rewrite of GoF through 2 different perspectives.
