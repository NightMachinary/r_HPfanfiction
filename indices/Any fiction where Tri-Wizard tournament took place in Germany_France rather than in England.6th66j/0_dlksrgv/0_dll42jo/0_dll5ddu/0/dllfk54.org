One flaw I see, though, is that Harry's name came out of the Cup well after Durmstrang and Beauxbatons were at Hogwarts. Therefore, if Hogwarts was traveling to the host school, Harry would not go at all because A) he is not of age and B) the Cup is only at the host school and the names are only put in after all of the schools have arrived.

So, unless Moody/Crouch is able to work a giant miracle, there is zero reason for Harry to be taken to the host school with the other 7th year Hogwarts students.

It would make for a fascinating read to see Harry's perspective of a different school. But there is zero logic behind bringing Harry when he is not of age and none of the other schools brought underage students with them in GoF.
