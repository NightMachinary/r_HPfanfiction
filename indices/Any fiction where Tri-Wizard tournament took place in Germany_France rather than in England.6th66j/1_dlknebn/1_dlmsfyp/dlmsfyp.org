Huh, a bit confused because I'm only just reading Harry McGonagall, but when I stumbled onto this post I was going to comment that I had remembered reading a plot where the TWT wasn't at Hogwarts and he still got chosen. I think I must be thinking of a different fic. Weird that it must happen in this story as well.
