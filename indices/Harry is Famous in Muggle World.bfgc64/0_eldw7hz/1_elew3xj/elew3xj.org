I'm only 5 chapters at the moment, but so far this is a fantastic read. The way the author wrote Hufflepuff social dynamics both makes sense and completely changes my outlook on the house. Thanks for the rec. If you know of any other fics with this kind of tone, especially regarding social interactions, please send some this way!
