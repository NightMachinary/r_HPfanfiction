I remember reading that à wizard need to have 3 generations of wizards ancestor to be considered pure. So for Harry case, his grand children would be pure blood, assuming they marry pure blood of Half blood of the same generation. But Ron and Hermione descendant would not be pure before their great grand children since Hermione is a first generation.

There is also something about not remember you have muggles in your family tree to be pureblood. But I don't really understand this one because from one side, someone could never know about his muggle grand parents, or "forget" about them. And on the other, one family could have married only pureblood since the founder time yet still keep trace on his muggle ancestor on thé family tree. So who's the pureblood in this case ?
