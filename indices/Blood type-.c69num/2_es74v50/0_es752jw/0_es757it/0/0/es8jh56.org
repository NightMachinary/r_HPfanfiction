I was going by what I'd read on the HP Wiki, which was taken from this information from JKR:

  â†‘ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 FAQ at J. K. Rowling's Official Site - "The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents. If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda."

So, for extremists, it seems to be no Muggles, but for the most part, seems to go by grandparents. The Weasleys are considered pure blood, even though the have squibs in the family who presumably have married Muggles. Ron and Hermione's children are in the same boat as Harry's--Muggle grand parents with Hermione's parents. Hermione is Muggleborn, but she's a witch, so her grandchildren, if all four grandparents are magical, would be considered pure blood.
