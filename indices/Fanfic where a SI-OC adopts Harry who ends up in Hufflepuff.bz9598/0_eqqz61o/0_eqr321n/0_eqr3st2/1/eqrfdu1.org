I have issues with faith in general, not just Christianity. Almost every religion has been subverted by the cult-minded, who used the existing faiths for their own gain, rather than creating cults of their own. Anything good in religion has been tainted with human greed and malice. To use Christianity as an example, we have evidence that many of the translations of the original hebrew texts that made up the bible were translated in such a way as to push an agenda, nevermind all the priests who have perverted its teachings for their own gain. You and Full-Paragon may have the most honest and wholesome intentions, but you've been part of a 2000+ year game of telephone and not everyone in the chain was playing fair.

A story set among a church community, about a person discovering their faith? Fine. That might even make for a quality story, and everyone is allowed their right to worship as they please. But injecting the faith into an existing work that didn't have strong religious themes before (excluding the Harry-is-Jesus allegory)? It feels like the author is trying to push their faith upon the readers, and that turns me off.

Thanks, but no thanks.
