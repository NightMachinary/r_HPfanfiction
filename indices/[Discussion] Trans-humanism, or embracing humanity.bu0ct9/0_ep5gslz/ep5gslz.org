I feel like "transhumanism" covers two very different things. Absent the afterlife which renders the matter moot, I am all in favor of ending death, but that's more a matter of 'preserving' humanity than transforming it; I'm certainly not keen on altering the nature of human thinking, becoming cyborgs for the hell of it, etc. Yet immortalism as such is branded transhumanism by common classification.
