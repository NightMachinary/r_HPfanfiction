I'm partial to stories that explore the outer limits of what it means to be human. Stories like the one you linked (The Carnivorous Muffin's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?") are great examples of that.

When I consider Transhumanism, I'm more fascinated by the extreme scenarios in which science advances to the point that /Homo sapiens/ is made obsolete by the the computing/reasoning capacity of their creations. I like the idea that humanity will eventually create their own replacements; something so far from human that we may lack the capacity to comprehend it, but that might carry on our legacy beyond the life span of our own civilization.

I would love to read Harry Potter fics that head in that direction, maybe with science and magic working together in a far future, similar to the /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfic "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To The Stars]]".

Thus far, the only HP fics I know of which come close are The Carnivorous Muffin's stories. She tends to write protagonists who stand outside humanity, looking in. Thus, their world view is less anthropocentric, which is the closest I've seen a fic get to the posthuman mindset. "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]" are good examples.
