Personally, I'm with canon and the embracement of being human. For me the transhumanism in HP is something that extremely hard (like mastery level), limited (even if a wizard could make himself stronger with a potion, I don't think he could get the level of a comic book super hero like Superman, or Hulk), and always come with a price.

For example, I read a lot of fic where Harry just go to Diagon Alley, drink a potion and then doesn't need his glasses anymore. In my headcanon, while correcting his vision is theorically possible, I would need an incredibly dangerous operation of self transfiguration to correct his cornea (the wizard being forced to do it himself because without measure, only he can know when the cornea is well adjusted), with any error carrying the risk to blind the patient. And this is why most wizards just wear glasses (which can also be enchanted).

Also, when it comes to transhumanism, there is the problem of the soul. No matter what someone does to his body, the soul can't be touched. There would be no problem when self repearing his body, but when it comes to truly "enhance" himself, there is a possibility that the soul becomes less "adjusted" to the body, with heavy consequences.
