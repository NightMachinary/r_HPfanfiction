Sure. I've got a few more.

Harry teaches for the Black Family sprogs, incl. Sirius, Andromeda, Regulus, Bellatrix, and Narcissa. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6866113/1/To-Bow-with-Pride]]

Harry is mildly melancholy here, but it's quite fluffy. Post-epilogue. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531]]

Both of these are Harry-Bellatrix teaching in the past. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]]

Another time travel one, only this is Harry-Ginny. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2386991/1/Putting-the-M-in-Mystery]]

Harry also ends up teaching a lot in the Where in the World is Harry Potter? series by Nonjon. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/]]

This is on my to-read list. Haven't read it yet, so can't speak to its quality. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11289525/1/A-Good-Teacher]]

And finally, the ever-aging Disorder of the Phoenix. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12813755/1/]]
