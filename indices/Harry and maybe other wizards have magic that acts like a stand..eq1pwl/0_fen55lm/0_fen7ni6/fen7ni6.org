In broad terms, a "Stand" is the physical manifestation of a character's supernatural abilities in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. They generally take the form of a humanoid figure standing next to the person (hence the name) and are invisible to those who do not have a Stand of their own. If you've ever played a Persona game, the concept of a Persona is basically identical to that of a Stand, minus the Jungian psychological symbolism.
