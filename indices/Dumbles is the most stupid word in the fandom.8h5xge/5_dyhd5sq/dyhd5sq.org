I don't normally like fics that use them, but I think that's because they belong in fics that maintain the same whimsical/absurdist nature that cannon has.

They are definitely too common in fannon, but they have their place. For example, it is not out of character for Fred, George, of Peeves to use terms like Dumbles, Umbitch, dark tosser, or Moldyshorts.
