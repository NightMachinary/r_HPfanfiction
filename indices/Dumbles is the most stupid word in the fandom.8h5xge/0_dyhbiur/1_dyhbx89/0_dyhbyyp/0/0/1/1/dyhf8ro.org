My first thought is the scene in Twilight where Cendric tells 'plain jane' to "Say it. Say it...out loud" in regards to him being a vampire. It made me chuckle thinking about Voldemort replacing him in Twilight. Him being all brooding at a high school while he's obviously an adult with no nose and horrible pale/transparent but sparkley skin, and the glowing red eyes. People just think he's an albino with 'Benjamin Button's disease' who had a botched nose job. Sounds like a funny crack fiction.
