This whole time I thought it was apparation and it bothered me more than it should whenever I saw apparition but I just dug out both my copies of HBP and both of them say “Apparition Lessons” so maybe we've both been wrong this whole time? I still don't understand how “apparate” turns into “apparition” and not “apparation”
