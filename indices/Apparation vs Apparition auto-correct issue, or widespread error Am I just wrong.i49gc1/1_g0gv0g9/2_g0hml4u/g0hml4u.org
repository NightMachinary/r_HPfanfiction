Except Apparition is already a word in English, spelled with an ‘i'. Referring to an entity that appears unexpectedly, hence why it is applied to magical teleportation. To ‘correct' it to Apparation is legitimately wrong. To apparate and disapparate are neologisms and back-forrmations from the word Apparition.
