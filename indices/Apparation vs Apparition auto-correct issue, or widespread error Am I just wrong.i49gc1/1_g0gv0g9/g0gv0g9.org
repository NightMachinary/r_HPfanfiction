I agree it should be Apparation, but JKR (or her editors) allowed the auto-correct to override this logical progression. As evidence I submit the use of Apparating and Disapparating used in chapter 2 of Book 5; also the term Anti-Disapparation Jinx in chapter 36.

Even better, this reference in Chapter 6 clinches it:

#+begin_quote
  ‘You two passed your Apparation tests, then?' asked Harry grumpily.

In book six, they flipped to using the auto-correct version

#+begin_quote
  ‘But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!' said Ron grumpily. ‘Big birthday treat ...'

  Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves.

By book 7, they'd even corrupted the departing version to use an 'i'

#+begin_quote
  The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition.
#+end_quote

In the end, it's just further proof that things went awry for the series after book 5.
