There's definitely still a big audience for them and a reasonable amount of people writing - the difference is they tend to be short stories, one shots or snippets. I think post-DH there was a big "im going to write what happened next!" phase and people would end up with lengthy fics where not much happened and the same beats had to be hit. I think those that are left have found that filling in those years is more powerful when focusing in on specific moments. At least that's how it's been for me - I basically have one giant fic made up from hundreds of one shots all in the same canon-compliant universe.
