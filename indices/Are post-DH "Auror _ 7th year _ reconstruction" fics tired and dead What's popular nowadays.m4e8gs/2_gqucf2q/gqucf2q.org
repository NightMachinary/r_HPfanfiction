I want way more post-DH fics, preferably EWE. The reason I got into HP fan fiction is because I wanted to know what happened after DH. The first fic I ever read was "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by little0bird and I have been hooked on what your brains come up with ever since.
