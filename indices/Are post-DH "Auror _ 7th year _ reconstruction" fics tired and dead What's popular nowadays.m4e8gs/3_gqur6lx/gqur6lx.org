I want more post-DH punishment fics. As far as I know, it's pretty much just "Sum of Their Parts" and "Marriage Law Revolution", neither of which is satisfactory. I want a fic that's not just Cornelius Fudge and his enablers and Dolores Umbridge and her collaborators (every staffer for the Muggleborn Registration Commission, every Snatcher, every Daily Prophet propagandist, etc.) getting executed, but the whole society that created them getting the Carthage or Khwarazmia treatment.

Don't get me wrong, I love EWE romance. But I really want to read a story where Wizarding Britain's version of Radical Reconstruction happens. Give me Percy Weasley and Barnabus Cuffe in the magical English equivalent of a Vietnamese reeducation camp.
