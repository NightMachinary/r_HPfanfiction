Voldemort was born in *1926*. I don't care how old Harry is when you're looking at age gap of more than half a *century*. Tomarry will never cease to be creepy as fuck to me, no matter how you justify it. Not technically paedophelia, no. But still disturbing for a number of reasons.

You'll also notice that it says /student/ in your quote. Snape/*student* is morally reprehensible. Even when the student is 'of age'.

All that being said: you do you. Read whatever the hell you want to read because that's your decision and nobody else's, but it doesn't change the fact that child molestation is an apt label for snape/student and tomarry.
