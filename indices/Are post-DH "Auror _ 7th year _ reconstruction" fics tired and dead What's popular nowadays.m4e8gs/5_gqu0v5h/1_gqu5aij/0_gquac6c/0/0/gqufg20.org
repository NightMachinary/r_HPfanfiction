I'm coming /back/ to HP fanfiction after a full decade away. Back in my heyday there were /scads/ of Teacher/Student fics, most especially around OotP/HBP when JK ramped the romance angle, it wasn't out-and-out statutory rape any more in most jurisdictions, and Voldemort was kicking ass and taking names.

Shit I even have a couple of Snape/Hermiones saved somewhere. I usually prefer canon pairings but some of these are really /good/.

What can I say? It was a more innocent time, I think.
