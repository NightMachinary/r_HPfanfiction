Fair enough. I still think child molestation is an apt term and it's a lot less loaded than the alternatives (such as paedophelia, which you brought up... not the dude you're responding to.)

  I just don't like seeing such loaded terms being flung around in relation to fanfiction of all terms.

I dislike it too, but at the same time? If it looks like a duck, and acts like a duck... Questionable pairings are still questionable even if you sugar coat them, so you may as well just call them what they are imo. They aren't 'okay' to me but it's fiction, so who cares?

(And yes, I've heard about people losing their shit over authors writing this stuff, and realise that that's probably what's prompting this. Those people are ridiculous.)
