Mine is like this if you want to check it out. I wrote the first version in 2003 pre-ootp and then redid it all this past summer. The concept is a bit unique, but it is a very book-style adventure/mystery story and I did my own thing with Voldemort. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.
