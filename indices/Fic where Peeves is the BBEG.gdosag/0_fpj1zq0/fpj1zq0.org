Oh, I remember this one. I don't remember the name, and I'll have to see if I can come up with it. What I remember is that Harry gets transported into an alternate universe, and when he looks for other wizards, there aren't any. Hogwarts is a ruin, but it's sealed tightly. Wizards made their last stand there, and Peeves sort-of-merged with the basilisk.
