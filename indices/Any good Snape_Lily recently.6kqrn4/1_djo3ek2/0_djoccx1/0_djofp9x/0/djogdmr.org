Because it really is fucking weird. A lot of shipping choices in this fandom is straight-up pedophilia, or incest, and that really is fucking gross. Snily is a bit tame compared to some of the worst, but it still makes me really uncomfortable to see people ship a creepy neckbeard with a normal woman and insist it's a much more logical pairing than Jily.
