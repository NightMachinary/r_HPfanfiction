Except this is just a thread asking for Snape/Lily fanfiction. No one started a debate or even mentioned Jily. If you feel uncomfortable about shipping choices that's on you. You can just not read or ignore "gross" ships. It's pretty annoying to see people police others on what's okay to ship or not in the fandom.
