Unfortunaly there's not many fics to choose in this ship, almost nobody ships them (I'd say most are HOSTILE to snily). Even most of the fics I've favorited are just good enough, not the very best.

IMO it's way easier to find a decent snily than a decent hapne, but the struggle is real, most of the fics about them aren't really good or clich√© free.
