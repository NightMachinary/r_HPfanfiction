Thank you for the peace not promised rec Just read it and it's really good. Usually I find both Snape and Lily extremely out of character in time travel fics but this one seems to actually be staying true to their characters. It's a relief to read a fic where she doesn't just suddenly start being friends with him again just because he starts acting nicer and drops James just because.
