  Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter have decided fifth year is going to be their year; the year everything falls into place for them both and the year they show the bullies they aren't afraid of them. Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?
