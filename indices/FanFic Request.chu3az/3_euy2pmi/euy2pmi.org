- linkao3(11676102;12305793;13682133) well, it is the story of Petunia Evans/Dursley, but we know so little about her really (aside from very biased opinion of highly unreliable abused teenager), that she may very well be OC.
- linkffn(3912184;4236594) again, Daphne Greengrass is really not OC, but we know really so little about her, that whatever author makes of her goes. This is very much NOT Heiress Daphne Greengrass, the Ice Queen of Slythering, just opposite on all counts. Poor, orphan, and very much not frozen, but the stories are really well written.
- linkffn(10847788) --- the same goes for Anthony Goldstein (well, he is not even Anthony); slightly too much chatty, too much about Jewish religion
- enough for now
