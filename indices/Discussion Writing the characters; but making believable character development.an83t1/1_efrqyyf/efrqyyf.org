I suppose I'd suggest writing little scenes first, and then see if you want to weave them together into the grander narrative.

Take Ron for example, how can we develop him? Expand on his dynamic with Ginny might be a good start. Ginny sees him as a peer as well as a big brother--she goes to him when she needs help in CoS, she's frequently seen in his company in later books, but she's also harsher towards him than any of her other brothers save post-GOF Percy.

So build on that. What if Ron sees a couple of Slytherins giving Ginny a hard time:

Does Ron retaliate on Ginny's behalf?

Does Ron let Ginny fight her own battle?

Does Ron let Ginny curse the Slytherin, only to take the blame for her when she gets in trouble?

Does Ron try to talk to Ginny, even though he doesn't think he's good at that sort of thing?

Do that sort of thing over and over with different characters--give them little scenes with many options and then experiment with consequences.
