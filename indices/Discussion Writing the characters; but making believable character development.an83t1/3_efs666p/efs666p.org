When writing in general (which I'll admit, it's been a while) I have found that for me, the only way to write a full 3-dimensional character is to know more details about the character than you actually wright. The books do a great job of giving you a firm foundation of the characters but elaborate more in your head about their childhood, preference, idiosyncrasies, habits, yadda yadda yadda. Then as you write them into different settings and situations, their actions become more natural rather than manufactured.
