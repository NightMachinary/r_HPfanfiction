There was definitely a magical spark (Pardon the pun), from reading the books. Not just the magical aspect, but the characters. They aren't perfect, they aren't OP or know everything and anything, they make mistakes, they have faults.

One thing I hate about fanfiction is that they make the characters so perfect, in a way that's just not believable.

Giving a character a believable character development is great (and difficult to do), but it's a lot better than just rehashing stuff that you've read in fanfiction a bunch of times, with just a few changes. And it just ends up losing that special magical spark that canon had.

Rowling wasn't perfect either, by any stretch of the means; for instance, if she wanted to write Harry and Ginny she could have started developing it sooner, (or other such things); but that's where fanfiction comes in, we can take what we have and expand on.

I don't have the books on me now, but I'll find them to re read them and see if I can't incorporate ideas I have into fanfiction in a believable way.
