When it comes to making sure you're not writing people OOC, there's no substitute for re-reading the books. You've gotta re-read lots and lots of passages, IMO. And when you read from the perspective of a fanfic writer, you'll notice lots of things you didn't notice before (like the fact that Hermione "squeaks" all the time, and that most of Ron's jokes are this specific kind of fun sarcasm). These are the subtle details that will help your story feel "right." And re-reading will remind you why you fell in love with the series in the first place.
