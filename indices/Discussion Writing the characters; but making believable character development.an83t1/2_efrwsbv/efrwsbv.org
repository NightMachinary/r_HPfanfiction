From a writing standpoint, I make a strengths and weaknesses list for my characters to ensure that they have a mix of positive and negative traits. For example, a character who is more skilled magically may have difficulty cultivating friendships with others, or a character who has less cunning may be better at connecting with others on a personal level.
