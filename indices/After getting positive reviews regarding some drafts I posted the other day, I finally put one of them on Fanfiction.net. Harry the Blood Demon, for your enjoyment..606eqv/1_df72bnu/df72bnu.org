This is brilliant so far, though as a reader I feel like I need something explaining why Harry appears hyper-intelligent as a 10 year old to suspend my disbelief from. I find myself really enjoying the bits where his childishness shines through, or where his shades act parental. It creates an adorable dichotomy between childhood innocence and, of course, being a literal demon.
