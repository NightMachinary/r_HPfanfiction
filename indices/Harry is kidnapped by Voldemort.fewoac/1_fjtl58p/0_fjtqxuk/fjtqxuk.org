I don't think so? There's not enough around the Harry being 'kidnapped' bit to be what I was thinking. And I recall the interaction between the two being more hostile - lots less "Yay, Voldemort adopted me" sort of vibes and more "Oh, the arse is still talking. Saying interesting things, but still an arse." vibes in what I'm thinking of.
