When the author copies scenes/dialogue verbatim from the books, I find myself a new story to read. I'm not talking about a copy of a significant sentence, which I don't like still but will tolerate. I'm talking about an entire scene copied directly from the books. Canon rehash is one of my top fanfiction pet peeves.
