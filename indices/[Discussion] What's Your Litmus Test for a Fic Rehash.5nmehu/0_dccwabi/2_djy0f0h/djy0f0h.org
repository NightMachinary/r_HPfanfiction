Indeed, a Harry who's into academics would probably not risk his neck easily (or if he does: He'd go about it another way!)...same for a Harry who was raised by responsible and loving adults (he'd trust the teachers more and would involve them more) :)

Exactly why I don't like canon re-hash fictions that change Harry but stick to canon like glue, because like ripples in a pond stuff would change quickly!
