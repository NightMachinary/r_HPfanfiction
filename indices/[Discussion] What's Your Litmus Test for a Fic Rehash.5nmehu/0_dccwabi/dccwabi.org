The one thing I absolutely hate is when authors diverge canon by having Harry be raised by someone other than the Dursleys yet still somehow have Harry act exactly the same way he does in canon. By act I don't mean his personality but rather the actions he takes are the same actions he takes in canon even though he is a different person.

To authors: If you change any aspect of Harry's personality the story is going to diverge from canon a lot faster. For example: If you make Harry even 10% more hard working then the story would change dramatically.
