I don't have any problem with Harry being a bird. The issue is that becoming an animagus never has any point in a fic and is just a boring waste of time.

In a fic I'm writing Harry learns how, but he doesn't turn into something 'cool' or useful. Being an animal won't matter, but the process of learning how is very important for character development.
