If it is used as a tool for character and relationship development, I don't mind so much. Although ultimately the forms (or at least Harry's) do participate in the plot in Vox Corporis, most of the fic is character and relationship fluff.

The only problem with it being used for character and relationship development is that in most cases it would be interchangeable with any other "deep" magical study. It is hard to find a balance between it being throwaway and it being a cheap plot device. I think I find it acceptable in Vox Corporis because it is just enough of both to be acceptable.

I believe it was also in that fic that it is mentioned Dumbledore is an animagus but never uses it because either his form is useless or he just dislikes it? I do like that it takes away from the mystique a bit, turning it into something that is not more common because it is both time-consuming and not always useful.
