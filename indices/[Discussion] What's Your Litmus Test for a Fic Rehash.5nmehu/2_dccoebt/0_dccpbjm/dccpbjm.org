Canon is pretty vague on the process, right? All we know is that it's a specialized branch of transfiguration, and a list of people who have managed it?

Why would Harry being a falcon/ talking about falcons be upsetting? Especially in a canon rehash type of way?

Honestly curious, it seems like I'm not understanding a lot of the subtext you've got going on here.
