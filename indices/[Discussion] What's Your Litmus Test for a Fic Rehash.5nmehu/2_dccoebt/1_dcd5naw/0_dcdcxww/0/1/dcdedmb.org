I'd argue that Hermione's DA Coins are pretty amazing, not to mention the kind of things Fred and George invented.

You're right though, it is a pretty big plot hole. JKR never really was the best at worldbuilding and consistency.

The problem is that the first few books were basically written for children and then became more mature over time, which only makes sense, but it also resulted in a series that is not very well thought out.

It's more about the story and the main characters than the world around them, which is completely fine but it also results in us having to rely on a lot of fanon simply because canon information often doesn't really make sense.
