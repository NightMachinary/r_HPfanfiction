  We never see anyone in Harrys group create anything that comes close in power.

I disagree. Hermione's beaded bag? DA coin? Extendable ears? Instant Darkness Powder?

Sure, Harry didn't create any artefacts but he did accomplish much more - killing a basilisk? Surviving Triwizard Tournament? Facing Voldemort and vanquishing him?

  So either the Marauders were incredible Savants or it's just a huge plothole. They were known to be very intelligent. One of them even became a Professor (a very good one at that). Don't see why this would be a plothole.
