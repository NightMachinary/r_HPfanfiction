  The list of registered ones is probably fairly short but that's only logical because the skill is mostly useless unless it's a secret. For all we know it's a common skill and no one talks about it; and let's be honest if 3 school kids could manage it, it can't be all that difficult to do.

Three school kids + Remus who also managed to create one of the most powerful magical artefacts we see in the series: The Map (it even sees through polyjuice and animagi). We never see anyone in Harrys group create anything that comes close in power. So either the Marauders were incredible Savants or it's just a huge plothole.
