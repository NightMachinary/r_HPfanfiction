While i do agree with you that it's sometimes overdone we can't really say how rare Animagi are.

The list of /registered/ ones is probably fairly short but that's only logical because the skill is mostly useless unless it's a secret. For all we know it's a common skill and no one talks about it; and let's be honest if 3 school kids could manage it, it can't be all that difficult to do.

It's probably very time consuming and my guess is that most forms are simply useless and therefore no one bothers actually learning it. Stags and Grims aren't particularly inconspicuous and i doubt James and SIrius would have bothered if it weren't for helping Remus.
