My peeve is when absolutely /everyone/ turns out to be an animagus. The books say it's a super-rare skill and it's implied that it was somewhat unheard of for James, Sirius, and Peter to have all learned, much less at their ages.

Then in some stories, half the school is a secret unregistered animagus.
