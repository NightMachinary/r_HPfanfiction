Yeah, I typically avoid stories that start earlier than 4th year, and a big part of the reason for that is that these stories tend to want to span across all 7 years but they then spend a lot of time in 1st year not doing much different. Its a real drag to read through all the events I'm already quite familiar with.

But worse than a fic rehash is a recap. I absolutely hate when a story grinds to a halt so that Harry can tell his new girlfriend about everything that happened in canon prior to this minor divergence.

Either one will turn me off almost immediately, and then I might skip ahead a bit to see if things diverge enough if the story had an interesting enough premise, but usually I just quite the story right then and there.
