Making 'kids sound like kids' has to be the worst move for a story. It's almost as annoying as the sounding out of words for people like Fleur and Krum, because they have an accent. Can you not just create a normal piece of dialogue, while adding "she said in a heavy french accent" at the end? You just make it harder to convey the point being made. But with making kids sound like kids, the author has to purposefully dumb the main character down, and everyone else, it makes it uninteresting to read. A person like Harry who had to live for himself would most definitely be able to hold adult conversations, or maybe just avoid the conversation altogether, growing up Anti-Social with no friends might make him wary to start a conversation.
