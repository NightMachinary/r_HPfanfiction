Eeeeh, depends. My daughter's teachers always commented on how she spoke like an adult, mostly because I always talked to her more or less like an adult. I never did the "kiddie talk" when speaking with her. So at 11 she did sound fairly mature in conversation. If I used a phrase or word she didn't understand I'd explain to her, and then she'd start using them.

(but for the most part, I agree with you.)
