Basically ANY significant amount of time spent on canon events without any changes is a turn off for me. I'm here for interesting changes to canon, not the canon story with Naruto along for the ride while inexplicably influencing absolutely nothing. I don't have a litmus test, really. It depends on how major the premise change is and how much the author pays attention to the subtleties that might arise from such a change. For example,let's say Harry is raised by loving guardians, I'd usually be fine with him still acquiring Hedwig, but if the Hagrid interaction is similar to canon I'm likely to stop reading before we make it through Diagon Alley.
