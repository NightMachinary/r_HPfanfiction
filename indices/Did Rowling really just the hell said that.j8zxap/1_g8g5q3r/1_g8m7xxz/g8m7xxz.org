I think it makes sense when you consider that medieval people didn't really value/have privacy unless they were the lord/lady of the castle. People back then toileted communally.

In the middle ages and the victorians were very concerned with it, so chamber pots make more sense. What seems bizarre to me is that the toilets used pipes and rather than being self-vanishing. Perhaps magic wasn't there yet, or the waste transports to a central tank/pit where vanishing or cleaning takes place.
