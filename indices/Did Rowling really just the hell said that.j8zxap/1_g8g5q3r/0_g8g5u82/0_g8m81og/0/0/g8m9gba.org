It would be hilarious indeed. I'm sure there's a oneshot like that. Back then, the Malfoys were quite pally with the muggle royalty so it's possible that wizards adjusted to changing standards just before the statue of secrecy kicked in.

I guess 900 years is a lot of time for traditions to be altered.
