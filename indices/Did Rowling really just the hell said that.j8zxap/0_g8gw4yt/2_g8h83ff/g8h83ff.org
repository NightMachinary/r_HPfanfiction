No no, you got me wrong. I have no objective with Hermione or Hagrid being black. Or rather, I would not have had any objective. Now I do. It has been more than 20 years since the release of 1st book and she suddenly says that these characters are black!! The books have described Hermione getting tanned or flushing due to embarrassment and other things and the movies have confirmed these beliefs so that now that we think of Hermione and Hagrid the images from movies pop up in our mind and make it hard to believe that these characters had been black. I didn't mind any other character having a coloured or black skin tone like the Patil twins and Seamus Finnigan.

BTW I am an Indian so I see all types of Skin colours everyday.
