  It has been more than 20 years since the release of 1st book and she suddenly says that these characters are black!!

This is how I feel too. It's pretty obvious that when Rowling wrote Hermione, she was picturing someone white.

I have no problem with a black Hermione. Adaptations change races all the time. Grover (from Percy Jackson) is white in the books and black in the movies. And I love how he's depicted in the movies (probably more than the books).

But Rowling pretending her books were retroactively more diverse than they really are just seems disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst.
