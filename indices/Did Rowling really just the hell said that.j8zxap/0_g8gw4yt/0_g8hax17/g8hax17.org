Particularly in the 90s - Scotland has really low diversity.

"The percentage of people in Scotland from minority ethnic groups had doubled to 4%, up from 2% in 2001.

The Asian population is the largest minority ethnic group (3% of the population or 141,000 people), representing an increase of** one percentage point (69,000) since 2001*. Within this, Pakistani is the largest individual category, accounting for 1% of the total population. **The African, Caribbean or Black groups made up 1% of the population of Scotland in 2011, an increase of 28,000 people since 2001.* Mixed or multiple ethnic groups represented 0.4% (20,000) and other ethnic groups 0.3% (14,000) of the total population."
