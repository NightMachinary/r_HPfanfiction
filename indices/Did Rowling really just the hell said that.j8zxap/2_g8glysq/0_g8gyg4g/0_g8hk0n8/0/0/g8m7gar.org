Back then toilets were often communal - large Roman toilets were two benches with holes several in and the soliders would sit facing the opposite person and chat. Even castle garderobes sometimes had two seats in the room. The king/lord would have his own, but a servant would wipe his bum for him.

I suppose, what value does a bucket have if you can vanish the contents away. There's no real need for containment.

Except for the gentry, almost no-one had any privacy at all back then. Potentially, going wherever you were would have provided greater privacy than the muggle alternative.

It seems likely to me that chamber pots probably came into play in wizard's lives when privacy started to matter.

My personal view is that the younger students probably did have to use garderobes, but the mark of a skilled wizard/student was one who could toilet where they pleased. Potentially, a transferring spell could have been used by those who couldn't vanish yet.
