Why shitting yourself? The quote doesn't say so. They probably pulled their pants down and crouched.

Cleanliness, which was the main reason for the early "bathrooms" you mentioned, would not be a problem for wizards. In the middle ages, when nudity taboos and privacy became a factor, wizards probably simply ignored such things at first. When they eventually adopted them, they just used a privacy charm in addition to a cleaning one.
