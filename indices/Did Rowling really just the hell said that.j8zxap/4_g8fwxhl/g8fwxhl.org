There are many articles which deal with this disaster (after just quick search on Internet I found for example [[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/91548/how-do-wizards-poop-jk-rowling-just-told-us]] ), but it all goes to [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets]] (search for “plumbing”). I think somewhere during the development of Pottermore JKR stopped writing for it, and it was taken over by WB and their writers. I just cannot believe JKR would ever write such nonsense, it had to be some intern at WB who didn't know any better.
