Can't we just say that Rowling's books were pioneering works of HP fiction, in fact she pretty much started the whole genre, but the stories we get nowadays on the fanfic sites are just plain superior? Fuddy-duddy wizards often lament that "nobody reads Rowling any more", but they are works of a bygone era when the most important problem facing a Hogwarts student was which magical corporation made his or her Quiddich broom. We have bigger things to attend to now ;-).
