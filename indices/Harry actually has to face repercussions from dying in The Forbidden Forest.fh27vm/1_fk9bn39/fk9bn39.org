If you don't mind crossovers, there's this Marvel one - tried to look for around half an hour and can't find it, so I will put in description instead:

Set before Avengers. Banner sees Harry trying to pay for a broken thing in muggle India (?) with galleons and looking really confused. Basically, Harry's soul was demaged and Luna recommended to go around and colect broken things. So Banner and Harry end up travelling together.
