linkffn(Barefoot) has Harry with the power of psychometry, which means he can completely understand the history of an inanimate object by touching it. This includes wands. The result is similar to your Legilimency idea.

linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) looks to be shaping up to end up with an OP Harry, but he still regularly loses his practice duels. He learns to do magic previously thought impossible because no one bothered(or in one case avoided telling) him it was supposed to be impossible.
