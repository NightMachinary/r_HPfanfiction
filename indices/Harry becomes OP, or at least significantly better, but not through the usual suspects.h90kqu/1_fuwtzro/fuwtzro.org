I'm thinking of "combine a ton of infinite water bottles and magic fuelless flames to build a bunch of unlimited impulse steam rockets, stick them to asteroids and hold the world hostage for a hundred billion galleons"

I'm not sure if the wizarding world has any kind of defense against a few hundred tons of inert rocks traveling at half a percent c after a week of acceleration. Most magic seems to rely on wizards with human response times hitting the target with a spell, and good luck doing that to something at a thousand kilometers per second.

Alternative strategy for a redo fic: Visit Jeff in 1994 with a hundred grand of investment money and some compulsion charms and wait a few decades until those Amazon shares are worth more than the GDP of the entire wizarding world.
