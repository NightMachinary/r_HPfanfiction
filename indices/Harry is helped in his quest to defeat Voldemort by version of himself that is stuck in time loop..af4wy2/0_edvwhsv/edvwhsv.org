Damn, I've read it, but can't remember enough details for a good google search for a name.. From what I do remember, to stir others's memory hopefully, I'm fairly sure the time-looped Harry was originally adopted and raised by the Malfoys, his timeline's Draco died because of him in some way, and since Lucius was the master of his slave bond, he ordered him to not leave the area of Hogsmeade till ??something?? Also I'm fairly sure it was a not time-looped Harry/Draco fic, but don't quote me on that!
