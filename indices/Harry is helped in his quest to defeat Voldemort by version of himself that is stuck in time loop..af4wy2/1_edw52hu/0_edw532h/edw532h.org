#+begin_quote
  After selling his soul to a demon for incredible power at the tips of his fingers, Harry flees Privet Drive to spend his next few years on the streets of London, hidden magically as well as physically. When he finally enrols at Hogwarts, only a handful of people know who he truly is, but obscurity doesn't keep him from trouble and power doesn't make for experience.
