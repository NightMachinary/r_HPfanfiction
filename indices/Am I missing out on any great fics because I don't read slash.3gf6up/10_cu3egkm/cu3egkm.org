Maybe. This is the first one I read that truly captivated me. I've re-read it at least thrice over the past six years and it still hasn't lost it for me. I could say many things about how I feel about it, but instead I'd rather just implore you to attempt to read it. While it has slash pairings, I rarely felt that the story was overwhelmed by it.
