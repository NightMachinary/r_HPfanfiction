It's a pretty large portion of fanfic, so yes. I find most of the good stuff I can enjoy by reading most of it normally and skimming through the slashy bits quickly.

linkffn(A Brother to Basilisks)

I recommended this one in the other thread, but it's a great read that has yet to cross into slash territory 40 chapters in, although it'll wind up there eventually.
