Yes.

linkffn(Reparations by Sara's Girl) is a favourite of mine, linkffn(Saving Connor) is a frequent rec around here, linkao3(Earthbound Spook) is also good. All of these are Harry/Draco, which is far and away the most popular slash ship in the fandom if not the most popular ship in the fandom /full stop/.

I honestly don't see why a person would avoid slash, as a category, when it really comes down to the specific ship.
