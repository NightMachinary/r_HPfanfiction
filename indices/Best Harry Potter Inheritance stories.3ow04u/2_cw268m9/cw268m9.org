/Out of The Night/, by Raining Ink, is easily my favorite inheritance-focused story.

He only has one inheritance (the Peverell one), and taking it doesn't make him absurdly powerful-- just introduces him to a side of wizarding culture he otherwise would not have been able to see. Indy!Harry without bashing, pairings, or most of the other tropes associated with Indy!Harry.

Abandoned and deleted, for reasons listed on the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1944343/Raining-Ink][author's profile]] (essentially they were afraid that working on fic was impeding their ability to otherwise launch a writing career). However, you can get it on dropbox either [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][here]] (unchanged) or [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/27qcq652zq2o8xf/Out%20of%20The%20Night.zip][here]] (no author's notes, pretty css veneer).
