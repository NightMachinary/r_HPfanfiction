How many Muggles? There are stories where one Muggle randomly happens to stumble in the Magical World:

- linkffn(A Muggle in Magical Britain by Tegildess) and its sequel linkffn(A Muggle in the Ministry of Magic by Tegildess)
- linkffn(A Muggle In The Magic World by Phoenixfox)

Or is it something like world reveal * linkffn(World War Wizard by Tegildess), which is the third part of the trilogy with the above two pieces * linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach by acgoldis)
