  “Zombies are...” The man started “dead people. They're people that are dead but...animated...yes, animated, that's probably the best word to describe it. They're animated dead people. Not like animated as in cartoons, but animated as in walking, groaning, biting dead people.”“You mean inferi?” Regulus breathed out. He clutched at his arms, remembering their gripping, grabbing, skeletal hands. Dead eyes-watching him hungrily-decaying jaws-biting into him-rotting flesh-peeling off-squelching into his fingers.“Probably...what were they doing there?”They bit and ate and grabbed and scratched, pulled and wrenched and screeched and bled.“The Dark Lord made them...to deal with trespassers I suppose.” Regulus Black didn't expect to survive the cave. He expected even less to wake up in a muggle hospital and have help forced upon him by a muggle organisation.
