Against a wandless opponent, Harry's /Expelliarmus/...:

- Physically removes the arms of its target, hence disarming them again.\\
- Summons a weapon to the hand of its target, and then promptly disarms them of it.\\
- Disarms the target of the /next/ wand, weapon or tool they pick up, an overpowered one making them butterfingers for days.\\
- Rips out the target's magic, rendering them a squib (until they can put said magic back, anyway).
