I've always liked The Family Clock. linkffn(The Family Clock). It centers around a young watchmaker who runs her family's Diagon Alley shop. It takes an interesting perspective to the war, and Diagon (and Knocturn) Alley in general. She makes fast friends with the twins (their shop is across the way) and later Charile.\\
It's first person, and the only major downside to it is that later the author will switch perspectives, and it's not immediately evident. Takes a minute to figure out a)they did it and b) who they're speaking through now.\\
Hasn't seen an update in five years though. :(\\
