I know this isn't much help, but I'm writing a story that takes place in 2015 and centers around pretty much /only/ OCs. New plot, new arcs, etc, pretty much no reused characters. Think Harry Potter but the only resemblance to HP is it's the same world and they're at Hogwarts. If you're interested, let me know because I can send you the first chapter or something as a beta (shameless self promo! :D)
