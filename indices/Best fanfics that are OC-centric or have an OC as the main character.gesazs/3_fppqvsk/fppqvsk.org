It's technically a D&D crossover and a gamer!fic (idk if you're into that), but when I read it a few years back I had zero experience with tabletop RPGs and loved it. The MC is an OC named Milo who, while a wizard himself, has no understand of how HP universe magic works. He gets plopped down in the canon-universe and navigates Hogwarts (in the same year as the Golden Trio, but it's not Harry-centric). It's super hilarious and has several great subplots which include muggle OCs and major divergences from canon. I don't remember where they left off, but I think it's somewhere in Book 3.
