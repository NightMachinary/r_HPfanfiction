I will never stop recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][this fic]]. I know the "Harry has a twin sister" trope has an awful reputation (partially deserved, as most are not great), but this fic surprised me. I really enjoyed it. It's quite long, over a million words, but it's a fun read!
