It's about her first year then, it timeskips to her fourth. She's basically Snape's Apprentice, but also his redemption.

Riddle "marked" her, but in a different way that Harry (this is one of the principal subplot of the story).

There is a bit of "bashing" toward the Gryffindor (especially the Golden Trio) because from her point of view, her brother's actions seem quite reckless.

Until the end of HBP she doesn't really influence that much the Canon Timeline, because she is never with the Golden Trio when it matters,(on the occasion where she's with them, the story follows the same path as Canon), after this point it diverges from Canon.

There might be a bit of Mary Sue-ing, but I read it twice and honestly it's not so bad. Anyway if you want to story about Slytherin politics, making Potions, Riddle's past and a bit of good old "Dumbledore your meddling is not appreciated", read it.
