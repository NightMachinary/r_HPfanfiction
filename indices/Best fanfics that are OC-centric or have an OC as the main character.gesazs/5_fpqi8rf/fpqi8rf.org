I love all-OC stories and those focusing on non-mainstream characters in particular.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) - absolutely incredible series set in an AU version of Wizarding America circa 2007-2011. Five fairly lengthy books are complete, with a sixth in progress right now (although the author finishes his books before beginning to upload them.) It's an all-OC fic, and whether it's fanfiction is debatable - while the magic system is the same as in canon, pretty much everything else is different, and the only connections to canon are a couple mentions of Lord Voldemort. Easily the best overall storytelling I've seen in the fandom.

Underneath Inverarity, there are a couple uncut gems - there's linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) which is a quite fluffy, wholesome story about Slytherin's first post-war muggleborn, and is mostly OCs. There is also linkffn(The Divide by Beedle) and linkffn(The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins) which are more slow-burning, character-centric next-gen fics that have OCs as point-of-view characters. I thought linkffn(The Guardian of Azkaban) was pretty well done, but YMMV.

There are more I could list, but these seem to be on the lines of what you're looking for. Hope you enjoy!
