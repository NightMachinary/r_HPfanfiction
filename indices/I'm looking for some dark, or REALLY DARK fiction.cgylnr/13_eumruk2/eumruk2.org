[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), is one of the very few plain vanilla â€˜HP Wizards in Space' fics. The author has done a great job in magical space travel mechanics and colonization, but comes short in several other places. It's also extremely dark, [[/spoiler][only 5 named HP characters made it until the end]]
