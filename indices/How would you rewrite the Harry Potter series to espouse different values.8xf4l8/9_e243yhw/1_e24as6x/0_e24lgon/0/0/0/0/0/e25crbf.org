It works for mundane world.

If magic can produce everything with just several motions of wand, this formula stops working.

To be honest I more like HPMOR approach: everything Magic produces is temporal, conjunction or transfiguration -- doesn't matter. The lifetime depends on the spell strength, but it ends.

Therefore all things (clothes, furniture, food etc.) must be produced as in mundane world. Magic can just help doing it.
