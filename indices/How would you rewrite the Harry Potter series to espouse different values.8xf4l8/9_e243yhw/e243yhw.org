I now imagine Harry, Ron and Hermione singing Bella Ciao around the bonfire in the forest.

But seriously, *edit* here, a lot of stories that try to get political make one, big mistake. They assume solutions/ideologies proposed and implemented by muggles can be solutions for wizarding problems as well. That often ignores one fundamental difference: Wizards have magic. Wizards and witches will not be confronted with the same problems as muggles. Period. Therefore their solutions must be different ones.

Corporate Capitalism as we have it nowadays is not happening in wizard society. The means of production cannot be seized by the upper class, because literally everyone capable of it is given his own, personal universal manufacturing device at the age of 11.

I know, of course, that fantasy always points to reality, no matter if the author wants or not. But I just wanted to point out that in order to worldbuild magical politics, these politics need to be rooted in believable cultural foundations
