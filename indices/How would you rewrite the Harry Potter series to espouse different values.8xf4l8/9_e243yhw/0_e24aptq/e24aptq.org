But at the same time "wizards aren't muggles, muggle solutions won't work" is stupid. You have to point out why a muggle solution - checks and balances, democracy, anti-discrimination laws, anti-corruption laws, etc. - wouldn't work for wizards as well. We know the problems of the Ministry in canon, and we know muggle solutions to those problems. What we don't know is why most muggle solutions shouldn't work.
