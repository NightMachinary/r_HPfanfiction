That why I wrote "Ideologies/Solutions". An ideology is nothing but a proposed solution to societies problems.

What I meant by saying that muggle solutions don't work for magical people is that the ideologies /must/ differ severely from the ideologies of muggles, simply because they have a different fundamental basis for their entire way of life. I'm not saying /all/ muggle solutions don't work, but I am saying that to apply some solution and call it a day without looking at the magical side of things would not suffice in most cases.
