There's plenty of fanfics that try to reframe Harry Potter in a alt-right/nationalistic/racist/fascist mindset: House Elves are parasitic and them being servants/slaves is the natural order of things. The ministry fails because it doesn't have strong leadership. Dumbledore is too forgiving. Muggleborn ("immigrants") try to usurp Wizarding culture and need to be put in their place. Pure-bloods have built the glorious Magical Britain with their blood and sweat and deserve their well earned dues: They naturally should lead and lesser people should follow (basic fascism).

I'm probably forgetting a few fanfic cliches that exemplify this in a similar manner.
