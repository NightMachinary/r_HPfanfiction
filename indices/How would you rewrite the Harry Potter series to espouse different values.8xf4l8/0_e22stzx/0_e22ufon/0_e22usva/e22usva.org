Yeah because there seems to be something seriously wrong with the education in the US (and possibly other countries). They think fascism/naziism is something completely disgusting and vile that only true monsters would fall for and that it will be obvious when it stares them in the face. They think it's some otherworldly ideology that no good person like themselves would ever fall for. These are also the people who get upset when some publications refer to the internment camps at the US border as "concentration camps", because they think that term should be reserved for something special.

It's the complete opposite of what I learned and I always want to smack these people up the head with a copy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(novel)][The Wave]]
