Dumbledore first: In his interaction with Harry, even laden with mea culpas, shows that the ends justify the means, at least where defeating Voldemort is concerned.

As far as the elder wand, I see it's meritocratic nature as tenuous at best. It is far more Arthurian, and while Excalibur ostensibly chose a king from among the people we also know that Arthur was the king along and more importantly that with the right tool he had all the power. Not skill, or intellect, empathy, dedication, but instead a tool.

For me it boils down to this, equity is about reasonable equality of opportunity, and the elder wand generally gives it wielded equality of result, regardless of how well said wielder used their opportunity.

Also, in rereading my first response it was more curt than intended. What are your thoughts?
