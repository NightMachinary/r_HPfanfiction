It is possible for blood purity to be true and also that inbreeding is bad. If the wizarding populace were aware of the first, the second may not be obvious. Thus, Merope Gaunt might have "strong" blood but be stunted by generations of inbreeding. Some fresh Muggle DNA later, and you got some hybrid vigor. But hybrid vigor generally only works when you have a small population (ie inbreeding).
