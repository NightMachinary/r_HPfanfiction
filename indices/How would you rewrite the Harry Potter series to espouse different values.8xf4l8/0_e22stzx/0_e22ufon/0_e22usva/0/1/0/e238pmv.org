Voldemort's mother was a near squib, and after she raped a Muggle, suddenly the greatest wizard in generations was born.

Dumbledore's mother Kendra was Muggleborn, like Harry's. Then another super talented and powerful wizard, Severus Snape, had a Muggle father. Dora Tonks's father was a Muggleborn too.

And yet, those dumbasses still think blood purity is the answer? Maybe they aren't more intelligent than Marvolo and Morfin Gaunt
