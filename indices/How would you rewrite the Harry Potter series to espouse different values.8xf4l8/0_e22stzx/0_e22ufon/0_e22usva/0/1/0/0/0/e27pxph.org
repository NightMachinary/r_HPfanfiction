If blood purity was true, wouldn't muggleborn be quite weak? Even if they have squib ancestors from strong blood somewhere that would be quite diluted from all the muggle ancestors. But muggleborn aren't shown to be weaker than purebloods or halfbloods.

I think the best you could argue for in terms of blood purity is that pure blood increases the chance of being magical at all (very low chance for people born to muggle parents, unknown chance for people with mixed ancestry, presumably very high chance for people of pure magical ancestry). However since it is unknown whether children of two magicals are less likely to be born squibs than children of a magical and a muggle, this is far from certain.
