I have to admit I've always struggled with eugenics a bit, because there seems to be some merit to it in principle, just the potential implementation resulting in dystopian horror states in practicality.

But that's neither here nor there in regards to JKRs world: I assume these people ground their theory on the fact that people like Tonks, Dumbledore and Voldemort who have magical ancestors stand out with "special" magical abilities (though they all conveniently forget that they've also been infused with a hefty dose of muggle).
