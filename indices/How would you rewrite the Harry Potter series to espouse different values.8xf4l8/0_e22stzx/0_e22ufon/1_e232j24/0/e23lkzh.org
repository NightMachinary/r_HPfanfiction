I thought this fandom started with bashing and gay sex (and horribly written fics of course)?

Also, yes, Rowling have nice ideas but her worldbuilding is horrible in consistency or in details. And because the movies didn't really expand on this, we are left with a situation where we only know about a oblivious schoolboy's life, never even mind about the legislative, executive and judicial branch of the government work.
