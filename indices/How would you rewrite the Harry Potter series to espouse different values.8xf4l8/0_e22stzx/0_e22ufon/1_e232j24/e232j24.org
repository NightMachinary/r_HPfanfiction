I blame Rowling. Since Wizarding Culture is so vaguely explained or described. I get it in the first three books, that were just boarding school books with magic. But the later books where Rowling started on with the bigger moral story, she still doesn't say anything about what must be a pretty old and rich culture already there. So people make up their own. And it often involves character bashing and lots of terribly written gay sex.
