Even if you can be 100% sure to avoid punishing innocent people I'd still argue that certain punishments (any kind of torture or death penalty) are immoral. The issue of deterrence is also not as clear cut as proponents seem to believe: Someone who is about to murder their spouse is usually not going to make a rational analysis of costs (possibly death penalty if caught) and benefits (dead spouse) before going along with the crime.
