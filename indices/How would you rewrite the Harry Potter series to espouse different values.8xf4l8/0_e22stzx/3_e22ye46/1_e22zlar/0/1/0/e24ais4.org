  Someone who is about to murder their spouse is usually not going to make a rational analysis of costs (possibly death penalty if caught) and benefits (dead spouse) before going along with the crime.

In that case if someone murdered his/her spouse, why can't the system sentence him/her to the same fate? Should the same system allow Hitler an his comrades to live? Why?
