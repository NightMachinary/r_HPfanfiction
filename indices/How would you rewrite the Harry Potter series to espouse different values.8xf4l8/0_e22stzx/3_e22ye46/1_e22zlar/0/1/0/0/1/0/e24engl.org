  Why do you agree to kill Hitler, but ready to spare a man who planned and killed his wife? Or his child? Or another's child? Or several children in school?

I think I explained this. I am able to make practical considerations about the overall harm to society by letting someone like Goebbels live. The same considerations don't apply to your average criminal/murderer: There's no vast reaching political consequences and lives at stake by letting them sit in a prison cell.
