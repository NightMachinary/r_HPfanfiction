  In that case if someone murdered his/her spouse, why can't the system sentence him/her to the same fate?
#+end_quote

The "system" can do whatever they want. They can also kill someone for stealing a loaf of bread. What does this have to do with it being immoral or not? We have moved away from the "an eye for an eye" policy, because issues like these are not solved by math equations: Retributive justice as a whole seems like a flawed concept to me. I don't believe in Karma or some kind of mythical balance that needs to be restored by inflicting equal amounts of pain to the perpetrator. In my perception imprisonment of a criminal is valid because it protects society and can be used to rehabilitate, not because I think it's awesome to hurt the dirty criminal and make him be sad and somehow that adds up to some kind of equilibrium (minus times minus equals plus?).

I think the death penalty is for the most part motivated by revenge and a desire to appease the victims family. This doesn't mesh at all with my sense of justice. Also I strongly believe that murderers can be rehabilitated (especially those that committed their crime in a state of emotional shock or trauma) and since my goal would be to improve our society it seems stupid and a waste to me to kill someone who could still be useful and make up for their crimes in a productive way.

Of course this only works in a somewhat enlightened and civilized society. If you have an angry mob of barbarians demanding blood you'll probably be forced to execute criminals in order to keep the peace.

  Should the same system allow Hitler an his comrades to live? Why?
#+end_quote

This is more difficult. There's little to no hope that any of Hitler's top Lieutenants could have been rehabilitated and there's lots of potential harm in letting them live: Just merely by living they might form a rallying point around a dangerous ideology, could be rescued from imprisonment and wreck further havoc.

It is difficult to say how things would have panned out if they had been shoved into a dark hole and never let out instead of hanging them. Speculative "What if" history like this is not my strength.

Suffice it to say my stance on the death penalty is not quite as firm when it comes to War Criminals and the likes. It is important to point out that I'm not rallying against killing per se (war or self defense for example are very different areas).
