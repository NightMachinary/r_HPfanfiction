Harsh punishments are immoral in the real world due to the risk of false positives--"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer". With a /perfect truth serum/, most things should be punished extremely harshly as a deterrent.

Of course, it's silly to debate this without knowing the specifics of the Wizarding judicial system or how Veritaserum works exactly.
