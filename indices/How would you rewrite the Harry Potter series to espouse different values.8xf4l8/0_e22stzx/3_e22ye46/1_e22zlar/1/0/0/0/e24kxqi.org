You're really not going to make much headway here, my Dumbledore hatred knows no bounds.

It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth though how Dumbledore sticks his neck out for Snape, a Dark Arts proponent and overall unpleasant person (and it turns out Dumbledore truly had nothing except his intuition about Snape's loyalties), but he can't even afford a single personal conversation with Sirius, who's been described as close as a brother to James. I'm not even talking about believing Sirius or not, but a lot of the plot hinges on the fact that no-one even bothers to ask him for his side of the story.

Sirius is a chief witnesses of the events. Not talking to him is stupid just from a practical position (as is proven by the fact that one of Voldemort's top death eaters can hide as a rat because of this oversight). Not fighting for a trial for Sirius is not only completely immoral but also retarded.

It boggles my mind that supposedly no one wanted to ask Sirius "why?".
