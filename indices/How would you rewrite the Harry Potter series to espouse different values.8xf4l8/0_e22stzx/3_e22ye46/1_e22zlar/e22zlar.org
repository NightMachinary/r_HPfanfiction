  I can't for the life of me see how this is relevant. If anything, it's extreme anti-fascism, considering what the Death Eaters represent.

Harsher punishments against criminals and other deviants is one of the first socially acceptable talking points that (borderline) fascists will bring up, even though there's little to no evidence that it would be beneficial - in fact it is probably harmful. Goes hand in hand with demanding the death penalty, etc.

Fits right in with the strong leadership and "cleaning" up society ideal.

It's funny though since Magical Britain already has horrific punishments and Dumbledore probably has a point not wishing anyone to be at the mercy of the Ministry. Just wish he'd been more consistent in giving Sirius the benefit of the doubt.
