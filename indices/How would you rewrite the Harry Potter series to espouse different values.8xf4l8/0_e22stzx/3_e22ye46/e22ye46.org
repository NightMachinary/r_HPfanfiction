I think you're reaching a bit.

  House Elves are parasitic and them being servants/slaves is the natural order of things.

This, for example. I've never seen that. Maybe it exists in, like, one obscure anti-creature fic, somewhere. But I've never seen it. However, I have seen fics which portray House Elves as symbiotic in other ways---typically mutualistic.

As for them being servants/slaves, well, that's something for the philosophers, I suppose --- whether it is acceptable for a person to become a slave under no duress and of their own free will.

  The ministry fails because it doesn't have strong leadership.
#+end_quote

I don't see this very often either. More often than the House Elves thing, since it is available in a couple... Emperor, maybe? At least from the description. I could never get into that fic. And that one that had that awkwardly placed OC Lestrange son raised by muggles.

There are, however, a few which recognize that Rowling was portraying the Death Eaters as a parallel for Nazism, and take that to the conclusion that Fudge's government policies were intended to be a metaphor for Neville Chamberlain.

  Dumbledore is too forgiving.
#+end_quote

I can't for the life of me see how this is relevant. If anything, it's extreme anti-fascism, considering what the Death Eaters represent.

The others... Well, I'm not going to say they don't exist, but I do think you're reaching a bit with them. At the very least taking them in the worst way possible.
