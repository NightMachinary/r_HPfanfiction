Yeah, I mean, most of these "arguments" are pretty bad and transparent at that. No one claims that people who have such views are particularly smart.

And coming back to something you brought up earlier: I'm sure there's some stories that include such things completely innocently without any political agenda, just because they saw it somewhere else or didn't really think it through. It's not like I immediately drop any such fics, get a red head and start to yell and ramble about those darn nazis - but all of these are things I take notice of for their implications.
