  Your solution of enslavement is genocide.

What?! Why? Freeing the Elves would obviously be a slow societal process. The first step for example could be to make a law that allow them to leave a family if they wanted to and give them somewhere to go. A next step might be to create a minimum wage for house elves, so that they have the means to leave a family if they are mistreated (instead of being technically free but falling into economical slavery).

Who gave you the insane idea that freeing the Elves means ripping them from their families and forcing them all to be free - without giving them any means to care for themselves.

  Also we see how Winky dealt with the freedom becoming an alcoholic.

Winky has been thrown out of her family which she cared for very much. She's not an alcoholic because she's free, but because she lost her family.
