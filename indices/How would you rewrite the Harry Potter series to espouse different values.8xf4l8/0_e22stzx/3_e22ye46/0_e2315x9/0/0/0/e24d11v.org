Your solution of enslavement is genocide. You're really nice person.

In the books we see that Dobby has been excluded from House Elves society. Also we see how Winky dealt with the freedom becoming an alcoholic. With Winky being a typical House Elf we can assume that others will deal with the freedom in similar ways and that will likely lead to the whole raise dying.

But yeah... It's just inconvenience, isn't it? At least they will die free.
