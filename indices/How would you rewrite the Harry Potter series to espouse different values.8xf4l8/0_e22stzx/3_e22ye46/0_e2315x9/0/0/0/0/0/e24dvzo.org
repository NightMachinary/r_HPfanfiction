  The first step for example could be to make a law that allow them to leave a family if they wanted to and give them somewhere to go

Is there a law that forbids them leaving by themselves now? What stops them now? Are there any laws about House Elves at all? Must they know about Ministry laws currently?

Relationships between House Elves and their owners aren't about laws, but about culture. I don't think it's possible to force any your laws to them. The point where it should start are House Elves owners.

For some reason almost everyone who root for the freedom for House Elves is missing it. They think "let's make right laws end everything will be great!" while such attitude will likely lead to disaster.

House Elves in Hogwarts are not for the freedom while they have Dobby as an example of free elf who is still working at Hogwarts.
