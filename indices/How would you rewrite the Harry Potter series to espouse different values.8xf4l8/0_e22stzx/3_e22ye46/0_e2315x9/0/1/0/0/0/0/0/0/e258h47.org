Are you going to place such bet on your knowledge of psychology totally inhuman race?

Laws aren't everything. You can't just make a law and expect that everything else will be great.

What are you going to do if (when?) majority of House Elves follow Winky's example and became alcoholic, because they can't bear the concept of freedom and wages? What will be your actions if some of then commit suicide? What will you do if feed House Elves start to spread the highly personal information about the families they served for? How are you going to control the species that don't know and don't care about your laws?
