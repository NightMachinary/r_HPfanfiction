  This, for example. I've never seen that. Maybe it exists in, like, one obscure anti-creature fic, somewhere. But I've never seen it. However, I have seen fics which portray House Elves as symbiotic in other ways---typically mutualistic.

The important thing is that many if not most writers portray house elves as needing to feed of their owners' magic to survive, and therefore it's morally acceptable for wizards to keep them as slavery. I feel like they do this to absolve their protagonists of the moral crimes of keeping slaves or at least tacitly supporting slavery.
