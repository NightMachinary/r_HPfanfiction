Rather than depict a fascist utopia, an alt-right fic would lampoon progressives. For example:

Non-human teachers would be hired at Hogwarts regardless of their qualifications, to show how inclusive and tolerant they are.

The Ministry and other state institutions would have hiring quotas to bring the muggleborn:pureblood ratio in line with the general population. Private companies would follow suit to show how virtuous they are. To join the Aurors, a pureblood would need an O in their Defense NEWT, but a Muggleborn would only need an EE - whereas someone part-nonhuman would only need a passing grade.

Conversely, should Muggleborn become overrepresented in the Ministry compared to general population, it would be celebrated as a great victory. Any suggestion to use those same mechanisms to bring in more purebloods would be laughed at.

Besides some fringe publications, the media would stay silent about crimes commited by Muggleborn, but any violent crime, especially hate crime, by purebloods would be plastered on the first page.

People would be encouraged to celebrate Muggle, goblin, or centaur cultures, but expressing pride in pureblood culture would be a taboo. In fact, it would be widely claimed that purebloods "have no culture at all".
