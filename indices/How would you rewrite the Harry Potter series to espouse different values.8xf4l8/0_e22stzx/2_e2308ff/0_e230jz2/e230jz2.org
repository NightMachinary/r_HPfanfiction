The "immigrant" thing is in "Potter", if I remember right:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12574498/1/Potter]]

I've definitely read a fic where House Elves where described as Parasites (since someone accused me of making that up), but can't remember which and don't care to. Another variant I've seen is the Elves' ancestors having done something bad and they have been enslaved as punishment and deserve what they get. Maybe someone else remembers the fics for these.

The "pure-bloods are awesome" and "Dumbledore is too forgiving" are so common that I don't feel the need to come up with examples.

Then there's fics like "Partially Kissed Hero" and "For Love of Magic" (see the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8vzvyk/for_love_of_magic_has_updated_and_harry_now_hates/][recent discussion]] on this subreddit) which are more overt/explicit in their political leanings.
