Its hard to shift Harry Potter much more to the Left before running into fundamental issue's with the setting which all pretty much boil down to the fact that a small segment of the population has godlike supernatural power, and the rest don't.

The troubling implications begin with "why doesn't everyone have magic?". The ability to use magic is implied to be somewhat hereditary which segways into eugenics all too easily. Either there must be some unseen drawback to magic that has led magic to be selected out of the majority of the human genepool, which seems unlikely, or it is some sort of evolutionary leap which is disproven in the text by the presence of ancient Egyptian curses. Introducing "the next stage of human evolution" is also problematic, but beside the point.

The only way I can imagine Harry Potter being rewritten to be truly egalitarian would be to have wizards be reframed more as Illuminati like hoarders of secret knowledge, and that anyone could potentially learn magic. All other sentient species would probably have to be descended from transfigured humans or you run into issue of ethnocentrism by projecting human beliefs onto non-humans and/or problematic questions of what is the measure of a nonhuman.
