I have yet to understand what "left" you mean. Social-Democrats? And if yes, in which country? Communists? Neo-Communists? Socialists? The poststructural Left or the structuralist left? Marxists? Neo-Marxists?

What "left" do you mean? Because I can tell you that beneath that gigantic general term, there is a lot, and I mean */a lot/* of different opinion floating around that makes the generalization as a whole incredibly meaningless.
