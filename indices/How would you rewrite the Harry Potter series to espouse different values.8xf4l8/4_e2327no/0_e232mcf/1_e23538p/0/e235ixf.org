Yeah that's an interesting model, but a lot of the old left actually doesn't want that and is concerned that it will create a two class society (those that require basic income and those that don't. Basically a state sponsored leper colony). They see basic income as a neo-liberal ploy (as in economic liberalism, because some from that school of thought also promote the idea). Its just that They don't have any counter proposal except for raising wages and unions, neither of which address the actual problem.
