That was pretty great. I don't agree with the generalizations about liberals, but the analysis on Harry Potter was funny and kind of insightful (in particular regarding status quo). Who says 4chan produces only poop?

I have to add: One of my personald biggest criticism against the left is that they don't have any ideals/ideas for utopias of the future... like some kind of counter culture. They're still stuck in Marxist wet dreams of the last century or raving mad. Ask someone on the far left about the economy in regards to digitization and the lack of gainful employment for most of society and all they can do is shrug. They don't understand that the digital industrial revolution will not produce more jobs, like the one of the 19th century, but instead will make most of them obsolete.
