I wouldn't necessarily change that much, but I would alter the perception of large people in Harry Potter. It seems that overweight people are on the whole made fun of due to their weight.

I'd also introduce a 'rival' leader within Hogwarts, from Hufflepuff or Slytherin, who is not bad, per se, but espouses a /slightly/ different set of values to Harry and co. Something like them being pro-dementors at Azkaban, pro-house elf rights, anti-discrimination, pro-Ministry reform, pro-Hogwarts reform, and anti-Harry Potter. In other words, someone reasonable, yet disagrees with the Golden Trio fairly often.

I'd like to see them form a following and end up as an up-and-coming leader in the magical government. They could be a great antagonist to the Golden Trio; while this person doesn't really like Harry Potter, they aren't opposed to working with Harry and Co. when it is expedient for him/her.
