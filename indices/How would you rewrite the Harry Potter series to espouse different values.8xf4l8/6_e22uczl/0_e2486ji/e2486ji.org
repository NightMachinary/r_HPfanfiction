With regards to the revolution, Veritaserum was used to ensure no innocents were executed. (And even if there are defences against Veritaserum, that just means that some guilty may escape; it still works perfectly fine to save the innocents.) Also, the story pretty much ends with showing that "Let's kill all enemies" isn't the correct answer, and that democracy beats autocratic systems.

While I generally do write stories where you won't win a war without killing your enemies, and where you'd betray everything you fought for if you'd settle for "status quo ante" after you won the war, there are lines you shouldn't cross.

In Divided and Entwined, a big part of the story centres around the question of how patient you should be with your political opponents when you could simply take over with force instead of trying to get aristocrats to step down and give way to democracy. Doubly so if some of you (former) allies in the war are now hell-bent on revenge and more violence.

But I do subscribe to the notion that when you're facing Death Eaters who want to murder all muggleborns, there's not a lot that's not justified to defeat them.
