  If you can frame your enemy so they'll pass Veritaserum checks, you can also kill them and make it look like an accident since you'd need complete control over them for such a ploy to work.

Even "accidental" death can be suspicious and may lead to unwanted investigation. It's more fool-proof and satisfying if it's the government that does the deed without any connection to you.

  In order to fake such a Veritaserum check, you need to be able to modify their memories - which means manipulating their mind.

Or arrange environment to make everything pointing to the target and just Obliviate the memories for the required time frame. If the whole justice system is based on Veritaserum, it won't have skills and tools for the proper investigation and it will assume that the target erased his/her own memories in order to escape justice.

  If you can do that, you can also modify their memories to the point that they are loyal to you, for example.
#+end_quote

Sudden loyalty of the enemy is definitely suspicious and rewriting huge chunks of memories is a complex, time consuming and very risky procedure. Change the only episode that should pass Veritaserum and the government will do the rest.
