Yeah, right. You don't have much experience with actual law enforcement, do you?

Making up shit like "elves die when freed" or "if Veritaserum is allowed, no one will investigate" doesn't work. First, in order to find someone to question, you need to have hints. You can't just go and grab "enemies" and use Veritaserum on them.

And, since you don't get it: If you need to be able to alter someone's memories to get him convicted, you don't need to frame him in the first place, since if you're in that position, you have him at your mercy.
