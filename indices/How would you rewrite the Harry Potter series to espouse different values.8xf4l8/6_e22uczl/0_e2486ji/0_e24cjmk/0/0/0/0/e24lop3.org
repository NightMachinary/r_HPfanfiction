They shouldn't be perfect. If a Veritaserum is a main tool of justice, no one will spend time and resources for a proper thoughtful investigation. I don't think such system will even have a lawyer for the accused.

Your suggestions lead to questions and one of them is who are the target's enemies.

In my case the target is convicted by the justice system with no relations to outsiders. There are victim and culprit who admitted the crime under the Veritaserum -- in the initial comment you described the system that requires only this.

  No chance of someone noticing that you manipulated the memories (which is a canon thing, see: Slughorn)

Every accused is checked by experienced and powerful Legiliment? Why do you need Veritaserum in that case? Why do you need anything else?

#+begin_quote
  Anyone who tries that would get caught halfway through his plan since he has the common sense of a lemming.

And at the same time your Hermione still isn't caught in your current story :-)
