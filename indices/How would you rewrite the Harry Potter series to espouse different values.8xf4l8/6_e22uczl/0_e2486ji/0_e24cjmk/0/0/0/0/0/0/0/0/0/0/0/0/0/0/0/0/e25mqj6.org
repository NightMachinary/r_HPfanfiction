My point, and that of drunk likely, is that you may have them at your mercy, but framing them may still be the better option. Nothing is ever so black and white that one option is always stupid.

My example shows you don't even need to rearrange memories. I'm reasonably certain Sirius said something akin to “I killed them” or something, leading to his trial-less Incarceration, so that's what he would say under veritaserum. Politicians have lying with the truth down to an art form. If fanfic hasn't completely made things up, then the wizarding judiciary and legislative branches are one and the same, with the legislature serving as a sort of high court. In other words, the politicians /ARE/ the judges, juries, and likely also lawyers.

Who wins in a court battle involving veritaserum would come down not to who did what, as you seem to believe, but who is smarter, and who has more information about the event in question.
