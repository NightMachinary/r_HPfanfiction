I have to agree with the drunk on this one, even if I find some of his other comments to be unpalatable.

This is magic, where the laws of reality go out the window. As far as I understand it, Harry Potter is mainly the result of a conflict between the arguably insane Voldemort and the utilitarian Dumbledore, who might be senile, but is definitely intelligent.

For most of the series it's still essentially a proxy war between Dumbledore and Voldemort. With the level of power both possess, plots can easily go up to many layers of meta. Enough that convoluted plots to frame people using veritaserum are viable options, if only to cause confusion and misdirection.

^{the} above is an argument for why veritaserum may not be viable /in the Harry Potter universe/

The other reason: drunk id correct. It is laughably easy to frame someone using a potion that forces you to tell the truth /as you know it/

Example: “Sirius Black, did you kill James and lily potter” “Yes” Tada. Unless veritaserum allows for a ludicrous amount of explanation of nuances, at which point it's worthless, it can't be used that well. It's only really useful for very very very specific queries, like, “where was your physical body at x time”, but even that's useless if the target had access to a) a time turner, or b) possession.
