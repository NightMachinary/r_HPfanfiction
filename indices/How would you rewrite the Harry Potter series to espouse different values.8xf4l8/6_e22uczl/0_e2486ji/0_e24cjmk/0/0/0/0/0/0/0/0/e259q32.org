  I didn't build the justice system on Veritaserum - I said Veritaserum can be used to avoid convicting an innocent.

If you have other means to prove guilt or innocence, you don't need Veritaserum at all. If you're using it, it means you don't have anything else.

As I know Lie Detectors are forbidden in Switzerland and they are not mandatory in courts in the most countries, still their justice systems work (not without mistakes, but good enough for the society to function).

I just shown that usage of Veritaserum in court can be easily abused.
