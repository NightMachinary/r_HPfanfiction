I've done interrogations. You don't ask "have you killed them?" and then nothing more. You ask a lot of questions, a lot of details, ask them to describe what happened, often multiple times, all in an attempt to filter out lies. Fake confessions are a thing in real life. Veritaserum is just one tool in an investigation.
