You still haven't gotten it? It's used as a means to check if someone's innocent. Not as a means to prove someone's guilt. And yes, there might be a case where someone is both skilled enough to commit a crime and frame someone for it, and so stupid to actually do such a moronic plan, and an innocent might get convicted. But such cases would as rare as a hen's teeth because such talented idiots are even rarer. In the vast majority of the cases, Veritaserum would serve perfectly well to protect the innocently accused.
