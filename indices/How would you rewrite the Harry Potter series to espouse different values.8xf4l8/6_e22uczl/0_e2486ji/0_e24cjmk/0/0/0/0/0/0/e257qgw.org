  you don't need to frame him in the first place, since if you're in that position, you have him at your mercy.

The goal isn't to have your enemy at your mercy. The goal is to avoid any connections between the enemy's future state (dead of in prison) with you.

  First, in order to find someone to question, you need to have hints.

You kill someone and leave some clues pointing to your enemy, then you inject the killing into your enemy's memory. Done. After finding the body Aurors will do the rest.

Or even better. You can just put your target under Imperius, make him/her kill someone and then Obliviate all memories of feeling Imperius.

How is mundane law enforcement related with the magical one? Only a mask allowed Death Eaters stay incognito during the First Riddle War. If Aurors had any means to connect magical traces with persons (like Dumbledore did in the 6th book), all DEs would have to hide and couldn't operate openly.

It's you who built the justice system on the Verisaterum. I just shown how it can be easily abused.
