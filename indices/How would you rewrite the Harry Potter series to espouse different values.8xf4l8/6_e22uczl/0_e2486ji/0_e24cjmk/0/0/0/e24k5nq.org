If you can change someone's memories, you can do much much more than have the government kill them for you. That's a shitty overcomplicated plan only morons would try. Not only do you need to actually commit a crime serious enough for the government to execute someone, without getting caught, but then you need to capture your stooge and manipulate their memories - and arrange everything else so it won't get caught. In other words: You're doing two perfect crimes or double the work and double the risk, for the same result. That's not smart and not efficient.

If you want to kill him, simply have him commit suicide by apparating out to the sea and drown himself. Or something similar. Or, depending on the man, some Fiendfyre accident. No body to find, nothing to implicate you. No chance of someone noticing that you manipulated the memories (which is a canon thing, see: Slughorn).

What you're proposing is stupid and makes no sense. Anyone who tries that would get caught halfway through his plan since he has the common sense of a lemming.
