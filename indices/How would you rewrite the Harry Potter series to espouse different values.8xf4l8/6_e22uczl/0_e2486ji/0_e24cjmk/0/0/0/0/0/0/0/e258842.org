No, I didn't build the justice system on Veritaserum - I said Veritaserum can be used to avoid convicting an innocent. You make up shit and then claim I did it.

Once more: If you can fool Veritaserum and frame someone for a crime, you're good enough to kill them without leaving any traces. Your plan requires double the work and double the risk for the same result - that's what we usually call "stupid".
