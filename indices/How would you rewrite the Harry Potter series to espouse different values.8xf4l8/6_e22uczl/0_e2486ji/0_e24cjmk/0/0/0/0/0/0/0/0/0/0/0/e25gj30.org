If you get in trouble if your enemy suddenly vanishes, then trying to frame them for a crime won't work out any better. Also, you still don't get it: If you can frame your enemy for a crime so Veritaserum can be fooled, then they are no longer your enemy, but your tool or minion. Killing them is not needed once you have so much power over them.
