  If you get in trouble if your enemy suddenly vanishes, then trying to frame them for a crime won't work out any better

Why is that? Those who don't believe it will have to fight the legal system first in order to prove that the mistake was made (and all cases closed with Veritaserum must be reopened as result) and than (years after) prove that you were related to it.

I see it as highly unlikely.

  If you can frame your enemy for a crime so Veritaserum can be fooled, then they are no longer your enemy, but your tool or minion. Killing them is not needed once you have so much power over them.

Continuous control is very risky bet. It can be broken at any point and then used against you. You need very strong guarantees not only from the controlled person, but also from the environment around him/her (that it won't interfere).

With wide spread of Memory charms, polyjuice, Imperius Veritaserum is fooled easily. It is my main point. It just cannot be used to determine guilt or innocence.
