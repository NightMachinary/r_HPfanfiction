If a system has a weakness, as time goes that weakness will be exploited more and more.

Yes, such crimes will be rare, but it's likely that the involved people will play bigger role in the society than an average person and therefore such justice mistake will have bigger consequences. For example, some some pureblood can frame your Hermione or some of her supporters in the corresponding story world.

Or even better example! At some point you said that you are fan of Nazi check. Let's use it. Assume you managed to catch Voldemort. You put him through your process, present all hard evidence against him, then it goes to the final step. He drinks a bottle of Veritaserum and... says that he didn't do any crimes. According to everything you said before you'll have to free him.

Small sacrifices “For The Greater Good”. How familiar. I believe Nazi started similarly.

[Edit]: Example with Voldemort.
