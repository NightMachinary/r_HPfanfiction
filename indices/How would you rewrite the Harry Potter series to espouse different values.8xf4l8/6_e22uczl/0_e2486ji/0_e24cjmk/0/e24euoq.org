If you can frame your enemy so they'll pass Veritaserum checks, you can also kill them and make it look like an accident since you'd need complete control over them for such a ploy to work. When you have that kind of control, framing your enemy for a crime is pretty much superfluous. It's on a level with "I'll imperius that man to tell me his darkest secret so I can blackmail him into giving me the contents of the safe in his bedroom".

In order to fake such a Veritaserum check, you need to be able to modify their memories - which means manipulating their mind. If you can do that, you can also modify their memories to the point that they are loyal to you, for example.
