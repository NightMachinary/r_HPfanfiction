Apart from the fact that it is, by my understanding of the theory and all known executions of communist government, an impossibility for what we understand to be a modern society. The moment choice in any capacity is introduced into a communist system, it teeters towards collapse as people who do not wish to be part of it leave (see the 'brain-drain' of the 1950s-1960s in the Soviet Union that was the main reason for building the Berlin wall). And it isn't democratic if you don't give people the right to choose not to be involved (within reason) or to vote for non-communist representatives.
