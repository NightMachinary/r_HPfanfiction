  Authoritarianism is as much a pillar of Communism because it must be present in order for said Communist state to function. There is not a single working example to the contrary throughout the entirety of history, to my knowledge.

Rojava, which also happens to be the only communist state to form without heavy influence from Russian authoritarian communists keen on genocide. (Well, aside from Bavaria, but that lasted maybe a day and was formed by a different anti-democratic group.) The US likewise, when it interferes with the formation of other nations' governments, tends to promote authoritarian states.

Anyway, I'd like to try both democracy and communism. I value democracy more, but I don't think they're incompatible.
