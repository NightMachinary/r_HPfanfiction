I didn't express myself well - I mean that in a capitalist/democratic system, you can spoil your vote or even vote for fascists or communists. You have that freedom. Under communism, the option to choose to disagree is a threat to the unity (and therefore stability) of the state, same as in a fascist dictatorship.

For communism to actually function it has to eliminate the concept of the individual - because from the moment people are treated as individuals by the state, the unity of communism becomes voluntary-only, and I believe - as history has proved - that voluntary-communism, where the entirety of the population agrees and individuals are not repressed by the state - doesn't exist.

I'm assuming that, because throughout all of recorded history, communism has never /naturally/ occurred through voluntary means - a hierarchy in some form has (as far as I am aware) always, even in tribes that have had no contact with the outside world until the 20th Century, formed of its own accord, along with the concept of property ownership. Therefore yes, I am assuming that no given human population would choose such a system because no existing human population to my knowledge ever has and /not/ had to repress or kill everyone else who disagreed.
