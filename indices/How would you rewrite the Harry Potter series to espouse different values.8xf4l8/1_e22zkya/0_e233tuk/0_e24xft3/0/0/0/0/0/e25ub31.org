  I didn't express myself well - I mean that in a capitalist/democratic system, you can spoil your vote or even vote for fascists or communists. You have that freedom. Under communism, the option to choose to disagree is a threat to the unity (and therefore stability) of the state, same as in a fascist dictatorship.
#+end_quote

In a capitalist democracy, voting in communists is possible. Does that mean that democracy is a threat to capitalism and therefore it is impossible to have a stable capitalist democracy?

#+begin_quote
  For communism to actually function it has to eliminate the concept of the individual - because from the moment people are treated as individuals by the state, the unity of communism becomes voluntary-only, and I believe - as history has proved - that voluntary-communism, where the entirety of the population agrees and individuals are not repressed by the state - doesn't exist.
#+end_quote

That complaint applies to any government. We have not had any successful governments in which obeying laws is voluntary. Does this mean anything short of anarchy eliminates the concept of the individual? My government assesses taxes. If it treated me as an individual, would it no longer be able to tax me?

  I'm assuming that, because throughout all of recorded history, communism has never naturally occurred through voluntary means - a hierarchy in some form has (as far as I am aware) always, even in tribes that have had no contact with the outside world until the 20th Century, formed of its own accord

Many types of hierarchies are compatible with communism. The Soviet Union had hierarchies, though it's not the example we would want to emulate.

  along with the concept of property ownership.
#+end_quote

Property ownership is also a feature of communism.

There are three types of property:

- Public property is stuff that anyone can use, under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Like a park.
- Personal property is stuff that you personally use. Like a house you live in.
- Private property is stuff that you don't use, but extract rents from. Like a car you rent out, or a plot of land where someone else extracts mineral resources and pays you for the privilege.

In communism, private property is turned into public or personal property. Personal and public property rights still need to be enforced.

  Therefore yes, I am assuming that no given human population would choose such a system because no existing human population to my knowledge ever has and not had to repress or kill everyone else who disagreed.

Capitalism itself was quite murderous at the outset and today is less murderous.
