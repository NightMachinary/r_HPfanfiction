  The moment choice in any capacity is introduced into a communist system, it teeters towards collapse as people who do not wish to be part of it leave

You are assuming that a huge portion of the country in question would so strongly prefer to live under capitalism that they would flee the country. While plenty of people tried and failed to leave the USSR, this was because it was a dictatorship that murdered millions of people. Travel restrictions were put in place to more effectively murder the populations in question.

If I were creating a communist democracy, genocide would not be a part of it, so I wouldn't need to put in travel restrictions to more thoroughly murder a population.

  And it isn't democratic if you don't give people the right to choose not to be involved (within reason) or to vote for non-communist representatives.

In Australia, voting is compulsory. Apparently Australia isn't democratic, because people don't have a choice to not be involved?

Or is it specifically the possibility of voting for a non-communist representative that's a requirement, and you're assuming that it is impossible for a population to generally want to live in a communist economic system?
