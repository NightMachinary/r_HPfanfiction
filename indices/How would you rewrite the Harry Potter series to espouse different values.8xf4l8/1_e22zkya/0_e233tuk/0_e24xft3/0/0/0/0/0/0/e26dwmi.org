  Hierarchy is compatible with Communism
#+end_quote

At its base level, Communism is about everyone being an equal member of a society. Hierarchy is fundamentally incompatible with this concept, as power/respect/wealth/food become accrued by a select number of individuals over time, /every time hierarchy is introduced to society/. Yes, hierarchy existed inside the Soviet Union, and therefore it fundamentally diverged from the actual theory laid down by Marx and Engels. Even Lenin saw that a government of the Proletariat can't actually work without allowing some intellectual or influential people to guide the revolution.

Otherwise regarding your other points I believe you're misinterpreting what I'm saying to an extent. At it's base level, yes, society as a whole (in any form) attacks the existence of the individual, however in Communist/Fascist/Authoritarian/Autocratic/Dictatorial systems, the individual is a definitive target of the state. No one is completely free in any democracy on earth, but anyone is still freer there than if they were a cog in a communist or other extreme society.

Democracy is, theoretically, a threat to the stability of any system, it's just that capitalism becomes more stable than other forms of economic policy overall because it /appeals/ to human individualism, to our ambitions and also our baser instincts regarding ownership and the accruing of wealth/property/mates etc. I state again, if Communism were the preferred state of being for humans, it would've existed long before the industrial revolution and would reoccur inside control populations of its own accord.

Being an individual is not inherently a threat in of itself to democracy, because in the end the only thing that matters is your vote and your taxes. In Western society, we celebrate our individualism.

However in the extreme forms of government I mentioned above (not just Communism), individualism is by its very existence an attack on the apparatus of the state. Why Communism doesn't work in the modern world, same as any other extreme form of government (in the long run), is because we are at our basest level, individuals. Not part of a commune or hive-mind that would allow actual cooperation. Society is by my understanding a construct created by individuals to ensure the security or availability of resources for those individuals. It is more comfortable to live as part of a society than alone, not just for material reasons but for social ones too, but it doesn't change the fact that in the end our ability to make choices is the largest threat to any societal system, and particularly ones that can only be formed with mass control/indoctrination/force such as Communism.
