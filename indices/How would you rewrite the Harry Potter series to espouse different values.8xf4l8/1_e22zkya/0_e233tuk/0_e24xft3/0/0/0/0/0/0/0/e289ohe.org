  Otherwise regarding your other points I believe you're misinterpreting what I'm saying to an extent. At it's base level, yes, society as a whole (in any form) attacks the existence of the individual, however in Communist/Fascist/Authoritarian/Autocratic/Dictatorial systems, the individual is a definitive target of the state. No one is completely free in any democracy on earth, but anyone is still freer there than if they were a cog in a communist or other extreme society.

A list with one odd element out. Authoritarianism is a pillar of fascism, and autocracy is the pinnacle of authoritarianism. You are trying to smuggle in an assumption that communism, even a communist democracy, must be authoritarian.

  Democracy is, theoretically, a threat to the stability of any system, it's just that capitalism becomes more stable than other forms of economic policy overall because it appeals to human individualism, to our ambitions and also our baser instincts regarding ownership and the accruing of wealth/property/mates etc.

Again, you've got a list with one odd element out. Mates are people who deserve human rights and are not property.

Anyway, capitalism is indeed an attempt to harness greed to create social progress. The problem is that it does not directly reward social progress. This problem was immediately apparent; the rise of capitalism (with the decline of mercantilism) was marked with slavery and the human rights violations of the Industrial Revolution. We've tried to patch this over with laws, and that was effective up to the Cold War, when the communists were inept bureaucrats intent on murdering large parts of their own populations and the capitalists were hell-bent on eliminating anyone who so much as whispered "worker's rights" on the grounds that they were communists. (Hyperbole, in case you want to argue about this in a literal sense. But I'll note that one of the major tasks for police since their founding has been union busting, and socialists have been essential for a lot of worker's rights.)

  I state again, if Communism were the preferred state of being for humans, it would've existed long before the industrial revolution and would reoccur inside control populations of its own accord.

An economic system somewhat similar to capitalism has existed for a very long time; however, slave labor, serfdom, and self-employment were the overwhelming options for labor, instead of wage labor. Capitalism itself superseded mercantilism and is about three hundred years old -- about 150 years older than communism.

Economic systems similar to communism have existed for a long time, at least a couple thousand years. I even linked you to an article about one example of this.

Please, learn the history of the systems you're talking about before you make history-based arguments on which ones are more natural. At least skim the relevant Wikipedia articles.
