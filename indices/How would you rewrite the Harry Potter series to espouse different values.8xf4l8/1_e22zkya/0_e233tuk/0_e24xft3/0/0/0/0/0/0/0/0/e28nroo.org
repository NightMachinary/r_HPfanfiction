Authoritarianism is as much a pillar of Communism because it /must be present/ in order for said Communist state to function. There is not a single working example to the contrary throughout the entirety of history, to my knowledge.

The fact that it must be propagated by armed Revolution for anyone to actually take notice of it supports this, as in even the people who invented Communism knew that having democracy would never lead to its acceptance or natural formation. Until you start recognising it as as bad as Fascism there's very little point arguing with you. I've studied Communism in all its forms at university grade, in all its executions in history, and literally the one single instance which didn't completely go against the ideals of human rights, democracy and all things decent in the world was a small portion of the way SFR Yugoslavia was run under Tito, and that was more about him not putting up with Stalin and trying to trade with the West more than anything else.

Also union busting is a US problem, we don't really have that in the UK because we have laws that protect unions. I'll readily admit that it's a trait of US Capitalism, but not one inherent to Capitalism as a whole.

The types of labour available are irrelevant to my point about control popualations. If Communism were preferable to human nature, it would not be a fringe idea peddled by middle class intellectuals. I'm not interested in systems that incorporate socialist items or other aspects of Communism, but /Communism itself/. No society has ever in history embraced Communism peacefully and then managed to avoid the creation of a heirarcy, ruling class and eventual perversion of everything the actual political theory is about.

In regards to what that article mentioned, I have repeatedly stated all of my arguments in relation to a modern society, and how Communism is fundamentally incompatible with Democracy. Furthermore, the theocratic communism mentioned (for example) is merely an interpretation of events quoted in the Bible, with no actual recorded deployment from an actual historical source. I have yet to see a single piece of actual evidence that Democratic forms of Communism can work and /have worked/ at any point in human history.

Therefore, returning to my original comment:

Democracy, or Communism. Choose one, because they do not work together.
