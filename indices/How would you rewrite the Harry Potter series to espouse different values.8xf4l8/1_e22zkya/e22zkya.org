WRT communism, it depends on whether you mean the actual, practiced communism (ie, the USSR or Cuba) or the anarcho-communist ideal. If the latter, the magical world has the potential to accomplish it. After all, the "means of production" are the wands and the raw materials for potions and other magical items. Reduce the Ministry bureaucracy to the bare minimum to keep the Statute of Secrecy and you're nearly there.

As for fascism, do you mean the authoritarian, nationalistic, corporativist movement of the 1920s and 1930s? Go the opposite way and increase nationalism and the Ministry bureaucracy.

The catch is, the books don't describe Harry as a revolutionary. He hates Wizard-Hitler, Wizard-Hitler wants to kill him, so it all goes towards a Harry/Wizard-Hitler showdown. The revolutionary is Hermione. So I'd focus the story on her, have her investigate muggle politics during her summer breaks and have her, instead of Harry, leading a struggle to change the Wizarding dystopia into another type of dystopia
