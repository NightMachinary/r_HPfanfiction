  "Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of Dougal McGregor to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship," says JKR. This is a development---actually, four possibilities, one per chapter, of how it could have looked, sounded, felt like to a younger Minerva McGonagall and a less ancient Albus Dumbledore. This story was featured on The Petulant Poetess for october-november 2013.
