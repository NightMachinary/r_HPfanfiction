[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] has some great scenes focused on Snape and the other professors (day to day interaction, bets between teachers, pranks, occasional staff parties, friction with Umbridge and related humor, etc.) I particularly like the friendship between Snape and McGonnagal and the interaction with Professor Vector at the staff Christmas party. linkffn(11687216)
