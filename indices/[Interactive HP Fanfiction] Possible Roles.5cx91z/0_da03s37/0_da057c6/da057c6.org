The story starts with an eleven-year-old. I'm not actually using a name, referring to the character as "you".

The roles will be strategically placed in different places around the story, for example, if he wanted to be a programmer you might have the option one day in the library to read a coding book, or maybe get access to a computer.

The last one is hard to explain. For example, if he was an alchemist, alchemy would be the main thing he did, but it wouldn't be a career or any life goal.
