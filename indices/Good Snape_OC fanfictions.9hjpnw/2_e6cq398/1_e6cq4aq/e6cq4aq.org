  Twelve years after the horrible experience in her father's bookshop, muggle Katherine Shepard is back home to start anew. However, a visit from a tall, miserable stranger sends her into a world she never knew existed, changing her future forever. As the dark potions master tries to grapple with the woman he's been forced to protect as well as living a life of a double-agent, his own worldview begins to change...against his better judgement. And as he continues with his plan to protect the world against the Dark Lord and begins to acknowledge the feelings that are starting to grow for a certain annoying muggle, Severus begins to wonder if he might deserve a happy ending after all. ***All 'Harry Potter'/etc related credit goes to Miss Rowling - whom I am very thankful created such a wonderful world full of amazing characters that we are able to play with!***[Note: This timeline is similar to Book 6- and it will continue slightly AU in the future for reasons that will eventually present themselves. ] I live for comments - they are my lifeblood.
