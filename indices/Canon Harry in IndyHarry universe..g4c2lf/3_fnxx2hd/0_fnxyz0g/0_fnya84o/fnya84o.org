I dunno. When you spend most of maths filling graph paper with fanfiction and then stress yourself to hell and back when the exam comes up. It's even worse now with school at home ... :(. I do have a fanfiction that I'm writing. It's meant to be a relatively short oneshot about twins who lived. (I love Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the santi). Plan is, Harry ain't the boy who lived, does have a horcrux on his head. Currently trying suicide by the enemy, aka putting himself in unwinnable positions. I'm trying to base it loosely on this guy, (I tried to find him but I'll give you the gist. NZ soldier in world war two, had personal vendetta against all things germans for gassing his uncles, and went batshit crazy after his girlfreind broke up with him, attempting suicide by charging enemy machine gun nests. Repeatedly.(Actually it might be this guy with his acheivments overblown by the lads in the army [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Upham)]]) Knowing that he needs to die, Harry takes on increasingly stupid risks, dropping out of school to fight the war, he gains the respect and the command of the fighting arm of the order of the phoenix. I also would like to work in some PTSD. I've been reading the body keeps the score and damn, that shit is dark. As Harry is a total badass motherfucker in the field against Death Eaters, he cries at night for the people he's killed. Not just those that he's killed personally, but those that have died for him. He's a haunted man. Death eaters will be competent, and casualties will be evened out. No:Harry instagibs 50 death eaters destroying voldemorts support base. Yes: Harry killed three, bellatrix killed five, lets get the fuck outta here. No:"By right of conquest I steal your shit" bullshit, Yes:"accio gold chandelier, family jewels, dark artifact that can be sold, malfoy's fancey silk shit, lets get us some more safehouses with this money. In short, a Harry Potter fanfic that will be very, very grim. Wanna be my beta reader, Internet stranger?
