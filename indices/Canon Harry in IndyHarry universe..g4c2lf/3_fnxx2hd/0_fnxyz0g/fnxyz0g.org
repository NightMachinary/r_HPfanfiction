This is very well written. The only mistake I can find is that you capitalized H in The as Harry talks about Tonks and Fred. You should really consider writing. Besides that one little thing, I can't find anything wrong with it. It was short but it was deep. It gave so much in such a small bite. Honestly I'm jealous.
