"I used the expelliarmus."

In the silence, the breeze blew, autumn leaves fluttering among the grass on the grounds of Hogwarts. It seemed marvolous that the grim battlescarred halls were here in their pre-battle state. It almost brought a tear to his eye.

The group stared at him in shock.

"But, there has to be more than that?" Hermione's question was reflected in the gaze of all present, and Harry sighed.

"I don't want to talk about it." THe tone was final and harry looked with haunted eyes, looking and seeing not what lay before him, but the echoes of the past. Fred. Tonks. A tear slipped past his eye. "You really don't want to know. Not even I."

"We used a school as a fortress. Yes, we evacuated most of the children, but some remained. You really want to know that in order for you to win, some first year jumped in front of an AK for you?" Harry let out a tear at that particular memory. Not all of the first years had left.

"I was ready to die. To give up on this world. So, I died." Harry took a deep inbreath, as he watched the thestrals, wandering if there was a Colin in this world as well. "I was ready to go on. In cowardice. Abandoning my freinds." There was steel in his eye as he made this declaration. "You know what they say."

"Hell is empty, and all the demons are here."

"I didn't want to kill him. I, I just could not bring myself to kill another human being. So, I threw the first spell I thaught of, expelliarmous at his AK. It rebounded, killing him." Harry saw a ruffle in the air, the telltale sign of disillusionment , and threw himself to the gound before throwing a protego.

"Jumpy are you?" Dumbledore asked.

"No. Just prepared."
