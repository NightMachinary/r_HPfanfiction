  In the films, there's several instances of spells being blocked in Beam-O-Wars.

I always hated that bit, because unless every instance of that happening involved wands made from the same core material from the same animal, like Harry's and Voldemort's wands, the spells should've just bounced away from each other in random directions, like what was described happening in Book 4 when Harry and Draco cast a spell at each other simultaneously.
