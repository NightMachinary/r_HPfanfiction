In the films, there's several instances of spells being blocked in Beam-O-Wars.

The special case in Harry's case was the Priori Incantatum, where Harry overpowered Voldemort's wand and forced it to show the wand's previous victims, along with the golden cage of light.

In Deathly Hallows, it was caused by Harry being the true master of the Elder Wand, causing the wand to backfire (like how Ron's wand backfired on Lockhart).
