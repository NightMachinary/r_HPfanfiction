"I used Expelliarmus."

There was silence for a few seconds before the Ron started snickering. "Good one Harry. You are funnier than Hadrian can ever be. But seriously how did you beat your 'You Know Who'?"

"I really used the Expelliarmus to kill him."

"Really?" Hermione said with curiosity clear in her voice. "I didn't believe it was possible to kill someone with the Disarming Charm. You must be an exceptionally powerful wizard to be able to do so. I doubt even Professor Dumbledore or Hadrian could do it."

"You are correct Miss Granger. I don't believe I could make an Expelliarmus powerful enough for it to kill someone. Perhaps a Stupefy but not Expelliarmus."

'My Expelliarmus didn't actually hit Voldemort." Harry was regretting asking about his counter part.

"Bloody Merlin. Your Expelliarmus is so strong that you didn't even need to hit with it to kill You Know Who." Ron said awed.

"No. Voldemort used the Killing Curse and I used the Disarming Charm. Our spells hit each others and his Killing Curse rebounded and hit him." Harry said through clenched teeth.

There was silence when the others heard about it and he wished he could be anywhere but here. Then Ron made a sound he has only ever heard his Ron make when talking about Chudley Canons.

"You mean you actually hit You Know Who's spell with your own?" There was even more awe in Ron's voice than before, "Like the Super Heroes in the comics do?"

He didn't know what to say to that. He had never read a Wizarding comic. He had not even read a Muggle comic book. "Yeah." he answered hesitantly.

"Show me." Hermione demanded. She was already drawing her wand and getting out of her seat. He hesitated but followed suit. When they were standing facing each other, wands in front of them he waited patiently for Hermione to cast first.

After a moment she drew her wand arm closer to her and his eyes widened. /What the hell is she thinking? Using Reducto inside a room./ As she brought her arm back forward and the blue spell left her wand; he moved his wand forward and thought /Stupefy./ As their spells collided the reducto deflected into the floor a few meters before him and his spell went whizzing just over her head.

He was about to snap at her for her choice of spell but halted when he saw the look of disbelief and awe on her face. "I never thought this was possible. Professor Dumbledore have you seen anything like this before?" she asked turning towards the Headmaster.

"I don't think I have Miss Granger. Harry here must be extremely skilled to be able to do this." he replied and he had.. admiration in his voice.

Ron slapped him on his back and as he turned towards him said, "You are so much cooler than Hadrian. I can't wait to rub the fact that you killed Voldemort by deflecting his own spell at him into his face."

In canon Harry did in fact fire spells at already fired spells to deflect or block them. And as far as I know he was the only one to do so.
