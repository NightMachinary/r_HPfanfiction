The goblins "I assume you've already gone through the inheritence ritual?"

Harry "Th-the what now?"

"The ritual in which you prick your finger and drop blood onto a peice of parchment, thereby magically creating a list of all your powers, titles, and properties. All orchestated for free in 10 minutes by the goblin nation of course, since you did smile at one of us once."

"...Um, no I don't believe I've done that."

"What?! Preposterous! You mean to say that when you were 11 years old you /did not/ conduct your own legal, financial, and political business without the consent of either your muggle or magical guardian? Nor did you claim your ungodly amount of seats on the wizengamot, therefore guaranteeing your complete control of magical Britain before you even hit puberty?"

"Ron, Hermione, I think we should get out of here. These guys are completely round the bend."

"Did you at least solidify your marriage contracts?"

"Contracts?? As in plural?!"

"Naturally. Your marriages gaurentee you access to the entirety of the Greengrass, Bones, Carrow, and Weasleys estates and vaults."

Hermione "Is this legal?"

Ron "Bloody hell no. If Percy heard of all this he'd have a conniption and die on spot. Imagine all the legal trouble and paperwork..."

Everyone ever in the HP Indy universe "Paperwork? What's paperwork?"
