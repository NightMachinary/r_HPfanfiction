Haha I actually just read this story, and I'm halfway through the sequel on my kindle as I type this.

The story is Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions, sequel to HP and the Psychic Serpent, prequel to HP and the Triangle Prophecy, all by Barb.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/70312/Barb-LP][Link to ff.net page]].

To round out the details you can't remember:

James did die, Lily married Snape. This happened because Voldie convinced Harry to help him change the timelines with the Tempus Bonum Voluntatis spell.\\
Harry and Lily have a rough relationship, Harry has a much better time with Snape and his younger brothers, the twins Simon and Stuart Snape, as well as his younger sister Jamie Potter.\\
In this fic none of them really WANT to be death eaters, but there's magic afoot that mucks that up.\\
In the mucked up timeline, Hermione and the other muggleborns are never invited to Hogwarts at all.

It's a pretty good trilogy. PS is great, ToGI is pretty good. The third book is ok so far... I hope it picks up soon, as it's mostly love triangle angst at the moment. That's my biggest complaint about the series actually. Every book has a super complicated somewhat contrived love triangle/angst angle that takes forever to resolve. And every time it's about to be handled, someone takes an innocuous comment or innocent happenstance WAY TOO MUCH to heart and suddenly it's like someone murdered their mum. But the first two books didn't focus on it as much as the third has so far, so hopefully that will clear up soon.

Oh and just for clarity's sake, Psychic Serpent is a 5th year story written before book 5 came out. So ToGI and TP are 6th/7th year stories in that established universe. Because of this, certain things are assumed and other things don't happen like canon- for one example, Sirius is alive and well in Harry's 7th year.
