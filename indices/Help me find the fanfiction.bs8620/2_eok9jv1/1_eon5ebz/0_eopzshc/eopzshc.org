If you didn't know there is an "official" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3032621/1/The-Hunt-For-Harry-Potter][sequel]] and some other derived fic. Amongst those, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11965672/1/Terminal-Justice-by-Overkill-AKA-Irrational-Intelligence][Terminal Justice]] (DC crossover, mostly the Justice League animated series from the early 2000's) which is unfortunately not complete but close enough from the end that you can read it without getting too frustrated. Sad because apparently the author had said on his original blog that it was missing only one chapter.
