Off the top of my head:

Prince of Slytherin has a lot of world building, some people think too much since the plot can move a bit slowly. (I'm also behind in this fic, I like to let the chapters to build up a bit so I have a decent amount to read through) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

To shape and change - delves into werewolves and healing magic a bit (I havent finished it yet though, I jump between fics) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]]

Blood - severitus, but really really well written. No weasley bashing either. If anything, read it for the good good friendship. (This has a bit of slash, but exploring sexuality is one of the plot points and its handled very well imo) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3089927/chapters/6696266]]

Antithesis - super dark and heartbreaking, but very good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]]

Theres more I could probably list, but I'm on mobile. If I think of any more later I'll post again.
