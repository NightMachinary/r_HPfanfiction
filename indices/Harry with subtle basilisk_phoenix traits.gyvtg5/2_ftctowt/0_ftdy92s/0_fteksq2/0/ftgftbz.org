True, but if one gets poetic enough it might even work.

What I hate is the kind of ppl who see "killing curse green" and immediately go to the end of the chapter just to say "I READ KILLING CURSE GREEN AND IMMEDIATELY STOPPED READING YOU'RE SO TERRIBLE THIS STORY IS SH*T GO DIE!!!" instead if trying to read a bit further to see if they like the story or just exiting without yelling at the author for using something completely valid.
