Ahhh you are amazing! I just finished Three Thousand Days of Innocence a few days ago and I might have read A Marriage of Convenience (it rings a bell), but I haven't heard of most of those! Thank you so much :D

As for recs, I really like a lot of the stories on the Fire and Ice Archive (if you haven't heard of it - it's a site solely devoted to DG fanfic, check it out!) - I'm currently reading [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewstory.php?sid=4481][Hesperides' Apple]] which is pretty good, and I love everything by [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewuser.php?uid=116][Anise]] (although warning - most of her stories are years old but unfinished).
