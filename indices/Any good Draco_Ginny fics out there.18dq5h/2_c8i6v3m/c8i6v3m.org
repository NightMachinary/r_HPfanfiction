I've never read one I enjoyed as a main pairing, but several where they are a background pairing (usually when Harry winds up with Hermione).

Likely the reason you got zero response was because nobody can think of any off the top of their heads. If YOU can think of any good ones where it is the main pairing, I might be convinced to try it out. . .
