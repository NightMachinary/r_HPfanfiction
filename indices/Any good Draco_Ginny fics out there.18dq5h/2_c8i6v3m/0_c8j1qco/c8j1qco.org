[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/sarea_okelani/KB01a.html][Kissing Booth]] is *hilarious*. And short.

[[http://www.dracoandginny.com/viewstory.php?sid=4386][Crossing Into Chaos]]: /Completely AU. In a world where Voldemort was never defeated, only a few things matter: pureblood, money and power. All that Ginny Weasley wanted was to survive her 7 years at Hogwarts, a school where the children of the richest and most powerful wizards dominate over others. Denying her natural instincts, she managed to make it into her 6th year without offending any of the cruel and powerful Slytherins - especially that horrible Draco Malfoy. Until one day, she crosses a line, and her peaceful existence is shattered forever. A story filled with adolescent drama, clash of the classes, angst, jealousy, ridiculous pride and love triangles (and squares)./ This is possibly the most fun to read D/G fic out there :D

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3043746/1/Not-Quite-Fate][Not Quite Fate]]: This is one of the first D/G fics I read and I've reread it so many times. Heart's Cadence is a fantastic author.
