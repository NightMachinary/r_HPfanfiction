It's not a central focus of the story, but linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay) eventually sees most of Harry's friend group become Animagi. Not only that, but they regularly use and refer to their forms, which in itself is unusual since it seems most fics that have someone become an Animagus go on to basically ignore the ability until it's plot-relevant.
