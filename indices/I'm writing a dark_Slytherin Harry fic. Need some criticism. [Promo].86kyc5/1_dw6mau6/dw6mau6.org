Hey! Hope I'm not coming off as rude. I want to help!

I just sort of skimmed the first chapter because to be honest when I see things formatted and written with your skill level I don't read further.

I noticed you put out a feeler for a beta as well, but there's a lot you can fix and work on on your own. I used to beta a lot but I got too frustrated because I hated fixing the same errors over and over again (after I'd beg the author to just fix a few bad habits). It seems like an interesting premise and I think if you put some more/different effort into editing on your own you may be okay without a beta! It's helpful to have a second pair of eyes and it's great that you're asking for advice but doing most of the editing yourself is best. Betas are better used for bigger picture issues or noticing a few strange details/errors, not fixing punctuation.

Some stuff (some of which had already been brought up):

- fix that dialogue formatting. Look at any novel for examples. Every time a new character speaks its a new line break.

-punctuation. There's tons of guides out online. Just search “when to use commas” for a start.

- 7 o'clock. Not 7'oclock.

-Dumbledore's beard goes DOWN to his waist. Not UP to his waist. Because his beard is above his waist.

- I think you're trying too hard by inserting more complicated words. I think it would genuinely read better if your prose was more direct. For example, you wrote something along the lines of Vernon ”stared at the spectacle he was facing” which is redundant and awkward. ((Sorry I can't quote exactly, I'm on mobile and can't keep switching between this and ff.net))

- It looks like you're trying to avoid a lot of prose between dialogue. You have entire masses of dialogue without anything like “she said” or “said Vernon” etc. You don't need to do that. When three characters are talking you definitely should fill in things like that.

- try to follow the rule “show; don't tell.” It's better to write about reactions and consequences than just to write “Petunia was upset.”

BIG TIPS:

*** I think a lot of the issues could actually be fixed if you took time to read your work out loud rather than reading it on your computer for editing that trick usually helps me a lot.

*** Go read a chapter of a novel or two. Just pay close attention to the way paragraphs are broken up. Pay attention to the way dialogue is written and pay attention to the BALANCE between dialogue and prose. By prose I mean just descriptive paragraphs. Your writing alternates a lot between chunks of dialogue and chunks of just prose.

*** See what you can cut out. There's a lot of extraneous stuff you don't need and your writing will seem clearer if you can cut down.

Because that was all a little harsh, I want to point out the good things too. Something that stood out is that you seemed to have a good idea of the way that characters talk. Dumbledore's dialogue looked like something would say. I could tell who said what by the way they spoke, more than once. That sounds basic but it's a huge plus, since a lot of writers don't even bother trying to keep to details like that.

Your past tense also is pretty consistent which is GREAT! After basic punctuation issues the next thing that would cause me to drop a fic is inconsistent tenses.

As far as formatting on ff.net goes, I agree with others: make Harry Potter a character so people can find your fic by searching for him. And try to keep your author's notes as short as possible.

I think it would be great if you would actually take what we've all given you and edit your first chapter and share it. I hope you do! And of course keep at it. Practice makes perfect!
