AO3 encourages people to upload abandoned works, while still indicating who originally wrote it, which is the only reason I recommended it.

FFN technically doesn't allow people to upload other people's work, so it might just get reported and taken down. Glad to hear you're committed to keeping it alive and on the internet.
