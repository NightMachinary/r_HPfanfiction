The best one without a doubt in linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) It's an adventure story, it has everything. It's sad and happy and funny and terrifying and tense and brilliant. Just fantastic!!! You definately should read it. The plot is so unique and just wonderful. Its exactly what you say, Harry ends up back in time, goes on the run because he doesn't want to mess up the timeline. Ends up with malnutrition so a weird guy invites him to live with him and Harry gets caught up in the first war in his own way, for his own reasons. It's amazing.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is also good? It's a bit more funny and there's a lot of tension between him and the Marauders makes it interesting.

linkao3(face death in the hope by LullabyKnell) is 63 chapters and unfinished. Not abandoned but updates are sporadic. Harry ends up back and accidently saves Regulus and they end up at Marlene's house. There's a lot of good character introspection into Harry trying to deal with the fact his parents are right there.

linkao3(into the arena with your head held high by LullabyKnell) is my Bonus Suggestion here. It's different, Harry and the most adorable Teddy Lupin end up back at OoTP era. Teddy is a dote and it's a bit of an adventure. Unfinished but different.
