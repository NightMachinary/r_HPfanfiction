I finally got around to reading this, and I absolutely loved it. It was adorably hilarious, and I wish it had been epic-length. No I'm scouring the net for similar stories, but am unfortunately coming up pretty empty handed. “Crack-taken-seriously-Hermione-granger-dark-witch-demon-summoner” is an oddly specific search, after all XD
