i loved the changeling too!

haven't really come across anything else like it, but if you are looking for female character centric fics, there's an awesome series of one shots written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]] on ao3 that covers the experiences of a lot of the female characters in the potterverse.

It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/136245][we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within]]
