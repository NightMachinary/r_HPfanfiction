Here's a few that haven't been mentioned yet:

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Originally published on porkey, due to some magic, Hermione's name comes out of the goblet instead of Harry's. It's Harry/Hermione, but that's not really the focus of the story. Hermione is the main character. I really enjoyed it. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- /Resistance/ by lorien829. Hermione-centric in a world where Voldemort won the last battle. She goes on to be bad ass. Again, HHr, but done very well. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Notebooks and Letters/ by chem prof. Probably the most romance-focused story on this list. It's Hermione telling her daughter the "true story" years after the fact. Very HHr. If you don't want any romance, this one isn't for you. But otherwise, this is the first real HHr story I read and it showed me that the pairing could work. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/ by The Carnivorous Muffin. It's a fem!Harry with godlike powers and a rather unique and interesting story. Worth reading. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]])

- /A Question of When/ by vlad the inhaler. Romilda Vane is the main character, and while the story is focused on her pursuit of Harry, I don't think I would call this a romance. Time travel is a big element. It's also short, a one-shot with only 5,800 words. But it's /very/ good. Worth reading. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])
