These tend to be the types of fics I enjoy.

Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass linkffn(12188150) is a Harry/Tonks fic where Tonks goes back in time and poses as a student. It is very character centric, and I think would hit your criteria well.

​

Escape linkffn(11916243) is a Harry/Hermione fic where Hermione decides to run away to America and drags Harry along. The romance is important, but not the basis of the story (It is mostly an adventure).

​

A Little Child Shall Lead Them is entirely Hermione centric linkffn(10871795). However it is not set during the school years, it is set during the... baby years. ... yeaaaa... Trust me, it is worth reading...
