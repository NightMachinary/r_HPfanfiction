Yesssss also would be tickled to see more elemental magic in HP. Not necessarily "bending" per se, but something of the mysterious "old ways" pre-Hogwarts magic. I've been kicking around a little crossover idea where the Last Airbender meets the Last Air Priestess, but I haven't even quite decided which one lands in the other's world. Still in that stage where it's a hodgepodge of ideas and no plot, and I have plenty of other fics to finish first.
