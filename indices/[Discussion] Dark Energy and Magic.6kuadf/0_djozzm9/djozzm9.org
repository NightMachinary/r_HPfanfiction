There are two main ways that magic can be characterised.

If you characterise magic as part of a unitary system of rules governing the universe (i.e. magic is a part of the same natural world as the rules of physics, it's just unknown how they fit together), then magic would be some form of energy.

The alternative is to characterise magic as an essentially supernatural force, entirely separate from the "regular" workings of nature.

I feel like there are a lot of problems with the former, regardless of what you pick as the source of the energy.

The biggest problem is that, while magic sometimes behaves like a physical force, at other times it behaves in ways that would make its combination with the natural universe very strange. Consider the following items:

- "You cannot create food out of nothing" is a fundamental law of magic, despite "food" being a concept that is relative to humanity.

- An abstract human concept like a job position has enough magical reality to be the target of a curse.

- It would appear that transfiguring objects into other objects with a similar name (beetles into buttons, for example) is easier than other transfigurations (since it is used as a simple first step before moving onto other more difficult transfigurations).

- Wizards never seem to run out or run low on magic.

On top of the above, if magic is energy, then you quickly run into absurdities with regards to the quantity of it that wizards have. The problem is that wizards can create matter (transfiguration can increase a thing's mass, and transfiguration creates real physical matter). By the famous equation E = m . c^{2} this means that wizards have access to an /absurd/ amount of energy. To put it in context, a single Aguamenti Charm - something wizards can cast effortlessly - would involve more energy than the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated. And wizards can cast spells like this end to end without apparently ever feeling tired or beginning to run out of magic.

So yeah. For these reasons I think it is generally superior to consider magic in HP as a purely supernatural force which follows its own rules.
