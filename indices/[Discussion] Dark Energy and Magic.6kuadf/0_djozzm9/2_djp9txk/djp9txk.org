- "You cannot create food out of nothing" I subscribe to the fanon that transfiguration is not permanent, and does not necessarily replicate all chemical and physical properties of target substance. You /can/ transfigure food, it will just kill you when it reverts. I understand Alchemy to be use of magic to rearrange matter on chemical or nuclear levels. Alchemic spells exist for food, kinda, you target, say, a bowl of gravy, and rearrange molecules in the air into random molecules in target. Is high-level magic, because if you mess up your concentration, and target wrong thing, you can poison yourself. Also, creating physical structures on the macro-molecular but still very tiny level is not a thing yet figured out. So you could replicate a a nice turkey dinner, if you're willing to drink random turkey slurry. This also takes a lot of energy, so unless you can tap a source other than yourself, this does not work for feeding you.
- For most magic to work, I already am presupposing that casting a spell involves making a... small and perhaps non-sentient spinoff your mind, that actively carries your intent out. The entire purpose of runes is to lock down this intent or maintain that copy for as long as possible. Sacrificial rituals in which a living thing is killed, its soul extracted, and enslaved to carry the will of the caster also might work.
- I understood that as being of similar mass and appearance, and even similar materials and physical properties. Needle into matchstick does not fit that theory - there too, it is similar mass and shape, so they only need to focus on two things - physical properties and details of shape.
- We see them getting tired, but in canon is indistinguishable from 'tired from waving my arms and running around all day'. Perhaps something like Inheritance's magic system, where you cast from the same energy source you run the mundane stuff on...
- Also, all the places where major casting happens are also places that are, well, very magical, so one would expect a high ambient magic level (Hogwarts, forbidden forest, Ministry of Magic. Only exception perhaps is Little Hangleton, and that was very short).
- I assume conjuration is transfiguration of air, and is difficult because of massive disparity in mass between a volume of air at sea level and the thing you are conjuring, and that there is not a morphing visualization you can use. Aguamenti is thus just transfigured air, and is dangerous to use, unless it is actually a summoning charm that summons nearby water and sprays it from wandtip. In this case, at Hogwarts it is drawn from the lake, and by the lake of the Inferi (after Dumbledore drinks the potion) summoned from the lake. The charm summons exactly water, so it is then an excellent way to obtain uncontaminated water. If used far from a source of water, you only have atmospheric water vapor to draw upon, and you then need insane power levels because of how large a volume of air you have to draw upon to get decent amounts of water, and then condense it, so the energy requirement shoots up.
- So, I prefer that magic energy source is either the body itself, or draw it from some alternate dimension with some kind of channeling cost or constraint. Otherwise, there's no reason I can't keep cast such a big Augamenti that there's so much water that it collapses into an unstable hypergiant that immediately goes supernova. That or transfigure a large volume of antimatter. It doesn't take that much to end life on earth. Every 11-year-old with even a basic science fiction novel background and a wand a walking doomsday weapon.
