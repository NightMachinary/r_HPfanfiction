  For most magic to work, I already am presupposing that casting a spell involves making a... small and perhaps non-sentient spinoff your mind, that actively carries your intent out.

Harry casts Sectumsempra sucessfully at Malfoy without knowing what it does (HBP). How does this fit in your magical system?

  where you cast from the same energy source you run the mundane stuff on...

Sure, except [[https://youtu.be/59iG_xo1eu0?t=76][this scene]] where a few wizards literally repair an entire city by lifting tons of steel. The Inheritance system doesn't really support that.

  In this case, at Hogwarts it is drawn from the lake, and by the lake of the Inferi (after Dumbledore drinks the potion) summoned from the lake.
#+end_quote

The whole point was that you *need* to use the lake water, and Aguamenti wouldn't work, because the water vanishes in the goblet.

#+begin_quote
  “Aguamenti!” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.\\
  The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips --- but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.

  “But I had some --- wait --- Aguamenti!” said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore's mouth, the water vanished again.

  “Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. “Aguamenti --- Aguamenti --- AGUAMENTI!”

  “Sir --- here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore's face.

  The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore's breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so ...

  He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.

So there seems to be a fundamental difference between the conjured water from Aguamenti and the lake water.

  I assume conjuration is transfiguration of air

And vanishing is transfiguration to air?

#+begin_quote
  That or transfigure a large volume of antimatter.
#+end_quote

Who says that you can do that? Maybe you need to know what you're transfiguring into, and that is why no such transfiguration exists. Or, perhaps everyone who discovered such a spell did try it with a "small" amount first.
