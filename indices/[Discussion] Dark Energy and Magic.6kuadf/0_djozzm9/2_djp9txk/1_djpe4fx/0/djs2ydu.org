  So there seems to be a fundamental difference between the conjured water from Aguamenti and the lake water.

Indeed. Maybe Aguamenti water is conjured and thus different from "real" water for magical purposes... but it could also be theorized that the potion and lake-water were specifically enchanted by Voldemort so that only the latter could counteract the former, in which case even "real" bottled water a would-be-thief might have had on them coming in would not have saved them (which would have been a loophole in the protections otherwise). This might have been achieved by putting some additional component in the water, which ABZB's mechanics for Aguamenti would counteract, since it would only summon the H20 and not the additional component.
