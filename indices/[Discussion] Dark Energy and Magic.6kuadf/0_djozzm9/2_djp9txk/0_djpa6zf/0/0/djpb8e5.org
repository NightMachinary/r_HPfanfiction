Canon is a lot less vague about many things than a lot of people think. It's just that most people aren't very familiar with canon.

  I subscribe to the fanon that transfiguration is not permanent

Contradicted by the Dursleys needing to get Dudley's pig tail removed surgically, wizards believing it is possible that Quintapeds were created by transfiguration, something which happened hundreds of years ago, and by logical deduction from what we do know for sure about transfiguration:

1. We know that transfiguration changes a thing's physical makeup at the most fundamental level (see below).

2. We know that in the absence of magical intervention, physical things do not spontaneously change into other physical things.

Conclusion 1. Transfiguration does not need to continuously maintain itself, because once the transfiguration is performed, there is no reason for it to revert unless fresh magic comes into play.

Conclusion 2. Transfiguration is permanent unless actively reversed.

Contradicted by the definition of spell types, as well as direct word of god.

The entire definition of transfiguration (in contrast to Charms) is that it /does/ alter a thing at its most fundamental level, whereas a Charm merely modifies a thing's properties:

#+begin_quote
  Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.”
#+end_quote

And word of god further backs this up by saying that transfiguration alters things at the molecular level:

#+begin_quote
  With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.”
#+end_quote

Another:

#+begin_quote
  I assume conjuration is transfiguration of air
#+end_quote

Contradicted by the description given by McGonagall in OotP - conjuration is the opposite of vanishing - in combination with the description of vanishing in DH - vanishing sends things into non-being. So conjuration is making things out of non-being, not the transfiguration of air.

So yeah. Like I say, fine for fanon, but definitely not canon.
