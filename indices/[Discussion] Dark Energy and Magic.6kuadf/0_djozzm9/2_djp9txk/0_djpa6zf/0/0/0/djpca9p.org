I generally ignore any WOG that touches on laws of physics in any way, or involves math in any way, unless said author has at least a bachelor's degree in a sufficiently relevant field.

Any such WOG or statement by a character in-universe is assumed to be a statement of what that character or author-avatar thinks is the case, and is not taken as actual in-universe fact.

For that matter, for my own work, I first construct a reasonably consistent set of rules for magic and its interaction with physics, by working backwards from my story parameters, then working forwards saying "if this is the case, then why is that not the case?" and repeating until major holes are removed.

Then as construct the societies of the world, I consider, given the laws, what conjectures would seem reasonable, what areas would be hard to play in, what rules of thumb look hard and fast, modelling from development of engineering and mathematical principles from rules of thumb and random guesses (i.e. Ancient-era elemental 'theories') that sounded good and explained what they saw more or less well enough without actually being right, identifying interesting areas that could be missed for protagonists to perhaps find, or even not.

To claim that one knows everything about one's universe, especially when one lacks the scientific and mathematical background to understand the implications of what one is saying is the very height of hubris, and tears at the greatness of the work.

For God's sake, it's not even science fiction. Just shrug and say it's still a mystery. Is that so hard??
