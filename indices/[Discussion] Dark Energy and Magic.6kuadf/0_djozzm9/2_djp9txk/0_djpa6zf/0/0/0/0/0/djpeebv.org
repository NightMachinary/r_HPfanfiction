I don't think you understand. This is how I read /every/ book.

I freely admit that I discriminate against non-science and math people. /shrug/ That said, I'm not saying they can't. Just that they should stick to handwaving and not try to define things in terms they don't understand. For the same reason that it is generally not recommended to use words that one does not well know the meaning of.

I am arguing for my right to this interpretation of canon being at least as valid as yours. It's just like law systems, in a way. There is a text, and then there are various ways of reading that text. As long as it's self-consistent within the language, you're basically ok. No interpretation that satisfies that is wrong, at most you have multiple valid and mutually exclusive interpretations.

I much prefer the formulation I presented due to my hobby for building laws of physics for fantasy worlds that I read.

If you prefer to hold the HP canon world in your mind differently, that's your right... and mine. Although, of course, it is quite fun to debate as we have so here done. :)
