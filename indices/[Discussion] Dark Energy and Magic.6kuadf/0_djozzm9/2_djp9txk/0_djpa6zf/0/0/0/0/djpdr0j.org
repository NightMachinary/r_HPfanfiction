  I generally ignore any WOG that touches on laws of physics in any way, or involves math in any way, unless said author has at least a bachelor's degree in a sufficiently relevant field.

Yeah, but then this whole discussion is completely and utterly irrelevant in relation to Harry Potter. I'm sorry, but you can define your fanon as you want, and no one will argue with that. However, if we want to discuss magic in relation to Harry Potter /canon/ we have no choice than to pay attention to the text and the author.

  For God's sake, it's not even science fiction. Just shrug and say it's still a mystery. Is that so hard??

Taure has written a relatively popular document detailing how the magic in the potterverse might work, and it is a interesting topic in my opinion. HP is the most read work of modern literature, and analyzing how it portrays magic and its limits is in my opinion something rather interesting.

  To claim that one knows everything about one's universe, especially when one lacks the scientific and mathematical background to understand the implications of what one is saying is the very height of hubris, and tears at the greatness of the work.

Why? Why would you limit fantasy and creativity like that? Your claim basically amounts to: "If you don't understand physics you don't have the right to use your imagination to build a universe as you see fit".

#+begin_quote
  For that matter, for my own work, I first construct a reasonably consistent set of rules for magic and its interaction with physics, by working backwards from my story parameters, then working forwards saying "if this is the case, then why is that not the case?" and repeating until major holes are removed.

And it's great that this works for you. But to build your world differently is fine too, and that's what we are discussing here - a world build by such an author.

You made claims that make no sense in this system by the author, yet you insist that your system is somehow 'correct'. And yes, you do that:

#+begin_quote
  It nevers says no. It just never says yes, either
#+end_quote

No, canon literally says no. And somehow you see the need to argue on, because your system is better and canon is wrong?

I just don't see your argument, sorry.
