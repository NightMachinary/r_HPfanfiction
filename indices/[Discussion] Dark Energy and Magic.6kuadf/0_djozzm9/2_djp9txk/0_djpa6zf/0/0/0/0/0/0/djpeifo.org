  I am arguing for my right to this interpretation of canon being at least as valid as yours.

Sure! But in terms of this discussion it's unhelpful, especially when you say it's canon.

  I much prefer the formulation I presented due to my hobby for building laws of physics for fantasy worlds that I read.

I do the same, but I like the challenge of actually including everything I read, and not selectively picking it. When Rowling says that transfiguration is permanent, isn't it a greater challenge to define your system so it works with that?\\
Your way is the Easy-mode. :)

Edit:

For example, citation of my (unfinished) magic wiki for my own fanfics:

  A spell is such a fundamental alteration of reality. The easiest example is funnily enough the "Avada Kedavra"-Curse. Whatever (living something) it hits will just be /dead/ afterwards. It doesn't stop the heart, it doesn't fry your brain, and it doesn't snap the connection of your soul. It just makes you dead.

  As less dark example, the "Wingardium Leviosa"-Spell makes a thing fly. It is not defined in how counteracts gravity or makes an object lighter, no: It just makes the object fly. If it has to overcome a magnetic field or gravity doesn't make a difference - which ideed makes wizards all the more confused about magnets.

  The Reparo-Spell is a very interesting spell, as 'repaired' is a fundamentally subjective thing. Think a set of Lego bricks. Build a plane, drop it. Build a boat, drop it. Cast reparo. What will the result be?\\
  Buy a lego-set of a car, never assemble it, and cast reparo on the parts. What will the result be now?\\
  A real car with a broken headlight is parked. You drop a huge rock on it, and then levitate it away. If you cast /reparo/ on the car, it will repaired afterwards. But will the headlight work as well now?

  Indeed, a lot of maigcal theory taught at Hogwarts focuses on problems such as this. The answer to all of these is "It depends". This is also where "intent" comes in, but intent isn't the only thing that decides what happenes in the above examples.
