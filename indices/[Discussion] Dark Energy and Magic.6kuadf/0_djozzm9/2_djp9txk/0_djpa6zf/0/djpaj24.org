It nevers says /no/. It just never says yes, either. And for God's sake, why does anyone ever assume that what someone wrote in some book 500 years ago is actually the case? I mean "Can't transfigure food" could be a statement of impossibility or "Don't do this. It ends very badly."

For that matter, considering we're talking teenagers, including Ronald Weasley, Crabbe, and Goyle, I'd think it even prudent to outright lie to them rather than have certain people decide "screw the rules, I'm hungry now" and end up having random molecules in their cells turning into wood, or air, several hours later. Sounds like a very painful way to die.
