Your post makes a lot of assumptions. The biggest being that even if magic is a 'because I say so force'/'cheat code to the universe' rather than some unknown energy, it is still a part of the workings of the nature just from the fact that it exists and can be described, and with study can be understood. Even if what is observed is downright weird that doesn't make it 'not nature,' just look at quantum mechanics for instance.

The biggest problem I see with the latter explanation as it implies some very disturbing things about the nature of reality. Like living in the Matrix type of disturbing. Not that that's a fundamentally impossible proposition, it's just not an interpretation I think fits the Harry Potter universe's style and themes.

On the other hand, there are problems with your big problems. The biggest one being that we don't really know a whole lot about how magic actually works in the Harry Potter universe. Despite the setting being a school for magic, we see very little of what is actually being taught as the series focuses on Harry's adventures rather than his studies.

To start with we don't even know where magic comes from. Weather it com from inside each wizard or if they channel it from their surroundings or somewhere in between is completely unknown.

As for wizards not getting magically tired, we really don't have good data on this either as there isn't much to go on as far as instances of wizards using lots of magic in a short span of time along with the related aftermath. Most instances of magic use in the series are either relatively short or behind the scenes. We don't even really get so much as a training montage.

On to your more specific examples:

#+begin_quote
  "You cannot create food out of nothing" is a fundamental law of magic, despite "food" being a concept that is relative to humanity.
#+end_quote

We don't really know enough about how conjuring and transfiguration works to know if this is a hard limit or a soft limit. By which I mean is anything one may consider food completely unable to be produced, or could you create a cheeseburger for example but some other factor involved prevents it from providing nutrition or just makes it a really bad idea. If the case may be that conjured objects are just magical constructs it stands to reason that they would not function as a source of nutrition and if not all transfiguration are permanent then eating a transfigured cheeseburger would be an exceedingly bad idea. That's more than enough reason to teach eleven-year-olds 'you cannot do this.'

#+begin_quote
  An abstract human concept like a job position has enough magical reality to be the target of a curse.
#+end_quote

Nobody really knows how that particular curse functions, nor the Taboo which is somewhat related. It's not clear weather the idea is cursed or if there's some sort of area effect magic that detects 'The Defense Professor' and makes enough bad thing happen to them (like an inverse liquid luck) that they get dismissed.

#+begin_quote
  It would appear that transfiguring objects into other objects with a similar name (beetles into buttons, for example) is easier than other transfigurations (since it is used as a simple first step before moving onto other more difficult transfigurations).
#+end_quote

I frankly have no idea where you got that conclusion from. The way I see that lesson is that a) wizards are whimsical enough to just do that for no actual reason, b) its a matter of relative complexity where starting out making one simple object into another (matchstick to needle) then a more complex object into a simple one (beetle to button) and so on while using superficially similar objects (hedgehog and pincushion) to make it easier is a logical lesson progression.
