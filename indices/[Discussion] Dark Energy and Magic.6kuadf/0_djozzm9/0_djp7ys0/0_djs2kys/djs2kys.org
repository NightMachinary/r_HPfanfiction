Yes to practically everything you said. In the case of the "no food" rule, my theory is that most transfiguration makes up random matter that, while stable, only /resembles/ the caster's idea of what the end product should look and feel like. Only someone with an intimate knowledge of exactly what food is made of, down to the elementary particles, would get an edible result; just imagining the shape and consistency of a cheeseburger, and the taste of one, might result in a totally poisonous result. This is the same as how Conjured and Transfigured animals, in spite of behaving like real ones, are presumably not really "alive" and feeling (I dare hope so, anyway; it'd be just /disturbing/ if Hogwarts' curriculum required fourteen-years-old to Vanish - aka, kill - actual live kittens as mandatory schoolwork) /
