How? Making the universe expand faster is presumably something large, large amounts of magic could do (it summons energy in defiance of the laws of thermodynamics, so scale isn't a problme, and it even has expanding charms as part of the standard spell lore). And we don't know what else Dark Energy could do other than expanding the universe, because we only know of it through the fact that it expands the universe --- so nothing about what we know of it is "inconsistent" with HP magic.
