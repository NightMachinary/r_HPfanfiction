Ha, that's clever. Dark energy is supposedly a property of space, so it is everywhere. Perhaps magic is what happens when humans with the gift to channel this energy use that gift.

It does seem to deminish the mystery of it somewhat, but on the other hand, the only thing scientists even "know" about dark energy is that something's needed to explain the expansion of space and they just gave it that name. They haven't even come close to understanding it, they haven't even really discovered it, they just inferred that /something/ needed to be there within the current models.
