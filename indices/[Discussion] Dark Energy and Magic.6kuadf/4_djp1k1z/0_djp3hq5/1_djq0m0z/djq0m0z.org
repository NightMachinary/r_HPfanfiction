Found it! And it's not too bad. It's a Tony is Harry's father story. The science/magic explanations are good. One of the things that irks me about Avengers crossovers is when an electronic more complicated than a toaster is touched by a magical person and it gets fried, but in the latest update of this story, that phenomenon is explained in a way that's more satisfactory than any other story like this has done. My biggest problem with the story is the grammar, but this latest chapter was better. Also, there's some Dumbledore bashing and Indie!Harry, but all things considered it's been pretty light. There is Genius!Harry, but considering Tony is his dad, it doesn't feel forced.

As for the reason you started this thread, magic as dark matter is explained and we see electricity being converted into magic/dark matter, although the how isn't really explained.
