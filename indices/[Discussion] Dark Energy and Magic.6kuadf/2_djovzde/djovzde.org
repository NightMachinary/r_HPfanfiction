I've actually been considering that for my worldbuilding for my fic.

Basically:

Q.Why do humans have mundanes and wizards, and every other species is either entirely magical or entirely mundane?

A.Really, (almost) every species is split like that. Many species have an extreme phenotype split.

Q. Since magic is so great, why is it not the case that every species is entirely magical, having outcompeted the mundanes?

A. Magic can neither be created nor destroyed (either it is a property of matter-energy, or magic is just a form of it, and thus falls under the matter-energy conservation law). The amount of magic available on Earth waxes and wanes, to the degree that most magical biologies either cannot function at all without sufficient ambient magic (i.e. dragon too heavy to fly, boggart cannot scare away predators, dementor not cause catatonia in prey) or they end up spending a ton of energy and biomass on structures that are useless without magic (i.e. dragon's wings are useless). Epigenetic regulation switches on and off magic-organelle-producing genes, based on stresses in environment and level of ambient magic in youth.

If dark energy or dark matter /are/ the ambient magic of my AU, then low-magic times are times when we are passing through an area where one or the other is less dense. However, then the magic should be interacting with itself and other matter via whatever force magic interacts with, and every observation we have IRL implies quite strongly that they only interact via gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force. So I need to construct either a very good reason for the ambient magic matter-energy to not interact outside of the presence of life, somehow, OR try to justify a universe that looks like ours, but dark matter and dark energy do have unexplained interactions, and since both of those things have MAJOR effects on the entire history of the entire universe (which is how we know that something is there at all in the first place)... That is not an easy task!

And the wizarding world(s) that I generally assume/construct have far too few people or understanding to even know about this, much less show up and obliviate and wipe computers.
