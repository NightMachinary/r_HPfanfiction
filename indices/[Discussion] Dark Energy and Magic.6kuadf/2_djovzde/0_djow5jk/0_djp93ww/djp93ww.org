Indeed.

I'm also building a small chart of what 'innate magics' given species have. Humans innate magics (which are the ones they can use wandlessly) are teleportation (Harry to top of school building in book 1), general reinforcement and repair of body (metamorphmagi, harry's hair regrowth, Neville bouncing), telekinesis (TMR), mind magics (legilimency and occlumency, multiple sources). Note that telekinesis can do many other things (create mundane fire by heating wood by rubbing its particles together, for example).

There are specific organelles or regenerable soft tissue structures per magic-thing. Whatever fundamental form of magic is is shaped like a protein by those structures. Evolution of magical abilities is just like evolution of proteins and enzymes.

Wands work by allowing wizard to push their magic into a thing that lets them shape custom proteins. Incantations are actually a biofeedback method to pump out the right magical monomers. Wand movements are to facilitate proper placement of monomers and fold the magic properly. With practice, both can be replaced by using one's own will (i.e. telekinesis) to manipulate the monomers directly as you spit them out of your wand.

Thus, wandless magic is extremely useful but inherently limited in scope.

The natural magical abilities of humans make sense, because our ancestors were Persistence Hunters [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting]]. Teleportation fits with that perfectly. Mind magics arose from complex social competition for mates, growing hand in hand with evolution of intelligence. Telekinesis... not sure how to place that, but if only homo sapiens developed it.... that may be why we're the only member of our species left. it's that amazing a power.

I would expect the magical versions of our closest relatives (orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, etc.) to exhibit similar or related magics, produced in similar ways.

The increased intelligence of 'familiar' species /might/ be from mind or soul links to their wizard, OR perhaps magic is somehow... friendly towards higher intelligence. Humanity is special in that our non-magicals are also as sentient and intelligent as our magicals... which would explain, actually, why in a world where there are other sapients who are our physical superiors and also have magic, humanity seems to have driven everyone else into near-extinction or hiding...
