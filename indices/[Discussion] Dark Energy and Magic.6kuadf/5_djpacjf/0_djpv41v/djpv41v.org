Nonono. It's a purely fanon concept that wizards and witches have "magical cores" and a power level and that kind of thing. And let's not bring Wicca into this, /please/. Rowling has gone on record saying there are no Wiccas at Hogwarts, she was so annoyed at people comparing her magic system to Wicca beliefs. In canon, "magic" is its own entity, an independant force that wizards (and other creatures) can control.
