  Salem School for Witches pretty much proves my point that Wicca and HPWizards can co-exist.

And here's why you should pay some attention to Word of God. Salem /Institute/ for Witches (it's Institute, not School) is actually /not/ a school, but a feminist institute, as Rowling revealed. The American school of witchcraft is Ilvermorny, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Salem Witches Trials (about which, incidentally, it's stated in some additional materials that they convicted more muggles than witches, as the true witches just Apparated away before their trial) or Wicca beliefs.
