Most people accept Word of God, though, even on Twitter. That's where she revealed that Anthony Goldstein is Jewish, for instance, or confirmed that the love potion had nothing to do with Voldemort's sociopathy. Also, the way she sets apart Wiccans makes me think the emphasis is very much intentional, to stress "Wiccans at Hogwarts make no sense".

Of course, your argument that Wiccans may coexist outside of the wizarding community is still valid and could be the premise of a fic... but it does invalidate your initial point, which was, as you'll recall, that how power works in Wiccan belief was a good indication for how it might work in the /Harry Potter/ universe.
