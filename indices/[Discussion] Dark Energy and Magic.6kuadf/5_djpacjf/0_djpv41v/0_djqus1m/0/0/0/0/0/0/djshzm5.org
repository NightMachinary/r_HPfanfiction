  Salem Institute for Witches (it's Institute, not School) is actually not a school, but a as Rowling revealed.

Once again, you don't know what a synonym is. It's semantics, School and Institute can be both given to a place of learning. Just because a school has pedagogy in its name doesn't not mean its a school.

  feminist institute,

Odd use of the word seeing as how Feminism is supposed to be equality between genders and this school only has female students. Therefore, calling it a sexist Institute would be more fitting :/

  nothing whatsoever to do with the Salem Witches Trials

Wicca is pretty prevalent in North America and England. The idea that not a single person that practices it got into Hogwarts is absurd. Do you want to know where Wicca is most common in America? Salem.

Edit: Still waiting for the disproval that Magic isn't internal and flows through a Wizard's being. What I used to get my point across no longer matters, as canon states so as well.
