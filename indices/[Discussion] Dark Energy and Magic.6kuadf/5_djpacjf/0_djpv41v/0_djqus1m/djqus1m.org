  It's a purely fanon concept that wizards and witches have "magical cores" and a power level and that kind of thing.
#+end_quote

No, it isn't. Fantastic Beasts claims that Magical is an internal thing within Wizards that can be suppressed. If it was an outside force, there'd be no reason why you can't just have the whole population be Wizards, or why being a Squib is a thing. Magic isn't simply something Wizards channel, that is a fanon concept.

  Rowling has gone on record saying there are no Wiccas at Hogwarts, she was so annoyed at people comparing her magic system to Wicca beliefs.

No, she's gone on record saying that she isn't a Wicca or Satan worshiper, etc ... She has never said that there are no people that practice Wicca at Hogwarts, as that's an idiotic thing to say, especially in a moderately large population like the Wizarding World's (10% of the Muggle populace is still large).

Comparing Magical Cores to simply saying that Wizards have Magic flowing through their body that they can both create and deplete if overused is not the same.
