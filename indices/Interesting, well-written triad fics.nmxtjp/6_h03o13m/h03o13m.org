There's the Triplicity series on AO3 by idleside - they're an amazing author. It's Harry/Daphne/Pansy, and is so good. It has the Lord Potter-Black Wizengamot trope, but Harry genuinely faces problems rather than breezing through life. Each character is well-developed, and it is pretty clear that the three all complement each other, and are in a good relationship as well.
