  This AU takes place in a world like Mary Potter, but where Eileen Prince left Tobias Snape and threw herself on the mercy of her family before moving to the continent and taking young Severus with her. Lily, James, and Sirius had a triad relationship for a while, and due to an unfortunate lapse of control on Beltane 1979, Lily ended up pregnant by both of them. Fraternal twins Victoria Anne (Potter-Black) Evans and James Henry (Black-Potter) Evans were born in early February of 1980. The prophecy Dumbledore received from Trelawney was not, in fact, anything to do with a boy born in July, but instead spoke of a 'great hero of wizards' who would be 'forced to yield in order to triumph.' It was not overheard by anyone. Dumbledore fulfilled it himself by appealing to the ICW to resolve the problems in Magical Britain when the Order finally sustained too many losses to keep going in the spring of 1982.
