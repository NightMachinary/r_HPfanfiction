  Padma Patil never meant to fall in love with a dragon. When she joined the Romanian Dragon Reserve after Hogwarts to train as a dragon Healer, she finds herself slowly enthralled by the handsome, kind dragonologist Charlie Weasley.But when Draco Malfoy, still broken and in pain following the war, also joins the reserve as a trainee dragon handler, things between Charlie and Padma start to change.Padma Patil certainly never meant to fall in love with two dragons...
