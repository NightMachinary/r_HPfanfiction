I humbly offer my new snoppymione fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31573067/][Drowning in Secrets and Lies]], complete in 6 chapters. It's a little bit /different/ than anything I've read from others, not least because Poppy is almost always a one-dimensional afterthought in fanfic, and I've put her center stage for 2 of the 6 chapters. When you say "believable" that's something other readers have said repeatedly about Chapter 1, and then after that it's going to be a matter of whether you like Hermione as someone ruthless enough to learn all of Snape's tricks for her own purposes, and also how you feel about a little "magic made me do it" trope. There's stuff /about/ sex but no explicit smut. The triad is developed slowly with an implied HEA. One of my beta readers said this fic is "set to be a really powerful story about triads and a really cool take on snape" so there's that :)
