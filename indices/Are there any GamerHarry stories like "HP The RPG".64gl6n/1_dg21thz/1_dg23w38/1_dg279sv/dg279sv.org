I just read this about a week ago and I would totally recommend it. It's very light on the HP content, but I watched the first five or so episodes of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (which it's crossed with) and, okay, gave up and read a summary of the plot on the KHR wiki, and found the whole fic really fun and easy to follow.
