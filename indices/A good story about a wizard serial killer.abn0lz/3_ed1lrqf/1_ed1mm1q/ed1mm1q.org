Ya. You can do all sorts of crazy stuff! Imagine a wizard/witch with a huge knowledge about the human body. What if there's a scene where (s)he transfigured organs while the victim was still alive. Like, bam, now your appendix is a hamster.

It would be so fucked up!

What if their serial killer's MO was ex-death eaters? Or people who specialized in the dark arts? What if the serial killer tracked down bad guys, ritualistically killed them, then turned their baddies into inferi? What if the killer was a necromancer trying to innovate the field of necromancy?

What if this serial killer was the main character anti-hero and Harry Potter himself was hunting him down?

I. Need. This. Story.

(Credit for the animal part goes half to my BF, he said snake intestines, but I think hamster appendix would be worse)
