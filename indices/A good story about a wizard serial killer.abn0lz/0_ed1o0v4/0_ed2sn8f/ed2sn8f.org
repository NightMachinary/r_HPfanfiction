Thanks! I would say that a common (and fair) criticism of my story is that there's not a huge amount of magic used - it's your standard police procedural with a bit of magic thrown in, so it might not fit OP's request. The sequel is far more magical in it's crime, but isn't finished yet (not long to go though).
