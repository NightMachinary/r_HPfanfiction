I'm not arguing the points because I'm not going to go joke by joke and explain to someone who clearly doesn't think it's funny that it actually is. That's not how comedy works. But let me put it this way: if the only bits of comedy allowed to be funny were ones that were pure as crystalline snow, comedy wouldn't exist.
