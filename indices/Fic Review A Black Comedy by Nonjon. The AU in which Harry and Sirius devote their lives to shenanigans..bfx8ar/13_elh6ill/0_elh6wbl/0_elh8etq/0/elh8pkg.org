Sure. If you don't take something too seriously, you can ignore quite a lot in favor of appreciating the better qualities something has. I don't think saying that "'A Black Comedy' has a lot of good qualities," would be an incorrect statement, either.

At the same time, though, I don't think this review was a condemnation of the people who enjoy the fic, nor even necessarily a condemnation of the author (though, mentioning his assumed age, race and gender to make a point was certainly toeing the line).

The fic gets recommended a /lot/, even by myself at one point, and no one ever mentions the negative aspects which are /readily/ apparent. Sure, some people say they dislike it because of its low-brow humor, but this is the first review I've ever seen which brings to light its blatant homophobia, transphobia and ableism (I've never voiced it, but that scene where Harry turns people into midgets as a punishment really made me uncomfortable).

Perhaps you like the fic; But notice that your comment is stating that you shouldn't take it too seriously, not that OP's review is /wrong/. On some level, I think you must agree - or at least you notice and can't argue the points which were well made.
