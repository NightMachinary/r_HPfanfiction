Very impressive review and analysis! I am surprised that you were able to read through the fic despite not liking so many things about it.

It only took me a few chapters to realize that I absolutely could not stand either the humour or the main characters. I am sure that Nonjon is a decent writer from the looks of it, but his writing style and characters are just not for me. I am still baffled by how much praise and recommendations this fic gets though.
