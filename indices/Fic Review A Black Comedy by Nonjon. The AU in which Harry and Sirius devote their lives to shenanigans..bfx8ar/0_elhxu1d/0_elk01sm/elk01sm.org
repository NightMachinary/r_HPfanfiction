I agree with you there. The author shows himself to be very capable of developing and executing a cohesive plot with a good mystery (I did not predict the outcome at all), and those are all pretty good reason for enjoying the fic.

Honestly, there were just too many dick jokes to get them all. I considered mentioning the After Dark Mark but the review was already far too long :)
