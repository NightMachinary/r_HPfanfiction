I don't fit into two of those categories, but I consider /A Black Comedy/ one of my favorite fics.

Tastes in comedy vary.

I typically don't enjoy sexist/sexual humor (Jim Jefferies springs to mind as an example that's not to my taste), but this fic takes its jokes so far beyond the edge of absurdity that (to me) it seems to swing back around the other side into making fun of itself and the existence of sexist stereotypes in general.

I read it as a satyrical parody of some of the most common stereotypes in male escapist fiction (and fanfiction). This interpretation fit for me due to a lot of small moments in the fic that OP chose to ignore/gloss over. For example, I thought it was great that in the final chapter Harry and Sirius end up with realistic negative consequences for their careless promiscuity. It's like the author was building the reader's assumption of Sirius and Harry as sex gods (a la male fantasy), but all the ridiculous morning-after scenes were actually just wind up to drive home the parody.

  I didn't realize how many objectionable things there were in the fic until this post laid them all out.

I will say this for OP, their post is an extremely thorough and concise list of things that might offend people who have things that offend them.
