Oddly enough, I've never enjoyed Anchorman. Will Ferrel's particular brand of comedy just doesn't hit me in the funny bone.

Thank you for sparking an interesting discussion! I've enjoyed seeing people's different ideas on either side, and the civility throughout this thread has been a pleasant surprise.
