I'll certainly grant a few things here. I did not provide anywhere near as much detail as I could have in this review, largely because I thought the word count was already too long, and it's true that I did not want to skim over the parts that I found problematic. I did want to write as well about some of the jokes that I did find funny, and that some of the jokes early on in the piece made me initially enjoy it more than Seventh Horcrux. I probably also could have discussed the plot in more depth, the ways in which the author limited Harry in order to not make him a Gary Stu, or the very genuine attempts to develop a meaningful relationship between Harry and Lily.

I guess it goes without saying that I didn't think it was a satire of sexist stereotypes. I think there were elements of that, but largely it was more of a wink and carry on with the fantasy sort of thing. I found Anchorman to be more in the spirit of satiring sexist stereotypes. Goes to show how much a reading can vary. Thank you for your comments.
