  I will say that the comedy here is written for and by straight white men and those are probably the only people who will find this story amazing

Pretty much sums it up. If you're a fan of 80s/90s frathouse comedies or find the current climate of political correctness too sensitive, you will likely enjoy the fic, because it's engaging if you don't get distracted by the implicit views of the story. Otherwise you may find it too offensive to hold your interest.

I will say though, as a straight white male, I didn't realize how many objectionable things there were in the fic until this post laid them all out. Probably says a lot about the implict biases I hold or at least how easy it is for me to ignore attitudes that don't directly affect me :(
