For clarity, you're not required to flair a post. Not that I'd /recommend/ not doing so (they help draw attention to your post in the sea of unflaired ones), just that the only rule regarding it is that posts should be flaired accordingly. In this case, we unfortunately don't have a flair for "Reviews" (which we really should, and might encourage awesome posts like this, in the future).
