That's... odd. I've never had that problem (I've sometimes forgotten to flair, and come back to do it later), and if you look through the subreddit, you'll clearly see plenty of posts which never get flaired.

But, anyways, no, not at all. Your points were well made and I agreed with most of them. If I disagreed, I wouldn't have made a post stating so - your review is valid regardless of whether or not I agree, and I try to avoid (pointless) confrontation where possible.

Though, I may have posted that comment, anyways, because we /really do/ need a "Review" flair, so I can see why you may have taken it that way.
