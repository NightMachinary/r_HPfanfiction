Alright. Wow. So this is a thing now, okay.

​

A) This fic was written 12 years ago, god forbid that it's not as WOKE and Progressive as you are in Current Year+5

​

B) "Harry Potter has a 90s attitude toward women".....dude, Harry grew /up/ in the 80s-90s... While I will give you its very American, that doesn't seem to be the focus of your complaint.

​

C) It. Is. A. Comedy. You ever been to a comedy show? I mean like a real one. Not that sanitized shit they have these days. And yes, I've laughed my ass off at all sorts of racial jokes, esp ones about my own race. Why? Because they are /funny/. I know, I know, humor is a depleted resource these days. Don't worry, I don't hold it against you. Much.

D) >Phobia
