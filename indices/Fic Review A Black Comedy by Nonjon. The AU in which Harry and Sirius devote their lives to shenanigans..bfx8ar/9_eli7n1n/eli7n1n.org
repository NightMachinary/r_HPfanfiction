I agree with everything that you said, but as a very brown very Indian guy, I must say that I loved the fic. I didn't know lots of little references in the story, so that may be a reason why I don't care much for a house elf with a lisp, I just thought nonjon created a humorous OC and moved on.

A lot of times the humour was punching down, and I don't care much so long as It's funny.

I do understand that my opinions may have differed if I did grow up as an underprivileged minority, but there you go.
