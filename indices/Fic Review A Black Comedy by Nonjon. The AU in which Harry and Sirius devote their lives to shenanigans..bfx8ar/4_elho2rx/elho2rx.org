I wasn't going to respond, I don't see the point of stirring these particular Hornet's nests but...

  This author seems to have a very problematic view of slavery. And by that I mean he seems to be totally fine with it. Harry winces when Sirius tells him what he's done to the elf but says nothing. Whilst house elf magic plays something of a role in the story and the mechanics of the magic are interesting, no one in this universe has any problem with house elves being slaves, including Harry.

I've seen this kind of argument popping up more and more recently, mostly in YA fiction circles. But how does this work? Harry, a fictional character, isn't speaking up in the story therefor the author is okay with slavery?

  Even James and Lily have a house elf named Nappy, and she is one of the most problematic elements of the fic. There's no getting around it - Nappy is written as a Black American slave. This insidious, perhaps even unconscious association that slaves = black people is the reason why I'm pretty certain the author is white.

I've always interpreted this as the author drawing a parallel between the situation of house elves and slavery in America. Your conclusion seems more based on your own bias than the story itself, but it has been a while since I've read it, so I could be wrong. Have you tried asking the author how he or she meant this? It would have been the decent thing to do, when insinuating someone is racist.
