I agree with you. I assumed the point of Nappy was to show that the elves are slaves; and are treated as such. The author probably only was exposed to examples of slavery that fit that bit. The stereotypical Hollywood black slave.

This piece goes down weird alleyways while rubbing its nose, but it's also not a spotlight into how white people are unconsciously feeling guilty of owning slaves in the past like the rest of the world.

A Black Comedy is the quintessential 'dudebro fic' and I think that was the whole point. Like the author pointed out, Harry/Sirius end up sleeping their way through Britain while also supporting a Tom Riddle horcrux that is only alive being it killed Neville Longbottom.

Come on. Why would people take this fic at all seriously? Everything about everything that happens in it is dialed up to 10.
