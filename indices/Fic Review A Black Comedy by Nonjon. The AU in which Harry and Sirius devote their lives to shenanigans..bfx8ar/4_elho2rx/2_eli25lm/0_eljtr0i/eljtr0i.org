Here's the thing. A Black Comedy is not absurdist humour. Seventh Horcrux is, but it's a very different kind of story. There are certainly absurdist elements to it, such as labeling the vigilante "That Fucker", the connections between the women Harry & Sirius sleep with, and probably the entire adventure in Africa, but Nonjon isn't writing a purely absurdist fic. He also goes to great lengths to rationalise how Harry and Sirius got into an alternate universe in the first place. He details immaculately how they're able to break into Death Eater mansions, and how Harry's "magical arms" work. He writes the characters of James, Lily and Dumbledore quite realistically. None of that is absurdist.

  I agree with you. I assumed the point of Nappy was to show that the elves are slaves; and are treated as such.

House elves are extremely well-known to be slaves. You don't need to put a black slave's voice onto one to establish their position in the world. And the author's reference points for slavery in the media could not be limited to black slavery, since they have also read books 1-6, which detail their accents, limitations and other characteristics pretty clearly.
