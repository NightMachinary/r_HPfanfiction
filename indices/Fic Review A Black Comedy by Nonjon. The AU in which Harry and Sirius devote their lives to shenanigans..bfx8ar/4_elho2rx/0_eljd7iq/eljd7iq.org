  I've always interpreted this as the author drawing a parallel between the situation of house elves and slavery in America.

My impression is that the joke wasn't "House Elves = slaves" but rather, "Wizards = slave apologists"

The explicit depiction of Nappy as a 'happy' Black slave (a la the absurd claims of George Fitzhugh and his pre-Civil War contemporaries) is designed to make the readers uncomfortable, so they might reconsider the way 'good' Wizards in the books ignored the issue and the way Hermione's obsession with SPHEW was played for laughs in canon.

Thus the joke isn't "haha slavery" but rather "haha, on second thought canon/fanon was seriously F'ed up."
