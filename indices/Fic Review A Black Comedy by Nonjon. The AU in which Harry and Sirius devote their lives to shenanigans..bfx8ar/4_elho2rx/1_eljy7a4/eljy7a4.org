  Harry, a fictional character, isn't speaking up in the story therefor the author is okay with slavery?

A very common trend in fanfiction and in YA literature is to have the main character of the story enact some kind of self-insert or wish fulfillment of the author. There are a number of indicators which point towards Harry in A Black Comedy being one of these examples.

Ginny being a ghost anchored to Harry just so that Harry can repeatedly express his distaste of her is one indicator. There is no real reason to have her in the story aside from showing a shipping preference. Another is Harry's particular criticisms of the way parliament is run, since these scenes only seem to exist in order to show "Harry's" opinions on the ministry and the Wizengamot, and don't have any bearing on the plot or the heists either. Parodies are after all often designed to point out things the author thought was silly about the original.

The fact that Harry is very over-powered compared to the other characters is almost a universal indicator of wish-fulfillment.

When we take this into account, it's not unreasonable to assume that what Harry and/or the narrative excuses, the author is excusing as well. Harry objects to the things he finds morally reprehensible (which admittedly is not a great deal in this story, but it does occur). However he never shows any distaste at all for owning house elves himself or for others owning them.

The accepted attitude towards owning house elves just seems to be "treat them kindly", not "don't enslave them".

  I've always interpreted this as the author drawing a parallel between the situation of house elves and slavery in America. Your conclusion seems more based on your own bias than the story itself, but it has been a while since I've read it, so I could be wrong. Have you tried asking the author how he or she meant this? It would have been the decent thing to do, when insinuating someone is racist.

If you try to equate house elves with black American slaves and don't say boo about slavery in the same story, then yes I see a problem with that. I don't know what the author's intent of the portrayal was, since there were no Author's Notes about the subject in the text. Nonjon may be more accessible to ask this kind of thing directly to than say, J.K Rowling, but the fact is that it's an author's responsibility to write a story which stands on its own and portrays what the author intended to portray.
