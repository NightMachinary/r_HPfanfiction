The OP clearly finds it objectionable to their morals. That is the definition I am working off of. You, clearly, do not agree and would prefer to define strictly held characteristics that a work must meet to be qualified as morally objectionable. Moreover, you seem to believe that even if a person personally finds a work morally objectionable even if the work isn't objectionable by whatever "objective" circumstances you would prefer to define, that's not enough reason for them not to like the work.

If I am still mischaracterising you, then let me ask a simple yes or no question. Can a person reasonably dislike something if they find it personally offensive? Given your initial post in this thread, in which you immediately started attacking the epistemological foundations of the OP's opinions, I would guess your answer would be no. If I'm mistaken and the answer is yes, I don't see why you'd be so personally offended by someone stating their opinion.

I don't understand what your last paragraph has to do with my position, which you have either misunderstood or are mischaracterising. Regardless, you have accused me of arguing in bad faith, so I'm afraid there's nothing more to be gained from having this conversation.
