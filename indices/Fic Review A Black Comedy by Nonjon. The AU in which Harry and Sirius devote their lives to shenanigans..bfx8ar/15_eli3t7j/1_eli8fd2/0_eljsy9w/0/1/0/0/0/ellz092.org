Glossing over your complete misunderstanding (or more likely, deliberate mischaracterisation) of my posts...

As should be clear from the comment chain, whether the work is in fact morally objectionable is precisely the matter in dispute (and indeed whether /any/ humour can be morally objectionable).

Just because one person says something is morally objectionable, it doesn't make it so. Moral arguments must be justified like any other.

Your position (which I have assumed to be a form of trolling given the low effort nature of your posts) is patently circular. Comments like "Why don't you dislike this racist work?", "Why don't you dislike this morally objectionable work?" presuppose that the work is racist/morally objectionable. But that is the very thing that is being argued. You are assuming your own conclusion.
