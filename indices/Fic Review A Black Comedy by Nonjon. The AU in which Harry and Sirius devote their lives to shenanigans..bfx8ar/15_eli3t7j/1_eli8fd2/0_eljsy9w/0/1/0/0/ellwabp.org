It really doesn't. Why do you personally care about other people not liking a fanfic because it expresses certain views? All I see in that post is a claim that the author of this review is using ad hominem, that group-based racism isn't valid to criticise because certain members of those groups are very successful, and that humor should be enjoyed completely divorced of context. None of these logically lead up to your implication that people shouldn't dislike a work because they find it morally objectionable.
