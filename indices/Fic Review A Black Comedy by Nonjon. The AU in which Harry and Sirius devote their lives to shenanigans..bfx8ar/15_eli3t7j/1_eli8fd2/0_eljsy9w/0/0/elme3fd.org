*1. Bad Epistemology*

My opinion differs from yours here in that yes I do believe that the person speaking can have relevance to what is being said. However, when you're talking about humour done in an anonymous space, it must stand on its own as you've said, since no one can know for sure who the author is. With nuance, punching down can be relative, but not in this context.

The content of the fic punches down at homosexuals and trans people for example, but not straight or cisgendered people. I assume that the author is likely to be straight and cisgendered because a person of that description is much more likely to punch down at homosexuals and trans people than someone belonging to either of those groups. I make assumptions about who the author is by the groups they punch down at and who they omit, but regardless of the identity of the author, the humour still punches down.

  But those pragmatic reasons do not mean that you have gained some kind of truth by treating individuals as a group. By moving from an individual-level analysis to a group-level analysis, you have lost information, not gained it.
#+end_quote

Being absolutist is just as limiting for gaining information as being too generalist is. You lose information if you reject any kind of group participation in favour of only examining people on an individual basis. Information on society doesn't function on a person by person basis. Firstly that isn't pragmatic as you've said, but it also prevents us from seeing the forest for the trees. Taking a census for example loses all meaning if any kind of group assumption is invalid. We may as well do away with the whole field of statistics, since the hardline thinking you're going on says that if there's even one exception to a trend then the rest of the data is invalid.

  The problem with redefining "racism" to be linked to historical power structures is that it results in ambiguities.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you're accusing me of redefining racism to suit my purposes or if you're expressing that the definition has been changed, but the Oxford dictionary defines it as this:

#+begin_quote
  "Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."
#+end_quote

Ideas of superiority or inferiority almost invariably lead to race-based victimisation. The two are intrinsically linked, so it's not disingenuous to assert that racism implies oppression. The only instance I can think of where you could separate the two and call it "skin-colourism" might be the way certain Albino African kids get hunted down for body parts based on a superstition that those body parts are magical, but that situation is much more the exception than the rule.

How can you claim that there are meaningful ways of discussing the links between inequality and power structures if you also dismiss the idea of inequality in a group context?

*3. Humour*

Sure, truth is not a requisite for comedy, and comedians are not always going to be making comedy about their values or truths. I think your appreciation for comedians based on their execution rather than their content is valid, but I don't think that renders their content immune to criticism.

What is the aim of their jokes? Obviously to make people laugh, but what are they laughing at? For you, the way Nappy was written was a deliberately subversive joke aimed at fanfiction writers who don't make a clear connection between house elves and real world slavery.

But in order to know if that was the intent behind the joke you would have to be aware of the author's opinions about those fanfiction writers, since the author doesn't allude to that connection in any clear way, nor does he leave any disclaimers about it in the author's notes. If you believe that the author and authorial intent is irrelevant and content must be judged on its own merits, then a reading of Nappy as a racist stereotype is much more valid than a reading which requires information most readers will not have in order to verify.
