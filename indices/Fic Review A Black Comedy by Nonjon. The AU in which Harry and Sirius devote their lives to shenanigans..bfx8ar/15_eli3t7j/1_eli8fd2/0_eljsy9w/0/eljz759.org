*1. Bad Epistemology*

In your review you mention the author's identity several times, even if only to speculate about it, so clearly you do consider it relevant in some way.

The way in which you consider the author's identity to be relevant is actually somewhat obvious: you cannot know if a person is punching up or down unless you know the author's identity.

*2. Isms*

Yes, I am wholesale wiping away the "validity of group oppression". A group is nothing more than a collection of individuals, and treating them as a group is nothing more than a generalisation.

Treating individuals as a group rather than as individuals is only done for pragmatic reasons e.g. when you have insufficient resources to treat each individual on their own merits. So for example, in affirmative action, treating any black applicant to a university as underprivileged is done because the university does not have the resources to investigate every individual's actual circumstances to determine whether they are in fact privileged or not.

But those pragmatic reasons do not mean that you have gained some kind of truth by treating individuals as a group. By moving from an individual-level analysis to a group-level analysis, you have lost information, not gained it.

If individual X shares a superficial characteristic with a group of oppressed individuals, but individual X is in fact not oppressed, then the group-level analysis is simply incorrect. That is the danger of generalisations.

A person either enjoys a privileged position in society or they don't. Whether a person is oppressed or not is a matter of fact.

They can't have their cake and eat it too. If a working class person becomes a billionaire, they can't turn around and act as if they are a member of an oppressed class. Beyonce's daughter doesn't get to look down from her ivory tower and declare that the colour of her skin makes her the member of an oppressed class.

The members of an oppressed class are only those individuals who are in fact oppressed.

As for the stuff about rewriting the meaning of racism to be based on historical power structures rather than being any position which ascribes characteristics to individuals on the basis of race - this is well-covered ground. Suffice it to say that it is simply the latest example of racism, this time dressed in the clothes of opposing racism.

To be clear, the point here is not a semantic one. There are meaningful ways in which one can speak about historical power structures and the classes of oppressed individuals within those power structures. There are meaningful ways in which one can speak about how those power structures are causally linked to today's inequalities.

The problem with redefining "racism" to be linked to historical power structures is that it results in ambiguities. When you have one word for two different things, you can create the impression that those different things are in fact the same. It would be simpler if two different words were used: say, "skin colourism" to describe treating individuals on the basis of their skin colour, and "historical victimism" to describe treating individuals on the basis of their membership of a historically oppressed class.

The problem is that when historical victimism leads to a person advocating a skin colourist approach to societal interactions, that skin colourism is disguised behind the fact that they've used the word "racism" to describe the position they oppose. And, of course, the same for sexism etc.

*3. Humour*

You've missed my point somewhat, here. My point is not that that comedians cannot refer to facts in their content. My point is that the truth is not really relevant to whether it is comedic or not.

A comedian who stands around declaring truths isn't really a comedian. The comedian's talent is /cleverness/. They have to describe the truth in a way that is novel and appeals in some way to the audience's sense of humour, whatever that may be. Crucially, the audience doesn't have to agree with the comedian, because what they are appreciating is the comedian's cleverness, not his ability to state true facts.

Even where the comedy is based around, say, stating shocking truths, the comedian's job is not to reveal truths that were previously unknown. They use known truths as the raw materials to show off their cleverness. Anyone can state a shocking truth. Only certain people have the ability to deliver that statement in a way that makes people laugh. And here's the funny thing: an individual without that talent could repeat the comedian's joke word for word and no one would laugh. Comedy is all about the delivery.

Probably my favourite comedian in the world is Bill Burr, whose views I mostly disagree with. If he was running for political office I would vote against him. But I appreciate his comedy because it's funny, even if I disagree with the content of 50% of what he says.

His views as stated in his comedy, at least. Because for all I know, he's just playing a character and in his private life he's the complete opposite. There are plenty of comedians who do that, after all. Because their actual identity doesn't matter to their comedy. What matters is the joke.

So, to take the house elf joke as an example, to appreciate the joke, you don't have to hold the view that house elf slavery is justifiable or that it isn't justifiable. The "truth" of the matter is irrelevant to the joke. All you need to get the joke is knowledge of the references implicitly made by it. When you come away from the joke, you are not supposed to be thinking "that's true!", you're meant to be thinking "that's funny!".
