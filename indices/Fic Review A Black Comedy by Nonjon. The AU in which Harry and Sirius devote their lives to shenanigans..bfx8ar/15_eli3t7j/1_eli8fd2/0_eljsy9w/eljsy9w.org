*1. Bad epistemology*

#+begin_quote
  This is the belief that the content of what a statement says should be judged based on the identity of the speaker rather than on the objective merits of that content.
#+end_quote

I do not know the personal details on Nonjon, and I have said as much. I have judged his fanfiction as it stands upon having opened and read it without any previous context about who Nonjon is. I have not judged his content by his identity, rather I have inferred information about his identity through his content. The things I have inferred about him could be incorrect, I acknowledge that, but regardless I would stand by the comments I have made about his content. If Nonjon is a woman, that would not make (her) comments about women in the fic not sexist.

*2. -Isms disguised as anti-isms.*

I have to say I'm impressed at your lengthy justification to essentially call me a racist for pointing out racist writing. That's some turnaround.

#+begin_quote
  To generate the hierarchy, you are categorising people by group characteristics like race, gender, etc. and creating rules based on those characteristics about what things people can and can't say to each other
#+end_quote

For one thing, whilst it's flattering that you think I can generate the hierarchies you described, what's considered racist and sexist has long since existed outside of my humble opinion, and has much more to do with historical and demonstrable oppression between different groups. I'm not going to spend the entirety of this reply explaining what those are, since you don't have to take my word for it in any case and I'm fairly certain you don't exist in such a vacuum that you are unaware that they exist either.

Your example about Beyonce's daughter is also misleading - you're wholesale wiping away the validity of group oppression by pointing to individuals who either represent exceptions or have succeeded in spite of oppression. I could just as easily invalidate the struggles of the working class man by pointing to the ones who made it rich. I don't, because the existence of exceptions does not disprove rules in a social context.

Whilst it's true that Beyonce's daughter's wealth sets her privilege above that of the working class white man, her skin colour does not. If you were to make a joke at the expense of Beyonce's daughter based on her skin colour, or for example if you were to talk to her in the accent Nappy uses in this fic, absolutely that would still be punch-down humour. If you were to make a joke at her expense because of her wealth and publicity, that would be punching up. Context matters.

If you argue that there is a moral problem in ascribing characteristics to a group and creating rules about those characteristics, then there is a moral problem in the way Nonjon creates humour, since he does the same thing; creating rules about what men (etc) are required to do or say in order to be men.

I /do/ believe that an individual's characteristics should speak for them. The issue with oppression and hierarchies is that they remove or reduce a person's ability to be seen as the individual they are, which is why calling out racism or sexism is not a method of 'boxing' the people affected by the joke so much as it is calling out the person using a joke to 'box' them. You are being intellectually dishonest by claiming that I am the one creating the hierarchies and oppression by pointing them out.

*3. Misunderstanding the nature of humour.*

#+begin_quote
  A joke is not reality.

  Firstly, humour has nothing to do with truth. When a comedian tells a funny anecdote, do you think it actually happened? Of course not.

  Secondly, humour has nothing to do with values.
#+end_quote

Are you serious? Humour has /loads/ to do with the truth. Do you think satires like Who Is America have nothing to do with reality? Or that the way Blazing Saddles subverted racism in the 70s had nothing to do with values? Do you think that the things that make you laugh exist in a vacuum of all the things you've experienced in your life? Are you likely to laugh at a particular soccer club's in-joke if you're not part of the club? Of course not. The jokes have to be relatable on some level or else they aren't funny.

A comedian's anecdote isn't supposed to be a literal surface truth, or 100% true, but they are telling something which is at least related to a truth we understand. Sometimes comedians are pointing out uncomfortable or shocking truths with their anecdotes. Sometimes they're making a point about society through sarcasm and irony. Sometimes a parody will illustrate the ridiculousness of something we've taken too seriously. Whilst not required on all counts, comedy's greatest benefit is in how is holds up a mirror to our lives, and that cannot be divorced from reality. There are certainly exceptions in terms of relatability being the punchline, but A Black Comedy doesn't fall under one of those categories.

When I combine this point with your final follow up about how you interpreted Nappy's racial identity, you run into a conundrum. Is Nappy a subversive fanon meta inclusion designed to make us rethink our dissociated attitude towards house elves? Or does humour have absolutely nothing to do with truth or values?
