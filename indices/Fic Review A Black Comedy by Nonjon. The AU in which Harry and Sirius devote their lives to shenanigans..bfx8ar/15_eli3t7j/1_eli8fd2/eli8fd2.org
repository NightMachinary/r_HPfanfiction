Engaging more seriously with the topic of the review, I think there are three main conceptual problems at play in the OP. Those conceptual problems will not be unfamiliar to most internet users, as they are propagated by certain online communities as well as finding a home within US university campuses.

The three problems are:

*1. Bad epistemology*

This is the belief that the content of what a statement says should be judged based on the identity of the speaker rather than on the objective merits of that content. This is philosophically unjustifiable. It is most obviously intellectually bankrupt with respect to truth propositions ("X is Y"), but it has equally little rational grounding in value propositions ("X" should be "Y"). Both truth and values must be justified rationally; any other basis for deciding these things is by definition irrational.

*2. -Isms disguised as anti-isms.*

The distinction between punching up and punching down has two problems: one rational, and one moral.

On the rational front, being able to punch up and down of course requires a hierarchy of who can say what to whom. Not only does this fall foul of the first problem (bad epistemology), it has an additional intellectual hurdle to cross, which is that the hierarchy is made up of /categories/ of people ranked by "privilege". So, for example, black people can make jokes about white people, but not vice versa.

The intellectual problem with this is that it ascribes characteristics to individuals on the basis of membership of a group, but those characteristics may in fact be entirely false. As an extreme example to show the problem, take Beyonce's daughter. She's black and a girl - two groups we are to understand fall somewhere lower down on the hierarchy, so that their members have the right to "punch up" against, say, white men, who cannot "punch down". But the proposition that Beyonce's daughter is unprivileged compared to some working class male in Alabama is laughable. She's one of the most privileged individuals in the history of the human race.

Ultimately, membership of a group can at best provide a generalisation to which there are many exceptions. The only rational basis to treat individuals is on the basis of that individual's actual characteristics and situation, not by assuming that because they are a member of X group, they must be Y.

By now the moral problem with this "philosophy" should also be obvious. To generate the hierarchy, you are categorising people by group characteristics like race, gender, etc. and creating rules based on those characteristics about what things people can and can't say to each other (in the sense of being able to speak with legitimacy, not in the sense of being able to speak at all, which I don't think anyone has suggested... yet). You are literally creating a racist, sexist order in pursuit of the elimination of racism and sexism.

The typical response to this criticism is "but our racism is /justified!/". So racists have always said.

*3. Misunderstanding the nature of humour.*

A joke is not reality.

Firstly, humour has nothing to do with truth. When a comedian tells a funny anecdote, do you think it actually happened? Of course not. At the very least it has been distorted and exaggerated, but most likely it's completely fabricated. We all engage in the game of pretending it's true, comedian and audience together, because it's funnier if it has the veneer of authenticity.

Secondly, humour has nothing to do with values. Do these people think those who make holocaust jokes think the holocaust was okay? Of course not. Telling a joke does not mean you endorse any particular view. Professionally offended people consistently fail to understand the difference between a joke and reality.

Now, this doesn't mean a person has to enjoy Black Comedy. Personally I think it's just too crackish. But to say there is some kind of moral problem with the fic (or any form of humour) has poor intellectual foundations.

The House-Elf speaking in a stereotypical "black" manner was actually one of the few decent jokes in the fic. It's not funny because "haha black people speak funny". If you thought that was the joke, you missed it. Rather, this scene is a comment on the HP fanfiction meta: namely, the widespread way in which certain people talk about House-Elf slavery as if it has no factual or moral distinguishing features from real life historical slavery of humans. By giving the House Elf an exaggerated voice associated with a stereotype of black America, nonjon is poking fun at those people by making their linking of the two explicit.
