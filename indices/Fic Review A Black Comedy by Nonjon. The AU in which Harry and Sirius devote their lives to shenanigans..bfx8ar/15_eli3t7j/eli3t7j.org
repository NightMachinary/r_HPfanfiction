TL;DR: This fic is offensive to me and I'm offended that you're not as offended as I am! I was not, however, so offended that I couldn't finish this story.

Seriously though, if you hated this story so much why did you finish it? It's not like there's a lack of Harry Potter fanfiction. Clearly you just wanted to get noticed by reviewing/bashing/ranting about one of the most popular and most recommended stories in this subreddit. Do you have valid points? Yes, but like my mother always told me: If you don't like it, don't watch/read/etc it.
