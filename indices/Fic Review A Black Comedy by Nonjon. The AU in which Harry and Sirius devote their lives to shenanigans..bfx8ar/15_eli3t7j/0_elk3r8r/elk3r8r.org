Your comment is just an endorsement of avoiding critical discussion. I read the fic expressly for the purposes of reviewing it, because someone asked me to. I like reviewing fics, and the ones I enjoy reading are not above criticism either. You've even said I have valid points, so why are you attacking me for writing them? You are welcome to criticise any points you disagree with.

Your TL:DR is only partly right, by the way. I am offended by the fic. I am not offended by your lack of offense.
