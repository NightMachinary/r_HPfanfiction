- Ginny is a 16-year-old ghost from the original universe who is anchored to Harry. Despite Harry being repulsed by her she believes she is his soulmate. Apart from occasional quips and one instance of exposition, there doesn't appear to be any reason for her existence in this fanfic, beyond perhaps establishing the author's distaste for the Hinny pairing.

It's funny. Nonjon is/was a DLP author, and back when this story was written, they were vehemently anti-Ginny, Nonjon included. So it's always amused me that this is really the one part that is my least favorite part of the entire fic. There really is no point to it.

I will say that the whole "aging well" argument is kinda overdone. I first read the story 10+ years ago, and I've read it this year, and my enjoyment of it is pretty much the same. It was absurd back then, and it still is now. All the things I dislike about it, I still dislike. And all the things I like, I still like. Though obviously the humor gets less effecting the amount of times you've been exposed to it, but that's to be expected.
