I always assumed that ghost-Ginny was less about panning the Hinny pairing and more about making fun of the soul bond trope which is so common in romance fics in this fandom. After all, alternate universe Ginny gets plenty of moments to shine, so ghost-Ginny's place in the story can't be explained by the author just having a hate-on for the character.
