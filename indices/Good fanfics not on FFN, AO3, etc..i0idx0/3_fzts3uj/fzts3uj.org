How do you feel about crossovers? Diane Castle has written quite an interesting series that starts with Hermione visiting a bunch of other universes (Buffy, Stargate, Alex Mack, etc) to gather The League of Extraordinary Women for a team-up against a multiversal threat. Then the other books in the series follow up on each of the team members afterward, and what they do with the things they learned (eg checking on the local analogues of their team mates).

Of particular relevance is book 4, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which is a prequel and can stand alone quite well (I read it before any of the rest). It's the local Hermione Granger in the Alex Mack universe. Instead of learning magic, Hermione is sent to "Harworts", which trains the next generation of counter-intelligence agents under Headmaster Dumont Appledore. Canon more or less happens, but with everything being reimagined as James Bond style advanced technology, eg Lord Deathstrike has hidden highly experimental point-in-time copies of his memories, in hopes that if he's ever killed, his followers will be able to clone him. And all the students are more sneaky and cunning than canon, naturally enough.

The largest book in the series focuses on Alex herself, and is the only really substantial Alex Mack fanfic I've been able to find (FFN has a very short list, most of them incomplete and none over 40k words).

Books 6 and 7 are still in progress and actively updating.
