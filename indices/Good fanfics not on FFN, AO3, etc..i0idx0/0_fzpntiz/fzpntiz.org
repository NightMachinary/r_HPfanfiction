Try Spacebattle

There's a couple of interesting (but usually incomplete) SI fics there that I have read and like

Search by the tag Harry Potter or just do a google search with “spacebattle Harry Potter”

A couple of them subverts things by having the SI expecting canon only to see things subtly or dramatically change in comparison to canon

There was one where they started to realize with horror that the magic system was radically different from canon and that they shouldn't rely too much on their canon knowledge
