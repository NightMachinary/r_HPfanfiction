Not really. Heck, he names one of his kids after Snape. Don't get me wrong. I love Snape's character. His personality on the other hand? Is a huge no. Some people have a difficult time thinking character and personality are different. You can like someone who is awful, as long as you realize that person was awful.

He wasn't even really angry at Snape, at least not as much as he was at Dumbledore when his magic went crazy and exploded things in Dumbledore's office. (If memory serves, that was after Dumbledore told him the Prophecy).

Also, they're asking for fanfics, not canon. If we wanted to read canon we would. I don't get comments like this, they aren't helpful.
