Apologies, I should have clarified more. I meant just after Trelawny tells Harry about this and how angry he was. I agree with all the rest, just in terms of Harry's reaction canon does it well. I am not a fan on Snape either, just to clarify.

And my bad, on second thoughts this wasn't helpful at all.
