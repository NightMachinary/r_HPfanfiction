linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12408440/1/The-Aftermath]]; You poked a dragon; Honour thy blood)

the aftermath isn;t the best written fic but it fits the request, 'you poked a dragon' is a wip and the updates have fairly large gaps in between but i definitely recommend checking it out.

Honour thy blood doesn;t have him finding out what snape did but he is fairly ruthless in his treatment of snape so should scratch the snape getting his just desserts itch
