But in the books he initially only tried to save Lily, and even if he tried to save them he still was complicit in their deaths...and he doesn't fully renounce it to dumbledore...he makes it clear it's about Lily. There's no big, sweeping moment where he goes "this is horrific, I'm guilty, x" Like it's good Snape semi reformed, but Harry literally is like "let's give the former nazi a cookie even tho he had a role in his parents death"

Like I said, plot armor/JK had a complex about being bullied, imo, that Harry seems more bothered by Snape being bullied & having a shitty childhood than Snape literally joining the magic nazis and being complicit in his parents death.
