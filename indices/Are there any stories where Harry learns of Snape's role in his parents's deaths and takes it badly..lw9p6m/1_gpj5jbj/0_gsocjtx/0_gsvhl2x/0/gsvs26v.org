You're asking him to be whitewashed. It is bad that he doesn't care about the loves of most others at this point, but that is what the redemption is about. It's remarkable that he even cares for Lily Potter at this point of time. They havent been friends for years. And yet he still cares enough to risk his life ('Dont kill me') to warn Dumbledore just because they had been friends once. He has a narrow view at this point. He's only mostly interested in the lives of his immediate circle, not of the general world. Pretty understandable, looking at his backstory.

  There's no big, sweeping moment where he goes "this is horrific, I'm guilty, x"

If you meant later, there is. 'only those I could not save' implies he takes responsibility for every life lost in the war he couldnt save. That's a bpretty sweeping statement. That is backed up by many of his actions, of course, including saving Lupin, a man he utterly hates, when he was specifically told not to risk his cover by Dumbledore. That's a lot of development from the guy who, mostly wanted the protection of the people he cared for.

  Like it's good Snape semi reformed, but Harry literally is like "let's give the former nazi a cookie even tho he had a role in his parents death"
#+end_quote

He was fully reformed. The only thing that he's guilty of is being a dickbag teacher, but that's not what Harry praises about him. Harry honors him because Snape was brave, because he took huge risks in the first and second war to save lives, and because he overcame his circumstances to become good because he clung on to the goodness of his love for lily by giving 'Anything' in return of keeping her safe, even when he was at his lowest. At his lowest, Snape performed the greatest act of protection that saved Harry.

Was he complicit in their deaths? Barely. He delivered a prophecy, that could or could not be interpreted to mean a child. Voldemort decided that this was a child. He decided to deal with it by killing the child and his parents. Snape's role ended the moment he went to Dumbledore and granted the potters increased protection at unlimited cost, which would have been impenetrable if not for Peter's betrayal.

In the end, harry doesnt consider him complicit in his parents death, because he isn't. He tried to save them to the best of his ability. He honors him for the hero he was, not the misguided boy he had been.
