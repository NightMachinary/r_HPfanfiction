I'm not sure that I've ever actually witnessed it as an ongoing plot point. Every time I have encountered it, it is introduced as /backstory/ which Harry is now abandoning.

E.g. in a post-OotP fic, Harry is revealed to have been holding himself back from PS through OotP, but now he is fed up of hiding and will reveal his true power.

I've never seen a fic where Harry /continues/ to hide his talents for the duration of the story. It's generally just a way to give Harry an instant power boost.
