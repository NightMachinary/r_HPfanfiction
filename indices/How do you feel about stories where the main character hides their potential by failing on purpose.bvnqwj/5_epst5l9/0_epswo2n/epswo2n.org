This kind of retconning is the worst. If Harry was secretly a genius who saw through Dumbledore/Weasleys/Hermione's machinations (TM) and hid his power and knowledge to present a certain image, it should still affect his decisions and change the plot. Hiding your powers and trying to lie low by needlessly risking your life time and again is moronic.
