I don't mind it if it's interesting and integral to the plot. There is a difference, though, between people failing “on purpose “ because of abuse/low self esteem (some kid-Harry fics have him failing so as not to show up Dudley), or failing because they have to play dumb.

I don't enjoy it if it's written the way you described it, where the character is downplaying their intelligence because they need to solve a problem but is also arrogant about it
