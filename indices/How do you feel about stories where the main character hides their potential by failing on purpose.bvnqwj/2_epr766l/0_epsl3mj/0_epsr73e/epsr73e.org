I'd love to read about Harry who pretends to be more competent than he is.

"Fools, tremble before my power!" *Waves wand, nothing happens* "Oh, heh, feeling a bit under the weather today. Let's try this again some other time."

Or even Lockhart-esque Harry who milks his fame and successfully scams the wizarding world.
