Yeah, maths teachers need to do a better job of communicating that what the students are learning is a methodology. Being able to solve problem A or problem B isn't the point - demonstrating knowledge of a methodology which can be used to solve /any/ problem is.

It's a similar point with Harry and the potion's book in HBP. The point of Potions class is not to brew potions, it's to develop the skills which allow you to brew /any/ potion. This is why Hermione is right about the book - Harry is not doing himself any favours by blindly following recipe Y rather than recipe X.
