I mean my point is that its lazy af to not bother showing your work. Of course a teacher is going to think you copied if you dont show your work.

Obviously theres no way to tell if someone is copying but if you're not even doing the entirety of the homework instructions then of course youd get in trouble.

It's like, you don't get full points on an essay if you write your hypothesis. You actually have to prove your points and give evidence and show why.
