Are we... having the same conversation? I'm not disagreeing with you at any point. What I'm saying is that wolfram alpha, the software, when you input a calculation, shows how it /reached/ the solution. If you copy /that portion/ as well as the answer, it would be functionally identical to if you had worked it out yourself and had showed your work.
