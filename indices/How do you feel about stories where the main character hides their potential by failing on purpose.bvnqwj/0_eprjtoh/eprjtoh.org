A gifted character even need to be faking it to fail his classes. Irl a lot of geniuses are failing school, and even in canon you've got people like Fred and George.

Just write them not putting efforts in schoolwork and not caring much, it's way more logical than failing tests on purpose and your character can still be smart outside the classroom. And please show us that, don't just tell.
