In theory, there is nothing bad about the idea. But the way you described

#+begin_quote
  but it's just so annoying to read about them getting berated in class while they think a out what a genius they are
#+end_quote

is probably the worst way to handle that idea. Why would you show such a scene? Just have a teachers conference where they say a single line about Harry being a slightly underwhelming student while moving on to the next point and call it a day.
