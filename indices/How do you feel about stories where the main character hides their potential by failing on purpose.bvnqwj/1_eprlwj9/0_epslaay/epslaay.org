Agreed.

It's even more frustrating when the protagonist goes on and on about how they're underestimated and they have the inevitable conversation with someone where someone says something along the lines of, "yeah, well at least I'm not an idiot" and Harry internally replies, 'Oh, ho, you fool! You've fallen for my cleverly crafted persona, you peon of low IQ pickle dust.' while externally all he says is "You'd be surprised."
