I don't recall a fic where Harry develops a potion that put into bubblegum that teaches you a language. There are a couple that feature a language lozenges that you can purchase.

Try Duel by fantasy1290

Linkffn(9041086)

For a goblin story one that I liked but many like to hate is Harry Crow by RobSt where harry is raised by goblins

Linkffn(8186071)

Try The Eighth Time is the Charm by madie080802 where Harry works with the goblins and uses a time chamber

Linkffn(13012483)

Try Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk for another story where Harry works with the goblins.
