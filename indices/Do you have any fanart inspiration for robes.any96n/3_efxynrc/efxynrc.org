There is actually a semi-famous British boarding school which wears almost exactly what I imagine robes to look like. Christ's Hospital students still wear the uniform as created in the Tudor period when the school was founded.

Now what they're wearing is actually a coat and the slit up the front does open, however I imagine that it doesn't. I would further imagine that while there is a standard plain black robe, students from wealthier wizarding families will often have sets of robes in different weights for the seasons.

Dress robes may have a deeper neck cut for women, puffed or 'leg of mutton' sleeves, double sleeves as well as being made out of finer materials and with more intricate patterns on them.
