Exactly.

And while they evidently can be worn over muggle clothes if necessary, it would make a lot of sense that (with a fully closed front) doing so would be uncomfortable for long periods leading to segregated changing, wizards mistaking nightgowns for robes and Snape having no trousers on underneath his robes.

They also seem to have reasonably deep pockets which are pretty invisible in terms of the line of the robe, which would explain where your wand goes if not 'in your bag'.

Plus, as much as I like the robes as drawn in the top post linked here the wide sleeves seem like a really bad idea given how cold Scotland can get. Cold wind under your robes is bad enough but cold wind right up your sleeves.
