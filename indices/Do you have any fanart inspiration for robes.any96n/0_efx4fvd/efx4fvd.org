I like [[http://thereisareaper.tumblr.com/post/132276464879/hogwarts-school-uniform#notes?ref_url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/harry-potter-hogwarts-robes-fan-theory/#_=_][this]] for Hogwarts robes in place of the "school uniform" look in the movie still, and the usual fanon charmed to change colour explanation.

In general (outside of Hogwarts) large voluminous sleeves in a much more apparent individual particular look. And of course we know dress robes, and can assume conservative and modern, and fudge has a semi-muggle look going etc. All with broad ranging differences.
