I never had too much of a problem with the robes because they're not too far off to traditional academic gowns. My uni still uses gowns and aside from the colour they look pretty similar to the movie robes and they're actually surprisingly comfortable, warm and practical for Scotland. I know grown =/= robe but growing up they got blurred in my head when reading the books so I was always happy with them!
