I think I more or less agree with the convention in Fantastic Beasts that robes for adults are basically just tailored topcoats, and IIRC while the movie robes are inaccurate to the books (where the robes seem to be modeled after the long, flowing robes we traditionally associate with wizards), they do invoke a certain sort of nostalgia for people who went to private or boarding schools, and I really dig that. But maybe for a slightly gloomier Hogwarts, something along the lines [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bloodborne/images/3/39/Black_Church_Set_Bloodborne_concept_art.png/revision/latest?cb=20171212021838][Black Church Set]] from Bloodborne could fit, without the hats and adding house colors to the stole to lessen the obvious "this is a horror game" detailing. I realize it's far closer to priest's robes than wizard's robes, but I think it fits the austere look black Hogwarts robes would be going for.
