I have to admit that I really enjoyed this story and read it several times (notwithstanding all the cliches). I love the different kinds of magical systems (thread magic, the runes they carve on themselves) as well as the different races of people like the Chapoyo (or whatever they were called). I also liked how she wrote the elves--menacing and at times indifferent to human survival.

I wish that the author had taken it out of the Harry Potter universe altogether and just made it its own fiction.
