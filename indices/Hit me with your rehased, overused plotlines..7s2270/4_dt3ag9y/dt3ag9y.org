linkffn(Harry Potter and the Uncle of Secrets) has... too many cliches to list, honestly. MoD!Harry goes to different dimension to fix stuff, Theres Dumbledore bashing, I think maybe some mentions of love potioning but I'm not sure, greater!good dumbledore, magical cores, marriage contracts, Lily is a vampire, Hagrid has an... accent... Dumbledore is a goat animagus, wandless magic, evil Dursleys... and more... PS if you haven't realized from this description, its crack.
