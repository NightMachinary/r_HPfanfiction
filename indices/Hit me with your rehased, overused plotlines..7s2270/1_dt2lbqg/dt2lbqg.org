- *Superintelligent Harry: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)* (Some people think Harry is too much of a "smartarse" for them to bear, but if that doesn't bother you, this fic is genuinely great. Be prepared for a lot of AUness, however.)

- *Overpowered Wandless-Magic Harry: linkffn(Core Threads)* (Boy, it does /not/ get any OPer than /Core Threads/. He's literally a god by now, and it's just Second Year. But what makes it not only bearable, but actually very /good/, is that it's always fun and light-hearted. Beyond the very first chapter, despite what the description might make you think, there's not a shred of angst in this, and no true bashing either; the closest you get is that Dumbledore's convoluted plans are made fun of, but not actually argued /against/, let alone presented as evil.)

- *Evil Dumbledore: linkffn(What Was Your Plan?)* (Can't really describe it without ruining the idea. It's a very good one-shot. Read it.)

- *Super-Duper Magical Trunk: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk)* (I'm halfway through reading it, and this fic has a /very/ good "canon flavour" thing going on. Harry is one of the most in-character canon-Harry I've ever seen, for instance. It has a fantastic Umbridge plotline.)

- *Super-Duper Magical Trunk, Honorable Mention: linkffn(Harry Potter and a grandfather's gift)* (Perhaps not quite as well-written as /Dimensional Trunk/. Still very good, although quite archaic in some ways. The Potter grandparents aren't Fleamont and Euphemia, but neither are they Charlus and Dorea. It shares with /Core Threads/ the fact that it has no conflict whatsoever and it's glorious.)

- *Arithmancy As Spellcrafting: linkffn(The Arithmancer)* (Very creative in the spells, and well-written as always with White Squirrel. Some feel it does have a bad case of Stations of Canon, however.)
