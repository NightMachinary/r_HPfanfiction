Harry Crow is possible the most unfulfilling thing I have ever experienced. I kept reading because it continually showed the potential of becoming an interesting story, but at almost every single turn it disappoints with bland shallow characterizations and boring resolutions of all the conflicts.

Then there's these scenes where the author has some girls sexually assaulted but writes it off like it's their fault for being sluts. Considering the whole narrative is about being progressive (or something resembling that) this gives me the impression that he things women deserve to be raped for being sluts, which is just uncomfortable as fuck to read on any day of the week.

Anyway so yeah this fic sucks don't read it.
