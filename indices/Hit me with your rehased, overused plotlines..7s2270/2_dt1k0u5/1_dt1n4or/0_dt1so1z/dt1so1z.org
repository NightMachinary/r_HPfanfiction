~glances at the blurb for that fic~

I just had an idea! What if you took a 'Harry dies, Death isn't happy with him and sends him back' plot and made it so that Harry's destiny was that he was supposed to be EVIL in all caps?

Like, he was supposed to be corrupted by the horcrux in his skull and become a vile super-genius bent on wreaking havoc on the world (Death's boss wants results like the World Wars, dammit!), but between the Dursleys stifling his academic ambitions and the Weasleys being good friends & role models and that dunce Voldemort believing in that prophecy, Harry ended up being a decent person and inadvertently stopping more death and destruction by beating Voldemort? Half of the trouble he wound up in each year being meant to help him snap and turn into a supervillain?
