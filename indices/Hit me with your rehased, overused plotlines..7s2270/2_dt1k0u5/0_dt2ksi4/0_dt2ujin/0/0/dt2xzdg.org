I know I just hate unfinished stories. I realize that fanfic writers have real lives and they write in their spare time for free to entertain the masses, (and hopefully have fun themselves) but when a good story is going great and then all of a sudden stops with no closure I just feel empty :((( yeah triple frown empty.
