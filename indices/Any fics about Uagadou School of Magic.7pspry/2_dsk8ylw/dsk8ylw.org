Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches features Uagadou in the latter half of what's out. There's a "Grey Lord" hailing from Uagadou and some background on the culture there: that they focus on wand less magic, their reaction to Harry very briefly visiting Uagadou, a description of the school itself, etc. Not a whole lot, and not necessarily important to the plot (yet), but an interesting bit of world building for sure
