So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] It's a slashfic which might not be your thing and Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) Apart from that, I still highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

Also additionally a shameless *self-rec* here. linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

Don't know if you're interested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few cliché tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them. Basically his main motivations are to reunite Voldemort's soul and getting Sirius a trial but he doesn't care much for anything else but Death

Harry will end up at some point staying with the Death Eaters.

He kills people, not feeling very guilty about it, though body counts will only start later in the story

*GENERAL DARK!HARRY RECS*

So some of these recs contain classic/cliché tropes and most of them if not all are slashfics, hope you don't mind

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23965102][Cacoethes]] Is a fic I recently finished and found very engaging.Tomarry, Features, Time travel, Slytherin!Harry, Kind of a Horcrux bond between Tom and Harry, Grindelwald as a threat

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] contains technically Harry/Death though it's more a Harrymort fic. Nonetheless it checks all boxes in the dark!Harry department. Features Time Travel, Werewolf!Harry, Dark Harry, Dark creatures The sequel is also really good

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10642821][Love They Haven't Thought of Yet]] Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Defeater of Grindelwald, never received his Hogwarts Letter. Five years later, a 16-year-old Harry Potter is found on the streets of London and immediately sent to Hogwarts, where he catches the eye of one Professor Tom Riddle. When Harry is sorted into Slytherin, well... that just makes things a whole lot easier for him, doesn't it?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589][Evitative]] Classic Dark Harry fic. Drarry. Harry gets resorted and ends up in Slytherin. Features Dark Rituals, Dark magic, Sirius being awesome

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9375371][Avarice]] I honestly don't remember anything abiut this but I've got it bookmarked and it sounds like the classic dark Harry trope. Here the summary: The Wizarding World has never seen a Human Horcrux before, and Lord Voldemort has every intention of using his newest weapon to its fullest effect. Abandoned by those he thought to be his friends shut out by Dumbledore and made the laughing stock of Britain, Harry Potter finds himself considering the offer of the Dark.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037][A dead man's tale]] Very interesting, wish it was longer or had a sequel It is almost a normal Yule winter night when Harry James Potter, 17 year old wizard and future husband of the Dark Lord of Britain finds a portrait of a dead man in one of Hogwarts dark rooms.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5745595][Sleeping somewhere cold]] Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14173404][All your stars]] If this is the fic I think it is, then Voldemort seals the Horcrux into Harry to make him a proper one which forces him to go through some dark changes in his personality. Harry/Tom Riddle | Voldemort

I'm currenly also following some *WIPs*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26949952][Fine Line]] Harry stumbles over the Diadem!Horcrux while he hides the book of the Half-Blood Prince, which possesses him. So basically he's got Tom Riddle (in his 20s) in his head, who of course follows his own agenda but corrupts Harry alongside the way. Eventual Tom Riddle/Harry Potter

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278][If Them's the Rules]] Not quite dark Harry but soo good. Love the worldbuilding and characzerizations. Very on point. WIP Eventual Tomarry

Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15558741][Choices]] Harry Potter's choices have always been restricted to almost nothing. After learning that he is the subject of a prophecy, he wants desperately to be able to choose something for himself - even if he knows it's the wrong choice.
