That would have been a /really/ nice start for a prompt I made a while ago, too.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jh59bz/two_sentence_prompt_on_october_31st_1981_harry/]] This prompt specifically. Minus Lily's sacrifice, your idea fits really well - you could adapt it to be /Harry's/ natural lifespan instead of Lily's, and basically just have that prompt.

... Although I'm not quite sure why you responded in a comment chain rather than making a new root-level comment, but what's done is done.
