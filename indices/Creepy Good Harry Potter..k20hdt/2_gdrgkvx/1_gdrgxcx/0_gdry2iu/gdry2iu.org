I've been kicking around an idea (read: thinking it's a neat idea then never doing anything with it) where Harry gets straight up killed by the first AK, and the Mother's Love magical sacrifice mcguffin just unkills him. He's best described as technically alive- mentally yes, physically about skin deep, as in he has no heartbeat or /measurable/ brain function (that's not going to be relevant until he gets knocked out, though), particular need to breath, eat, or drink, etc. Skin wounds show up but heal bloodlessly in a normal amount of time, and healing magics don't work at all, etc.

Plot twist is the sacrifice set him up to live exactly how long Lily would have had she lived a full life, and he's going to live it no matter what tries to interfere with that because of the magic locking in his life to the unspent time. From there, the plot can be about whatever is needed, though the creepiness comes from Harry being noticeably dead, except for the fact that he's as animated as any normal child/adult/whatever would be.
