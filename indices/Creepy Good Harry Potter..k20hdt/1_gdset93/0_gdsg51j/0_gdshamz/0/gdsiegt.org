Based on the synopsis and with a title like "Hell Eyes" I expected something pretty edgy. What I got instead was an epic adventure in a large, high fantasy world and all that entails.

As another departure from the norm, rather than Harry being the only one from canon in the new world, he just sort of fell in ahead of schedule.

This is in the first chapter, so not really a spoiler, but the portal in question is a rare but well documented phenomenon and the Hogwarts staff were organizing a sort of field trip. Harry goes to check it out alone out of curiosity and gets sucked in.
