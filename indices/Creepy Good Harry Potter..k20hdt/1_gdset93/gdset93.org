linkffn(12754810): Rather than simply being scary, Harry's a literal monster due to a rare involuntary and permanent transformation. Despite spending most of his time in the forbidden forest chilling by himself he's still rather personable, makes friends and learns some magic (albeit in a modified curriculum) once he's discovered. I found it enjoyable and pretty wholesome; there's also no bashing if memory serves.
