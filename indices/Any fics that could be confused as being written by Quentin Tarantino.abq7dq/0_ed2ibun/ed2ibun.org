-"Expecto Royale Ass Patronum With Cheese, Motherf*cker!"

*WHOOSH*

-"Fuck, Harry! You should warn us before using a spell like that, I think you just about popped all of these ni**as right out of existence!"

-"I couldn't resist."

-"Shit, why is there so much blood everywhere, aren't they supposed to be skeletons or something?"

-"I don't know mate, I guess it's just how it is."

-"F*CK!"

-"What's wrong ?"

-"What's wrong?! Just look at my f*cking sneakers man, you've gotten Dementor goo everywhere!"

-"So yeah, it's a little bit of a dirty work..."

-"A little dirty? A little dirty! These go*damned brand spanking new Nike are completely ruined now!"

-"Calm down, for f*ck sake! Why did you even come here dressed to the f*ucking nines, were you expecting to get a date or something?"

-"I dress like I want!"

-"Ooo look, it's me Ronald Weasley, I want to f*ck a Dementor up the a*s !"

-"Shut your f*king mouth!"

-"Look, guys, maybe we can say that the spell was a good idea but, not pointing any fingers, we should all come dressed in old clothes next time."

-"Shut up, Neville!" | "Stay out of this!"

-"BOYS!"

-"..."

-"Can we please go now?"

-"Yeah, sure."

-"Are you blushing, Ron?"

-"Shut up, Harry."
