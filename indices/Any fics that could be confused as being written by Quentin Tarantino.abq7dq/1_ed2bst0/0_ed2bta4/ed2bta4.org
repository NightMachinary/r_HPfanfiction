  The work Harry does is justifiable. It's justice. He works for his country, and his country is a republic---the magical side, anyway. It's not laudable work, it's not work he's proud of, but it's necessary work. Harry has always taken the necessary jobs that no one else has the stomach for.It's just that he's never deciphered a kill sheet and seen Draco Malfoy's name on it.Career Choices: Harry: Hit Wizard; Draco: Anti-Government Extremist Please see the END NOTES for UNTAGGED *SPOILERY* STORY CONTENT WARNING about the ending.
