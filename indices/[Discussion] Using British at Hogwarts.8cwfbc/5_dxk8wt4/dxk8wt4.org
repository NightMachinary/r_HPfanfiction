'Blocks' - Even newly built, specifically designed UK towns are far, far less linear than American towns. You can't just run around the block, because there is no block. Blocks are used to describe flats, as in 'a block of flats'. The older the town, the more likely it is to be wiggly and nonsensical because it's been built and rebuilt and added on to. I did my undergrad in a city which was over 1000 years old.

Forgetting the NHS. I know socialised medicine is scary to Americans but nevertheless, we have it. Although the Dursleys hated Harry, they would not be not taking him to the dentist or the optician because it cost too much. Children under sixteen get everything free. If you're going to say that they chose not to take him to the opticians or dentists, that's fine but give me a reason other than money.

Speaking of, Harry went to *primary school*, not elementary school.
