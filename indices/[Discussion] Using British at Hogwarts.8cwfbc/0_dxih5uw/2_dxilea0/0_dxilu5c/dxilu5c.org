I've heard that proms are getting more and more popular in the last few years. I know they definitely have them in Canada because we were in Vancouver during prom season and there were kids in fancy dress everywhere.

What about other school dances? Here in the US, there are generally two formal events--Winter Formal and Prom--with smaller dances sprinkled around throughout the year. A popular one is Sadie Hawkins where the girls ask the guys out and they dress in ridiculous matching outfits. Oh, I forgot about Homecoming which is another formal situation and a Homecoming King and Queen are elected. I would imagine there's no UK equivalent since Homecoming is usually associated with American Football.
