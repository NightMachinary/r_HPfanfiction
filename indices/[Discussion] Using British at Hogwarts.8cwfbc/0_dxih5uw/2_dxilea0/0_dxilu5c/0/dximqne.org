No, we have nothing like that. Individual schools might hold a dance (actually, during my childhood, we called them discos; don't know if they still do, might be showing my age) for whatever reason, but nothing regular.

Also, now that I think about it, while we don't have graduation, Hogwarts might have Leavers' Day. I don't know what it's like in a state school if they have them, but at my boarding school it was a bit of a big thing. Huge tent on the sports field, headmaster and one or two others would give speeches, special mention given to outstanding pupils. Lunch was served after, and throughout the afternoon parents could visit the buildings to see work displays or clubs performances (small, informal performances, I think; the only one I actually recall was the gymnastics display that I was actually a part of).
