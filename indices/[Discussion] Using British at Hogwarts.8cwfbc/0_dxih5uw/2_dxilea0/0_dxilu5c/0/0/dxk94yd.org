Ahhh primary school discos. Wow, that's a hit of nostalgia I wasn't expecting.

We did have a Leavers Day in my state school. We hung around on the field, cut up jumpers, signed/wrote/drew penises on shirts, went to our tutor groups for the final time, had an assembly and then participated in the school's time honoured tradition of running screaming down the corridors in the middle of the school day to leave early and go home.

Things like the art exhibit (for those doing the art GCSE) or whatever those doing the PE GCSE did happened earlier.
