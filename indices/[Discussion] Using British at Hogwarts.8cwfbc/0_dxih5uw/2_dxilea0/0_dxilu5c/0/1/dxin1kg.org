A Leaver's Day sounds nice! Much more chill than a full-on graduation. It doesn't seem like Hogwarts had anything like that, however. Although I think they did have the leaving feast where like the House Cup winner was announced, but that was more for the whole school rather than the kids leaving school at the end of their seventh years.

I find the differences between UK and US schools endlessly fascinating. A lot of what the US does seems tied to good old American exceptionalism.
