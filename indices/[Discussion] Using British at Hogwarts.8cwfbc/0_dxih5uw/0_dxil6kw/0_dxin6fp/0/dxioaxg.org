When I was in year nine, the leaving sixth formers made a hell of mess of the school grounds shortly before the end of the year (after exams, possibly). It's too long ago for me to recall any details, but I know the school banned later years from having any kind of similar party. (Now I think about it, I'm pretty sure that's the same year group that was rumoured to have one of the sixth form girls sleeping with one of the English teachers.)

Don't recall any fires, but someone did drew a huge penis on the north quad in the snow one winter. The math classrooms were next to it and the female teacher was /furious/.
