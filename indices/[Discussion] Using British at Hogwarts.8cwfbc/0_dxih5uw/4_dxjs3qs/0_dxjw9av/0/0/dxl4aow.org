That's funny about the reunion getting shot down. "Eh, screw those guys! Hated them then, hate them now."

Yearbooks are a huge deal in the US. There are tons of pictures and a lot of kids will join a bunch of clubs just so they can be in as many yearbook photos as possible. I remember some kids would go through and actually count how many pages they appear on. I think all of mine--Sophomore, Junior and Senior--were in excess of 200 pages. Like, heavyweight, nice pages. Most of which are scribbled on in pen and marker by people I don't really even remember, but were SO IMPORTANT almost 30 years ago.

I remember my junior year I was in a bunch of clubs because I was a busybody and the guy I had a massive crush on was a photographer for the yearbook and he took the club photographs. So in that year, my face is frozen in the most ridiculous smile.

I don't even remember what year I took my SATs or what my score was. It must have been my junior year. I do recall that I did better on the language part than the math part.

I'm really loving this glimpse into the UK school life!
