We don't have any of that. We broke for our exams in May, then came back for our leavers assembly and then on the last day, you played hangman and riddles and stuff. We had an 18 page red year book and that was it. No caps, no gowns, you wear your uniform every day until the assembly then you dress 'smartly' and your parents are invited to come. We had some orange juice and chocolate. People then go back to school after and on the actual leaving day, people usually wear their uniform and people write on it like you would a year book.

Ours is split into GCSE (think OWLs) and A Levels (think NEWTs), so I had my year book and leavers do in 03 with GCSE but I went onto sixth form as well (A Levels) so I finished that in '05. Most people rely on A Level grades for university, but I became sick so I didn't start university until '12. That was more like what you're describng. We didn't have a reunion - one was theorised about on facebook and quickly shot down. My mother, who finished school in (I think) in '69 and my dad who finished in '68 (he was held back a year because he couldn't understand the new currency) both had reunions a few years ago, though my mother is northern irish and my dad is from the west country.
