Pretty much everyone goes to sixth form now. There are also sixth forms which focus on more vocational training rather than academic for people who aren't interested in university.

IIRC sixth form is a holdover from the old grammar school system where you took an 11+ exam and from there you might be able to go to a grammar school where years would be called 'forms'. So your class of 11-12 year olds would be 'First Form', going all the way up to 17-18 year olds being in 'Sixth Form'.

Our SATs are nothing like yours and I'm not certain if they even still exist but 15+ years ago I took them as an eleven year old.
