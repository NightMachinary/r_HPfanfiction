School leaving age /used/ to be 16, but I think it's now been raised to eighteen.

Secondary school is 11-16. Sixth form is 16-18 (confusingly for Americans, sixth form can also be referred to as 'college'. University is solely referred to as university or uni)

You do your GCSE's in Secondary School. Your AS and A-levels are done in Sixth Form. Some sixth forms also have facilities to resit your GCSE's if you didn't do very well. Being held back a year or moved up a year is insanely rare.

There's no real university prep. You do need A-levels to get into uni (mostly, exceptions can be made for mature students whose education was completed when there were still O-Levels or who only did GCSE's and then went into work) though but we don't have things like your SATS (/our/ SATS are or were done at age 11 - I'm not sure if they've got rid of them but frankly I don't much care).

If you want to be both authentically British and contemporary, Harry would have been one of the first few year groups to take the SAT in Year 6.

Even our universities don't really do the reunion thing, not that I'm aware of.
