Got it. I'd figured secondary was equal to high school here, but the term "sixth form" was confusing me. So everyone goes on to sixth form? Or is that for kids that are planning on University rather than a trade? I had no idea that SATs were even a thing in the UK.

Thanks so much for answering all of my questions. :D
