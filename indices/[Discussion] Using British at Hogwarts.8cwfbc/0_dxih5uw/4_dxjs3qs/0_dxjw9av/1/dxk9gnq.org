There's also probably some difference when it's a combined secondary and sixth form as opposed to a straight secondary where you go to a separate sixth form.

I went to a state secondary with no sixth form. So when we finished our GSCE's that was pretty much it. We had to come back in a few times after that for Leavers Day and to collect anything we'd left behind. Apart from things like exhibiting the art done by Art GCSE students and possibly something for the PE GCSE students parents didn't come in at all.

All that sort of pomp and circumstance is reserved for university graduations. That's when you have caps and gowns, family watching, going up to shake hands and get your diploma.

Reunions are not a thing for state schools. They /might/ be for public schools or boarding schools but I'll defer to those who actually went to them. As far as I am aware, no state school has any kind of reunion.

Why on earth would I want to see people I went to school with but didn't like again?
