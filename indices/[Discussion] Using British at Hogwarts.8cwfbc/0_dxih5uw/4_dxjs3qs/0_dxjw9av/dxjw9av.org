Oh my goodness, it's a whole big deal. Seniors got out of school a whole week early. I remember taking my senior picture the summer before school started and ordering a whole bunch of wallet sizes to give away to friends. Class rings are a big deal, but I didn't get one. You have to order your cap and gown and there's a whole bunch of other stuff you can order and then when you graduate, you can be a tool and hang your tassel from your car's rear view mirror. Then you have to decide who you're going to walk with for the processional, get enough tickets for your family (my class was huge and the event was held in a local event arena) and then there's the graduation party afterwards with gifts and and and. Ugh.

How long ago did you leave school? And are reunions a thing? I graduated in 1991 and I have yet to go to any of my reunions, though I might go to my 30th (shudder). My dad's 50th is this year and he said for his alma mater's graduation ceremony this year, they're going to have members of his class on the stage. I'm encouraging him to participate because he needs to get out of the house more.
