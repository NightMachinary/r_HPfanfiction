I'm not usually bothered by people using Americanisms in speech unless it's really, really over the top ("Gee mom! I wanna visit with my friends at the mall!" sort of stuff). Everyone picks things up from TV or the movies, and from their friends. Harry might not have been watching those but others certainly would have been and he could have picked things up that way.

What stands out for me is people /doing/ things. Eating waffles for breakfast (we don't). Buying milk in gallons (always pints in the UK even when it's actually litres). Visiting a mall (we say shopping centre). Or actually, a lot of writers just have Harry go to Harrods for everything, which is a bit of a giveaway too.
