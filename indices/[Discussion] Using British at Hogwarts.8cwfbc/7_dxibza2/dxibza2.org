It's an obvious one, but mom really grates me. I don't know why - I can deal with dropping u's, swapping s and z, and all the other crazy stuff Americans get up to, but as soon as I see mom instead of mum it makes me cringe up inside. Possibly because I find it impossible to read in anything other than an over-the-top American accent.

In their defence even the worse of the fanfic authors seem to be pretty good at not doing this, but it's an immediate turnoff.
