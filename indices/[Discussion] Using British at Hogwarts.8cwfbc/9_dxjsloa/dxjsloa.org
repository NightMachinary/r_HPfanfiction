Everything British can be so regional - Mum, Mam, Ma for mother, for example. There is no one way to do it. Knowing I'm from roughly near where Godric's Hollow would be, I find it easier to model that but I don't know anyone who's done a midlands Lily Evans. That said, my personal pet peeve has always been cupcakes being used instead of fairycakes. They're different things, I know, but one is much more prevalent here.
