Yeah for me the language isn't a huge issue. Yes, there are some things Americans only say, but it's not a huge deal. I also don't expect writers to learn to write in a completely different dialect of English just to do fanfic.

And they're not super accurate either. I'm American but I write words with "u"'s, and say stuff like "I've drunk that before." Generalizations are useful, but they're not the be-all-end-all.

But behaviours are another thing. British society is different from American society, from its traditions to its pop culture to its government/school system, so fanfics that get that right get many more points in my book.
