Unless you're getting steak and kidney pudding from the chippy for your tea.

Also: bullocks are castrated bulls. Bollocks, meanwhile, are one of those universal words. You can talk bollocks (nonsense), be the dog's bollocks (very impressive), get up to bollocks (drunken and/or criminal shenanigans), describe something as a load of bollocks (tiresome and/or nonsensical), and, if it comes to it, kick a lad /in/ the bollocks (testicles) for talking bollocks. None of these involve cattle for good or ill.

It's also a very, very old slang word for a vicar of a parish church, which the Sex Pistols insisted was what they meant when prosecuted for obscene advertising.

Also, 'nutters' is a plural noun. One nutter (crazy person, distinguished by the bollocks they're spouting), two or more nutters. It is not an adjective (although it can look like one, properly used in context - "Nutters, the lot of them.")

The nub of my gist, here, is that using someone else's dialect can be decidedly tricky and make it quite clear you're not a native.
