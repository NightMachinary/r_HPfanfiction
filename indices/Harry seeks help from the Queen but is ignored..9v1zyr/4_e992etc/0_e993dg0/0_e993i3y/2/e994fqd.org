Oh you silly colonials and your experimental government.

In earnest though, monarchies of some form or other still make up over 20% of modern nations (43 of the ~ 200 nations of the world). While absolute monarchies like you may be thinking of are not too common in our current age (though some do still exist with the most influential being Saudi Arabia, ruled by the house of Saud), a decent number of countries are constitutional monarchies. For example, the 16 members of the commonwealth realms (canada, australia, Jamaica, UK, etc.) all have queen Elizabeth II as their sovereign, while Denmark, Spain, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Belgium are all examples of other European countries that still have a monarchy.
