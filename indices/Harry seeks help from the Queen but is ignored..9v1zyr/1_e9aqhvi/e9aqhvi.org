I remember something else. Harry wrote one or more letters to the Queen. It received no reaction. Harry accuses the Queen of that. But not directly to her, but in the media, or others in his environment. Someone informs the queen about the accusation. It is being tested. It is found that the Queen unconsciously ignores certain things.
