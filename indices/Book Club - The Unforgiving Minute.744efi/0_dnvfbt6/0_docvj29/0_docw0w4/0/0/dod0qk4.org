They knew Voldemort was hiding out in Little Hangleton prior to his resurrection, and he was WEAK in his homunculus form.

There are many ways to neutralize Voldemort without killing him, and then they could hunt Horcruxes without much pressure.

Even if Voldemort escaped again in wraith form, he would be weakened further than after the PS debacle. Furthermore, Wormtail and Barty Jr would certainly be finished off, and he would have even fewer means to attempt another resurrection with the same method, because the time travelers would certainly VANISH ALL his ancestors' remains. His enemies would also have plenty of time to hunt for his Horcruxes.
