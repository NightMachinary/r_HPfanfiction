I have a fundamental problem with this fic (and other similar time travels):

Voldemort's hiding place during the TWT period was known, and he was much weaker in his homunculus form. It would be much easier and safer for the time traveler(s) to strike at him directly than waiting for the Graveyard event.

Once Voldemort had been captured, they could subject him to ALL KINDS of treatments without killing him, and it would be so much easier to hunt for Horcruxes without his interference.

I now heavily favor time travels that completely avoid the Graveyard Resurrection Scheme.
