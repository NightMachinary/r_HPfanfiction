I'm still reading this one. I'm 20% in and so far it's been rubbing me the wrong way. I'm going to keep reading until I either get into it or get completely turned off it, but I hope it engages me soon. The premise really seemed interesting and up my alley.

In particular, the parts that bothered me started off with when he broke into Azkaban for Bellatrix. All the description of how he magicked the cell bars and then other cell bars etc it just seemed really hard for me to picture. Like I couldn't quite get what the author was imagining? It felt more show-offy than like cool action if that makes any sense. Then when he gets to Bellatrix and she shows him that flashback to what she did to that pregnant woman with her wand... I just blanked. I mean you could have gotten just the same effect/served the same purpose alluding to what happened with the wand, but I felt the circumstance was horrific enough without including rape. Especially, ON screen.

Anyway, we'll see how it goes from here.
