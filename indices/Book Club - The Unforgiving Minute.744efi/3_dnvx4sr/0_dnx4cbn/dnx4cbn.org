So, I'm at the part where he is trying to get the key to Bellatrix's vault. He takes polyjuice to impersonate Lucius. Then he fools Narcissa, confunds her, slips her veritaserum... only to Imperio her at the end? What purpose did any of that serve if he was going to Imperio her anyway? It was working beforehand. These sorts of things just pulls me out of the story and I'm really not one that notices every small detail. This just seemed really blatant.
