I'm not sure quite how to react to this story.

The action scenes are among the best I've seen: really imaginitive sequences of spells with logical countermeasures and realistic consequences. After a while, though, it began to feel like trying to take a refreshing drink by sipping from a firehose - there was almost too much action in too short a space.

The interludes at Grimmauld Place didn't work for me. Smith was too much of an asshole, Wood was wildly OOC, Sprout... wtf was she doing there? Ginny was just eye candy. The others weren't around long enough. Only Hermione was in any way enjoyable to read, and she didn't have a huge amount of page time.

I found it difficult to have much empathy with Harry. He spent so much time being a badass that there wasn't much characterisation beyond being an unstoppable duelling machine.

It all adds up to a story that I feel I should have enjoyed more than I actually did. It's well-written and an original take on an old trope but has too many flaws for me to imagine re-reading any time soon.
