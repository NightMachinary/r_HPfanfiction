It's a nice story.

But there are two things I don't like about it: 1. Family magic as a plot device to make everyone good and accepting: Harry immediately found powerful people who are taking him (and his “wife”) literally into their families no questions asked; 2. Relationship between Harry and Hermione are given as perfect and again everyone sees them as one made for another; there's no development between them, just ideal sweetness without any other feelings.
