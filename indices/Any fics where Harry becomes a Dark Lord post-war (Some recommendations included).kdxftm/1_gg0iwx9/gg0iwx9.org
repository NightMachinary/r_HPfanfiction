[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A second Chance at Life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Complete but has an unfinished sequel. FFNet. No Harry declaring himself a dark lord per say but pretty close.
