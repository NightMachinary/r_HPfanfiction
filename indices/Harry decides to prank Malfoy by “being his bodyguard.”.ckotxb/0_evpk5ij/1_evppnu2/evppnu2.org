It's all perception. If we refer to canon, would Mad-Eye call turning Malfoy into a ferret bullying or teaching?

SPOILERS BELOW

Then there is Bellatrix taunting Harry about Sirius's death. Would Bellatrix call that teasing or bullying?

Personally, I think that Harry should have done something more. He put up with the badges in fourth year. Harassment in fifth year. Both caused/ taken part of by Malfoy. And let's not forget the cruicatus curse Malfoy attempted in sixth year. This definitely warrants being an asshole to an asshole in my book.

I never said what year it had to be.

Edit: I have no idea how to do the covered text
