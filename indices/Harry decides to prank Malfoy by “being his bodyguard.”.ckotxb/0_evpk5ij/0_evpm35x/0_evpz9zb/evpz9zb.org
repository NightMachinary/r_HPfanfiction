Fred and George pranking people constantly isn't canon. I couldn't get through that fic but I assume you're alluding to the incident where they turned his toy into a spider, and when they tried to get Ron to make an unbreakable vow. If so I'd remind you that those events took place when they were kids, all three of them. The twins are only two years Ron's senior and none of them had a wand or had attended Hogwart's yet. Transfiguring a spider intentionally would be impossible for them, and they've shown no maliciousness that would indicate they understood the danger of an unbreakable vow.
