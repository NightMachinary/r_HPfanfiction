This isn't exactly what you're looking for because there's still a good Harry, but it's close. A good Harry gets thrown into an alternate dimension with another Harry as the dark lord, and Tom Riddle as the boy who lived. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but what's there is pretty good. The alternate dimension has quite a few other characters in it who also switch from good to evil.
