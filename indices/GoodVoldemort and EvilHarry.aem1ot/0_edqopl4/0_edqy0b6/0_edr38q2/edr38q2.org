Glad you enjoyed it :)

I'm thinking Harry would have to be secretly (or not secretly) very cunning, actually well versed in magic, and aspire for world domination for this setup to be anywhere near interesting about two paragraphs on. Otherwise, we're a little unbalanced with two REALLY powerful (now mostly) light wizards on one side and a 11 year old naive scrawny boy on the other. But what would his driving force be? And where would he get the practise in if he's still underage? Would he be able to bypass magical monitoring at home that early on? What would happen to the Dursleys? Wouldn't that ruin any power-curve before the story's even begun?

But there's a possibility he flies under the radar and becomes so sinister and threatening that Dumbledore and Voldemort have to go on a quest to activate all of the horcruxes to defeat him with sheer number of Toms... huh. Maybe because They'd decided to just watch him and provide gentle guidance early on, and then all hell broke loose?

Where even would Harry be sorted? Gryffindor? Slytherin? Or the ever so not-suspicions Hufflepuff? (talk about a master plan) Who would Harry's friends be? Surely not the regular suspects?

/"But Tom, old friend, surely you are mistaken. Young Harry is a bright, reasonable, well adjusted boy. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Why, he's brilliant with the other Hufflepuffs!"/

/"Hufflepuffs?"/

/"A whole gaggle of them! His new group of friends follow him everywhere, and it's only the second week of term!"/

/"A band of... loyal, devoted... friends, you say?"/

/After all, Hufflepuffs are loyal, and unafraid of toil... And ridding the magical world of vermin sounds like a gruelling job. But young Harry makes the future sound so promising! Brotherhood, unity, and equality for all.../ */who survive./*
