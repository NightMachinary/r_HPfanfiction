Maybe a sort of time travel thingamajig where older evil harry was transported back to his younger body, and that's how he knows the magic? As a baby he imperioed his mother maybe? Last time I saw a "good" voldemort against an "evil" harry was a fic I forgot the name of, and I don't remember much, but I remember it ended with Voldemort and some other survivors including Hagrid doing a last stand on Azkaban against Harry, who turned into a monster after he was bit by the basilisk i think?
