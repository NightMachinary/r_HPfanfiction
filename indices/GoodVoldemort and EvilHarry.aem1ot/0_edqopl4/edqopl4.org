That's an interesting premise! Now I want to read this too! Maybe their moralities or some such switched places when the killing curse backfired?

I can just imagine Voldemort possessing Quirrel just so he could get into Hogwarts to talk to Dumbledore.

/...Quirrell entered the Headmaster's office. Dumbledore looked up at him through his half moon glasses, intrigued./

/"You wanted to see me, Quirinus?"/

/"Y-Yes, Headmaster, there's something of absolute importance regarding the Phy-Phylosopher's S-Stone that we must discuss!"/

*/"Let me ssssspeak to him!"/*

/Dumbledore rose up from his seat cautiously, his wand at the ready upon hearing the disembodied voice. Quirrell started to unravel his turban, his hands shaking. As the fabric fell away, he turned around. A twisted, humanoid face looked back at Dumbledore from the back of his head. The eyes were slitted and red./

/Dumbledore raised his wand, a spell already on his lips, when Quirrell raised his arms to stall him, his joints bending backwards in an unnatural angle./

/"Wait! I come in peace! I have searched far and wide for magic that finally allowed me to reach you... I must warn you! We must protect the stone... from Harry Potter!"/

/Dumbledore's hand stilled, and it was only by years of practise that he did not drop the wand. He trained it on the alien face carefully./

/"Are you the one I suspect you to be?"/

/"Yes, it it I, Lord Voldemort. You were right not to think me dead. But there are things even you do not know"/

/"Tell me everything."/
