There was this guy called Prince Arthas. His kingdom got infected by this strange plague. He went to investigate and found out that the plague turned his people into the undead. He purged the city of Stratholme to prevent the plague and the undead from spreading. He later learned that a Dreadlord Mal'ganis was behind the plague. Arthas gathered his forces and went north, to the icy cold lands of Northrend. There he attemted to kill Mal'ganis but his vast undead forces proved to o tought to even get to him. Arthas' friend told him of a Legend of an increadibly strong Blade called Frostmourne. Luckily for Arthas the blade was nearby. Upon accuiring the blade, Arthas found that it sliced through the undead like a hot knife through butter. He found Mal'ganis and killed him. Before dead Mal'ganis told Arthas that the voice of Frostmourne Arthas was hearing was the Lich King speaking to him through the blade. Lich King then had Arthas butcher his father. Later on Arthas met another Dreadlord who told that quote.
