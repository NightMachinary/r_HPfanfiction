Making them relatable, while not required, is probably the easiest way to gain sympathy from your readers. Identify their motivations and have their actions reflect those. If they're proactive, they're probably going to be interesting whether or not they're aligned with your main character.

Ron is oftentimes unmotivated, but he wants to be acknowledged. The struggle to accomplish this without resorting to some sort of mental fortitude potion or self-induced Imperious to buckle down will be something people can relate to.

Snape is broken by self-incrimination and self-loathing. The fact that he's semi-functional at all is a minor miracle. It doesn't mean he's not a disgusting human being, but you don't need to make him likable, just make the reasons behind his actions not entirely irrational.
