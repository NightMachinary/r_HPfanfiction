There's a lot of great advice in this thread, so I'll go with something a bit closer to home.

Think about yourself for a moment. Remember the life you've lived, from what you remember of childhood to the present day. Remember your parents and/or siblings, and all the good or bad times spent with them. Remember your hopes and dreams, your wants and desires. Remember your first crush, your puberty, the best and worst moments of your life. Remember all the times you were right, and all the times where you just /thought/ you were right. Remember that moment of Oh-Shit-I-Fucked-Up, and Oh-Shit-I-Can't-Believe-That-Worked-Out. Remember all of that. You've lived all of this. You are a person.

Now remember that /everyone else/ is a person too. They have their own family, their own wants and desires, their own triumphs and failures. They have lived their own lives. They've lived their lives like you've lived yours.

Would you bash yourself?
