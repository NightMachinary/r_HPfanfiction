  Now, in Harry's place, what kind of person would you be if you consider him a traitor for being jealous once in year 4?

As for Ron's point of view, imagine you have this trusted great friend you went through all that dangerous madness. There is this tournament, far safer than an acromantula or basilik's nest, where you're barred from entrance. You joke about it with your trusted friend, they both agree there is no way you can enter, neither is trying to find a way to enter and, BAM! he gets chosen through an obvious cheat.

Wouldn't you believe he could have told you how to enter either because he trusts you or because both can try to enter? And that by refusing to share with you how to enter, he's actively blocking your way into the tournament?
