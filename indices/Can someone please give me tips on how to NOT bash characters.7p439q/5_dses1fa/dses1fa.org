Well, if you don't want to bash Ron, for example, you need to take a look at Ron, and imagine yourself in Harry's shoes. Ron laid down his life for Harry in first year - sacrificing himself in the chess game. In second year, he, deathly afraid of spiders, followed him into the Forbidden Forest facing Acromantulas. He went down into the CoS with him, despite having a broken wand. In third year, he stood on a broken leg and told a supposed mass-murderer that he had to go through him before he could get to Harry. He engineered Harry's breakout with the flying car, too. He followed you into an obvious trap in year 5.

Now, in Harry's place, what kind of person would you be if you consider him a traitor for being jealous once in year 4? Imagine that. I'd think you'd have a hard time not bashing Harry, seen from this point of view.

Now, realise that most of the "Ron eats like a pig" stuff is comedy and hyperbole - or fanon. Molly certainly wouldn't tolerate a total lack of manners in her children. And that Ron was more or less as skilled in magic as Harry.

It really doesn't take that much to not bash Ron. Simply don't brush away what he actually did. He is Harry's best friend. He is one of the bravest kids in the books. (Snape is a bloody coward in comparison, and Neville is a wet blanket.) Yes, he doubted Harry in fourth year - and? Everyone but Hermione did far worse.

As far as the other Weasleys are concerned, Molly can be portrayed as forceful and overbearing. But once again, put yourself in her place. She has raised the twins - who were as stupid and reckless to try and make Ron swear an unbreakable vow as kids. And generally break any and all rules they know, and seem to waste their talents - they're smart - by doing the minimum of O.W.L.s. Now imagine hearing about Ron and Harry's adventures. Your kids and their friends are facing dark lords, giant snakes, giant spiders, steal your car to drive across the country, almost break the SoS, and want to fight in a brewing civil war. And 9 months out of 12 they're at Hogwarts, where you can't protect them and keep them from killing themselves. I think you might be a little overbearing too - especially if you're staying, say, in a house full of curses and traps, and know the kids will want to explore. Oh, and if you read the infamous "love potion" scene, it's "Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a Love Potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly". Nothing about using it to catch Arthur, or his interest. It sounds more like an amusing "Look how stupid I was when I was a kid" story.

With regards to Snape, I would advise you not to go overboard. He is a miserable excuse for a human being who bullies kids for no fault of their own, but he is not a cartoon villain. He loathes Voldemort more than anyone else, he seems to practically live for his revenge, and he is very smart.
