If it's been a long while since you read the books, it might also be helpful to reread parts or even just certain scenes to get a feel for what the character was like in canon, the way he talked, interacted with others etc.

Also, give the character the benefit of the doubt. Don't know why a character acted a certain way? Don't assume the worst motivation. They make mistakes, they (opposed to you) don't know their future. Consider what you know about them, and then think logically why they would act in a certain way.

E.g. the Weasleys... I don't even know how one would really bash the Weasleys. They have little money, but took Harry in almost every year, they invited him to the Quidditch World Cup, they sent him presents for Christmas, they worried about him. Yes, Molly is a concerned mother, yes she tries to keep Harry and the others away from the war. But if you really think about it, if you consider that she lost her brothers in the last war, almost lost her daughter, that she is surrounded by families that were destroyed by the war (Potters, Longbottoms, Blacks e.g.) then it seems only natural that she would try to shield the children from the war as much as possible.
