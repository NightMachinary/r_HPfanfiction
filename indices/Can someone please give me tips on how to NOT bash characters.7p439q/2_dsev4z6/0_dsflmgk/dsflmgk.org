I agree about Molly, but I know how the bashing got started I think.

While most of us in Harry's place would feel smothered by the attention she gives him (Do this, Go here, Clean this), I think Harry (In context) would have thrived under it.

A female parental figure who is giving the kids a common activity, helping him integrate with a bunch of strangers while standing out less... it was pretty clever if it was on purpose.

//The boy was starved for positive attention, really.
