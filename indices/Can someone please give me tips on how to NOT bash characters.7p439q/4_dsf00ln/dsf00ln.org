It sounds weird, but it's about having empathy for them, even if you disagree. All of their thoughts, behaviours and responses make sense to them, and, like everyone, they will see themselves as the hero of their own story. Something I found interesting when I wrote an argument between Harry and Ginny in a fic was a clear divide between people who thought Ginny was being a bitch and people who thought Harry was being selfish. Any conflict in your story should have layers of mistakes/unreasonableness as well as genuine motivation on both sides - unless you are writing for children people shouldn't be evil for the sake of being evil, and good characters should not always be right. You should be able to empathise (even if not necessarily sympathising) with the character.
