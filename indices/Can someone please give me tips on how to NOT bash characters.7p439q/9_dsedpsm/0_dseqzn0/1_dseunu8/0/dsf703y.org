It is logical to assume that someone is exaggerating if they inform you of child abuse?

Molly had reasons for her concern and yet nothing ever came out of it. Harry even went as far as telling her that he was being starved and yet she did not call the authorities. In Germany, we call that "Unterlassene Hilfeleistung", which translates as failure to rend aid and is a criminal offence. And according to Wikipedia, there is a Duty to rescue in Britain if you are watching over a child, such as Molly did when Harry was at the Burrow.
