  She knew Harry was getting abused and she sent food instead of calling the authorities.
#+end_quote

First, she did not know Harry was getting abused. She was told that the Dursleys put bars on Harry's window, and logically assumed her sons were exaggerating.

Second, she had no reason to believe it because she had not witnessed it. To say nothing of the twins breaking the bars off Harry's window, thereby eliminating any evidence.

Third, what of Hermione? She lives in the Muggle world; she knows the proper channels. She only sent food too. Are you going to bash Hermione?

  How anyone can see her as loving mother figure is beyond me. Just read the scene when Harry arrives at the Burrow in CoS.

I saw Molly reign in her temper and welcome Harry into her home and let him eat as much as he wanted.

Furthermore, I remember her saying that she and Arthur were concerned and had agreed to drive to Surrey to ask in person why Harry hadn't responded to any of Ron's post.

  There are a couple more characters where Rowling writes characters in a certain way but ignores it in the end because she intended the character to be received in a positive light (Draco Malfoy, Snape).
#+end_quote

Rowling has said /repeatedly/ that she's disturbed by the adoration the fandom has for Draco Malfoy. She did not intend for him to be a positively received character.

  Draco's attack on Katie alone would earn him multiple lifetimes in prison if not outright execution. Apparently the unforgivables are forgivable since he is free in the epilogue
#+end_quote

There wasn't any concrete proof that Draco was the one who cursed Katie (or, to be more precise, cursed Rosmerta and had her curse Katie in turn).

And Rowling mentioned that the Malfoys, true to their nature, were only just able to get out of Azkaban, but that they lost most of their prestige in doing so.
