The issue with this is that if you stay true to some characters they end up bashed. Take Molly Weasley for example. She knew Harry was getting abused and she sent food instead of calling the authorities. That's at least accessory to child abuse. How anyone can see her as the loving mother figure is beyond me. Just read the scene when Harry arrives at the Burrow in CoS.

There are a couple more characters where Rowling writes characters in a certain way but ignores it in the end because she intended the character to be received in a positive light (Draco Malfoy, Snape). Draco's attack on Katie alone would earn him multiple lifetimes in prison if not outright execution. Apparently, the unforgivables are forgivable since he is free in the epilogue. You cannot write those following Rowling without either having gaping plotholes or disregarding the canon interpretation of the character.

  Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday.

Molly suspected that Harry was badly treated to the point where she and her husband considered getting him out of there (CoS). You don't take children away from their guardians without their consent without good reason else it is called kidnapping and even then you need to inform the authorities. So either the Weasleys suspected that Harry was abused but were content with letting him be with his abusive relatives or they did not, in which case there would be no reason to remove him from Privet Drive. By GoF Molly knew that he was starved. She sent food. 1/4 of a grapefruit has around 30 calories if we are generous. That was Harry's breakfast. In his age, the recommended intake is 2200-3200. Divided by three you get 730-1065. So in the best case scenario, Harry got less than 5% of his supposed ration. Wikipedia lists starvation as a form of torture and sign of child abuse. The Dursleys abused/tortured him and Molly knew.

  Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age.

Signs of malnutrition in SS.

  The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust. “It's no good turning your beak up at it --- that's all we've got,” said Harry grimly.

Literal starvation in CoS. A can of soup has 200 calories at most. That is 600 calories daily at most while he should get over 2000.
