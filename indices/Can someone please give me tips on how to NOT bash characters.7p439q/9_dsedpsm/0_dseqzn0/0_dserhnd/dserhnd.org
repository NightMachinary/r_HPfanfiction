So you think that Molly Weasley knew Harry was getting abused, I'm pretty sure that she just thought Harry didn't eat enough. Harry does not give the signs of an abused person, therefore there is no way for her to know that he is abused. Another thing, you hate the Weasleys in general so you can't really give advice on how not to bash them. You are one of the biggest Weasley Bashers there are.
