Then can you please give a direct quote from the books where Molly said she /used/ a love potion, or pass the /usage/ of love potion as a joke?

The only exact quote is this:

"Mrs Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a Love Potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly." - Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 5.

She had /made/ one, not /used/ one, and there's no evidence anywhere saying that she condones the use of such thing or finds it's usage funny. Had it been the kind of joke that you implied, Hermione wouldn't have been "giggly", she would be horrified.

So no, what you said about Molly wasn't part of canon, unless you can give a quote.
