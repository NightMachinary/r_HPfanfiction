Well you used muggle logic on canon situations. That doesnt really work. If you want to use canon evidence you really have to look at the big picture. Do wizards even have child care standard? 1. They let little kids fly high above the ground on brooms that can go 100km per hour. 2. They have no real problem with children fighting dragons or swimming in a lake in winter. 3. They don't get children after care when something traumatic happens. 4. A ministery employee lets severall children use their own blood to write lines 5. Villifing a child in the media seems not to a problematic action. I'm not sure why you think Molly should have seen a problem? It seems that she lives in a society with very different standards.

The second problem with your theory is that nobody in the HP universe seems overly concerned with child abuse. 1. All the muggle teachers who Harry had while sleeping in a closet seemed not to notice any abuse? 2. The neighbours of the Dursleys didnt seem to notice any abuse? 3. The teachers how send letters adressed to a cupboard did not see any abuse. Nor did they see it after he arrived at school. 4. The schoolnurse did not notice any abuse while he has been in her care many times.
