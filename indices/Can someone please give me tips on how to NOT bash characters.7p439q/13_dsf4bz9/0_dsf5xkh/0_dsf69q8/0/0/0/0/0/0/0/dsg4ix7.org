You don't really know when he invented it. In fact, the spells prior to Sectumsempra were all mostly Fred-and-George-ish kind of spells. You could easily also say he escalated and invented it after he was nearly eaten by a Werewolf. Either way there's not enough information to know what really happened. You don't have to agree or disagree, but saying Snape went down the Shrieking Shack to murder Remus is flimsy speculation and can't be taken as fact.
