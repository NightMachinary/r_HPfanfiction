Eh, you never called a loved one any names? My siblings and I used to have some spectacular fights when we were all teens. Some I thought I'd never forgive them from. Yes, he crossed a line, but that's kinda what the entire Snape plotline rests on, how much he regretted it.

Sorry but there's a lot more evidence for Sirius trying to murder Snape than the other way around. Snape knew Sectumsempra all the time, if he wanted to murder any of the marauders there'd be no reason to go to a time and place Sirius had told him. He could just wait around a dark corner and do it any old time.
