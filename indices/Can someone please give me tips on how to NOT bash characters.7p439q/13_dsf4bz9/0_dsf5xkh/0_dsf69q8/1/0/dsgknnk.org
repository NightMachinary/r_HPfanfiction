Except for that moment in 5th year where he calls her a mudblood... but yah he loves her so much. Then there is the fact he is fine with Voldemort killing James and Harry so long as he can keep Lily likely as his sex slave in this scenario.

No Sirius was not trying to murder Snape he didn't tell Snape to go confront Remus only how to do it. Snape wanted to prove his suspicion about Remus correct and expel him and Sirius at worst and potentially kill Remus at best in an attempt to hurt James.

Draco is a special case among Death Eaters for three reasons. First, it punishes his parents for their failings. Second, he has access to Hogwarts and as a student is unlikely to attract much attention. Third, Voldemort expects him to fail this ties into the first point but Draco failing will test Snape's loyalty.
