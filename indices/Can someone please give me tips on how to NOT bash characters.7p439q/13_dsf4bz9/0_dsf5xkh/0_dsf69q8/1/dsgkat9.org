  I don't buy Snape as being anything more than infatuated with Lily.

Okay, but the Patronus kinda says differently. People can read Snape so differently- I see him as not being "in love" or infatuated, so much as simply loving the only person who showed him friendship and care pretty much his entire life. Like someone would love their grandmother or their sister. The only reason he had a problem with Lily going out with James Potter is because he was a bullying Marauder.

And I believe Sirius was trying to murder Snape, not Snape murder Remus.

As for the Death Eaters, I believe all they had to do was be trusted by Voldemort. Which Draco kind of proves.
