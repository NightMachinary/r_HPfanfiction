I don't buy Snape as being anything more than infatuated with Lily. At best he was 'in love' with the idea of Lily not Lily as a person. We are talking abaout a person who tried to murder Remus in their 6th year for simply being turned into a werewolf. Also do you really think that all the Death Eaters had to do to join Voldemort was take the dark mark?
