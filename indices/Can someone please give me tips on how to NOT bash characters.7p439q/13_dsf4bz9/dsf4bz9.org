Ok first thing is that personally I do not believe that it is possible to bash Snape. Snape is a member of a magic Nazi death cult and likely had to commit horrible acts as part of the initiation. And also prior to that used the magical equivalent of the N word to attack his best friend. There is no redemption for Snape and without major changes to canon where he actively changes his behavior there is no reason to pretend he is a decent human being. And before anyone says what about his enduring love for Lily I will simply point out that I don't find Snape capable of loving someone.

Ron in specific, Ron has an inferiority complex as the youngest of 6 boys. His brothers already set the bar so high that Ron feels he cannot match it. There are two ways to deal with this. First, you could give him places to excel maybe have a Hogwarts chess team or have Oliver notice how obsessed Ron is with Quidditch and take Ron under his wing to become Captain latter (probably should have Harry be prefect instead if you do this). Second, ditch him fast. There are many ways this could happen: Harry and Ron don't meet on the train, Harry picks Hermione over Ron 3rd year, Ron ruins their friendship after the Goblet of Fire incident.

The Weasleys which usually means Molly and Ginny. Starting with Ginny have her get over her crush and move on. If she is not going to be Harry's love interest have her date Neville or anyone else really. Then she was just a young girl with a crush on a celebrity and not an obsessed stalker. Molly bashing is a function of many people not finding Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny parings realistic over Hermione/Harry and looking for a reason to explain how the canon parings happen. The obvious answer to some people is the use of love potions. To solve this have Ron and Ginny date other people and have Molly avoid interfering in their relationships.
