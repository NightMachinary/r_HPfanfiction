Figure out each character's greatest strength, and their fatal flaw. Make another list of positive/negative qualities for each character, and make sure that you show them in relatively equal amounts. This can also help prevent making your characters too overpowered -- if you notice your character has no fatal flaw, then they're probably not only overpowered but also one dimensional.

Take, for example, Ron. One of his greatest strengths is his loyalty to his friends and his willingness to sacrifice himself/overcome his fears to support them (think chess game, and going into the Forbidden Forest despite the Acromantulas). One of his major flaws is his short temper (goblet of fire fiasco, storming off during the horcrux hunt). Some other positives are his sense of humor, and his knowledge of the Wizarding World (he tells Harry what Quidditch is, reminds Hermione to use her wand in the first book). Another negative is his impulsivness/acting before he thinks.

If you do this for all your characters, and make sure to show some of their positive qualities while not making their flaws the only characterization, you'll be able to avoid bashing :)
