Make Ron witty?

His cannon character is to be a heartfelt, laid back person who 'Says what he feels' without a thought. He may embarrass you, drive cute girls away who don't like his team, let you fight a dragon without warning cause of an argument, and eat so badly that it is a running gag... but he will stand up for you against death itself.

O.o Why not just make Hermione a class skipping girl about fashion, or Severus a forgive and forget christian who loves correcting potion mistakes?

Don't get me wrong, I've seen stories where characters are literally cursed with god like vengeance for such crimes as 'She read my mail without asking!' and 'He would rather die than do homework!', but calling Ron witty is not somehow 'un-bashing', it is almost lavish praise.

I had to get away from insulting the kid by basically having him do what he WOULD do if he wasn't so important to the story: Play chess, eat food, and sit places.
