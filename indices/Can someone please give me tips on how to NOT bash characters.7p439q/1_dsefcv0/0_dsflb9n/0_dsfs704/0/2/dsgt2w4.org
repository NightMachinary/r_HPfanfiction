  Ron went to a school of magic, to learn magic, to practice magic... and did NOT get a replacement wand for a whole year. Like having a machine gun randomly fire all the time. I can understand having pride, mind you, but not having a wand at a wand-required facility... Oh that made me angry, even if it was plot-required later. I think there was a fanfiction story where Goyle flat out refused to carry his, tossing it out or leaving it places, cause he only cared about potions, history, and so forth... at least that made SOME sense to me. If it WAS because they were poor... well, that speaks pretty badly in my opinion on the facilities, his family, hell, neither Hermione nor Harry volunteered to help out. (This still bothers me).

Ron's family was poor, they couldn't afford a new wand, and because of Ron and Harry flying the car to school, they had to pay a fine as well. Because of that, Ron didn't tell them.

  Ron's really bizarre refusal to believe his best friend about the Trophy thing. I mean, the boy sort of just decided "Hey, Harry is a lying asshole for some reason." His refusal to directly inform the boy sleeping in the same room that he may have to fight a DRAGON... well, that seemed like a murder attempt to me, and again, NO REASON as far as I could tell. I think he was still angry AS HE WALKED TO THE FIRST CHALLENGE.

I would recommend reading [[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=97181][this essay]] about Ron not believing Harry. It brings up some good points about the fight that is rarely brought up. Including Harry and Ron talking about entering, and Harry telling Ron how he would have entered his name during the night so no one could see him... And Ron never knew about the dragon, that was a movie invention.

  Hmm... now I'm second guessing myself about some of the other bits that annoy me. The whole 'abbandon them while trying to save the world in a tent' thing followed up with 'Showing up in time to save harry' thing bothered me, but I have read so many 'I abbandoned them cause I'm hungry' or 'I wanted more potions to blah blah' stories that the whole thing is foggy in my head, not to mention his mind being influenced by a soul portion.

He did not abandon them because he was hungry, but because he had just heard that the the "Weasley don't need any more of their kids injured" and that Ginny had been sent into the forbidden forest, and it seemed that Harry didn't care. Harry also had to basically ask him to leave THREE TIMES before Ron left

  “*So why are you still here?*” Harry asked Ron.

“Search me,” said Ron.

  “*Go home then*,” said Harry.

‘"Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn't you hear what they said about my sister? But you don't give a rat's fart, do you, it's only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I've- Faced-Worse Potter doesn't care what happens to her in there --- well, I do, all right, giant spider and mental stuff --- ”

“I was only saying --- she was with the others, they were with Hagrid --- ”

“Yeah, I get it, you don't care! And what about the rest of my family, the Weasleys don't need another kid injured, did you hear that?”

“Yeah, I---”

“Not bothered what it meant, though?”

“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don't think it means anything new has happened, anything we don't know about: think, Ron, Bill's already scarred; plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you're supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I'm sure that's all he meant --- ”

“Oh, you're sure, are you? Right then, well, I won't bother myself about them. It's all right for you two, isn't it, with your parents safely out of the way --- ”

“My parents are deadl” Harry bellowed.

“And mine could be going the same way!” yellow Ron.

#+begin_quote
  “*Then GO!*” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you've got over your spattergroit and Mummy'll be able to feed you up and --- ”

Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner's pocket, Hermione had raised her own.
