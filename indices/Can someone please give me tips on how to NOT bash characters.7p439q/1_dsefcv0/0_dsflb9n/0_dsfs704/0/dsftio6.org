Hmm... It HAS been a long time since the books, and the movies DID make him seem like an ass I suppose...

I think I have a bad impression for a few reasons.

I sympathized with Hermione a lot (Also a know-it-all person here, obviously) and the boy's constant fighting with her annoyed me.

The chess set thing annoyed me, because the supposed chess prodigy made NO ONE the king, the safest piece. I tried not to judge him not replacing the queen, as I am not brilliant at chess, mind you.

Ron went to a school of magic, to learn magic, to practice magic... and did NOT get a replacement wand for a whole year. Like having a machine gun randomly fire all the time. I can understand having pride, mind you, but not having a wand at a wand-required facility... Oh that made me angry, even if it was plot-required later. I think there was a fanfiction story where Goyle flat out refused to carry his, tossing it out or leaving it places, cause he only cared about potions, history, and so forth... at least that made SOME sense to me. If it WAS because they were poor... well, that speaks pretty badly in my opinion on the facilities, his family, hell, neither Hermione nor Harry volunteered to help out. (This still bothers me).

Ron's really bizarre refusal to believe his best friend about the Trophy thing. I mean, the boy sort of just decided "Hey, Harry is a lying asshole for some reason." His refusal to directly inform the boy sleeping in the same room that he may have to fight a DRAGON... well, that seemed like a murder attempt to me, and again, NO REASON as far as I could tell. I think he was still angry AS HE WALKED TO THE FIRST CHALLENGE.

After not caring about his rat for several years (To the point of forgetting it, almost sitting on it, cursing its existence), it became THE most important thing of his life 3rd year, more important than his friends. Yeah.

I'll forgive the broom thing, all wizards seem way too into Quidditch.

Hmm... now I'm second guessing myself about some of the other bits that annoy me. The whole 'abbandon them while trying to save the world in a tent' thing followed up with 'Showing up in time to save harry' thing bothered me, but I have read so many 'I abbandoned them cause I'm hungry' or 'I wanted more potions to blah blah' stories that the whole thing is foggy in my head, not to mention his mind being influenced by a soul portion.

And don't get me started on Snape, I never liked the Ass and he abused 11 year olds every year, 3/4ths of all the witches and wizards of England no less. And he wanted to tap a woman so hard that he went evil, tried to kill her husband and children, then wined about it forever.

Yeah... Snape was designed to be a bad guy, to the point where it was plot required. Just because the actor on screen did such a GOOD job portaying that, doesn't mean that he gets a good mark in my book when he uses the last moments of his life informing the boy he abused to 'GO KILL YASELF! Only way to save the day, sorry!'
