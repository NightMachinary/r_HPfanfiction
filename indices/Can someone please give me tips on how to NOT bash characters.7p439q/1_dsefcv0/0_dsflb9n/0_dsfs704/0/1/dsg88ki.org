Yeah, so let's start from ... someplace that is not the very beginning, shall we?

  Hmm... now I'm second guessing myself about some of the other bits that annoy me. The whole 'abbandon them while trying to save the world in a tent' thing followed up with 'Showing up in time to save harry' thing bothered me, but I have read so many 'I abbandoned them cause I'm hungry' or 'I wanted more potions to blah blah' stories that the whole thing is foggy in my head, not to mention his mind being influenced by a soul portion.

So, here's the thing: Ron is convinced that because he is the sixth son he will never amount to anything compared to his brothers. His biggest desire is to be recognised for his accomplishments and his biggest flaw is his jealously, a flaw that he does try to keep under control but Harry being famous is just one more nail for the thing because obviously compared to him Ron won't be of any importance.

The horcrux in the locket fed on this, amplified his jealousy, and make him go out the tent. The thing is, he immediately wanted to go back but couldn't because the snatchers got him. And, I will note, he did protest when Harry decided that they are going to be taking turns wearing the locket, so we can't say he did not try.

  After not caring about his rat for several years (To the point of forgetting it, almost sitting on it, cursing its existence), it became THE most important thing of his life 3rd year, more important than his friends. Yeah.

Ron did not want the rat, nor did he want to care for it. It'd been given to him as an afterthought basically, yet another hand-me-down, but the rat always managed fine. The third story was the first one where the rat was in any actual danger, and so the first time when Ron, not very willingly but still, actually tried to do something about it. And let's be honest, Hermione's lack of capacity to understand that maybe cats are predators so she shouldn't dismiss Ron's claims that the cat is trying to get the rat just because it's easier for her that way. I don't dislike Hermione but the whole situation with Scabbers would have been way different has she not behaved like a stubborn ... loon, frankly (she does the same thing---decides she knows better than anyone else so her version it is---when she throws clothes for the elves to find, and also when she obliviates her parents).

  Ron's really bizarre refusal to believe his best friend about the Trophy thing. I mean, the boy sort of just decided "Hey, Harry is a lying asshole for some reason." His refusal to directly inform the boy sleeping in the same room that he may have to fight a DRAGON... well, that seemed like a murder attempt to me, and again, NO REASON as far as I could tell. I think he was still angry AS HE WALKED TO THE FIRST CHALLENGE.

It's not really bizarre. Again, we go back to the jealousy and to the feeling insignificant compared to Harry thing. Yes, that should not have happened, it was Ron at his lowest. Nonetheless, I will point out that in the books Harry did not really try to talk with Ron, and what played on Ron's jealousy the most was that Harry did not want to tell him how he got past the age line when he knew Ron would have wanted to know. And from that moment neither of them talked with the other, so as far as Ron saw they may not have been friends anymore, so while not telling him about the dragons was not good it definitely was not a murder attempt, it was someone losing a friend and being convinced that the friend was somewhat at fault and thus not approaching them because they were no longer friends, not a deliberate choice to put Harry in danger via dragons. Jealousy? Sure. Childish stupidity? Sure. Malice? No.

  Ron went to a school of magic, to learn magic, to practice magic... and did NOT get a replacement wand for a whole year. Like having a machine gun randomly fire all the time. I can understand having pride, mind you, but not having a wand at a wand-required facility...
#+end_quote

No, you do not understand. Because you ascribe pride to him as the reason for this when the real reason was that he thought his family did not have money to spend on him, even when it comes to something as important as a wand. Read the first book, his wand is in a shape where everyone would have told him to replace it even when he meets Harry for the first time, yes, before the first year even, but at that point where you read it you do not yet know how important it is to have a wand in good condition so people don't remember. It's easy to see Ron as arrogant, prideful, spiteful sometimes, it's a bit harder to see that there are moments when he's just resigned to not being important enough for anyone, even his own parents. It's easy to see him as utterly lazy because he just is, it's a bit harder to see him look at his homework and think “what does it matter, even if I do it nobody will notice me anyway”. It's easy to forget about his flaws, the ones that he really has and why he has them, and give them exaggerated versions that are there “because he's Ron”.

But if you want to not bash him, you will have to learn to not go for what is easy and instead write his character in his whole.
