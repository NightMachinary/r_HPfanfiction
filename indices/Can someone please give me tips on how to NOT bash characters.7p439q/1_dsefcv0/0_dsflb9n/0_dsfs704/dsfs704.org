Ron was witty in book canon, his eating habits are fine, he does not only play chess, eat, and sit places. Only fanon and the movies make him look like a disgusting pig, a bunch of Ron lines were given to Hermione in the movies.

It was not Hermione that stood up to Sirius in PoA, it was Ron who stood up on a broken leg in the books while in the movie he was just in a corner whimpering.

In PS it was he who reminded Hermione to use her wand against the Devil's Snare while in the movie he just screamed.

When Draco called Hermione a mudblood Ron explained what it was and said the idea behind it was ridiculous, but in the movies Hermione explained what it was. Even though Ron is the one who should know about it because he grew up in the Wizarding World

When Snape called Hermione a know it all in the books he stood up for her, while in the movie he agreed with Snape.

You see what I mean, in the books Ron was amazing but the movies made a Hermione a goddess and Ron a buffoon.
