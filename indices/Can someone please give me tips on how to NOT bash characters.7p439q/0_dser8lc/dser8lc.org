1. Think of them as their own independent people with their own stories rather than as adjuncts to Harry's story.

2. Have them learn from their mistakes and adapt to new circumstances.

3. Allow them victories.

4. Don't reveal all their thoughts to the reader but rather leave the reader guessing as to their true motives and plans.

Follow these points and even if you cannot resist making those characters villains, they will at least be interesting villains rather than cardboard cut-outs that only exist for Harry to easily defeat.
