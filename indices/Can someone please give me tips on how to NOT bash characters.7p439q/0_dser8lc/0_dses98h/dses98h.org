To add a little more value: Taure's comment is good advice for writing any supporting character, not just avoiding bashing. If a character isn't relevant to the story (doesn't meet points 1 or 3 of the comment), there's no reason for them to be there. Points 2 and 4 will make the supporting character more interesting.

Character bashing is just the antagonist version of creating a Mary Sue and neither of them are particularly interesting.
