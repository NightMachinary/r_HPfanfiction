I guess think how you would react if you where in their shoes. Characters have motivates. They are like people. They have flaws that may be more emphasized or strengths that are emphasize. Bashing a character is simply painting just their flaws without any redeeming qualities. That they themselves don't have anything that makes them complex.

For example, Percy. People can keep on saying he is a pompous Prefect or a git. However, if you are in his shoes. He is an elder brother who would worry about is younger siblings. He conflicts more with the Twins because some of their experiments are possibly dangerous. He was might've been inspired to get a high position in the Ministry to provide for his family. He could equate high position as better recognition for his family. So it would have hurt to be accused about something he worked so hard to achieve just to say he would spy on his own family.

Giving them a background story also helps lessen bashing moments.
