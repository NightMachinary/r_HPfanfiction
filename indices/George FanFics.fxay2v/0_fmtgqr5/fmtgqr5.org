- linkffn(7562379) ... primarily about Ron & Hermione in Australia looking for her parents (without explanation why they haven't the secret Granger's location method mentioned in linkao3(The Wheel Is Come Full Circle by White_Squirrel), but that's the only small weakness of the story), but with really great George dealing (badly) with losing his brother.

- linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) ... again, primarily Harry & Ginny story, George is a bit in the background, but his grief is very believable.

- linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) ... of course, mentioning White_Squirrel, I have to mention this great story, which has Hermione & George pairing (and it is quite AU, so for example, Fred survives).
