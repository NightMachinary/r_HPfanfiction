Due to the general expectations of the fandom, I try to give Daphne some minor antagonistic role whenever possible. Yet I also don't feel the need to waste pages just to mock a fanon concept.

That being said, the best "subversion" of the Ice Princess is a fic called "Ice Princess", where her persona is the result of brain damage. Chapter 2 is a parody of its self.
