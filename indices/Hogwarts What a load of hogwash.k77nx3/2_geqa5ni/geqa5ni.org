*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* - very good, a classic. Durmstrang.

*Cupboard series -* a decent guilty pleasure. Original school.

*A Second Chance at Life -* a somewhat infamous over-the-top fic with questionable execution. Original school. Don't know if there's anything else like it in the fandom.
