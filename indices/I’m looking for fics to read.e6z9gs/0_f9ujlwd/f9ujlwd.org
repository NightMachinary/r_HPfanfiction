Not 100% sure what you do like but I'm gonna assume you want Harry-centric fics? Also going to assume you're okay with darker fics since you're okay with dark Harry? Hope you like these, if not let me know what you like to read and I'll try to find some. I feel like I've read loads of Drarry but can't find it saved anywhere, -_\, so there isn't much of that.

This doesn't have any Harry planning really, he travels to another dimension where the war is much worse.

Very fun, not a darkfic. Adult Harry ends up back in time and there is a minor Harry/Bellatrix pairing but we don't see much of it.

Harry and Daphne, 99% post war, have a kid after what is essentially a blind-one-night-stand. Cute story.

This is a Drarry fic. It's AU, obviously, where Harry goes back to Hogwarts after the war and ends up with Draco. It does start Ginny/Harry but at no point is the fic rooting for them.

Another Drarry, this one has more non-Drarry plot than Say My Name. Completely AU, Harry never goes to Hogwarts and the Hogwarts gang (Hermione, Ron, Draco, Ginny, Luna, Neville) finds him with the hope he can end the war. Very cool fic, I loved it.

This is actually a series on AO3 that starts with Snape 'kidnapping' Harry and raising him in secret with Remus. Harry is such a cute kid/teen. Ends with Drarry but you don't see that until they get older. It's a unique take on Harry's magic.
