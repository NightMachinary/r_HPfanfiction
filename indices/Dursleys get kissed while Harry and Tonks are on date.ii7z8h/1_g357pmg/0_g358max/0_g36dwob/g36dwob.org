I think the OG Harry/Tonks fic(series) had them the same age. Look up the R-series if you want a complete 7-books fanfic series.

Quite a few of the more popular ones decrese the age gap, which IMO is poor taste since it usually leads to romance too early to be believable. I can buy Harry and Tonks getting together in HBP, but GoF feels too early unless you make her Fleur's age or younger (and even that is a stretch).
