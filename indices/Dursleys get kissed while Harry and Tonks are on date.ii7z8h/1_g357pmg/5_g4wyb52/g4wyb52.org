I personally dated a 21 year old when I was 16. It wasn't that bad. Granted, given some events in life a few years prior I tend towards the more emotionally mature way of thinking. I think. We broke up when I was 17. She was 22. It was pretty amicable, we just wanted to go different places at that point.
