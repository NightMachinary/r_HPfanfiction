It's a lot more common for young women to go for men who are older that themselves. Besides, a 17 year old Fleur is mature and of age. She's not a child. A young woman would usually not be interested in boys younger than themselves, as boys are slower to mature than girls. That's why Fleur/Harry and Tonks/Harry doesn't make sense to me
