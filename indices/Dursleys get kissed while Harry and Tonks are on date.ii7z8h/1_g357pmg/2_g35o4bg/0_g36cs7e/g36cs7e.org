Age changes can get annoying though. I really hate it when fics put Bellatrix and James in the same year when she was 9 years older and therefore finished Hogwarts before he even started. Narcissa had two years overlap, Andromeda could if she was the older twin of Narcissa (it is never stated when she was born, only that she is the middle sister).
