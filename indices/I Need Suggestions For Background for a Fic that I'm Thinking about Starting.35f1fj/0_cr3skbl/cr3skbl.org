Possibly at least one that was as close to saint like as a normal human can be, who did his best to fight against the madness, perhaps even succeeding somewhat in taking up pure causes, killing killers.

Edit: Or maybe make them a Christian, but with the power, they turn to punishing the sinners. Killing for even the slightest sins; lust gluteny, greed, etc.. Perhaps ending in their suicide.

Perhaps one with some real cleverness and cunning; who managed to take over and run a small country at the very least, at least for a while.
