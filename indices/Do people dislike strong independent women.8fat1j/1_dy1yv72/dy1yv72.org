Another of those "first post, no comments, no history" accounts.

That said, there is a strong tendency to label a female character as a Mary Sue if she "horns in" on the traditionally male hero role.In the same vein, male characters often get far more of a pass. I've never seen a post accusing an author of being a "Harry worshipper" for writing a powerful hero or anti-hero Harry, for example.
