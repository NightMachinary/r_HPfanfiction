My wish-it-were-canon pairing is Vikor/Hermione, and it's probably the only pairing I feel strongly about at all. That said, I read very, very little of it, partly because not much exists, and also because there are a ton of very interesting fics with other pairings or that are gen (I actually really enjoy gen fics). Also, there are a lot of pairings that are fun to read about in fanfiction even if they're inherently quite odd. Harry/Voldemort for example is great in linkao3(again and again by athey), but certainly not remotely reasonable in a canon sense.
