  Two boys grow up together in an orphanage, grow powerful at school, are torn apart by death and brought back together by rebirth. Horcruxes aren't the only way to live forever. Necromancy, reincarnation, HP/TR Slash dark!Harry.

      Rating: T, but it will have some violence that will eventually earn an M rating\.

            Note that this story was first posted back in 2010 \- so it's kind of old\!  'Book 1' is in here, in its entirety, and 'Book 2' gets a number of chapters in as well\.  My time to write is super\-duper limited these days, and it's been\.\.\. probably 2 years, since the last time I updated, before dropping the big bomb of 'Book 2' chapters up, in August of '15\.  Do not go into this expecting to see an ending to the story any time soon, if ever\.  If I mange to write more, then I do\.  But I make no guarantees\.
