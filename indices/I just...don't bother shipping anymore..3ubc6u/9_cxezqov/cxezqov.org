I don't care much for shipping. I am far more fond of Missing Moments. To that end, "Faith and Understanding" is a very well-written "Missing Moments" fic of much of the series. Ginny Weasely meets Luna Lovegood and slowly the two girls become very close friends. This is one of my all-time favorite fanfictions across any fandom. Luna is written beautifully, insightful and kind and blunt and eccentric. Ginny's got a spark to her that you don't often see. This story is heartfelt and funny and real.
