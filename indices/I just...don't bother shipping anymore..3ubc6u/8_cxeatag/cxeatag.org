Yes, I suppose pairings are important to me. Part of the reason is my ingrained stubbornness. The other is that every so often I find a fic that ticks all the right boxes and just leaves me feeling like a junkie that got his fix for the day.

I don't give a shit about cliches. (tropes is something different people!)

Why, you might ask? Because at one point something that is cliche was original and quite possibly amazing. I don't lose faith that good writing can revive it properly.
