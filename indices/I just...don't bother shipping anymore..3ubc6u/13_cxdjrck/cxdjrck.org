Harem shipping I will almost always refuse to read because the storyline tends to be poor quality.

Otherwise, I'm pretty open to other ships as long as they don't detract from the actual plot of the story.

However, if I read a romance/shipping focused story it's probably for laughs because the sex scenes in fan fiction are usually quite over the top and ridiculous.
