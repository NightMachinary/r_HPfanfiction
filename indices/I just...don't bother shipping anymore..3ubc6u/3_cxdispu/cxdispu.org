I used to only read D/Hr fics, my angsty-draco-in-leather-pants phase /shudders/. Then I kind of branched off to other ships both het and slash. I think I've only read <5 D/Hr fics over the past several years.

Now I just want good plot! I don't usually care about tropes, although some make me roll my eyes. If it's well written, I'm all for it, :) I don't care who ends up with who as long as the author doesn't dedicate half the story to ship building.
