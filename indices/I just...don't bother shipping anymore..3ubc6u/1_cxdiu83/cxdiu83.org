I judge stories on the following criteria:

1) Does the set up and characterization make sense for the story?

2) Spelling and narrative flow are enjoyable and relatively consistent.

3) Pairings are done well if they're in the story. Make me believe in them.

4) Don't have characters be OOC out of nowhere for no reason.

5) Make me feel something. Am I laughing? Teary? Gripping my legs with white fingered fury?
