I never understood the obsession with shipping. The books are about magic, not romance. They aren't soap operas. Most characters aren't very attractive imo. Yet there are more stories focused on relationships than on any other topic. It feels to me like fanfiction authors want to write erotic fiction, and simply use the characters of HP as puppets instead of creating their own characters. I get the mental image of a teenage girl playing with dolls of HP characters, making them kiss and have anatomically impossible sex.
