I can't read stories that don't have a H/G pairing. It's pretty irrational, but in my head, Harry's still the same Harry as in canon, which means that he is with Ginny. Reading about Harry or Ginny being with someone else just feels wrong to me. I get sad that they're not together and that sucks all the fun out of the story.

Sadly, that does limit the amount of fics I can happily read, so I'm pretty burned out of HP fanfics at the moment. Luckily there's millions of other books to read out there instead.
