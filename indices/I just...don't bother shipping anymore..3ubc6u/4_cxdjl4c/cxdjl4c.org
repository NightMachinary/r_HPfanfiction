Sure I read HP for ships. I just don't really try to limit myself to one. Ships are excellent for stories without much meaning or symbolism. Especially in fics that just have characters interact and build a relationship. More often than not, it requires extreme AU and character-in-name-only-ness.

But if you're question was: would I rage quit a fic because, say, a wild Drarry or a Dramione appears? Nah. I'll rage quit a fic for having an overly long word count with way too much exposition sooner.
