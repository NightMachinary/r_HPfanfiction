I have some anti-pairings. I wont read Harry or Hermione paired with Snape or Draco or Voldemort. I also dislike Hermione/Ron though I'll read it if the story is otherwise good. Other than that I'll take what ever. I think Harry can be paired with just about anyone without him being too OOC, its just harder for with some characters. I think Hermione is best paired with someone outside the trio, though Harry/Hermione can work under the right circumstances.

Everything is a trope, you can't have a story without them. That doesn't mean its unoriginal.
