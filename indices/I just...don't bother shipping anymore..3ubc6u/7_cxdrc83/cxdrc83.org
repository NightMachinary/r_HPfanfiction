You might as well label this /The/ FanFiction Dilemma. All mature fans have to deal with it. The mechanism is extremely simple: the majority of fanfiction readers and writers are teens. Crafting good prose is /hard/. So the majority of works fall short, and the majority of fans just obsess with the ship, because those stories are easily digested and enjoyed, somewhat independent of writing quality.

If you're the type of person who just can't get into a piece of writing unless it's /good/, you're doomed to spend most of your time panning through dirt to find the gold, as it were.
