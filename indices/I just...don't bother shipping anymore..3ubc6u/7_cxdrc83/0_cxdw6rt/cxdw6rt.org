True, but in that case, shipping's not the issue. Fandom is a community populated by amateurs - that's the reason it exists in the first place. Fanfiction's a hobby, a social opportunity, not an art for most fans. They don't care about improving. What's more amazing to me is that there /are/ fans who are incredibly talented, and they share their talent freely. I love that.

I'm very character-focused myself, and I'm addicted to certain varieties of shipfic, so I stick like a burr to writers who do it well. I also enjoy genfic, although military, world-conquering, badass Harry (or Draco or Neville) fantasies don't turn my crank, no matter how decent the writer's prose is. So, yeah, I don't bother with those, but I'm glad there are people writing Harry Napoleon and doing a good enough job of it to satisfy the battlefield fans. Fandom is best when it caters to all sorts of tastes.

Teenagers aren't the only awful writers, of course. (And not all teens are bad at it. Some are phenomenally gifted, but they're the exceptions.) Like you said, crafting good prose is hard - it means self-criticism and caring about the end results. Lots of adult fans don't want to put the work in, either. For most folks, fanfic is about squee and instant gratification.

The issue with shipfic is that it vastly outnumbers other kinds of fic, so gen readers have a smaller pool to draw from but the same percentage of awful to good. Which is rough. And without the inbuilt shipping drama, gen writers are forced to come up with a compelling plot that develops convincingly and keeps up the pace. The requirements for writing good genfic are higher, and fewer people have the skill or the staying power to manage it.

(Random off-topic mini-rant: it will always burn me that mainstream publishing rewarded bad writing with a mega-deal, and that the public reinforced their choice. I don't care if people read /Fifty Shades/, I care that it was rubbish fanfic that became a rubbish bestseller. We can all roll our eyes at barely literate teen writers, but E. L. James is an adult who writes as poorly as the teenage stereotype. Sigh. /old rant is old)
