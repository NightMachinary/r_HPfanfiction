I usually don't care unless I'm reading a marauder story, which is mostly James and Lily. Other than that, I could care less about who ends up with who as long as it makes sense /in the story/. I don't mind tropes as long as they feel right for the story, otherwise its just an author liking an idea and throwing it into their story. If it's a lord-potter story where he inherits all these lands and responsibilities, make him be looked down upon from all the other, much older and much more experienced lords. Stuff like that, tropes are cool.
