Linkao3(it's green by Doodled93) fantastic, poignant story with unique point of view - it grows as Harry grows. Harry finds adult that is distantly supportive and slowly that leads to big changes in his life with Dursleys. I just love this fic, sadly it's unfinished and most likely abandoned. Still a worthwhile read.
