I think these three would fit your request the most, from the stories I'm currently aware of.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]]/ --- Harry's two main priorities are to learn magic in its multifaceted forms and to protect his in-group (mostly his lovers). After learning about the prophecy, he grudgingly comes to accept that he'll also have to uproot and kill VD.

  - Pros: worldbuilding, magical lore, some deconstruction of canon's magic and experimentation with magic, derailing from canon stations and travelling;
  - Cons: at least some wishful thinking and cracky elements, (IIRC) intellectually nerfed Dumbledore, unrealistically quickly OPed Harry;
  - Warnings: WiP, smut scenes, harem-ish poly, magical tattoos and rituals, ruthless!Harry.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Unchampion]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Muggle-Raised-Champion][Muggle-Raised Champion]]/ --- harvested from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yqea0/any_stories_in_which_harry_deliberately_flanks/][this thread]]
