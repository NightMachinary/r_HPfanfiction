I've seen those too, there is one that I just cannot remember the name of. Neutral Chaotic is what you want, because then he doesn't really care about either side and simply does what amuses him.

I'm really bad at keeping track of fics, but there is one where he spent eons simply f'ing with the timeline in various different ways just to see what would happen. I mean thousands of years, and then something happens where he meets someone(super vague yes, but I cannot recall the details). He had no empathy for people any longer, and simply did it for entertainment value.
