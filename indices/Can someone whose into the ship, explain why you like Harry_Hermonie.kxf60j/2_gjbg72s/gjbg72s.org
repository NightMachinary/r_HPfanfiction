I am not into the Harry/Hermonie ship. I have been, and always will be on the Harry/Ginny ship. Always.

There is an entire essay on Why Hermione is Not the Right Girl for Harry. But people don't read.

At a most fundamental level, i think people believe, Harry is the male protagonist character, Hermione is the female protagonist character, therefore they have to end up together. If not that they haven't read the books, and only watched the movies, in which Ginny is almost non existent, and they can't fathom Harry being with Ginny.
