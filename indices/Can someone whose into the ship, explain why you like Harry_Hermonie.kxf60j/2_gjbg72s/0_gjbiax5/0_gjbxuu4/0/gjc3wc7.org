She said that Harry and Hermione should have been the endgame. The lasf half of what I said is based on reading an article. I have nothing against the canon pairing of Harry/Ginny.

It was just something that I didnt want to happen about 15 years ago when I read the books. I cant remember which book it may have been OOTP, but Hermione/Ron virtually argued that entire book. Then I think HBP could have been summed up as the little monster in Harry's chest.
