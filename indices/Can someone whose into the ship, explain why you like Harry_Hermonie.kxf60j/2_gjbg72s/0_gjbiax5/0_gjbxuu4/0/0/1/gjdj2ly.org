People feel like it's terrible to consider Harry/Hermione. Realistically you could have written anybody in Ginny's place. Ginny was easier to write into that position by nature of him seeing her a lot over the summer.

I have no problem with Harry/Ginny. It was the obvious choice, if not Hermione the only other girl he would have significant interaction with is Ginny, then further down is Cho, and then Luna.
