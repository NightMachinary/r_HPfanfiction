I am not on the Harry/Ginny. JKR even states that Harry/Ginny was more her unwillingness to change her original plan. She actually agrees that Harry would have been better off with Hermione. I read all 7 books about 15 years ago. I never finished the movies. Ginny in the books start playing more a role I believe in book five. Also, there's an article that counters ypurs and shows comparatively that Harry has glowing words for both. However, the thing is that Harry had so few friends growing up that he couldnt see Hermione as nothing but.
