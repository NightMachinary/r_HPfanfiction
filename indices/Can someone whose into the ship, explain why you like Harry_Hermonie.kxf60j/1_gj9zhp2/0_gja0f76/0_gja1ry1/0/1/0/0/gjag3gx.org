I get it, I thought you wee talking about the trope where Tonks hides her true form for some reason or another. I think I've got a kind of cool-counter idea to this one though. What if we reverse it, and end up with a Harry who accepts Tonks, with all the random changes of appearance included? You'd have to build it in, but I bet it could work.
