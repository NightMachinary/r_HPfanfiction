I can see Tonks not wanting to date someone who wants her to ALWAYS fit into their ideal of beauty, but the "true form" bit always makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. It's such a shame because it takes a tiny bit of work to turn it into something good. For example, metamorphs have no "true form". Instead, they have a constantly-shifting case of body dismorphia. Tonks, having spent years dealing with people who want her to always meet their standards of beauty, wants to date someone who won't reject her for being herself when she doesn't meet their desires.
