Ah, I suppose I should clarify that by 'True Form Tonks', I specifically mean the part where Tonks hates being used for her abilities. She's always been seen as an object, and then all of a sudden when Harry asks to see her true form, Tonks goes gaga over him, etc.

In my headcanon regarding Honks, Tonks is perfectly fine in using her abilities however and whenever, as she sees it as being who she is. Being a Metamorphmagus is her identity (however ironic that may sound), so she likely won't get angsty when people mostly see her for that.
