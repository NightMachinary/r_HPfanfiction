I can't name any good Honks fics either. The tropes are bad, but I can almost forgive the True Form Tonks trope sometimes.

The idea that she's actually supposed to be short, but makes herself taller explains her clumsiness. But you know what would be great? Her actual height is like 1.89m, and she makes herself shorter.

But when it turns into, 'let me show you my true form,' kind of stuff I want to hard pass. It just doesn't make that much sense.
