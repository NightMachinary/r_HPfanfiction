Tonks has a true form in my fic, but I didn't make a thing of it. She morphed into it accidently, when she was emotionally distressed, and only once for a moment.

It just so happens to very closely resemble her aunt Bella, and her mother Andie. My Harry surmised that was the reason why Tonks prefers to wear the clothes she does, and have that pink, spiky hair. ðŸ˜„
