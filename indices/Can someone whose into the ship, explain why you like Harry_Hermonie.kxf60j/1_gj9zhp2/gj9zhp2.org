Sometimes the best relationships are born out of close friendship. That's my reasoning as to why. Harry and Hermione are different from each other, but they are best friends. If you add in attraction, you get a relationship. Sure, Hermione can't be everything Harry might want, she doesn't like Quidditch, and Harry can't provide the kind of academia, etc., etc., but that's not really necessary for a good relationship. All you need to do is tweak Harry from, 'loves her as a sister,' to, 'wants to be with her romantically,' and you end up with an interesting fic. Does that help? Or is there anything else?

I can't help with the soulbond and true love people, I find them weird.
