  Do you seriously think Hermione would be happy with an immature arse like Ron? They barely have a functional friendship through the books and I'm supposed to believe they'll have a functional marriage which includds children?
#+end_quote

Wut? Classic Harmony shipper who hate Ron.

  Ron Weasley and his infamous temper and jealousy. If he hates being overshadowed by his brothers or Harry's fame, don't you think he will also hate the fact that Hermione is far more intelligent than he is? That does not sound like a base for a good marriage.
#+end_quote

Ron already knew that Hermione is more intelligent than him. He never feel insecure about it in the whole ass 7 books. He compliments her intelligence and brains many times even more than Harry. He quit his dream auror job to support his wife and children so that Hermione could persue her dreams. When you made some claim at least back it up.

  How about the wedding scene in the book? When Hermione's sat by her "love interest" turns and beams tearfully at harry during the vows?
#+end_quote

How the f/ck, Hermione turns towards Harry and not Ron. How the f/ck did you concludes that Hermione was sitting between the two boys and turns towards Harry only. She could have been in the corner and turned towards both boys. And even if she did turns towards Harry, how the f*uck it's romantic. She and Harry were the only one in the wedding with muggle background. It's the first time they were attending a wizards wedding and it's quite possible that she is overwhelmed with emotions. Turned towards Harry like are you overwhelmed too.

  The reason can be found in book 6 after Harry used Sectumsempra on Draco: While Hermione tries to talk some sense into Harry's head, Ginny feels the need to attack Hermione. Because Ginny is a fangirl to whom everything Harry does is right, even nearly murdering Draco. So while Hermione tries her best to keep Harry's feet on the ground, Ginny actually thinks it's OK when Harry shows the world what he's like at his worst.
#+end_quote

Ginny doesn't think it's okay. Harry was already beating himself about this and he needs someone to say it's not entirely his fault instead of Hermione's told you so attitude. That's why he was grateful when Ginny defended him.

#+begin_quote
  which in fact is the ONLY reason why Ginny loves him, making her a total mismatch
#+end_quote

What a bs

#+begin_quote
  And then I haven't even mentioned the most emotional two moments in the book. Harry rarely shows his emotions, so what does it tell us he totally breaks down in book 5 when he thinks Hermione is dead? Call it whatever you want, I call it love.
#+end_quote

Are you serious??? Do you expect Harry to be emotion less when one of his best friend dies in front of him?? Or did you forgot how Harry reacted to Ron's poisoning??

  Interestingly, I found a quote by JK "I wish they werent so popular, so I could go back and change things"...
#+end_quote

Where is the quote. Back it up with original source. Don't be like Dr*mione shippers who say bs in the name of JKR.
