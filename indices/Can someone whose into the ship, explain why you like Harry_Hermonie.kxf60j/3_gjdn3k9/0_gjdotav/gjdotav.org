Well idk I guess I just disagree. Harry was panicking after what he did to Draco and Hermonie's attitude wasn't helping, so Ginny stepped in to back him up. I don't think Ginny only loved him because he was famous Harry Potter, that's why she crushed on him when she was like 11 but she grew out of that and dated other people, only going back to Harry cuz she loved him.

Here's my problem, the most important part of a relationship is the ability to spend lots of time together alone and still enjoy the company of each other. But when Harry and Hermonie do that, in book4 when Ron is gone and in book7 when Ron is gone, Harry just doesn't enjoy himself. He still gets along with Hermonie but he doesn't have that fun with her that he has with Ron or Ginny. They aren't interested in the same things for fun
