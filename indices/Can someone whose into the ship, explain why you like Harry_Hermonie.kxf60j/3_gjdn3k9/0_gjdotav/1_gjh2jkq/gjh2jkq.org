  But when Harry and Hermonie do that, in book4 when Ron is gone and in book7 when Ron is gone, Harry just doesn't enjoy himself.

I think you're being unfair. Harry not enjoying himself in the middle of a dangerous tournament or in the middle of a warzone seems par for course to me. I've always read that as less about him not enjoying Hermione's presence and more about Ron's absence aggravating already dire circumstances.

And he does have fun with her. As we see in their library conversation about Filch and Madam Pince where they both laugh themselves silly. It is true that Hermione and Harry do not enjoy the same things, but I think it misrepresents their relationship to state that "he doesn't have fun with her as he has with Ron and Ginny".
