  I think the two of them simply have different love languages
#+end_quote

I think this is one-half of their dynamic.

  And honestly, if I were raised by Petunia, I'd react like that to any form of nagging too.
#+end_quote

And I think this is the other half.

Either way, Harry doesn't appreciate a lot of the ways Hermione expresses her love (especially since it's less fun and more of the life-saving kind), and he takes her help and presence for granted. But I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree here.

  I'm someone with avoidant attachment who finds attraction extremely important
#+end_quote

Same hat - at least on the avoidant attachment.

But really I do think that fandom will be infinitely more fun if we all just accept that different things work for different people. Harry/Ginny works for you in a way that doesn't work for me, and I see things in Harry/Hermione that you don't quite too. And really, neither of us is wrong for liking one ship more than the other. It's just a matter of preference. *shrug*

Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to rant about my ship! I had fun writing about them!
