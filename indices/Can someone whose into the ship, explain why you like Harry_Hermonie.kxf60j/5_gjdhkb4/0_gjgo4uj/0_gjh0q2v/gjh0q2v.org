  But does Harry need to have romantic feelings for Hermione or to constantly think about how great she is in order for us to know that he genuinely appreciates her?

Full disclosure: I'm aroace - I fall in the school of attraction isn't necessary for anything. My fascination had always been more in line with the intensity of their emotional connection as opposed to any attraction they might feel for each other (this is usually the argument of the canon shippers - that they have never expressed attraction to each other). SO to answer the first part of your question, I do believe that romantic feelings is wholly unnecessary.

(And before this confuses anyone, I'm just going to go on record and say that I /don't/ necessarily envision their relationship to be romantic - just that it's their singularly /most important relationship/.)

For the second part, the thing about Harry and Hermione is that, in canon, they have a largely unequal relationship. Harry had, by and large, preferred people like Ron and Ginny over Hermione. He prefers to have fun and often resents how she asks him to focus on the mission or asks him to be cautious. For as much as Harry represents duty to Hermione, Hermione represents the mission to Harry as well. The difference between them is that Hermione embraces her duty wholeheartedly while Harry resents it even as he moves to fulfill it. He loves her but doesn't fully appreciate the way she's been keeping her alive - at least not in the same way he appreciates the way Ron and Ginny bring levity into his life,

So for the second part of the question, yes, I do believe that Harry has to do some serious introspection about Hermione's place in his life and their relationship. More than that, I need him to /act/ on that introspection. It's only then that I'll be satisfied that he appreciates her enough.

  The ones who had a crush on Emma Watson are straightforward but I've also seen many who seem to relate to Hermione on a personal level and resent Harry for falling for the sexy Cool Girl instead.

First and foremost, I'm going to admit that I'm pretty new to the fandom and have missed most of the ship wars. I only know the very surface of the prevailing arguments for both sides. More than that, I can't speak for other Harmione shippers. All the opinions you see here are mine and mine alone. (If anything, I suspect my particular reading for Harmione would be pretty unpopular in most Harmione spaces.)

That said, I actually fall in neither camp. First, again I'm aroace. Second, I don't actually dislike Harry/Ginny as a ship. The ship is cute if poorly written and underdeveloped. Harry and Ginny are quite attracted to each other, but other than that, we don't actually see much of their relationship. As someone incredibly unimpressed with attraction, the relationship just doesn't suit my tastes or my needs.

Contrast to Harry and Hermione's relationship. Godric's Hallow is arguably one of the most emotionally intense and intimate scenes of the entire series. It's the two of them against the world, and they have no one else to turn to for comfort except each other. Harry comes /home/, and he stands in front of his parents' graves for the very first time with nothing to offer them but his grief and desperation. And it's Hermione who shares that moment with him. It's Hermione who gives him something to offer. In that moment of despair, it's Hermione who is Harry's reprieve and safe harbor.

When it comes to emotional intimacy, I've found that no other pairing matches Harry and Hermione when it comes to intensity. When it comes to [[https://www.thoughtco.com/romanticism-definition-4777449][romanticism]], Harry and Hermione's relationship beats nearly every pairing by a mile. Their relationship is characterized by grief, duty, and desperation. There is an immensely complicated love between them - one they both have difficulty conveying and yet desperately trying to anyway. Their relationship is a tense dance because they are incredibly different people - and yet they never fail to come together when it matters most. Because that's what their love does.

I've said this already in the grandparent post, but I think it bears repeating. Harry and Hermione's relationship is a trainwreck. I don't deny that. But it is precisely /because/ they are a trainwreck that I love them so.

(I hope this clarifies things for you!)
