I've written about this before. Here you go:

Harmione is my guilty pleasure ship because it's such a trainwreck. They are codependent and poorly matched, and yet still so desperately trying to love the other in the only ways they know how. They can't communicate for shit, and they want drastically different things, but it's always been Hermione who stayed and Harry she chose, so they step into a relationship even if everything feels wrong.

Anyway, in my daydreams, I love concocting ways wherein Harry finally learns to freaking appreciate Hermione, and Hermione at long last gets that she matters just as much as everyone else she's been trying to take care of. I've no doubt that it'll take a near tragedy to get them to anywhere close to healthy, but I desperately want it anyway. I have no clue if I even ship them romantically, but in my head, they are and will always be each other's ONE.
