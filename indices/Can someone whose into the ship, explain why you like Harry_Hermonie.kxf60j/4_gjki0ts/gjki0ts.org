My two knuts: Harry/Hermione could have worked out well if one or preferably both of them were a bit better. If Harry stepped up his work ethic and better appreciated Hermione's dedication to study. If Hermione learned to listen more sympathetically. If Harry embraced a bit more Slytherin cunning and worked through existing channels and authority figures more often, instead of striking out to fix problems himself. If Hermione loosened up to laugh more.

So I think it's a popular pairing partially because if you see the characters make mistakes and wish that they could do better, then you're wishing for a world where Harry/Hermione is feasible.
