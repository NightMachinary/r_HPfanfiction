Lets take the assumption that literally everyone travels back in time. Here is a list of events what I think that would happen.

1. Harry goes back in time, doing a ritual but something goes wrong sending everyone back in time.
2. Rita skeeter publishes an article with information she is unaware everyone else knows. (Sirius is innocent, Crouch escaped, Dumbledore's past).
3. The government is already in chaos with everyone knowing what has happened.
4. Pettigrew is caught by the weasleys and Sirius gets free. He goes out to find Harry.
5. Two days after the time-travel, harry sees Sirius and is perplexed that he is free. He quickly discovers what is going on.
6. I have no idea what will happen with education, etc but I guess we will see worldwide changes in laws. This is not only in the wizarding world but also in the muggle world as literally everyone traveled back in time.

If this is written, I guess it is best to start with scene 1 and 5 and do the rest in flashbacks.

If you want to write a less crack-fic story, I would advice having only key-players have knowledge from the future and have a rule that you can't tell others you traveled back in time. Finally, balance the time travel between the good and bad side. This would add more suspense and would create a more engaging story. After all, you never know who traveled back in time.
