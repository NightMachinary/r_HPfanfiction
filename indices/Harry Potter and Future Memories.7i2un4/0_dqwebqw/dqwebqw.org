I dreamed about this once, it was ruddy brilliant. Something like it would probably be a total rehash of cannon or so AU it is unrecognizable. Would definitely require some thought, though, with everyone knowing - especially the deceased Head of the Auroras and the no longer dead, very dangerous people like Mad Eye or Bellatrix who would have a vendetta and know who to avoid. Lucius, though, after everything that happened to him under Riddle, I wouldn't be surprised if, with some amount of madness tinging his perception, he burned the diary himself.

The surviving Death Eaters would probably know that their magnanimous leader wasn't everything he claimed to be, causing dissent; that is if the disembodied wraith ever got his body back. If he did manage to posses someone or some such, it would probably be a mad dash for the horcuxes - since Tom probably knows they know.

Then you have an entire generation of children who are much older than they appear, which would cause so much trouble with the schooling system. There would be 7-10 year old magical children who have already finished their entire education, who have aged a decade in a moment. Depending when he ended back up at, you might have people like Pandora Lovegood who never die. That alone is enough to substantiate some AU stories.

tl;dr - It would be so much to think about but almost certainly amazing.
