The way I see it is, Harry had the visual memories which he then tried to bury. I don't have the visual memory in the first place.

So while Snape was trying to force Harry to un-repress a memory which he was consciously trying to hide, it would be an entirely different proposition to uncover a memory which I don't think I can see in the first place.
