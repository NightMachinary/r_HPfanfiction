Very very likely. In canon I feel like he would just go to Dumbledore and say that Harry is as prepared as he ever will be to stop any further Remedial Potions Classes.

In fanon it depends on the fanfic you're reading. He could think he is a golem, or already possessed by You Know Who or any number of things.
