Canonically, Legitimacy doesn't seem to allow you to know the context of what you're seeing, but we only see it used from the perspective of someone it's being used on- from Harry's perspective (Correct me if I'm wrong, its been a while haha).

So Snape would presumably get a rush of emotions but no context. It's easier to discern context from a visual image than from a rush of random emotions, even if its just flashes of memories, so presumably Snape wouldn't know why I was embarrassed, I think.
