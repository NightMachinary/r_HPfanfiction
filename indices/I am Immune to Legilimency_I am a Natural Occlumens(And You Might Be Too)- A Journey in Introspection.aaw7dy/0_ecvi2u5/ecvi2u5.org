Legilimency is not limited to seeing images (and indeed, I would hesitate to say that is its primary use). For example, in the Harry vs Snape duel at the end of HBP, Snape states that he knows via legilimency what incantation Harry is going to use before he uses it.

Not only is an incantation not an image, it would also be extremely distracting to Snape if he was seeing a load of images from Harry's mind while simultaneously duelling.

Another example is that Voldemort always knows when someone is lying via legilimency.
