While I'm by no means an expert in aphantasia, I think you need to be careful in distinguishing memories from visualisation.

As I understand it, you still see things and remember what you have seen. It's just that you can't visualise the memory. For example, I can ask you what colour the sky was yesterday and you would be able to respond "blue" or "grey". You wouldn't be able to see the colour in your "mind's eye" but you would know the colour as a fact. So the visual information is still part of your episodic memory. The problem is not in the storage of information but rather in the representation of it. But with legilimency and pensieves, the subject's mind is not doing the representation work. The legilimens/pensieve are going directly to the memory and reading that using their own representation apparatus.

Indeed, pensieves contain information which isn't in your memory anyway so I think they would definitely work. And I suspect legilimency would still be able to access visual information, even though the subject themselves couldn't visualise it. So long as the /legilimens/ doesn't have aphantasia, they should still be able to see it using their own mind's eye.

In any event, like I say, there's far more in a person's head than images. There's your semantic memory (knowledge of facts etc.) as well as non-visual episodic memory (memories of sounds, smells, etc. as well as factual "summary" recollections of information which was originally visual). All that is still open to a legilimens even if they can't access visual info.
