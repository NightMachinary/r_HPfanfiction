I feel like there's a contradiction in your argument with this post, specifically this part:

#+begin_quote
  My only disagreement is whether the Legilimens/Pensieve would be able to access a memory in a form which isn't available to the subject himself.
#+end_quote

I think that even if we accept this frase 100% then it doesn't matter because there is a lot more in your mind than just images (which if I'm understanding aphantasia correctly are the only thing you can't... mentalize? Imagine? I can't think of the correct word hahahaha) like Taure mentions above, but you don't address that point (unless that's what you meant by "I totally get your argument"), so I don't think you could reasonably state that having aphantasia makes you a natural occlumens/immune to legilimency.

​

The only situation I could think of it being... hmmm useful to the plot I guess is if the character was in a room with someone they didn't know, a legilimens wouldn't be able to identify this person based on what they know since they would only have the facts in your head (I imagine that by searching for a specific memory they would instead get the hard facts about the situation that you mentioned below).

​

P.S. While I was typing this I also thought of several questions that I can't find an answer I trust due to their being very little research on this, do you mind if I pm them to you? They're mostly about the scope of what you can and can't imagine/remember.
