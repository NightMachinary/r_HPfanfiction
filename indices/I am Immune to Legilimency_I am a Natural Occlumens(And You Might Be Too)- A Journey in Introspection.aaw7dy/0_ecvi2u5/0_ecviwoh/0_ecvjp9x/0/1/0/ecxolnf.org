Right so what I was trying to say (badly) was that a Legilimancer would not be able to access a memory in image form if the person with Aphantasia didn't have the memory in visual form in the first place.

So, as I've personally realized, the restriction on Legilimency is purely visual in nature for a person with Aphantasia. Ofc, as I've stated I get my memories in the form of hard facts.

However that's not the only form of memory retention for Aphantasia apparently. I was talking with another person on this thread who realized he might have Aphantasia after reading this and he said that his memory was emotional in nature i.e. when he remembers an embarrassing memory he remembers the feeling of embarrassment rather than the actual memory along with it.

Yeah sure go ahead and PM me no problem.
