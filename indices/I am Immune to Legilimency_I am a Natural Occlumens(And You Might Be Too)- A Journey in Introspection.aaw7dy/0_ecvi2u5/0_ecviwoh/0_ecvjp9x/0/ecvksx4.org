I totally get your argument. My only point of disagreement is whether the Legilimens/Pensieve would be able to access a memory in a form which isn't available to the subject himself.

From personal experience, I can describe my memories but I can't see them. I personally don't think that a Legilimens or Pensieve would be able to convert a memory into a format which it doesn't exist in for the subject with Aphantasia but that's depends on your interpretation I feel.
