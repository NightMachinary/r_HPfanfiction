Right for the Pensieve, you say that

The magic of the pensieve is such that you can explore a memory beyond the limits of what the subject originally perceived: it shows you what actually happened in a place and time, not simply the perception of an individual whose memory you are in.

1) If it shows you what actually happened in a place or time, then what is the need for the memory extracted from someone's mind in the first place. Surely I couldn't take the memory of someone in Australia on 9/11 and then somehow reach the World Trade Center to experience what is happening there.

The Pensieve must have some limits( time and/or space) and those limits have to revolve around the victim whose memories are used.

2) Suppose a Pensieve allows you to perceive a 1000% of what the subject perceived his memory as. If he had Aphantasia and his perception was 0, then obviously the Pensieve would be unable to perceive anything.

As for the Legilimancer, I feel like a Legilimancer of enough quality would be able to read the mind of Harry without him being aware given he is useless at it. So I don't get that argument completely. The fact that Harry doesn't have an inner film reel doesn't mean that Voldemort doesn't see it.
