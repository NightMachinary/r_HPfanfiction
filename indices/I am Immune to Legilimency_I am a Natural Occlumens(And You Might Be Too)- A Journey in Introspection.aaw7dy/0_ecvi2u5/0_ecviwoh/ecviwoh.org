My answer is kinda weird I guess. How do you think? A visual thinker who hypothetically has Aphantasia is pretty immune I imagine. But I feel that argument can be countered easily by someone smarter than me.

If I concede that thoughts of a person at that particular moment are accessible to Legilimancers(?), then how about memories. A Legilimens surely can't access the memories of a person with Aphantasia.

If Snape had Aphantasia then Harry surely wouldn't have been able to see the whole bullying incident.

Actually, on further thinking a Pensieve is entirely useless for someone with Aphantasia.

Sidenote, I'm a big fan.
