  Aphantasia is the suggested name for a condition where one does not possess a functioning mind's eye and cannot voluntarily visualize imagery.

Wait, when other people imagine things they can *literally* see them when they close their eyes?! Could I have Aphantasia? I had no idea this is even a thing. I've always had trouble visualizing faces as well... when I don't have them in front of me.

This is so weird... I'm freaking out right now. Maybe I can see some kind of abstraction, so I might be on a 1 or 2 on that scale. I always thought "close your eyes and imagine X in your mind's eye" was just a newagey way to say "it's easier to concentrate on the thing you are thinking about this way". It isn't supposed to be mostly black?

Edit: Also when imagining the characters or locations of a book I don't have any concrete visualizations. Is that part of it? I can only tell you after watching a movie adaption whether the depiction fits or is wrong to how I would have imagined it. Before that characters are not really... well defined... besides through the words.
