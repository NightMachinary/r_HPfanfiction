*TL/DR: I think you don't have aphantasia because you didn't instantly recognize that this is the way your brain works. Also there's a third level of reading you might not know about.*

I think the easiest way for you to see if this is you actually having aphantasia (which keep in mind we know super little about) is to compare it to something else that might be easier to grasp.

​

So there's this thing called sub-vocalization, which has to do with reading. Theoretically you learn to read first by reading out loud, then you learn how to keep your mouth shut and "say" the words in your head via your stream of consciousness. There's a "third level" which some people never get to, when you reach this level you just look at a word and your brain understands what the word is, without having to "say it" inside you're head.

Someone did an experiment and the people who never reach the third level are still moving their vocal chords, even though they're not talking and you can't really hear anything, they're still vocalizing the words they read but you can't hear it so, sub-vocalization.

Now the thing that's *relevant to this conversation* is that in my experience when you ask someone if they're a subvocalizer (mostly by asking do you always have a voice in your head when you read) they either instantly say "Yes, how do you read without the little voice", or they waffle a bit and get lost in the metaness of the question "Do I do that? I'm not sure".

​

So it might be helpful to think of aphantasia the same way. The other people I've seen commenting here and on other places about the same topic seem to be either "Today I learned", ""Wait do I have this? Like I don't see things when I close my eyes." or instant belief "Wow I didn't even know I had this". Just like with sub-vocalizing I would guess that the only people who actually have it are the people who instantly realize that they've had it all their lives, since it's an experience that you can't prove/quantify (at least in a regular setting in regards to sub-vocalizing, and maybe aphantasia in the future), but you would instantly recognize a description of how your brain works.
