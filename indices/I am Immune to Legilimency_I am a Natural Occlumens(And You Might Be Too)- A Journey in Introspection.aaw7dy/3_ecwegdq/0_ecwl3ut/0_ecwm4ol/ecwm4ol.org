Right. But I wouldn't compare thinking about the taste or imagining the taste of something to tasting. Maybe I'm completely messed up though? I'm not tasting anything when I do that...

But from what I gather there's supposed to be actual imagery when imagining something visual. So, when I think about / imagine a footballer tackling another guy, I don't think there's a functional difference for me whether I do that with open eyes or closed. But I get the impression that for most other people there's supposed to be a little movie playing out in their head? Do you just pick the color of their outfits at random and stuff.. or is your brain just doing that for you? Like in a dream? This is fascinating...

PS: Am I supposed to have a mind's ear too?! I listen to a *lot* of music, but I only ever hear music when I'm listening to it or when singing/whistling. This shit is so confusing.
