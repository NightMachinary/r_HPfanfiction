  Wait, when other people imagine things they can literally see them when they close their eyes?!

No, not literally in the sense of "indistinguishable from vision". It's still in your head -- people don't see a mental image with their eyes. It's no different from thinking about how a thing tastes. You can recall it as an idea, you may even begin to salivate, but you don't literally taste it in your mouth.
