Right. But you wouldn't be able to draw the exact shape of the apple then right? Like it's not perfectly round and all the subtleties of the roundness are hard to remember as pure informational facts, I feel like it would take a lot more "memory" to write out every detail of an apple's shape than to store the image, for example. Or do you literally remember it as something like, indentation on the top, round shape along the side, but less round as you approach the bottom, indent slightly on the bottom, etc.
