If anything, I wonder if aphants would be terrible at Occlumency. Like, you know how people tell you to go to your ‘happy place' and you might visualise a beach? If you can't do that, that tactic wouldn't work. Snape tells Harry to clear his mind, but as someone with aphantasia, it's always blank visually. It's a running chatter of my inner thoughts. I feel like it would be frustrating for someone with aphantasia to clear their minds, just like it can be frustrating to try and imagine your ‘happy place'.

Perhaps we need to write a Occlumency book for aphants?

Idk. Just my 2 cents. But a fun thought! Thank you!
