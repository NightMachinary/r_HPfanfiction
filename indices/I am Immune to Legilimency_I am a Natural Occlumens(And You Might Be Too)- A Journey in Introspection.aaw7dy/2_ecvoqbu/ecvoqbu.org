I do not have aphantasia, but that doesn't mean I visualise all my memories. I feel like it would be pretty weird if I would have to do that, it'd take a lot of time to always have a picture to be able to remember a random fact.

In fact most times I just "hear" a voice in my head that just "tells" me what I want to remember. I use quotes because it isn't because I'm crazy, just the same as visualising, but hearing it instead.

My -theory-, would therefore be that all manners of memories can be understood by a legilimens, but you have to do it in the medium the recipient of your spell. That's why he would be able to "read" the mind in a duel, he hears the name of spell before it is cast.

If so, you would probably be somewhat protected from legilimency.
