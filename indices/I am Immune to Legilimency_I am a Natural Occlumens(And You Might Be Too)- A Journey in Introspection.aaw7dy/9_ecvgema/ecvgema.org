Nice try.

Legilimency is the art of reading thoughts and memories, not mental pictures. Unless you're retarded and can't think, you'd be susceptible to legilimency.

It's described as images because Harry associates his memories as images and flashing scenes - if he had this condition Aphantasia that you spoke of, he'd associate thoughts and memories with something else and Snape would get the information regardless.

Quick personal question though, what do you associate your memories with? Say the memory of your first paycheck or graduation? What goes through you when you think of that moment?
