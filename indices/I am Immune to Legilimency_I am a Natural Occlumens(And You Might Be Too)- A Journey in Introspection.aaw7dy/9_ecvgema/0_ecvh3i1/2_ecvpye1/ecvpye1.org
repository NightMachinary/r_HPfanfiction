I am not an expert, per se, but I did study memory and similar conditions extensively. The best way I know how to explain something is with a metaphor or story. What I say below is not meant to judge or cast opinion.

​

Metaphor time:

You and your friend both have the same TV, the same console on which you play movies, all the way down to the same batteries for the remote. You both go to the same store where he purchases the movie and agrees to watch it and give it to you to watch the next day, after which, you will meet up to discuss it. When you do, your friend is describing the scenes and recalling how impressive the visuals were and asking if you remember that one part where the hero does something amazing. You can, and you can't. Your memory of the movie is more focused on the associated information (facts, figures, etc.). How can this be? You both have the exact same setup at home to watch the movie. You both watched the same movie. You both used the same exact disc. Why the disconnect?

The one difference is in the setting of your TV. His is factory default. Your's is set to "Aphantasia" mode. See where I'm going with this?

​

On memory:

Memory is just chemicals. Seriously, look it up. Whatever someone remembers is legitimately a chemical reaction to spur the pictures, words, and information of said memory. How it is interpreted is dependent on the user. And yes, stronger memories are tied to strong feelings of emotion. This is because emotions are also chemical reactions in the brain. Not everyone has strong feelings of emotion in the same way. I may feel an enormous amount of joy with my first pay check, where someone else may feel that the receipt of their first paycheck is perfunctory (boring). This influences the strength of memories strictly on emotion. Long term memory is also different than short term memory, but I have not read enough lately to speak intelligently to that, so I will leave it alone.

​

Let's take my example of TVs before and call You Person A, and your friend Person B. If instead of a movie, we instead substitute a chemical memory, the way that person A remembers it differs from Person B. Where person B can easily recall and visualize in their mind's eye, whereas person A is able to recall the facts and information without the visualization.

​

Knowing this and tying it all together with the assumption that Harry had Aphantasia, I would say that Snape would still be able to use Legilimency on Harry effectively. Ultimately, Snape is extracting the chemical memory from Harry and viewing it on his own unaffected hardware. It would be like in the TV metaphor above. Snape is merely taking the disc (raw data) from Harry and playing it on his own TV (Mind's Eye). He would, in fact, be viewing the memories for the first time since their creation in this format. This would make Harry more prone to being at risk to Legilimency used on him since he wouldn't think that his memories could be viewed since he couldn't view them (hubris).
