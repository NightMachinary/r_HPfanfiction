I'll answer the personal question first I guess.

I know facts about what happened on the day I graduated. I know that I was wearing an ugly af cap. I just can't see it. I can describe it. Just can't remember it.

So for the Legilimency, how else do other people see memories besides as images. If I mention the TARDIS to you, I'm pretty sure from what I've observed that the first thing in your head will be the photo of the blue police box as you remember it from the show.

As far as I interpreted Legilimency you read thoughts and memories by looking at the images. If there are no images how do you read them?
