We see people use Legilimency to read current non-visual thoughts, such as lies or incantations. Therefore, lack of visual memory would not make you immune to Legilimency.

Also, how do you know visual memories aren't stored in your head, and that you're simply unable to access them? You don't have to be actively thinking of something for a Legilimens to see it, after all.
