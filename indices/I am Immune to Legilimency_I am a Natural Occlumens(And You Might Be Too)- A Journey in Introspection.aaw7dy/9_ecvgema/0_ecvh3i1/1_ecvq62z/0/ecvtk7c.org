I agree with your first point on this. I have aphantasia and I've got a running dialogue in my head which Snape or Voldemort would have no problem listening to. They might even enjoy it because there wouldn't be a visual component included to distract them. Just because there are no pictures in my brain doesn't mean that there isn't anything going on up there for them to pick up on.

For the second part, I feel like you would be a good researcher! Memory for aphantasia isn't understood very well, in fact, only within the last 15 years or so has there been any research on the matter. I don't think we know if aphants are able to encode a visual component for a memory or if we just can't access it. For instance, I know my dad has brown eyes, crooked teeth, and tan skin, but I can't bring a picture up in my mind. Do I have a picture floating around in my noggin? Perhaps! Or perhaps I don't. I'd love to see more research done on the matter. I think it would be quite interesting!
