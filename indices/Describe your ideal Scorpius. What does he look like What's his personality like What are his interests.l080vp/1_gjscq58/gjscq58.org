I write Scorpius quite a lot! Here's my head canon:

-He looks like Draco (blond, grey eyes)

-He's a Slytherin

-He plays Chaser (same as Albus)

-He's more easygoing than Draco, a good student, witty, likes teasing people and is really overdramatic

-He has a sweet tooth but is really bad at baking/cooking

-He's good at dueling

-His worst subject is Arithmancy

-He plays the pipe organ (Astoria made him learn)

... but I also love reading a shy Ravenclaw Scorpius, even though that's not how I personally imagine him!
