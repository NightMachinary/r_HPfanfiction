In fics, he's generally portrayed as very soft, clever, nerdy and bookish, and sometimes anxious or needing approval from his dad and peers. He's contrasted a bit with Albus, who's always his best friend and almost always his love interest, because Albus is usually a little more reserved, sometimes sullen, and introverted. I tend to agree with those characterizations. Scorpius usually softens Draco up a bit too. Overall, he's a nice boy with geek tendencies.
