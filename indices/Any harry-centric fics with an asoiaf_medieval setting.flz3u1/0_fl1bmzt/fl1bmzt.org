#+begin_quote
  In a world called Albion, there were four rulers; fair and just. That fairy tale is over; a new one begins. Harry Potter is an orphan-boy, wandering through the world alone, ignorant of the power that dwells deep within him. But, when the Dark Lord arrives to rip his heart out for the Queen, he learns that he is the rightful heir of a kingdom lost.
