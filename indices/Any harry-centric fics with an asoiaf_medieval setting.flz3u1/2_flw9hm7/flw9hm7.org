There are a few stories that I believe can fit those features, I hope.

1. linkao3(The Dragon's Rebirth) - this one is very well written
2. linkao3(Tomb of the First Men)
3. linkffn(Starfall Prince)
4. linkao3(The Dancing Dragon)
5. linkao3(Howl by molmcmahon)
6. linkao3(Midnight Sun by molmcmahon)
7. â€‹

Check out Kelorus, because he has a few GOT/ASOIAF and Harry Potter slash crossovers.

I know fewer gen fics than het/slash but the filtering feature works fine on ao3

also shameless self-promotion - sorry - perhaps you shouldn't read this - this is a warning
