A "journalist" posted an article on New York Times about child pornography on Pornhub. Apparently, less than 200 videos were uploaded over a time of 3 years. This caused Visa and Mastercard to stop accepting payments to Pornhub. This caused Pornhub to delete ~80% of all videos without even a notice. Meanwhile, 11 million photos and videos with CP were deleted from Facebook over a period of 6 months.
