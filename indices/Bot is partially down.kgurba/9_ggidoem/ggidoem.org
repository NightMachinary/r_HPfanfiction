Yup, Causes FanFicFare plugin for Calibre to fail too, reporting 403.

I'm not sure if FFF uses the API, or if it's working off of the user-agent, but the only workaround I've found for now is using the archive functionality of ff2ebook, which is good for the function of adding new stories, but of updating them.
