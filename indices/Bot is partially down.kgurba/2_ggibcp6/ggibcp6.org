AO3 hasn't worked for a long time in my experience. Whenever I linkao3() it just doesn't work. Unless it was recently fixed?

EDIT: This was the last attempt I made: [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kceai8/looking_for_recs_young_snape_stories_please/gfpue0i/?context=3]]

I later removed the linkao3() later since it clearly didn't work, but what I typed was "linkao3(The Hogwarts Potions Professor)".
