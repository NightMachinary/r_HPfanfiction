[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]: If Harry Potter took part in the world of James Bond and Hogwarts were a school for spies. Complete, covers the full seven years. A little darker as well - the trio racks up quite the body count.

I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy", which is a fusion of Buffy and Harry Potter, set before the canon TV series.
