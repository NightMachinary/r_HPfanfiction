Yes I definitely liked it. Emperor by Marquis Black (I think) is supposed to be similar, but I never read it. Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution is somewhat similar with the war elements and gritty imagery. But honestly, I don't think any fic is really comparable. I've never seen a fic that seamlessly combines a perfectly canon Hermione with Harry and Ron from Gryffindors Never Die. It's such a perfect combination of different kinds of drama: crime, family, politics, and humor. Even the fact that plays straight several tropes especially those related to the Big Bad adds to the story because you know there's more to come. There are some places where you can definitely see where the author stopped writing for an abnormally extended time and due to the time jumps it does get a bit confusing, but overall it doesn't take much away from the story. I hope the author makes it to the end.
