Hey, finally a reason for me to stop lurking and create an account!

I dunno about other fics, since most of what ended up creating MB was pop culture references to movies and novels and music, even. The entire point was to create a seamlessly believable fic where Harry and Hermione still remained tethered to the muggle world (which is one of the reasons why Harry prefers football to Quidditch, a sentiment I'm sure the canon Harry wouldn't). But the fic also had to simultaneously allow Harry and Ron to get up in all the shit that they do alongside that. Which I'm sure I cop certain amount of (probably deserved) flak for, since I do realize it comes off as a bit /too/ muggle for some people's tastes.

The closest I can think of is maybe Gryffindors Never Die for Ron and Harry's bromance, but other than that, I'm drawing a pretty big blank on other fics.

If you want original media, and not fics, I've got a lot for you: Guy Ritchie movies (Lock Stock and Snatch in particular), The Big Lebowski, John Le Carr√© novels, *lots* of Metal Gear (seriously, half of the fic is an extended reference to Metal Gear), and Bond films, particularly the more campy Connery/Moore ones than the realistic Craig ones.
