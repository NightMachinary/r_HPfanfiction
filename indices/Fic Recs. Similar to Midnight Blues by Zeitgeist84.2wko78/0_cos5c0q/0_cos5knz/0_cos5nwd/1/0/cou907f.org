Yeah, as I've learned over the past year, there's a very good reason I wasn't an English major. I've totally scrapped the who vs. whom stuff as the fic's gone on but any typos in earlier chapters are a product of both my idiocy and my laziness to go back and change it. I really should get around to cleaning it up, there are definitely some messy parts in earlier chapters both grammar and plot-wise that could use some tinkering.
