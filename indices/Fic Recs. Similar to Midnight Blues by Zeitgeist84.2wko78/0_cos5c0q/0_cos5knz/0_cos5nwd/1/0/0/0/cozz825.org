Sorry I'm so late with a reply, but I've been fixing up the who vs. whom stuff with find and replace and am now going more thoroughly each chapter for revisions.

As for Harry and Hermione, I don't think there's much question that Harry is totally deluding himself into thinking he's not at the very least attracted Hermione. That being said, I don't think Harry would jump into a relationship beyond casual sex and feel comfortable (he tried and failed with Ginny) after the whole Hannah fiasco and Hermione is already seeing someone, unimportant as the dude is, though that's mostly due to the fact that the story is told from Harry's perspective.
