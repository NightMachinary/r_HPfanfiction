You've got the whole first person narrative, which gives you some leeway, but yeah, going over your story would't hurt. It really doesn't have to be perfect, but there are a bunch of mistakes that make your narrator sound a bit daft.

Seriously, start with that find and replace. I did that from chapter six or so onward and that made it instantly readable. You have a way with words -- not so much if they're pronouns. Also, Harry/Hermione all the way. Obviously they're both bonkers but how would waiting for years help at all?
