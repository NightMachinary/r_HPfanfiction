You do know that “who” and “whom” are not synonyms, right? I mean they're not not synonyms. You can use “who” whenever you should use “whom” and it's going to be fine. Very much not vice versa, however. You have to do a find and replace, because otherwise your story is unreadable.

Really well written apart from that, but your subjects and objects need figuring out.
