Haha wow. I actually love the muggle influence on Harry. Also the references are fantastic. I'm really into the whole spy thing recently. Possibly because Archer and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are on loop in my dorm room. Excellent writing honestly. Although as an Arsenal fan I find Harry's allegiance most disturbing ;) . I'll check out the Gryffindors Never Die thank you!
