Bit of an extreme way to word it, but I do agree. I have other fandoms for my anime fanfics riddled with Japanese terms (although I still hate when people put the word "arigatou" in English stories).

On the other hand, I would still totally read a weeb version of HP, because I haven't been able to find many good crack fics and this sounds like crack fic material
