In the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects-and-Side-Effects][Effects and Side-effects]] which is set immediately after the Department of Mysteries battle, Voldie commands Draco to force-feed Harry a potion that will allow him to retrieve the piece of soul in Harry's scar along with most of Harry's magic in order to give himself a massive boost. However, Harry manages to reverse the magic-drain, but a side-effect of the potion leaves Harry female.

The fic is 400K+ words long and has a large amount of world-expansion, but is unfortunately on Hiatus/dead since it hasn't updated since 2015.
