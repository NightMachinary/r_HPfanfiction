Well, the Riddikulus Spell's whole point is to "force" the Boggart to assume another, non-scary shape, so presumably they're shapeshifters who normally turn into their strangers' worst fear because that's an effective defense mechanism against most things that'd want to hurt them, but can turn into other things as well (and could be said in a story to be capable of being trained to assume certain non-scary shapes).
