This is small and old, but I found it an especially touching fic with a kind Dumbledore. Actually most to all the fics swamygliders writes have a good Dumbledore, but this one's the most Dumbledore and Harry focused.

Found By swamygliders

Summary: As Dumbledore walked through the hall one night he heard something unexpected and what he finds is even more unexpected. OneShot Warning: mentions of abuse
