They aren't Dumbledore centric, but both linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure) and linkao3(Aim & Ignite by shostakobitch) have an extremely well characterized Dumbledore. His aura, sense of humor, ability to control the conversation and belief in the power of love, his empathy, etc, everything's there. They're both Girl!Harry, but extremely well done. Among the best fics in the fandom.
