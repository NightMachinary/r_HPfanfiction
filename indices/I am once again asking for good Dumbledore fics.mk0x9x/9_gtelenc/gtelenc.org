This is, admittedly, a still in progress fic wherein Dumbledore's a minor character (I think he's only in three of the six chapters so far) but the author goes out of their way to establish that Dumbledore really is just a kind man doing his best but with too much on his plate in pretty much all of his appearances thus far.

Don't know if that's what you were looking for or if you wanted more Dumbledore centric works, but it's what sprung to mind when I read your request.
