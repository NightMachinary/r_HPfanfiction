linkffn(10639968) is a kinda WBWL, and is probably my favorite fic of the genre. Voldemort died, and Harry was neglected. Dumbledore, whose only involvement in the raising of the children was to warn them about Death Eaters coming for Jacob, is horrified by the situation. One shot with two sequels on the author's page (I really wish FFN has a series function like AO3).
