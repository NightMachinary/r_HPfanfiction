Dumbledore wouldn't have to face the entire auror force in a fight. He could easily take on small squads of them at a time if he ever had to face them, it would indeed be extremely foolish for him to attempt to take on the entire Ministry at once. He could carry out assassinations against known death eaters like the Malfoys and their sympathizers who sit in the Wizengamot. Also, the Ministry is still opposed to Voldemort as well, they would certainly take action against him if he decided to attack Hogwarts. I'm quite certain that Voldemort's forces were not powerful enough to conquer Hogwarts with its defenses and the Ministry combined. Dumbledore could also be easily informed about the attack and he could come and help.
