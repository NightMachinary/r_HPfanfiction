The problem was that if Dumbledore openly turned against the Ministry and used those - quite effective - tactics who would the Ministry turn to? Voldemort, of course. It was always a balance act for him to keep the Ministry pointed at Voldemort, doubly so after the Muggleborn Resistance attempted to kill Voldemort and caused a lot of collateral damage. The problem in the early parts was that the great majority of purebloods didn't really care about "a few restrictions placed on muggleborns" as long as it kept Voldemort from starting a second war.
