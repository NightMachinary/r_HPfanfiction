I have to admit I was disappointed. I really liked the first film, what's not to like on wizards in the jazz New York?, but the second film is still just only an exposition and after four and half hours the proper story still haven't started. The second film really felt like "No, this is not the story yet, just a tease for you to pay me for another movie in two years, suckers!"
