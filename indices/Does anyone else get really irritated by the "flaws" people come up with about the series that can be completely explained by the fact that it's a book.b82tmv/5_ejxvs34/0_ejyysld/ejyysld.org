Some people really do forget it's a children's book, especially since the in-vogue thing are darker, more adult themes. There are a number of people who think HP would have been better if written more like Game of Thrones, but what they don't realize is it was written for completely different audiences and tones. I mean, literally, the word count constraints on children's books alone hampers HP.

It's probably less of a concern on the HPfanfiction sub, but on the main HarryPotter sub people really do seem to forget that it started as a kids' series and would prefer their "gotcha!" moments.
