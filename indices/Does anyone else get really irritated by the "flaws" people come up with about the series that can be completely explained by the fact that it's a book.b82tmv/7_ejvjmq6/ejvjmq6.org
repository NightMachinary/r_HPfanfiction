There are complaints about that? Lol.

The story took place in the 90s and furthermore in a society that's a little backwards in thinking compared to muggles, it WOULD be weird if there were actually any focus in mental health. Now that would be jarring and non-immersive.

Besides, not everyone in the world who experiences trauma gets to have the opportunity for therapy. That's not how life works.

Must be the special tumblr snowflakes complaining, I guess?
