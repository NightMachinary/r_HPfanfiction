Not really. A society that has had mind altering elements for how long? Legilimency was around since the 11th century, and Obliviate originated sometime between 1562 and 1649. And then the False Memory Charm that was created by the early 1900's. I'd think it'd be probable to have some idea of healing the psyche to a degree that would probably at least be comparable to what we have today.
