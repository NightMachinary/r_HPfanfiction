And they've just went out a civil war in the '70s/early '80s which would have probably caused a fair amount of PSTD and suicides among the survivors. Backwards or not, a small society that just went through a ruthless civil war and is now seeing its few members commit suicide in an unprecedented scale will look up to this issue. Neville and Harry won't get any sort of therapy, but I'd expect Molly and Arthur to have Ginny seen by whatever passes for a psychiatrist among wizards.

Overall, however, the way Ginny dealt with the fallout of CoS is never stated in the books. And while part of that it's because CoS is still a children's book and another part because Harry has issues when dealing with people, it would have been nice to reference whatever was going on in Ginny's mind through books 3 and 4 beyond "She was even more infatuated with Harry, but realized he didn't even registered her, so she started dating around"
