Changing someone's memories around/rummaging around in their heads is a little different than dealing with clinical depression, trauma, schizophrenia, etc.

And since at least half of most mental illnesses are actual medical problems, I doubt wizards understand. Especially as Muggles barely understand it even now.

Though I do think they had a better understanding of it than it comes across to Harry. Who is a kid focused on surviving, not healing.
