Because we have not thought highly of the mind until the last century. This proves that magical's in the HP world has an understanding of the mind that surpasses ours, and it's been around for far longer for them. This means that it's far more likely that they would have some sort of psychology.

Mean while in the real world, the masses of people who weren't right after WW1 gave psychology/therapy a jumpstart. And then came WW2 and did it again. We're still not 'there' in regards to knowing all the important bits and bobs in it, but we're much further along because of all of the problems the people that served in those wars had than if they didn't. And that's because of simply the scope of it, most military aged men in villages, and towns either died or were psychologically scarred.\\
Watch "They Shall Not Grow Old", it paints quite the picture of the western front of WW1.
