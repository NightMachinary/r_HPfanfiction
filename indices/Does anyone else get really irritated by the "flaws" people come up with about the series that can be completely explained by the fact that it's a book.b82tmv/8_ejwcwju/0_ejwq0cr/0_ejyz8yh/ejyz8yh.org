Seconded. I think there's a balance - I /love/ taking things seriously and trying to make it work, but I'm also aware that none of it "matters" and there can be a lot of different interpretations. It's just a fun exercise to try to connect the dots, and it's fun to see how people would build the world in a way that's different from how I would build it, especially since people may notice details that I have skipped over.

Like, I love reading endless theories about all the different ways the Sorting works, but at the end of the day a /talking hat/ is just giving out room assignments.
