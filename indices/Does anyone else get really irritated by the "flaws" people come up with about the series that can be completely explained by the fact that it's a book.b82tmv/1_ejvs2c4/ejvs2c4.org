I feel this about the complaint "it's so unrealistic for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to get through the protections on the Philosopher's Stone!" I mean, yeah, sure. But... it's a children's book. Kids are going to do exciting, dangerous, implausible things in it. If that bothers you, I suggest sticking to other genres of literature.

And on a similar note, I've also seen people go "I can't believe no one ever noticed Harry was being abused!" or "lol the Ministry's so incompetent what terrible world-building" and man, I sure wished I lived in a world where those things weren't entirely realistic.
