My headcanon for that whole fiasco is that it was done in a sense that it appeared easy. It was easy so that Voldemort would make a move on it. I am certain Dumbledore knew that Voldemort would come for it, just not when or how. The deterrent of death would warn most students away and seeing a massive three headed dog would be the final straw for everyone else.

You see, most psychopaths tend to underestimate things that they think are easy. All the while, there were alerts or something to alert Dumbledore and, maybe, the other professors that were in on it.

However, the real reason is that it needed to be easy enough for Harry and co. to resolve so that it did not look unrealistic.
