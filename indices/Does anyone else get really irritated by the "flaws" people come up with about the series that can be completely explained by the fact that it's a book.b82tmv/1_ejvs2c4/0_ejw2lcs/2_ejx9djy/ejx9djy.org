Depends on who he was teaching. I had a middle school math teacher tell us girls were bad at math and wouldn't need it anyways. Told my mom. Two days later i was in a different math class, and the next year he was demoted to assistant librarian. Bonus. My new math teacher was my favorite 5th grade teachers husband. Everything was good in my world again.
