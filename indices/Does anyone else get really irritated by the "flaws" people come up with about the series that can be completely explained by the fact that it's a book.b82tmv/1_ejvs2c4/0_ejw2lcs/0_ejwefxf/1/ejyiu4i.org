Is he though? I got the impression that a lot of the original round of death eaters couldn't really be pinned down. So while a lot of people would "know" it, they also didn't "know" it if that makes sense. Like, yes, dude obviously ran with a clique that overwhelmingly went death Eater, but with no way to prove it.

Plus parents are surprisingly willing to overlook glaring faults of teachers if it means that their kid gets to go to a good school.

Hogwarts doesn't answer to anyone outside of the board of governors. The ministry kinda sorta has a relationship with them, but for the most part, Hogwarts can do whatever the fuck it wants when it comes to staff appointments. It happens in privately funded schools in the real world all the time. Not to mention that Hogwarts is very much based off the Eton/Harrow-esque ideal of a school, and /corporal punishment was still allowed when the books were set/. Snape being a sneering bastard who assigns detentions and plays favorites is sort of nothing to a character who had they gone to the equivalent muggle school would have had to deal with at least one bastard who sneered, played favorites, and also believed in not sparing the rod. At all.

Like I would have loved to have gone to the sort of school where Snape wouldn't have lasted a month, but the thing is horrible teachers like that legitimately exist. I know my school had some absolutely bullying fuckwits teaching things, my sister's high school definitely did, every high school my friends went to did. Those teachers really do exist, how can people say Binns/Snape wouldn't last? IME they'd probably hold their positions for life barring something hugely egregious that couldn't be swept under the rug with hush money.
