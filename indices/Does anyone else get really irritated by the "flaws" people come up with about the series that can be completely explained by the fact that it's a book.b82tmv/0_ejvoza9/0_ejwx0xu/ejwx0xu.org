To add to this, it's a disservice to the people who lived then. I /love/ Pride and Prejudice, and I love the mini-series and the film (even if it took some liberties, but the /production design/ is gorgeous!). For some reason, the trailer for the Keira Knightley film called Elizabeth Bennett a "modern woman" and by saying this it sort of intimated that she is a progressive force pushing against the social structures of her time. It really bothered me. I think Elizabeth Bennett is an absolutely amazing character and I really admire her, but she is /absolutely/ a product of her time. Elizabeth Bennett hardly pushes any boundaries except that she'd like to marry for love, which was not universal, but was still absolutely common enough in her time. It's a disservice to her as a character to act like her choices were made in our modern social and economical climate. She works within her system even when she finds it a bit annoying, and she does hardly anything to push back. When her sister is "lost" with a man (the most horrible thing a young lady could do), she does not question the validity that her family's reputation is ruined forever and she does not blame anybody for probably shunning them. That is absolutely ridiculous by modern standards, and that's just one example. Elizabeth Bennett is a self-respecting woman working within the confines of her time, but she is nevertheless working /within/ the confines of her time, and I think it's a shame to pretend she is more progressive than she is just because she has self-respect.

Anyway, I agree with you, just thought I'd use a non-HP example for once.
