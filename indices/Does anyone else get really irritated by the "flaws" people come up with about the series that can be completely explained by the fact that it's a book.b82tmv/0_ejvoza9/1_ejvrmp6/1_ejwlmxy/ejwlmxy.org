For me, that doesn't really matter. The main storyline is so disconnected from the muggle world that it is pretty easy to adjust the time frame to make it work. I mostly read crossover fanfiction and often authors will write a crossover between two works that were not released at the same time and therefore require the timeline of one being adjusted to make the story work. Harry Potter is commonly the one that is adjusted because compared to most works it is very flexible with where it fits in a general time frame.
