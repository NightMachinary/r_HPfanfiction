This doesn't phase me, as long as it is done right. If they claim their story is set in the 80's/90's, and then add modern technology/entertainment and mix it with old stuff, yes it will tick me off. But if they simply set the entire story into the future because they are more familiar with it, I don't care. Do what you like. Just like I dont mind author's using American english, or mess their terms up. It takes a shit ton of research to get everything right, and I get that a lot of writers just want to write for fun. Not to get everything completey correct.
