I think their gripes are very valid.

While it's ok to give a pass to JKR for writing a children's series with its typical cliches, readers should be a lot tougher on fanfic authors writing serious AU stories in this regard.

That being said, it's also important to note that the Books are written from Harry's very limited POV. There are many things he doesn't know and can't know. For example, the Weasleys might have spent considerable effort healing Ginny during their trip in Egypt. But since Harry only met them for a few days near the end of the summer, why the hell should Harry know about whether Ginny had been treated or not? Furthermore, why should a 13 years old teenage boy know about PTSD and psycho therapies?

Just because something happened off screen doesn't mean it didn't happen.
