Way to disregard his second point.\\
Most fanfics I read are at least T-rated. And the only thing stopping them from being M/R rated is [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]'s disregard of sex. But removing sex from the table. Most fanfics that are T-rated or higher does venture into aspects of humans that the books barely skimmed the surface of.
