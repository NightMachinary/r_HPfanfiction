Kids books can be about anything. It wasn't /at the time, deemed/ relevant for /this/ kids book, but that's not necessarily because it's /inherently/ the kind of content never addressed in that medium. If Ginny had been, for example, a neighbour or childhood friend whose absence had to be addressed because her absence would suddenly directly impact Harry, it would likely have been to some at least brief extent. Therapy of certain kinds happens in lots of classic kids books, off the top of my head the decades-old What Katy Did and Heidi feature ill protagonists & friends recovering from physical & mental trauma.
