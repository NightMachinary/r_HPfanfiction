Thank you, yes, I definitely do. I feel like people are taking something that wasn't meant to be an exhaustive recounting of every minor character's struggles and triumphs and either shitting on the author for that not being the case or shitting on the characters for not being shown to have done this or that.

A big, BIG portion of this is that not only is it a children's book but it's also written from a child's point of view. For all we know, Harry was never told that Remus tried to contact him when he was a child and was shut down! For all we know, Sirius nearly got caught going to Hogwarts to give Dumbledore a piece of his mind when Harry told him he was in the Tri-Wizard Tournament! There are a lot of 'plot holes' that might be easily explained by 'hey, this 12, 14, 16 year old kid wasn't there to see this happen and no one told him because he's a KID!'
