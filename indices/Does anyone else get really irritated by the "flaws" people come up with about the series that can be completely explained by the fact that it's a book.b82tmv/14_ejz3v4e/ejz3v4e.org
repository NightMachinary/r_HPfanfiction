I'd say that is one of the reasons people read fanfiction, after all.

HP are children to teenager books, written in a protagonist centered viewpoint. Many things are left out, or not understood by Harry.

So fanfiction fills the gaps and explains what hasn't been understood by our protagonist.

But I gotta agree, I'm also a bit annoyed when people become serious about calling the books bad (or similar adjectives) because they can't withstand an adult viewpoint.
