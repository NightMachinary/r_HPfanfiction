Absolutely. Moreover, I strongly suspect that most people who complain about JKR not writing "realistic" teenagers and how they would deal (or fail to deal) with their respective traumas after all the shit they went through don't /actually/ want that. After all, JKR did exactly that in The Casual Vacancy, but I haven't seen many people interested in poor Krystal. No, everybody wants their fun fantasy mysteries with whimsical magic. And you can't have your cake and eat it.

I also think it's a good thing that not every part of wordbuilding or characters' motivations is explained. The books would be three times longer and actively worse otherwise. We don't need a complete rundown of how Wizengamot works, we don't need to read McGonagall's lecture on magical theory of transfiguration or Snape's instructions on cauldron safety. It can be explored in fanfiction (and I think it's the reason why HP fandom is so big and still going strong, there's just so much to explore), but the canon would just get boggled down.
