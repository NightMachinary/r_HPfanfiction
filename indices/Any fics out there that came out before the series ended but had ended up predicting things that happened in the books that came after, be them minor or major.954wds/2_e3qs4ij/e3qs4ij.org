There was a few fics that predicted Snape loved Lily in some manner. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/165421/1/Lily-Evans-Potter][Here's one from 2001.]] I also recall another in which Severus confronts James about making sure Lily is happy or something along those lines from either 1999, or 2000, but I can't currently find it. (Saw it months ago.)
