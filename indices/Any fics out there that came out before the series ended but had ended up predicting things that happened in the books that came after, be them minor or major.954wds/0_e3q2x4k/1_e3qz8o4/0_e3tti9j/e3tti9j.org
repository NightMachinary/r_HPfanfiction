I know what you mean. Personally, I think it boils down to two words: Deathly Hallows.

That book muddied the waters far more than I can describe. In the aftermath, now that we look back on the series as a whole, it makes you see a great deal of it in a different light.

Deathly Hallows sort of highlighted the downsides to trying to change tone dramatically mid-series.
