Apart from Fleur marrying Bill, none of that seems that special honestly. Herbology was the one subject that Neville was always good at so it doesn't seem that far-fetched for him to become the professor.

In war, many people are going to die and it's always dramatically satisfying to have a twin killed off so that doesn't seem special either. Also you're saying one of the Weasley/Creevey brothers so it could probably not even be the right ones.

And Dumbledore would /need/ to die in most war fics for Harry (I'm assuming he's the protagonist) to come into his own. It only makes sense for him to die on Hogwarts, possibly delaying the enemy/ saving the students . That way his death is more satisfying dramatically
