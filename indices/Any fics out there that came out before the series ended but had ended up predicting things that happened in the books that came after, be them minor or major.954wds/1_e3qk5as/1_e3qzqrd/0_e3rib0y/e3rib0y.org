Yes, fair criticisms! And you're right on point about the way Dumbledore died. I just assumed -- as I wasn't around in the fandom at the time of publishing -- that things like Neville mustering up the confidence to become a professor or Dumbledore dying prior to the Battle of Hogwarts might not have been easy predictions, especially knowing only up to Goblet of Fire.

However, I feel like in hindsight, I would have thought those were obvious too! But despite not being special or jawdropping (and admittedly broad, regarding the deaths of the siblings), they were predictions nonetheless, which I thought might fulfill the request.
