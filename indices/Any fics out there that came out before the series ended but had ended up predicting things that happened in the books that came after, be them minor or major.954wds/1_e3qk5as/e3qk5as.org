After the End (linkffn(282139)) is a post-war fic that was concluded in 2003, the day before the release of the Order of the Phoenix. I just read it a while back (thanks to a recommendation on here) and loved it! While I can't remember specifics, some of the corresponding details include:

- the death of one of the Creevey brothers
- the death of one of the Weasley brothers
- the death of Dumbledore on Hogwarts' grounds
- Hogwarts in ruins after the final battle
- the massive corruption of the Ministry during the war, leading to a haphazard/disorganized Ministry after the war with an Order member as its Acting Minister (who eventually becomes the actual Minister!)
- Fleur getting together with Bill, as well as Fleur taking a job at Gringotts
- Neville becoming the Herbology professor

I'm not 100% sure how many of these had already been hinted at in the canon at when the story first began (in 2001). The whole story felt very true to the characters, though, so I'm sure there were others!
