None of these are Sandman-style Deaths.

/On a Pale Horse/ is a fun crack fic with an ancient Harry-turned-Death summoned by the Order to defeat Voldemort. He and the human/canon Harry become very close (but not in a sexual way). linkao3(8446057)

/Death and the Boy/ is a lovely fic with Harry turning into Death upon reuniting the Hallows. Features him being Death and 'raising' the scarcrux-turned-little-boy. linkao3(1115380)

Quine's /The Master of Death/ is one I've enjoyed, though the details are fuzzy and I need to reread it. It's a WIP with a Harry/Death relationship. linkao3(17672156)
