So I'm not a pro-pokemon battler but I imagine the professors having both a specialty in Pokemon types as well as subject they teach:

1. McGonagall would teach about general concepts. Types and attacks. Strategies. Evolution. I see her having a Balanced team. Water-Fire-Electric.

2. Snape would teach about potions(ha), and other items and enhancers that can be used in Pokemon. How to use them and balance a battle with them. How to prepare your own potion. He'll be a Dark/Poison expert.

3. Flitwick is a master duelist. He would be all about combos and assembling a team. About choosing Pokemon that work towards a same strategy. About tournaments and gyms. He would use fairy and maybe dragon.

4. Sprout would be about healing Pokemon and a major bug/plant expert.

5. Vector would be all about EVs IVs and stats Maximizing. She would use psychic of course.

6. Hagrid would use normals and be an expert about the catching part of the deal... About tracking and finding them.

7. Binns would use ghosts for sure.
