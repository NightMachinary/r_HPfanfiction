In quidditch everyone flies on school pidgeottos as standard, except harry who is gifted a rare Pidgeot in his first year. The aim is simple for Harry - catch the golden baby zapdos at all costs while dodging the beaters Golems. Harry isn't too sure about chasing.. it seems a bit weird, all they do is play catch with a great ball? Harry shrugs, not his idea of fun.

His trusty Pidgeot unfortunately flies into the Whomping Sudowoodo in his third year, leaving harry without his HM Fly until a suspicious pokeball arrives containing a rare Ho-oh!

Harry eventually gets his legendary Pok√©mon back from the professor's in time to catch the baby zapdos and win the cup for his house, Pyroar.

Just how on earth was harry meant to get past the giant shiny charizard in his first task? Thankfully his Ho-oh released herself from his pokeball on his belt and took the initiative, leading the charizard on a chase around the grounds, allowing harry to secure the Exeggcute.
