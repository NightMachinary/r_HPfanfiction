Hm, closest to that really are the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Sherlock-Crossovers/224/7190/?&srt=4&r=10][HP and sherlock crossovers]],

An example: linkffn(7578572) A study of magic wherein Harry is raised by Sherlock, though they somewhat nerf Harry- since, lets face it, a Harry Raised by Sherlock would destroy anything in his path, so they made him ill and gave him a limp from some explosion he saved Watson from.
