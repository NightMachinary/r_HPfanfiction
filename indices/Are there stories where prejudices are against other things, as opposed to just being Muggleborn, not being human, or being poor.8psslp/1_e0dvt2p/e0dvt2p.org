There's one fanfic series that is based entirely off the concept that witches are socially better than wizards, but I can't remember what it's called. Wizards were forcefully bound to multiple witches to keep their power in check, and witches held all the political power.

As for canon, there's not really any overt discrimination other than the Muggle-born stuff and some occasional 'ooh, that French veela'. I think some of Rowling's own biases did end up seeping through though--not saying she's racist or sexist, just that there are two Asians in the entire series (Cho Chang and Su Lin) and both ended up in Ravenclaw, the house of smart people.
