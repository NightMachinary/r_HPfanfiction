To be precise, racism in "Patron" is different in each country. Veela are considered purebloods in France and don't face discrimination there while the British don't consider them purebloods. In Bulgaria, they are seen as "wizard stealing" creatures. Werewolves are shunned and feared (and worse) in Britain, but in Magical Scandinavia, they are respected and adored, and generally community leaders.
