Patron linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has muggleborn prejudice, but there is also significant discrimination against say non-humans such as Veelas and werewolves, far more than is depicted in canon at least.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a number of prejudices. Werewolves are far more prejudiced than canon here, though there is a good reason why (no spoilers). Additionally, Hagrid and similar half-breeds are prejudiced against for /very different reasons/ than in canon (hint: Lady Echidna).

The Firebird Trilogy also has a LOT of prejudices. Muggles are particularly disparate here, because magicals are so different they are actually a separate species (read to see what I mean). Additionally, races like the centaurs and goblins are theorized to be the by-products of ancient magic or experiments such as the work of the Zoroastrian magi during the Achaemanid Empire.
