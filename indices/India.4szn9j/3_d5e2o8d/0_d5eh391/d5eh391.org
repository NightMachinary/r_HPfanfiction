I actually have a mini-history of magical India for the Animagus-Verse that I haven't had occasion to use yet. Basically, while the European magical governments have mostly adapted to modern borders thanks to Grindelwald's War, what was once British India is now a loose confederation of a dozen or so pre-colonial kingdoms, colonial-era princely states, and modern Ministries of Magic. Maybe I'll try to work it into /Animagus at War/, since that story will have a much bigger ICW role.
