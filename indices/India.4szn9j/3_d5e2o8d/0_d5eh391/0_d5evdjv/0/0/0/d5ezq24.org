If you don't mind my terrible British accent, I'd be happy to. My only caveat is that I'd like to cut my teeth on a smallish part like Mr. Granger in /The Arithmancer/ until I get a feel for what the time commitment will be. I'll be able to make a better call when you have an official parts list for that story.
