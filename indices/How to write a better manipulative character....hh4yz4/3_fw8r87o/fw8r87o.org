I'd like to see a manipulative Dumbledore who actually manipulates the Wizengamot and the Minister. Dumbledore focusing all his attention on one schoolboy just to steal his money and make him a weapon? That's boring. There are dozens of fics like that. I want to see Dumbledore manipulating adults. And maybe even try to appease Voldemort by giving him some island to rule or something.

The British PM Neville Chamberlain tried appeasing Hitler and is still a controversial figure. I want to see a Dumbledore like that.
