I think the closest I've ever seen to that is the "Switchverse," starting with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071][/Switch/]]. It starts off with the Twins pranking the school by drugging the Sorting Hat with a potion before the sorting of Harry's year. This results in Harry and Draco going to Hufflepuff, Crabbe, Goyle, and Susan going to Gryffindor, Neville and Hermione into Slytherin, and /Ron/ into Ravenclaw.

I've also seen a few fanfics with Ron using his chess skills to analyze someone's status in a social hierarchy(mostly to see who's taking charge of the Slytherin students when something outside shakes up said hierarchy), using the chess pieces as metaphors for their own personal political power. I'd cite you an example, but I can't recall a specific fanfic.
