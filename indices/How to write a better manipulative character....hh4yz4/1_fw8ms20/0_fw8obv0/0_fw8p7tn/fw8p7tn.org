Oh certainly, being good at chess doesn't automatically make someone a brilliant grand strategist. But it wouldn't be a stretch at all to write Ron as "smart but lazy", and over the course of a story have him start applying the same effort to other things that he does in canon to chess. I'm quite partial to the idea that Ron is the wisdom, Hermione the intelligence, and Harry the charisma, if you'll pardon the metaphor.
