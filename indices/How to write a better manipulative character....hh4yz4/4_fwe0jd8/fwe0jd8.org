One of the greatest examples of somebody manipulating others is Akira Kurosawa's cinematic masterpiece [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yojimbo][Yojimbo]]. You might not know that film but you've probably heard of the +blatant ripoff+ unofficial remake, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars][A Fistful of Dollars]].

I won't spoil the plot but the lead character in both is a manipulative sob and does a great job of it.
