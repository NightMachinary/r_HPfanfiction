The reason we don't see a logical Master Manipulator Dumbledore is because of the title. If he really was good enough to control the entire wizarding world for some fifty years, he would basically curb stomp Harry and destroy him immediately. He wouldn't make an interesting-to-read villain because he would absolutely /annihilate/ Harry. And while I would love to read this, I don't think a lot of people would enjoy a story where the protagonist loses.

This is basically why I hate manupulative!Dumbledore fics.
