The only time I've seen this sort of done was in the actual nightmare fic 'Partially Kissed Hero'. Started off really interesting, curb-stomp Goliath Dumbledore going up against witty David Harry, but quickly became the actual definition of 'Off the fucking rails'. The whole bit about the Malaclaw Venom was a really interesting and semi-decently done way of fucking with All-Powerful Dumbledore.

But somewhat like [[/u/Myreque_BTW][u/Myreque_BTW]] said, it's really difficult for Harry the Idiot to match up against an actual machiavellian Dumbledore, so the fic went truly ridiculous in Levelling Up Harry and his side to compensate. When it hits the Time Travel bit (if you make it that far) absolutely stop reading.
