I think the /real/ problem with Manipulative!Dumbledore is that he's always written as having /nothing/ to offer, and always having goals that end in Harry dying for the Greater Good - with no Plan B that achieves the same goal without the "Harry dies" part.

Indy!Harry has no reason whatsoever to go along with anything Dumbledore offers. 9 times out of 10, the story deus-ex-machinas all the information and magical power/protection Harry needs right into his hands - and that 10th time, he outmaneuvers Dumbledore into handing it to him anyway for no gain.

Imagine a manipulative!Dumbledore whose goal /isn't/ somehow in direct opposition to Harry's continued existence, and who actually has information Harry can't easily get - that makes it possible to /actually/ have Harry go along with Dumbledore's machinations and have something to gain for it in turn.

Let's say Dumbledore wants control over the Resurrection Stone to bring back his sister, but he knows it's in the Gaunt Ring, which in turn is likely a Horcrux - so heavily cursed it'll have to be destroyed on the spot.\\
Given that the ring's last known location is in a Muggle-heavy area, Fiendfyre is out of the question (it's really flashy magic so it'll break the Statute) so the easiest way to destroy the ring is with the sword or a Basilisk fang - which leaves the Stone intact.\\
All Dumbledore really has to do is hand Harry the information and then ensure that Harry doesn't need the Stone for anything so he leaves it there - if he has a portrait of his parents, job done.
