It's also canon that Dumbledore had "a gleam of something like triumph" in his eye when he was told that Voldemort used Harry's blood to come back - implication, he /knew/ that that would eventually allow Harry to survive another Killing Curse, and /didn't want Harry to actually/ */die/* (otherwise he wouldn't have reacted to that tidbit at all - it would have been irrelevant).
