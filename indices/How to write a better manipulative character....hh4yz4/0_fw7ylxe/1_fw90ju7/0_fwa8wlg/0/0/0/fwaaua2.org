Better a very slim chance of survival than none at all - and indeed, it's canon that this was the literal, /only/ way that Harry could have survived the destruction of the Horcrux inside himself.

There wasn't going to /be/ a plan that guaranteed survival, no matter how hard anyone tried - so the "best chance" is a good outcome.
