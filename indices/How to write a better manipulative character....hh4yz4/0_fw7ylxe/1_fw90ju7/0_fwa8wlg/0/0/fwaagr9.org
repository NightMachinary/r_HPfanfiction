That Plan B was still really stupid. What if Harry died in a way where his body was too damaged to live on (eg killing curse misses him, blows up something behind Harry and he dies to shrapnel or something caving his head in). Or to Nagini. Or from a random stray spell.

That Dumbledore's plan B worked is honestly an insult to the laws of probability.
