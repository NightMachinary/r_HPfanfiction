In my opinion, the method to write a better manipulative character is the same as the method to write any character, authors have to put a bit more of themselves into it. Imagine you are that character: what are your motives? what are your concerns? who and what do you care bout? how are you doing what you are doing? why doe is work? why does it fail?

The best authors are the ones who can inject a bit of soul into every character and every situations. In a lot of indy/powerful! fanfics (and in a lot of fictions in general), the main character is the only one who has any kind of animus. You get the frustrating feeling that if you came up to Dumbledore and knocked on his head shouting “Helloooo, is there anyone here?”, he'd just say: “Ah, my boy, what can I do for you? would you like a sherbet lemon?” Its a bit like the NPC problem in video games, where you could ransack their home, shit in their potted plants and kidnap their dog and the only dialogue they'd have is still: “I've heard rumours of an evil dragon in the north.”

As well, in a lot of fanfics, schemes are just an attribute of a character: he had blue eyes, and a plan for world domination. But that's not how it works, actions must have weight. If an old man stole one of his pupil's inheritance money, he must have had something he wanted to do with it, a method so that people didn't notice, maybe he made a deal with a goblin, is there a paper trail? did he hide the money somewhere? did he use everything? on what? why? *what did it do to the plot*? who is complicit? who would be appalled by it? why didn't they notice?

I disagree that you can't have a believable/interesting manipulative Dumbledore because he would curb-stomp Harry. It's just not relevant. Literature and real life is full of people winning against stronger opponents. It's literally a trope: the underdog story. Harry wins because I have decided that Harry wins and I'm the one writing the stuff xD. The whole problem of good writing is how do I make it engaging and interesting.

If a villain has to lose in the end, you can't only plot his loss. If you want it to be believable, I think the best trick is to plot their win in a believable way, and then think of what happens to make it impossible, and then how do they respond to that to get a win? and what happens to make *that* fail. It's a bit like playing chess against yourself: if you only play half-heartedly on one side, the game is rigged and it's boring as fuck, but if you do your best on both side it can get interesting. And it reveals something of the inner-working of the game to you, the same way a conflict between a hero and a villain reveal something of the inner-workings of your fictional world.

But you know, I think ultimately a lot of fanfiction is written in a bit of a casual way. It's like playing a game on your phone for a few minutes: you get a quick dopamine rush of Harry kicking ass or being a mysterious edgelord and then you close it up and go about your day. It works the same for the reader and the writer. I'm not dissing it, it's fun and there is nothing wrong with it.

Or you could also play an enormous multi-session game of D&D, play a bit more seriously, it's a lot more demanding but it's a different kind of fun. That's crafting a good plot and interesting characters and trying to put life into a fictional world.

Anyway, I don't really have a conclusion, so that's it for my TED talk :P.
