If we are talking about summoning, I think Fate's Gamble is a good fic... It's a crossover between fate/stay night and hp. It's a good fic with a powerful harry who ends up summoning multiple servants quite a few of whom like him either romantically(Elizabeth, Frankenstein) or in a family like way(Medusa, Jack). It also has a sequel and a spinoff/omake by a different author.

Original Fic : linkffn(Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror)

Sequel Fic : linkffn(Fate's Gamble : Round Two by Lupine Horror)

​

Omakes : linkffn(Fate's Gamble Omake edition by roughstar333; Fate's Gamble Omake : Second Edition by roughstar333)

​

Also harry ends up becoming very powerful towards the end and I haven't read the omakes myself.
