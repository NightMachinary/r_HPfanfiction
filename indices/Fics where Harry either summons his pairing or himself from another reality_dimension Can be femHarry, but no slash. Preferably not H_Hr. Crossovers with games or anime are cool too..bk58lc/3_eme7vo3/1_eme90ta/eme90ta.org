All I remember from Fate is from Fate/Stay Night, UBW and Fate/Zero, which isn't much, seeing I've only watched it once and several years ago (except UBW, I watched it when it came out, few years ago).

I also read Swords and Sorcery, a x-over where Shiro travels dimension by accident.

Will I be lost or is it fairly explanatory by itself ?
