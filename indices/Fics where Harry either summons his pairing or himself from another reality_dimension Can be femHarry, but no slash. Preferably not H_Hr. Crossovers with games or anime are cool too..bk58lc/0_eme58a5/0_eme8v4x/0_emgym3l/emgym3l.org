Well in Echoes in the Fog, Grey!Harry and Canon!Harry (plus friends) get inadvertently summoned into a universe where Evil!Harry serves as the second in command to Voldemort, who rules most of the world.

Only catch is that Grey!Harry is from the author's short fic For Lack of a Bezoar, which essentially details what happens if Ron dies on his birthday after drinking the stuff Malfoy poisoned. It's a good, quick read (35k words) which helps with the background of the Grey!Harry.

As it happens, Evil!Harry is from the author's Downard Spiral Saga which was really long and I never read, but I felt it wasn't necessary for enjoyment of Echoes in the Fog.
