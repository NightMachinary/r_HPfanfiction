Not particularly, and I've read pretty much all of them. I meant more like either Harry summoning, either by accident or on purpose, a demon or a hero or something from another world, or like in Potter Paradox, where a femHarry in her 40s travels to another universe and removes Harry from the Dursleys. Or like in that Intersecting Realities, with an older Slytherin Harry being summoned and ending up helping a young femHarry.
