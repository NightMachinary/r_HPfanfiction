It doesn't say anywhere that wands choose the wizard based off their personality. The only things that can be assumed is that dragon heartstring wands are more powerful - even though the wand doesn't really determine the power of the spell - and that unicorn tail hair wands might go to "pure hearted" people.

Also, the wizards who purchase their wands at 11 cannot be the same person a decade later. The wands work for them just fine through all the change they go through as they live.
