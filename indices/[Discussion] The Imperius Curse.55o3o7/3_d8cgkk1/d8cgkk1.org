- Casting requires physical proximity, but distance doesn't reduce the effect
- Only one victim at a time, and it takes concentration -- it can't be "daisy chained"
- It can only control/cause the euphoric feeling if it's being actively held, the caster has to concentrate and keep their intent focused
- Strong-willed witches and wizards (and a small group of muggles--needs research) can throw it off, but only when it's being actively controlled -- if they don't experience the euphoric feeling but for a moment or two once or twice every few weeks, they might not ever realize they've been put under the curse
- A strong Occlumens can cast off the curse almost immediately
- It works like a suggestion, the caster doesn't actually "take over" the body of the other person. "Jump on the desk, Potter."

In that same vein, a caster can suggest, "Kill the muggle" or "torture the muggle," but it would be the one under the Imperius to decide how to do that. Most often, the controlled wouldn't be able to focus enough anger or hatred for the killing curse or the torture curse to be effect while also experiencing the euphoric feeling. Basically meaning:

- Those under the Imperius cannot cast Unforgivables
