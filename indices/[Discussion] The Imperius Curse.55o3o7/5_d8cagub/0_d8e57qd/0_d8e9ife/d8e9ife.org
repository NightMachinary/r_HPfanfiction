You seem to be missing the whole point about fanfiction -- that it doesn't need to stick to canon. I even had a paragraph that started with "If you stick with canon" and it's /after/ the muggles not having souls bit, so you might want to read more carefully in the future even if the contextual clue that we're in a /fanfiction/ subreddit and not [[/r/HarryPotter]] isn't sufficient.

Specific to this discussion, it's almost entirely about how the Imperius curse is too strong in canon and that fanfiction authors might come up with explicit limitations to explain why the entire world isn't controlled by it. So that should be a huge contextual hint that we're going to talk about deviations from canon.

Or possibly you misread my statement about souls as saying that that's what I think about canon? I'm rather certain that I specifically said "In my fics", which should have been enough of a clue, considering it's entirely explicit instead of a subtle suggestion.

Do you assume that I would keep everything the same as canon except for muggles not having souls? That would be terrible writing. In two fics I have that even mention this idea, none of them attempts to visit any of the stations of canon, and none features Dementors attacking muggles.

If I made it so that muggles don't have souls and still wanted to show muggles and Dementors in the same area, I would have to write that differently. I could say that Dementors' fear aura is psychophysiological instead of magical, for instance. I could have them attack with their limbs. Granted, I can't have them suck non-existent souls out of muggles, and perhaps the effect on squibs would be somewhat different. Or perhaps Dementors wouldn't even be able to interact with muggles. But I didn't write any of that into a fic, so you aren't complaining about anything I wrote -- or, as near as I can tell, anything in reality.

So I don't see where you have room to complain. I'm not specifying something is canon when it's inconsistent with canon, nor am I writing anything that is internally inconsistent relating to Dementors and soulless muggles.

Perhaps you just hate it when people deviate from canon?
