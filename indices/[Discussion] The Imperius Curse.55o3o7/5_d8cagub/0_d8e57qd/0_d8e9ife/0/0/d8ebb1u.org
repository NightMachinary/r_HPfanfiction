As you say, it would be something that Death Eaters would use to justify mistreating muggles. It's not something I could use to justify it. I wrote in one of my stories:

#+begin_quote
  When she'd seen ghosts and talking portraits, she'd investigated, and it turned out Muggles could not become either. She'd come to the conclusion that this "soul" concept didn't apply to Muggles, but that didn't mean her parents were not people, or not worthy of moral consideration.

To expand on that idea, there are several concepts at play. One is the thing that lets certain types of magic operate on you -- horcruxes, Legilimency, memory charms, ghostification, animated portrait magic, maybe the Killing Curse. (If I were investigating a real phenomenon, I'd start out by grouping them together, and later I would investigate whether they're really in the same category.) Another is whatever makes you capable of thought, the thing that gives you a will. That's what gives you moral responsibility. Muggles obviously have wills and are capable of thought. A related concept is whether something is capable of suffering, which is one reason that you must give a thing some level of moral regard, and muggles can suffer. You can also talk about a seat of emotions, which will probably go along with your capacity for thought. (Again, subject to investigation.) And if you're religious, your religion may or may not include the concept of souls, which might do something else entirely.

In canon, we don't know about animated portraits or ghosts of muggles. We know there are memory charms that work on them, and we know the Killing Curse works on them. If muggles don't have souls, then you might need to use a different type of memory charm on them. Maybe Legilimency doesn't work on them. But this is an entirely separate consideration from whether they can think and feel and make decisions. It's at least potentially separate from whether muggles or mages are subject to reincarnation, or whether they have an afterlife.

These are all at least sometimes called "souls", but that's a quirk of language rather than an indelible union of concepts in reality.
