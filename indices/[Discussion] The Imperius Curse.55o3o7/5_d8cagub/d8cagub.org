I explored what might happen if the canon Imperius curse [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11901553/1/Imperius][worked as advertised]]. In short, the entire magical world is controlled by a handful of dark lords using the Imperius on several others, each of those people using it on a few others, etc.

Your list of potential limitations is good. Others I would consider employing:

- You get direct physical control over the person, nothing more. It's a test of your acting skills and knowledge of the person to use the curse for mayhem.
- It takes concentration to control people. It would be highly unusual to be able to carry on a conversation in your own body and with an Imperius'd person at the same time.
- The curse lapses when the caster sleeps.
- Exposure breeds immunity. Not exactly the same as "time reduces the effect", which might only require you to recast the spell periodically.
- The curse operates on a magical level, so it can affect mages and squibs but not muggles. (In my fics, I commonly have it that souls are real and measurable but muggles don't have them.)
- Controlled people can't cast Unforgiveables.

If you stick with canon, the curse makes you euphoric. This suggests a weak test for it if you can gauge someone's emotions, though depending on the victim's acting abilities and the caster's orders, you might need rather more direct access than just looking at the person's face.
