For me, aside from the canon limitation of it being able to be resisted, the only three things about the Imperius Curse I ever include is:

- The Imperius Curse does not grant the victim any increase in skill from their controller at all, no matter how much direct control the caster has over that victim. Otherwise Voldemort could just Imperius someone and that victim would become as powerful as him while they are being controlled.

- The Imperius Curse cannot be used to force a Secret Keeper to confess the secret. In other words, the Fidelius Charm overrules the Imperius Curse, just like how Veritaserum cannot be used to make a Secret Keeper confess their secret.

- The Imperius Curse cannot be used to gain knowledge that the victim doesn't actually know. Meaning if Voldemort wanted to force someone to tell him where the Elder Wand was, he would have to find someone who actually knew where the Elder Wand was and use the Imperius Curse on THAT person. However if the victim doesn't know where the Elder Wand is, then they couldn't give Voldemort the answer even if they were under the Imperius Curse. They would just tell him they don't know where it is, then get killed for being useless.

That's it. Those three limits only exist because without those three specific limits, it would open up dozens and dozens of plothole in the actual HP canon. I think putting illogical limits on the duration and effect of the Imperius Curse is just bad writing and comes off as really annoying since its this attempt to dumb down/rationalize magic.

*Its almost as if people who put unreasonable limits on the Imperius Curse forgot that its one of the three Unforgivable Curses for a reason.* Its an Unforgivable Curse BECAUSE its so overpowered. If the Imperius Curse was nerfed or limited too much then it wouldn't be unforgivable. Hence the reason why the only real limitation needed is that a witch or wizard should be able to resist the Imperius Curse if they strong enough and/or if the caster is weak enough. Those other three limitations I put in my bullet points only exist because without them, it would have many plotholes in canon.

The entire nature of the Unforgivables is how absurdly powerful they are. The Killing Curse cannot be blocked by any spell (e.g. Protego, etc), the Cruciatus Curse can inflict permanent mental damage, and the Imperius Curse grants absolute control over its victim. However the Killing Curse can be blocked by conjuring physical objects big enough to take the hit (which would beyond the average wiazrd), the Cruciatus Curse seemingly cannot kill anyone (but death isn't the worst experience compared to the Cruciatus or a Dementor), the Imperius Curse can be resisted by a witch or wizard with a strong enough willpower (something that is very rare), and none of the Unforgivables are too fast to be dodged.

There is no limits on how many people can be controlled at one time. There is no limits on how long you can control people if they are incapable of resisting it. There is no distance limitation to maintain it (e.g. you can use Imperio on someone in the UK, travel to America, and you'd still be able to control them). Having items to make them immune to Imperio is literally the dumbest limit I have heard of since if such a limitation existed then Imperio wouldn't be Unforgivable. Magical items that make people immune to the Imperius would make Imperio a worthless spell.

Most importantly, there is no continued concentration needed at all. The Imperius Curse doesn't need to be continuously maintained to remain active. Its almost like a sleeper agent thing where you can use it once, and then you can just let the victim carry on with their regular life and then just take control whenever you want. Draco pretty much does this with Rosmerta in HBP since he obviously isn't controlling every single second of her actions, he just controls her when he needs to. If it needed continuous control then it would be too easy to tell if someone was under the Imperius Curse, which defeats the entire point of it.
