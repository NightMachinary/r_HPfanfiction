  Its an Unforgivable Curse BECAUSE its so overpowered. If the Imperius Curse was nerfed or limited too much then it wouldn't be unforgivable.

I agree with this completely, and I like the idea of a curse this powerful. However, I also believe that unless limits are put on the Imperius curse, you just end up with bad story telling.

If it's not particularly hard to cast, can be chained, and is pretty much limitless control. And (even worse), the incantation and wand movement are common knowledge, meaning that any competent wizard can cast it.

Imagine a world where anyone can basically mind control anybody at will. It would be a total shitshow. "Nice car you got there." Whoops, now it's mine. "I don't agree with the law you suggested." Boom, controversial legislation passed. "Sorry, you lack proper bank identification." Lol nope.

They touch on this when Harry visits Gringotts, and the scene has always bothered me for that reason. The (second?) most secure place in all of Britain is broken into because of the Imperius curse. The tellers know that there will be a robbery, the trio clearly lacks the proper form of ID, but it doesn't matter because Harry can just mind control 4 different people.

One of the most secure places in the entire series is broken into by 3 17 year olds because of the Imperius curse.

If everyone acted totally logically (which, to be fair, isn't true for the HP series; it's YA literature, and I don't think any fan would disagree with that) and the Imperius curse becomes a total nightmare without any restrictions on it.
