Though in HBP, Draco chained the Imperius on Madame Rosmerta, and had her use the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell. So Draco used Imperio on a witch to Imperio another witch. Though it should be noted that Rosmerta and Katie Bell are not particularly powerful so maybe Draco just got lucky that those two were weak.

If Draco can have chain the Imperius Curse, then the likes of Voldemort/Bellatrix/Lucius/etc would be able to do it even better than what Draco did in canon. Though its seems to be implied that the Imperius Curse is harder to use than the other Unforgivable Curses just purely for the continuous control over a victim the caster can have without needing to be directly around at all times.

The only real limitation to the Imperius Curse seems to be that the victim can resist it if they have a strong enough will, and said resistance can come at ANY moment. Meaning that a dark wizard could get screwed over if their Imperiused victim breaks free from control at a crucial moment like in GoF when Barty Crouch Sr broke free of the Imperius Curse and almost got away entirely if he wasn't killed off by his son. If Crouch Sr had got to Dumbledore in time, everyone would know Crouch Sr was under the Imperius Curse and therefore it would change the entire endgame of GoF.

Another weakness in canon is that if generally speaking, it is possible to tell if someone is under the Imperius Curse just by looking at them in the eyes, assuming the Imperius Curse was poorly done. If a dark wizard puts someone under the Imperius Curse, and then its found out later that the victim is under the Imperius Curse, then it destroy the entire point of the Imperius Curse.

Though really, the Imperius Curse is only really OP when used against muggles since muggles cannot resist the Imperius Curse, since the entire resistance of the Imperius Curse is a magical thing. Even then, the only muggles that would be worth putting under the Imperius Curse would be politicians or monarchs, which could easily backfire if it ends up breaking the Statute of Secrecy.
