I'm not going to get into restrictions until I get home, so I am going to address your restrictions.

Only one actively controlled at the same time is something I wouldn't do. I would think that you can cast it as many times as you want, but it costs an absurd amount of power, so realistically only a few people could be imperiused, and that is only with a powerful person like Voldemort.

I would disagree with distance reducing effects because of one reason- it's /magic/. It doesn't care about distance!

I would agree with passage of time, because as I believe it takes energy while the person is under the imperius. Eventually they one controlling them will run out of power.

A strong willed person throwing it off I agree with, because from what i've seen it implants the suggestion in your mind, not dissimilar to legimency. A strong willed person would be able to react to the suggestion and say /no/.

The existence of magical artifacts that can make you immune im iffy about. I mean sure, anything is possible right? But on the other hand, if something like that was possible why would people not buy those instead of learning Occulamency? But I digress, it is definitely possible.

I would agree with physical proximity, because I view spell similar to bullets- you fire them off, and they go towards you, but they can miss and will obviously not go on forever. So, going by my bullet logic they would also have a range.

On a side note, I think this is the longest thing i've ever written on here :P
