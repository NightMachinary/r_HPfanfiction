Harry is given stupidly OP abilities and traits by Fate to make him Voldemort's equal. He's very cunning, intelligent, and charismatic. The story is great fun, with lots of action, plot twists, and good ol romance.

The best part is: you don't know whether to root for Harry or root against him. He makes sweeping changes, yet he's not an ideal hero....
