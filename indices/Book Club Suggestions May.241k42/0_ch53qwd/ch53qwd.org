[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]] 260K long novel, and I believe its the #1 HP fanfic the internet has to offer! A warning though, the fanfic features a dark HP universe were many characters have been killed and the author's portrayal of Voldemort is the most evilest one you'll ever find.

With that said the portrayal of the rest of the characters (H and Hr in particular) are so spot on it will make you shed a tear, the story is also VERY real and details very real emotions, anguish and angst. you'll be on the edge of your seat the entire way I'd think, at least thats the case for me and I'm halfway through the story.

Another thing, this is an H/Hr pairing, even if you aren't a fan, you just have to read it for the writing in of it self, its a real masterpiece.
