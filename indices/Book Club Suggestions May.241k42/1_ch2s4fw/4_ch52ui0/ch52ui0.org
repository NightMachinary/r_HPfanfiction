Both are great, original stories. I have to admit that I favored The Prince Who Was Promised, if only because I've always wanted to see more of the ASOIAF world before book 1 in cannon.

Also helps that both fics are being actively updated, with the author of TPWWP recently putting out new material on the DLP WbA section.
