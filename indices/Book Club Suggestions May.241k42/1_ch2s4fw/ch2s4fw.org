I'd like to put my story out there since the theme is AU.

Hogwarts Battle School. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

And so I'm not being too selfish, another AU. It might fall more into the crossover realm, but I think it deserves to be submitted for discussion.

The Prince Who Was Promised. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/]]

  He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.
