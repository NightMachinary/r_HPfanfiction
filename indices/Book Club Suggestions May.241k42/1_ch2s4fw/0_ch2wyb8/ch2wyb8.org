After reading both of these fan fictions yesterday (great job by the way, Kwan), I can also vouch for these. Especially The Prince Who Was Promised. It's a crossover with a Game of Thrones however it's still a great read even without actually knowing anything about GoT.

They are a tonne of AU stories however I'll recommend this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] and it's sequels.
