  There are two things to know about Harry Potter. One: He kicks ass. Two: No one cares. Why? Because Daniel Potter is the Boy Who Lived. Badass Horcruxes. A Year 7 fic with lots of twin fic elements.

Ravenclaw Harry/Hermione. Really good most of the time; sometimes quite depressing. Features Luna. Complete, but the sequel is abandoned.
