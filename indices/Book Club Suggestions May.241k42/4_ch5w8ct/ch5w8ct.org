If we are talking AU there is one fic I would say is an absolute must.

#+begin_quote
  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
#+end_quote

Complete

This story almost ignores the books, as to instead follow Harry on an adventure in Southern America together with Bill Weasley. Great fic - I can't stress this enough.

#+begin_quote
  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?
#+end_quote

Complete

Bungle in the Jungle sequal. Not as good as the previous one unfortunately.

#+begin_quote
  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
#+end_quote

WIP

A lot darker than many fics out there, and not something you wish to read if you want to feel happy. It is however very AU and well written.

#+begin_quote
  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.
#+end_quote

WIP

A big focus on the Blacks (duh) and some Harry-Draco friendship. No slash.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
#+end_quote

WIP

The newest one on the list. Fairly regularly updated. If you like fast moving stories this isn't one for you. It's about Harry following the Voldemort of his dimension to pu a stop to him. He suddenly finds himself in a new dimension where he never existed, and his now battle-hardened self must go through Hogwarts again with quite a few changes. Not very AU, but subtly and ever increasing.

To anyone who wants to write and AU HP story you might want to take a look at Taure's Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic. It has a lot of good ideas, but the author abandoned the story when he found he didn't have enough of a plot to keep it going. A real shame.
