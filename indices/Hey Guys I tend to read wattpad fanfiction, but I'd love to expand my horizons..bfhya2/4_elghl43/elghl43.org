These two are better than the books:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

Is a series, they are on book 4 now, but Harry's not in Hogwarts on the first one.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1746629/chapters/3731000]]

Also a series, book 5 has been completed and it has a one-shot prequel ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1577144]]), I recommend reading it after chapter 4, though.

Both are super well-written and when the plot deviates from the books, it only gets better.

Happy reading!
