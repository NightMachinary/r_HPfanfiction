#+begin_quote
  Draco made a different choice in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions before his first year at Hogwarts. He gained some friends, changed his family's allegiance, and changed the entire Second Voldemort War.This story, as the others in Draco Takeover, stands alone and are only connected thematically. Point of divergence in Philosopher's Stone.
