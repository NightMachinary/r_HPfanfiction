I have two fic suggestions!

The first is a WIP called surrogate on AO3: a truly masterful look at the relationship between Bellatrix and Voldemort, exploring her relationship with Rodolphus and Andromeda as well. Rodolphus is serious and thoughtful, and the two unite over their mutual love of Voldemort (not exactly romantic on Rod's part, but... very interested). Set during Deathly Hallows but replete with flashbacks. It's one of the best fan fictions I've ever seen: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11682174/chapters/26295996]]

The second is a story called Vacillation. It's actually a Lucius/Narcissa story set during the first war and delves much more deeply into their psyches, but Bellatrix and Rodolphus get a lot of attention too. If you're solely interested in Bellatrix I'd at least recommend you read chapter 18, which almost reads like a lengthy Bella/Rod one shot. Rodolphus is totally wild in it and while I'm not sure how canon that is, it's a fun read. The L/N parts are canon though, and it's completed.
