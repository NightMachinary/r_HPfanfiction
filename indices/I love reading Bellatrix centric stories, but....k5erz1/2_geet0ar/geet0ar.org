The YouTube Fan Film 'House of Sisters Black' has it that Bellatrix's father was removing her memories to keep her in line. It's well worth a watch! My fanfic (told from Narcissa's POV) has it that Voldemort himself was teaching Bellatrix Occlumency/Legilemency and was deliberately changing things in her mind - just because he could.
