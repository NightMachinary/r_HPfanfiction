I think people discount the effect of a lengthy prison sentence on someone's mental health. Sirius and Bellatrix were both essentially in almost complete segregation in a 24/hour torture prison for over a decade.

The United Nations says anything over 14 days segregation is torture FYI.

Bellatrix would not be okay after Azkaban regardless of what state she was in before Azkaban.
