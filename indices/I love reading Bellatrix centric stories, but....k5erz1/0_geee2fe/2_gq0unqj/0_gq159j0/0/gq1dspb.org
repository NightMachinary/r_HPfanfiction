Heh, what can I say...? I'm a no-life who spends way too much time either drawing, reading, or going through old, interesting threads.

I agree that it's hard to find something that isn't viewed in a completely objective manner, especially in the fandom with such a long tradition. And when it comes to the essay itself I think it's well-written and easy to read - definitely one of the most detailed I've seen so far. My main beef was that this text was presented as a summary of canon information, and it was quite obvious that the author was getting too influenced by their own vision and therefore it felt as if they tried to paint that vision as a fact. It's mostly seen in the description of Bellatrix' relationships.

Quite a shame, because if not for this one problem, this essay would be marvelous. It's very rare for someone in the fandom to give so much thought to the book version of Bellatrix.
