Well... yeah. That's the nature of the fandom - you won't find a single character who isn't subjectively viewed. Rowling's plot-railed whimsy saw to that.

I can't really comment on any of your other points because I barely know shit about canon.

But the essay does do what it does well (by fandom standards, anyway :D) - it decides it's going to see a family-bound Bellatrix character and looks into the key aspects of such a character, pulling in various parts of canon to support that idea. The OP wanted ideas around a Bellatrix character that wasn't born insane or abused, and that's what that essay provided.

Also, did not think people would still be reading months old comments, so kudos on your dedication. Thanks for picking mine. :)
