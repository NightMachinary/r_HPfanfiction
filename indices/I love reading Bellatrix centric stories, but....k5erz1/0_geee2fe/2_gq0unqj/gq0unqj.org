I've read it. And while I admit that there are some really insightful parts, there is also a couple of problems.

The biggest one I have is that the author seems to dive too deep into their own headcanons. I'm mostly talking about how they try hard to portray Bellatrix as a very family-bound person. The most blatant example of it is how there are some "clues" in the text, that supposedly suggest Bella and Sirius were "close" when they were young, and that Sirius' death was basically an accident; allegedly Bellatrix' triumphant scream was wrongly interpreted by Harry, and her later instructions concerning the Cruciatus Curse were a result of her subconscious need for punishment.

It's similar with the Malfoys. While I agree Bellatrix was close with Narcissa and wanted to keep her out of harm's way, her sister was definitely not more important than Voldemort. Every next assumption seems to be more and more unlikely. In "Dark Lord Ascending", when Bellatrix is making a show out of herself, according to the author, it was to distract Voldemort from humiliating the Malfoys; not because her emotions and longing were GENUINE. The author states that Bellatrix was the person who manipulated Voldemort in some way - not the other way round.

Later they lean heavily towards the idea that Bellatrix was purposefully avoiding killing Tonks. When Voldemort ordered her to murder Nymphadora and she almost cried it was likely not because she was happy and relieved - it was because she didn't want to do this. The fact that Tonks survived the Battle of the Seven Potters, and the later months was somehow proof of Bellatrix' unwillingness to kill her niece.

In short... This analysis was neither hit nor miss. As I said earlier I agree with some parts, such as Bellatrix being (unjustly) perceived as a crazy bimbo by the majority of the fandom, and that she's much more capable, intelligent, and calculating than people think. I was also glad that the author decided to throw the film version out of the window - otherwise, it would have been a complete mess. But at the same time, the author keeps on overanalysing the tiniest, insignificant details and tries to use them as proof for the legitimacy of their own headcanons, thus making the essay a highly subjective read.
