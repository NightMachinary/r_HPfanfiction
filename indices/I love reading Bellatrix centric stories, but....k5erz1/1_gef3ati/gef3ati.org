FWIW, regarding point 1, many studies have shown that:

1) In abusive families, it's not uncommon for one individual to be the primary target of abuse, instead of the abuse being spread around. It can be well enough hidden that some siblings either have no idea the abuse occurred, or only a vague sense that there was “something” going on, but surely it wasn't as bad as what the abused sibling claims. This is especially common in sexual abuse.

2) There is no one “response” that abuse victims have. Some may get angry and lash out. Some may display avoidant behavior, and run as far and as fast away as they can get. Some try to become “perfect” in order to minimize the abuse. (I think we've covered the 3 Black sisters right there, lol.) There are other responses too, not just those, and they do tend to be overlapping, so this is kind of a simplistic run down, but yeah. We really can't draw any conclusions from the reactions of the Black family, except to say this: were any of them what we might call well-adjusted? I daresay not. The closest might be Sirius pre-Azkaban, but even he seemed to be an attention-seeking horse's posterior. But even if we did call him “normal”, that certainly shouldn't suggest to us that the Black sisters weren't abused, especially as they had a different set of parents.

So, in summation, I do not think the points you presented argue against the prior generation of Blacks being abusive. In fact, if anything, I find the behavior of the latest generation, all of whom seem maladjusted to a greater or lesser degree, to argue for /some/ type of abuse happening, whether emotional, physical, or sexual.

That's not to say it proves anything either. Obviously there's nothing in canon to say either way. But the preponderance of the evidence seems to indicate (to me) that there was /something/ not quite right going on there. Therefore, I don't find fanfic speculating that some (all?) of Bellatrix's behavior could be linked to childhood abuse to be far-fetched at all.
