That's low-key what made sense to me in reading Bellatrix. She's not so much inherently evil, as having tried to get acceptance from her family by being the super-supporter of the Dark Lord that would please them, and broken herself in trying to fit that ideal. In the same way that Narcissa decided to be the perfect pureblood wife and Andromeda left the family to avoid.
