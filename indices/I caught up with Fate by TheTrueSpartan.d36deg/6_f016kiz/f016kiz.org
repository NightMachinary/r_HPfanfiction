I like the authors interpretation of Voldemort. That St Mungo's scene was chilling. I'm not sure how I feel about Snape and Dumbledore so easily accepting Ron so easily, even with all the explanations. It's still weird seeing 13 year old Ron strategizing with them, even though it's justified. But I do love his relationship with Daphne. It seems realistic and kind of sweet

Also the Silver Trio idea is really fascinating- reminds me of the parlor in the Changeling
