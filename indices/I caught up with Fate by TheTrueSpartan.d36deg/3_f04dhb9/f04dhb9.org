The best thing about True Spartan is how fast he updates. Almost one and a half million words within eight months. I was probably one of the first ones to read it, but I honestly thought it was a poor man's 'The Red Knight' and gave up. Job got hectic and had to give up fanfics for a few more months. When I came back it was long and was really interesting before I too caught up. Now I have to wait for him to update.

True Spartan updates amazingly as well. He almost always update within 2-3 days and they are not 1-2k chapters either. They are long, proof read legit 18-20k worded chapters. Amazing dedication. Story is really interesting as well. Character and plot wise. Needless to say it's the most regularly updated fanfiction that I follow. Definitely something that I'm looking forward to everyweek.

It does have an amazing 1k reviews, but I honestly wish people would check it out even more. The author deserves 2k-3k for his current work. It's Ron Centric so it's really good to see atleast 1k reviews. But the great thing is, people who are here after 1500k words are totally devoted to the fic. If you look at the reviews there are reviews as long as a chapter from multiple people.

Another amazing thing is, he doesn't bash any characters. Sure Molly, Harry, Hermione and even Ron has their negative moments, but it's just calling out their canon negative behavior that people tend to ignore.

The story also has a multiple fronts, so there is a lot happening. Usually when this happens fanfic authors ignores the characters, but True Partner always tries to develop his characters as well. If we look at the students Ron, Daphne, Hermione, Harry, Neville, Theo, Blaize, Millie, Pansy, Tracy, Luna, Draco and Ginny all gets developed really well. They all have their own identities. Even JKR didn't try to develop that much characters. And it's not a mess. There is an amazing plot holding it together. And on top of that there are amazing written non MC OC characters like the triumvirate, French veela characters, first years etc. They all have their own identities and they feel like they belong in that universe.

Please please give few chapters a try if you can. It'll encourage the author even more.

P.S. Despite the long comment, I'm not the author and not self promoting here.
