I've loved reading this one, too. I loved the separate arcs and the Greengrass/Chess parts of the fic. I would love to read more chess related fanfics in HP now.

The only issue I have is “payed” a few times. It is a word but has a different meaning than “paid.” Paid is financial while payed is nautical.
