If you have a written diagnosis of ADHD, that counts as a disability that your school should accommodate with extended exam time, test taking in a reduced distraction environment, and possibly note taking by a classmate. Just mentioning it because you sound like me prior to my diagnosis of moderate inattentive adhd at the age of 21, which is notoriously underdiagnosed and more common in women. Twice the time on exams was a godsend during my college engineering classes, since zoning out at the wall every five minutes is awful for solving math problems on a timeframe.
