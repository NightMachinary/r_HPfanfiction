Thank for the reply!

I am from Russia. I just tried to google some information about it and there seem to have been one or two volunteer groups to put out forest fires in some regions. But I don't think there was such a training as you had.

I still think it strange that they allow just some people "from the street" with a week worth of training to come close to such dangerous situations. Or are there restrictions on the kind of work that you do as opposed to a professional firefighter?
