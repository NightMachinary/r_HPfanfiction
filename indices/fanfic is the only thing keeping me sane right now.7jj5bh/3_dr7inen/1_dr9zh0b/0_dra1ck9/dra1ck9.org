Basic training was 2 days, machinists training 3 days, SCBA training another 3 and then there are monthly exercises in the evenings and a couple special trainings for us SCBA wearers on evenings and Saturdays.

Which country would it be? I'm in Switzerland and I know Germany and Austria also have volunteer firefighters (though each country treats them differently).
