Not banging his head but in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/12/35]]) Harry loses it in a hilarious manner.

"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision," Albus announced. Harry tuned the man out and buried his head in his arms. At least everyone had shut up so the head master could speak.

"They're announcing the names," Ron whispered.

"Let them," Harry growled. He peaked up as Albus caught a piece of paper.

"The champion for Durmstrang will be Viktor Krum!" Harry tried to squeeze his ears shut as everyone began applauding.

"You didn't put your name in, did you?" he asked, trying to distract himself.

"It was my choice if I did or did not," Amalie stated.

"True," Harry agreed.

"The champion for Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour!" Harry patted Amalie's hand as her shoulders slumped.

"It's for the best."

"That's the veela girl," Ron commented. Harry glanced at the woman as she walked towards the table. She was indeed the astonishingly beautiful woman from last night.

"One more and I can go to bed."

"You know," Hermione stated, sounding like she was trying to hide her amusement, "this is actually very exciting, Harry."

"For you," Harry grunted. "Although, it will be fun to watch some other shmuck risk his life for a change."

"That's certainly an interesting way of looking at the situation," Amalie commented. Harry just shrugged. He doubted it would actually be too bad. The head masters probably lacked the imagination for real death traps.

"The Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory!" Harry puffed out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding even as the cheering from Hufflepuff's table caused his head to explode into pain.

"You know," Hermione began, "I actually kind of thought. . ."

"Yeah," Ron agreed, looking about as relieved as Harry felt. "It's stupid, but I really did think that Harry's name was going to come out."

"Me too," Harry managed with a weak laugh.

"Why would you think that?" Amalie asked.

"Things tend to happen in this school," Ron answered.

"Usually to Harry," Luna added helpfully.

"Yes, usually to Harry," Harry agreed. "I'm going to bed." He glanced up at the table where Albus was staring at the goblet. Another piece of paper shot out. "No." The old man caught the paper and read it. "No, no, no."

"Harry Potter!"

"Mother fucker, no!" Harry shot to his feet, wand in hand and a powerful blasting curse already building up as he aimed it at the goblet.

"Get him!" Ron yelled.
