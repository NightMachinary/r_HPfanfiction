Black Jack Crowley from [[http://www.geocities.ws/heksie2144/alc.html][The Alchemists Cell]]. He's a criminal and bastard, but he's an interesting one.

In fact, I enjoyed many of the OC's in this fic: Edgar Bones (turns out to be alive), Fay (Edgar's muggle partner), Annie (a muggle friend Harry meets after running away), and the director of the play Harry ends up in. The later sequels had muggle military and police that I got attached to as well. I know people complain about the Hogwarts portions of this fic, but the muggle world section and OC's were fantastic.
