I loved Atlanta Black in the Rewritten in Time Series linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8601821/1/Regrets-Collect-Like-Old-Friends]])

My two favorites are definitely Bronson and Quigley from Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria. I've never gotten so emotionally attached to two OC's before and it is definitely a must read. No longer on [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] but you can google and find a couple pdf's of it floating around.
