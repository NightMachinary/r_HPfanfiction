I haven't read that fic in a long time (the author has stopped updating for some reason) and I am, by no means, a good judge of good stories, but for me, the appeal of Grow young with me, basically boiled down to - one, the fact that was my first fic with Harry (or for that matter, any other character) being paired with an OC; two, that the fic made a good story out of a realistic scenario of Harry losing Ginny in a freak accident and having to bring up three children all on his own, while dealing with his grief (admittedly, a common trope in fiction, but one that I hadn't seen being utilized in the Potterverse before) and finally three, the sheer plot possibilities of muggles getting to know about magic/vice-versa, although IMO Mugglefied did a far better job in this aspect.
