Not from a fanfic, but I read a headcanon that Dean and Seamus end up adopting a muggleborn from an abusive family. His name was Raj and he was supposed to be the same age as James Sirius Potter.

I'm really smitten with the idea that Raj represents some of the flaws in the ministry that everyone is trying to fix and how he parallels Harry's situation, but Raj actually gets to leave his family.
