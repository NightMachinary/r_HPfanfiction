  When he looked back on it later, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in 6th year were much more important than he could have ever known at the time. It was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16; constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come. (AU, SS/LE)
