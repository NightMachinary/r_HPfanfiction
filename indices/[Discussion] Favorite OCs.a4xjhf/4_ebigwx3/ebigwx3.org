These two stories recently became my new favorite pieces of fanfiction: linkffn(2233473; 3353818)

It's an OC-centric fic about four Slytherins, and I think it's the gold standard for OC fics. The author did such a good job that I've grown to care (and worry) about all of them.

We have Tobias Grey, an intelligent, slightly high-strung half-blood wizard who doesn't know how to shut up in situations when he knows that he's right; Tanith Cole, a much more real-life version of the Daphne Greengrass trope (ice queen with a secret heart of gold); Cal Brynmor, a Quidditch-obsessed son of Death Eater parents who was raised by the Muggle-born Auror who jailed one and killed the other; and Gabriel Doyle, a pureblood wizard with a secret (I'll leave it at that).
