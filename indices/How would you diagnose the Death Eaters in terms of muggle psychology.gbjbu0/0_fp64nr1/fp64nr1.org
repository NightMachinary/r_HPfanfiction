I don't think they can be diagnosed as a group. Maybe certain isolated individuals can have some complex or disorder associated with them but I think it's less a psychological problem they have and more the fact that sometimes people just suck. Some are opportunists, some are sadists, some are probably frightened and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect themselves or their families. That doesn't mean they need a diagnosis. I think that would take away from their unique motivations.
