Unfortunately, when it comes to studying people, cool and cruel often interweave. It's terrifyingly fascinating, how many ways there are to be cruel to one another, psychologically speaking.

Apologies for the delay in response. Life, y'know?

And diagnostically, there's no actual separate term 'sociopathic' or 'psychopathic' anymore. They're just colloquial terms for sub-categories of things like Antisocial Personality Disorder or Dissocial Personality Disorder - Personality Disorders being a relatively broad term for things that relate to how you interact with other people and manage your own feelings in social contexts. Otherwise, it's often used wrongly, even by psychological professionals themselves. Some diagnosticians use them interchangeably, some believe there are differences, others agree that there are differences, but disagree on what those differences are. As in most fields examining people, there's a lot of dispute in psychology. :)

The most accurate general definitions I can give for the more academic usages of the terms though are that psychopaths tend to lack all remorse or empathy (they have no 'conscience' to guide them) and tend to manipulate the people around them while sociopaths tend towards simply anti-social or anti-norm behaviours - psychopaths manipulate, while sociopaths deviate, basically. There's no intrinsic violence though - they're not deterministic in that fashion, just contributing factors (they can make it more likely, but it's not absolutely certainly going to happen). If I were restricted to those two terms only, I'd say the DEs would likely be a mix, with more leaning toward psychopathy than sociopathy, but we get so little information on most of the DEs apart from Bellatrix and Lucius and Snappy, so it's hard to really say for sure. Diagnostics is more of an art than a science.

Also yeah, no wonder at that. When it comes to academic stuff, Wikipedia is a reference, not a teaching tool. It's written for people who already know something about the subject. I treat it like a way to remind myself of things without having to go digging through textbooks. I recommend you find a cheap introductory textbook that covers the topic, or look up more 'magazine' articles online like the links below - they're often designed to help laymen digest the relatively complex topics they talk about, so it can be a helpful start to give you the building blocks to go understand the technical terms on wikipedia and such.

I'm not a criminologist, so I'm not really qualified to give an absolute answer - I'm more clinical than forensic - but I believe the definition of a serial killer is just someone who kills 3+ people over a long-ish period of time. The gratification they get from that is more an associated point than a strict criteria for labelling someone that. But given that most people don't take pleasure in murder and torture, I could argue that a lot of Death Eaters would qualify for that as well. Bellatrix certainly seems somewhat over-enthused about torture and murder, for one, but I could also argue that it's more about the dehumanisation aspects. Can hardly take 'pleasure in the murder of people' if you don't see the people you're murdering as people, y'know? That's just my best guess though, I'd recommend finding a criminologist or abnormal psychologist to get a more evidence-backed answer (there are groups like that on reddit, actually).

At the moment, I'm in training to be one, not actually working as one, but here in England, getting the Ph.D qualification you need to be a Clinical Psychologist (mental health treatment specialising psychologist, basically) requires work experience, which I'm currently working on getting. It's stressful, hard-work, I won't deny that. But if you find a good place to work, a place that supports and nurtures you through the tough times, it can be incredibly rewarding.

And heh. No mistaking here. As a handsome jerk on TV once said, "There are two kinds of people who sit around all day thinking about killing people... mystery writers and serial killers. I'm the kind that pays better.‚Äù :D

And no need for awards. Always happy to talk about psychology stuff - sharing your passions is its own reward and all that. :)
