Thanks a ton again, I'll definitely check it out. It sounds really +cruel+ -I mean cool.

Curious, but do you think that the Death Eaters (the more extremists ones) can be termed as either sociopathic or psychopathic (I have very little knowledge on either of the two terms. Most of it streams from Criminal Minds) and do they technically count as Serial Killers? â€˜Cause I read like a page on Wikipedia and was left so utterly confused.

P.S: All these questions are for this ff that my friend and I are thinking of writing, so please don't mistake me for a serial-killer.

P.P.S: And this isn't about the subject, but I was wondering how does it feel to be a psychologist? (Question from somebody who is thinking of it as career).

P.P.P.S: If I wasn't so broke, I'd give you an award for your answer...
