Sure, happy to help. Might as well get some use out of my psychology degree. :)

If you have any more questions about this, feel free to reply here or message me. There's a lot of research been done on this sort of thing and I'm happy to share.

Oh, and about the cult stuff other people talk about in this sub, that's a bit more sociology than psychology, but there's still some in there. Basic gist of that stuff is that the already adrift or struggling are really easy to radicalise or bind into an extremist group (even celebrities - Tom Cruise in Scientology and Allison Mack in that weird sex cult I forget the name of) like the Death Eaters. If you've ever read Delenda Est and saw it talked about disenfranchised Pureblood youths being converted by Voldemort and the pre-DEs (Knights of Walpurgis, IIRC), that's very reflective of how it really happens. It's also why Bellatrix is so easy to make sympathetic - she's so brokenly loyal now that it seems very, very likely that she was one of the previously struggling ones looking for answers or meaning and support and found it in the DEs. That's mostly sociology though - try look at studies of the Moonies in Korea or any of the generic end-of-days cults in America (Heaven's Gate, for instance) and you'll see a lot of how that predation happens with their recruitment.
