There's definitely some individual mental health illnesses there - probably along the psychopathy/personality disorder lines - but otherwise this is basically the answer: Group Think in the DEs and Dehumanisation of the Muggles/Muggleborns. Though I would also argue that mob dynamics is strongly psychological - I spent enough of my psychology degree studying it. :D

If you want an example of that sort of thing happening in real life, look up things like the Stanford Prison Experiment or the Milgram Shock Experiment (and the subsequent experiments building on their findings - particularly those looking at clothing and masks). Both were completely real experiments (that somehow passed an ethics board) where perfectly typical people, as 'normal' as society could deem them, did utterly terrible things to others simply due to conformity of authority and groupthink, and/or dehumanisation of an 'other'. Then there's the Asch Line Experiment, also looking at conformity. People will go against their own perceptions of reality quite often simply to be part of the group.

If you're interested in the psychology of this, OP ( [[/u/888athenablack888][u/888athenablack888]] ), then I'd recommend looking into things along this line of dehumanisation and conformity instead. The DEs were heavily based on the Nazis and this is essentially how they got normal people to turn on whomever their regime wanted, which is also what motivated most of those experiments I mentioned in the last paragraph. The common explanation given in the post-War trials by Nazi soldiers was "I was just following orders" and psychology wanted to find out what was up with that. Really interesting stuff, despite being completely fridge-horror terrifying if you look too deeply.
