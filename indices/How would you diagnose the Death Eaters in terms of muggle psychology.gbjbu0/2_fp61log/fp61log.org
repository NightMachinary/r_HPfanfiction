I think it's hard to generalise. I mean how would you diagnose ppl who are for example members of the KKK or who are in a cult? I think it's had to define and you'd have to look at every person individually. Bellatrix for example is all kinds of crazy and I think everyone who was in Azkaban experiences some kind of repercassions
