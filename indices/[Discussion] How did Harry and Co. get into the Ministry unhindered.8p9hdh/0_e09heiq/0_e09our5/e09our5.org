I understand that. To be honest, it just strikes me as odd that they are able to infiltrate the Department of Mysteries so easily, when such a big point of the 5th book is that no one really knows what goes on there (except for other Unspeakables like Rookwood).

Additionally, I realized it would sort of make sense that there would not be anyone there to Harry and the group since they think Voldemort is there. But what about the Order guard who was supposed to be watching the Hall of Prophecy? Thats never mentioned. Maybe they stopped watching after Arthur got bitten, but Dumbledore doesn't seem to have been deterred by Podemore being sent to Azkaban either. Maybe they killed or removed them, but its harder to catch someone under an invisibility cloak.
