I get that. Personally, I live in an area like that: people leave their houses unlocked and nobody chains up any bikes and things like that. Stealing and serious crime just doesn't happen around here, and its in an area with more than 60k people. I sort of wonder if its that sort of mindset behind the Ministry at the time (what could go wrong, don't bother with security), or if its that security has genuinely /never/ been a thing for the Ministry.

Are there any forms of defenses on the Ministry building at all? If not, why didn't Voldemort stage his coup d'etat earlier than he did? One answer seems to be Dumbledore and/or preferring to operate in the shadows with hit-and-run tactics, but if he gained the Ministry quickly through alternative tactics (e.g. liberal use of the Imperius and legilimency) Voldemort could take the building and apply protective spells to stop apparition/portkey/floo travel. And, if you believe that gaining power over the Ministry grants new authority powers, this would give Voldemort an advantage over Dumbledore, who would need to operate exclusively from Hogwarts.

The biggest issue though with the whole thing is specifically /where/ in the Ministry they are going: the Department of Mysteries. This is supposed to be the Ministries top secret research facility that no one is allowed to know or really even talk about (although Dumbledore and the Order do seem to know quite a bit about it). The fact that there was no protection around this particular area is a gaping hole in the entire idea of the DoM. The only real protection seems to be in the Hall of Prophecy, and really that is only if someone attempts to remove a prophecy in the first place.
