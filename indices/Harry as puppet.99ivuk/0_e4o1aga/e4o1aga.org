...You do realize the horcrux is internal, not external right?

Kind of an odd request, but I'll take a crack at this:

Linkffn(The One He Feared): Harry got Dumbledore's memories in the start of DH.

Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): the most original time-travel fic I have yet encountered.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): its implied something is messing with Harry that is beyond others perceptions.
