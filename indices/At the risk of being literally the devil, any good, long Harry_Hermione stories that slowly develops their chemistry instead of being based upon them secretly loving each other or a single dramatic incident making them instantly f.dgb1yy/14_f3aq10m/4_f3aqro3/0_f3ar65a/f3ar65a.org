I'm sorry, are you just ignoring the parentheses I put up in my comment? Also, the phenomenon where only a minority number of units in any subject or matter are of good quality isn't exclusive HP fanfic pairings, it's applicable to everything. I only read what I deem to be the best, so to me, the sample size is smaller. Try looking up RZZMG and Craft Rose on FanFiction.net and AO3. That's what I call quality Dramione and Hansy fanfic. By the way, how am I gatekeeping OP from anything, I was just putting out my opinion until you trudged along and ruined my morning.
