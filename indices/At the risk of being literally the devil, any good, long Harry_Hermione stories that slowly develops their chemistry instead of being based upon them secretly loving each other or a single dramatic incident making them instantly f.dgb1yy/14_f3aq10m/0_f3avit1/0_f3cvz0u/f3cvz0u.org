Dramione just typically doesn't work. You have to remember, up until the end of fifth year, Draco took his father's word and beliefs as gospel, and was a total bully, spoiled brat, and all around dick. Wasn't much better in sixth year either. He specifically targeted the golden trio, and 5 years of hate and 15 years of brainwashing can't simply be washed away. So, to compensate, the authors use utterly ludicrous plot points, such as Hermione being the daughter of Voldemort or a high ranking death eater, Harry and Ron abandoning their best friend so she goes dark, the mudblood slytherin, sudden and immediate forgiveness, or my personal least favorite, it was all an act.
