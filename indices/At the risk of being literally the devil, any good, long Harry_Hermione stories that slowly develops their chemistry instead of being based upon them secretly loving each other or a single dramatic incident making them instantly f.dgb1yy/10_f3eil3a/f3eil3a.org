You're fine here, but if you're looking for trouble, just crosspost this in [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]].

If you mean well written works that have a Harmony pairing, this I can do!

linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) was really fun, though dark and while it's not very Harmony focused, it is there. Harry doesn't get to save Ron on his birthday. The sequel is linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) which has Canon!Harry LackofaBezoar!Harry and there respective spouses and friends sent to a universe where Voldemort won and Evil!Harry is his 2nd in command.

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) Harry lives, Harry dies, but /when/ he comes back to life isn't fixed. Kinda like a Groundhog Day/Harry Potter crossover where Harry's resets are not fixed in time.
