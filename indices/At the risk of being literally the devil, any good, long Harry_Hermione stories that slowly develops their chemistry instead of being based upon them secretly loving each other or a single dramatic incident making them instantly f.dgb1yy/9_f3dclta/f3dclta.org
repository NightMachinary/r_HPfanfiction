Story: What We're Fighting For [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1]]

I'm not really a fan of the pairing, but I really liked this story. It's a very AU 6th year fic. Hermione is a friendless outcast at school and Harry has been home schooled before this year, with no experience at dealing with people his own age. The two of them meet on the train ride and slowly become first friends and then more.
