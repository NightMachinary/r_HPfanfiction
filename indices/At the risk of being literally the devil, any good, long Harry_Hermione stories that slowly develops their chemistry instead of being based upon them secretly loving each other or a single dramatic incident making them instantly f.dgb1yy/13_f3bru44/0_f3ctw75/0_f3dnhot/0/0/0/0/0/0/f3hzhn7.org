She's fine, it's just, I think everyone is like "Harry looks like James, therefore he should be with a redhead who's stubborn and feisty." My problem with this is James had a mostly sheltered life: Harry was mostly the opposite. Also, I feel like trying to look at him as a replica of James, the canon Harry, is impossible. He isn't a braggort or even extroverted-heck you could say he's the opposite. He plays Quidditch mainly for the feeling of freedom, and as a outlet to ride his broom. He has a small group of friends, mainly I'd say due to Houses, and him not knowing where to start really. In short, he's not a replica of James or of Lily, either in personality or looks. Rather, he's a mixture. A Harry and Ginny pairing really just sounds bad, especially when you realize how stubborn and unyielding Harry is regarding personal things, and how Ginny wouldn't back down as she's to stubborn to do so. Throw in the Weasley temper, and you've got a intense argument every time something actually serious and not superficial comes up. This is why I despise the Harry/Ginny pairing. Canon Harry would need someone with patience in spades, a caring attitude, and overall a warm personality at the very least. This is my perspective on the situation of Hinny in canon. Make of it what you will.
