I admit there were scenes that were poorly done, but half-blood Prince is miles better than the best fanfiction.

Rowling wanted to showcase Hermione had flaws in the books, but she never really followed up on her learning from them. I thought Hermione showing jealousy at being beaten at potions was a great idea.

The funny thing is that the most sympathetic figure in the book is Lavender.
