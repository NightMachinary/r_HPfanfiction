I am the same. I saw Harry and Hermione in first book. The movies really reinforced that for me because there was so much more chemistry between Harry and Hermione than Harry and Ginny. Movies did that so badly at least for me. I initially read romine and there are some great romine stories out there. Now I read a lot of harmony with occasional Hermione Neville. My fav character is obviously Hermione. It should not matter which ship you love. Many are so good.
