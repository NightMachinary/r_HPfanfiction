Harmony is canon as far as I'm concerned. I've long since dismissed books 6 and 7 from my memory (never even bothered to finish 7 I hated it so much), and I ALWAYS felt they belonged together. Don't think I can suggest anything that hasn't already appeared here though, as basically all the fics include the ones I would have mentioned, and some I've never heard of (thus adding them to my overly long list of things to read).
