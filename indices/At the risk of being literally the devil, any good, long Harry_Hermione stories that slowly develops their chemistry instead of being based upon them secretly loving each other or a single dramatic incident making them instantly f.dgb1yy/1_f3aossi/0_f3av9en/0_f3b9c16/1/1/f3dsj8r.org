Thanks for recommending Moments in Love. I'm only at chapter 6, but I like how it's handling things.

I don't object to Harmony in principle, but I think a lot of stories try to suddenly pull "it is you I have loved all along" out of the air, and it grates. This one does it much more believably, going back to first principles and adjusting the Golden Trio dynamic to make it work. And the author may be on to something with the claim that Harry changed a lot after meeting Ron.

I'll see how the rest of the fic goes, but I'm optimistic.
