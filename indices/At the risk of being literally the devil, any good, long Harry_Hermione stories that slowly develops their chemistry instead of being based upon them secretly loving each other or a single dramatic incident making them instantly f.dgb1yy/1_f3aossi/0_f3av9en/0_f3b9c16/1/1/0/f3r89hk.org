Yeah, I recently started reading a fic and backed out immediately because the first paragraph was literally Harry having lightbulb flash that he totally loved Hermione and then they made out for 15 minutes and told Ron they didn't have time to be around him and his slacking off anymore, and went back to making out. It was so bizarre.
