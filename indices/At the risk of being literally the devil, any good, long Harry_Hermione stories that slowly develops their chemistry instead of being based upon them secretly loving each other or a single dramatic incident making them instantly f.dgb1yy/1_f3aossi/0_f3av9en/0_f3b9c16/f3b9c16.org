I just want to see the character arcs that the first book set up. Not Rowling's shoehorn ships and the sledgehammer school of character development she uses to make up for forgetting a character exists for three books.

Harry's pre-Hogwarts schooling makes him sound like, if not some kid genius character, at least a good student, who's very interested in learning about magic. Both of which have previously been stolen from him by the Dursleys. Meanwhile Hermione's character arc in the first book, among other things, has her realizing that there are more important things than grades.

Then all of that gets reset, and reset again several times after when you'd think they'd have reason to change like after abusing the time-turner for Hermione or after the tournament for Harry, because at that point Rowling has mentally typecast Harry as a slacker quidditch jock, and Hermione as an obsessive nerd with no sense of boundaries or self-care.

Then the whole Hermione-Ron shoehorn ship happens, despite never bothering to progress their relationship beyond Ron being someone Hermione mostly tolerates because he's attached to Harry.

If I wanted to see more shoehorn ships I'd /read the original damn books/.
