If we were talking about almost anyone else, I would agree. But we are talking about the girl who charged a Basilisk with a sword at 12 and faced Voldemort 3 times, as well as the friend who was along for most of the ride and who went back through time to face off against a horde of dementors.

After being through that hell and back, the opinion of their classmates, a good chunk of whom already wants to kill Hermione and the large majority of who is happy to hate Harry/Jasmin with any available excuse, shouldn't matter at all. After all, compared to Voldemort, how bad could they be?
