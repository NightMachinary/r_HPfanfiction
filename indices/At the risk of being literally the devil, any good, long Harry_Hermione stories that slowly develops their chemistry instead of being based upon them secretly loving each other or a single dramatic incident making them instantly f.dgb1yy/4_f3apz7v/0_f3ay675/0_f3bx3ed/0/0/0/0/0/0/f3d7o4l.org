Those "few teenagers" as you say, one: have parents that can effectively ruin the two socially and politically, two: are the vast majority of their peers and colleagues for the rest of their lives, and three: can make their lives living hell. Case in point, First year: Harry and Hermione were ostracized in Gryffindor for the massive point loss, and only Ron and the quidditch team would talk to them, Second year: Heir of Slytherin debacle, Fourth year: Triwizard Tournament, Fifth Year: Dumbass Umbitch & the Prophet. True, neither truly gave in, but public opinion has always been fickle when it comes to Harry, Hermione had the odds stacked against her from day one, and coming out could potentially lead to them becoming blacklisted in magical society, with the only place even potentially willing to hire them being the Quibbler (Can you see the Lovegoods caring about lesbianism?). We still have pride marches and gay rights activists where I live in America almost twenty five years after this story is set, can you honestly say a much more bigoted and restrictive society such as magical Britain in the 90's was would be better? I can't see 15 year old Hermione commiting social suicide less than a year into her relationship, and like I previously stated Molly Weasley, Harry's only real maternal figure, often adopts a very conservative viewpoint. Losing her and by extension the Weasley family would absolutely crush Harry.
