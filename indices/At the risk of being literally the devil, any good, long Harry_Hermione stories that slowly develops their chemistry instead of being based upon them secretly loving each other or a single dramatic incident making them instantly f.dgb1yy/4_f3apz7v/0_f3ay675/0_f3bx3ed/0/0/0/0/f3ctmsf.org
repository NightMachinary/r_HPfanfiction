As an outsider who hasnt read the fic, may I offer my opinion? To be fair, they are teenagers, so social pressure is a big thing. And it's also the nineties, so, people aren't exactly as accepting of the LGBT community. Plus, Wizarding Britain is said to be stick in the Victorian Era, where appearances were everything. Name a single canon homosexual relationship in the Harry Potter EU. Harry's biggest desire was always to be accepted and loved, so of course he/she would be angsty and afraid. Hermione isn't a social outcast by choice. Hello, troll incident of Halloween '91? And then we all know Molly Weasley, a woman both Harry and Hermione revere, is rather conservative, I'd even go so far as to call her one of the most conservative characters in the series. And the first section of the trilogy, based on title, I'd say takes place during the Triwizard tournament, where Rita Skeeter ran rampant. Eh but what do I know. I'll go read it and come back to this thread later.
