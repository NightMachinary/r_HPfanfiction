The issue with Harry/Draco is that there is no way this pairing could work. Draco did horrible things to Harry and his friends (Katie Bell, Hermione) and was only "redeemed" after he was personally suffering from the choices he made. He had the evidence that the pureblood cause was bullshit right in front of him for 6 years (Hermione besting him in everything, the "mudblood Evans" blasting Voldemort out of his body) and ignored it. He demanded a muggleborn genocide since he was twelve. How could Harry be attracted to that, especially since Draco ought to serve at least a lifetime in Azkaban for his crimes?
