It seems like there was a whole website of stories where Snape became a Christian and underwent a complete personality transplant similar to a pod person? He insisted on being called Brother Severus, even by the students? I wonder if that's still up, you might get a few chuckles out of it, as they all follow the exact same plot.... It seems like one of the stories was called 'Oh My Soul'? I'll do a bit of poking around later, see if I can find it for you.
