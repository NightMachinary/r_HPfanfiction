The website seems to be gone, and Fiction Alley only has part of the one I was talking about, but [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/logospilgrim/OMS01a.html][here]] is the link to that anyway. Apparently the author, Logospilgrim, removed the longer, 25 chapter version from FFN because she didn't intend to complete it anymore.
