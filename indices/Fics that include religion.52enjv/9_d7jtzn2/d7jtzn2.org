There's one that I became fond of but its still a WIP and a crossover. Basically /Harry Potter/ meets /Charmed/ and how the Charmed ladies use magic is in fact related to how the HP universe does magic. In /Charmed/ wiccan spells and powers are real and it just seems like an interesting thing to mash up with HP.

Managed to find the thing linkffn(2272234). WARNING: Read at own risk! Hasn't been updated since 2005! I'm only linking it as proof that I didn't imagine it.

The /concept/ is sound even if there's a lot of old tropes and weird stuff with cannon in there.
