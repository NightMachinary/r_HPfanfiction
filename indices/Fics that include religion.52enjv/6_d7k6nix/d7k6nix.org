Main character is an OC, twin sister of the boy who lived. And while the Potters survived Halloween, they proceeded to leave her with the Dursleys. This does not result in a particularly good childhood.

Anyways, she worships the personification of Death, Baron Samedi. There are 13 other gods like him, each with a domain - totaling 7 Light, and 7 Dark. [[/spoiler][A bit more than worships, to be honest - she's a Voodoo practitioner, which means that Death owns her soul, and she gets some abilities in return. The ability to perform human sacrificial rituals, for instance.]]

I also feel obligated to recommend To The Stars, even though it isn't a Harry Potter fanfic (instead being PMMM). Set ~450 years after the end of PMMM [[/spoiler][and Madoka's rewriting of history/editing of the universe]], 20 years after Magical Girls are revealed to the public [[/spoiler][thanks to their intervention in an alien attack on a human colony world]], it follows a newly contracted Magical Girl from Earth. One of the main plot threads is her involvement with "The Cult of Hope", a religion for Magical Girls by Magical Girls, and the only religion to be growing in the year 2460. [[/spoiler][And a religion that can actually back up it's claims with evidence, thanks to the frequent visions the ascended Madoka grants.]] No prior exposure to PMMM is required to follow along with the plot.
