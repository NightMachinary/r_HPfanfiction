To argue about this, we'd need to answer 'what is the soul?'

'Soul' is an inherently religious idea, but not all religions claim there are souls. Buddhism, for example, says there is no self and so there is no soul. In religions that claim souls exists, there is always a story of the divine origin of the soul.

Rowling does not directly mention religion at all within her story, and she didn't come up with a new religion explaining the soul. What the reader is left with is the inference that some religion out there got it right, all of them claiming the soul has divine origin.
