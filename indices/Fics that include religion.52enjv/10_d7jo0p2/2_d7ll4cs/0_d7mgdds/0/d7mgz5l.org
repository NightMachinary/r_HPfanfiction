  What the reader is left with is the inference that some religion out there got it right, all of them claiming the soul has divine origin.

Or, you know, none of them is right. In the universe of HP, when we only look at what we are told, the afterlife is merely a different state of existence. We know there are souls, but there is absolutely no reason to believe they are part of something divine. One could also argue that they are a natural occurrence within this universe and god was never needed for it.

In the real world the soul is a spiritual idea, true (and even there the chance that one human-made ideology hits the mark is almost nil, should it turn out souls exist). But we are speaking about a made up universe that only has a striking similarity with our real one. One may explore this universe however he deems fit, but I for one prefer a Occam's razor approach.
