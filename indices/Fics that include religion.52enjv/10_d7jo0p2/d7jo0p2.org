I used to think that religion was an odd thing to implement in Harry Potter, even though I'm Catholic myself, but think about it - horcruxes mean that people have souls and if you have a soul then there's a god of some sort, and so a heaven an hell as well? Even in the last book Harry winds up in some sort of purgatory-like place after dying.
