The wizards in my story "Patron" revere the Old (pagan) gods - or what they think are the old gods - with a few rituals described in scenes. Although most are not really religious, the return to the pagan gods was more a "screw you" aimed at Christian Witch hunters. Some groups take it more seriously, though, and and there's a sect as well.
