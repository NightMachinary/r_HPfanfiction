If you don't mind crossovers (and somewhat unfinished stories - there are two or three complete books, a chapter or two long omake, and a start of another bookbthat hasn't been updated for years), there's a bunch of religion-related magic in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) which is a Harry Potter and Dresden Files crossover. As someone who has literally no idea what the Dresden Files was before starting the fanfic, I found the stories a great read full of non-canon magic, characters, and lore.
