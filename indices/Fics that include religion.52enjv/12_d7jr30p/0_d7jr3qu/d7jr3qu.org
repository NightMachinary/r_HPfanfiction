  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.
