Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341). The first one has Harry jumping into the Star Wars universe after Sirius fell through the Veil. He came back an edgy Sith Lord. In the sequel, his misdeeds were discovered and they forced him and his girls through the Star Gate, where he embarked on a galactic conquest. This fic has a genocide almost every 5 chapters, and one marriage infidelity led to deaths of billion.
