Steelbager has some great fics in this category.

/The Power He Knows Not/, a completed HP/LOTR crossover. The dimension hop isn't really the focus of the story, though.

/The Shadow of Angmar/, an in-progress HP/LOTR crossover that is steeped in lore, as well as the mechanics of HP-style magic. The dimension hop is definitely a big part of the plot.

/A New Man/, an on-hiatus HP/Avengers crossover that seems to be leading to a very interesting twist. The dimension hop is a big part of the plot in this one, too.
