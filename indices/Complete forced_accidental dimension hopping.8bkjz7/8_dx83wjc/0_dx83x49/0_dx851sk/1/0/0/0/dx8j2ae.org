  Harriet Potter, displaced in a world where people have strange powers and nobody speaks her language, is pretty sure she's screwed. Until, that is, she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children.However, when their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. With assassins on her trail, and a new group threatening the just-found stability of the Shinobi world, Harriet may be hard-pressed to create the family that she's always wanted.
