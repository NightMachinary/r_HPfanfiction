Yeah, but I honestly can't think of anything that comes closer to a marraige law fic where sexuality is a sticking point.

You are right, its abhorrent that something like this would exist (marriage laws). Like a lot of tropes, I see it as a shortcut to something else the author wants to happen but neither 1) considered its implications or 2) wanted to do a lot of work to make their story "happen." This is a bigger problem in shipping stories than anywhere else.
