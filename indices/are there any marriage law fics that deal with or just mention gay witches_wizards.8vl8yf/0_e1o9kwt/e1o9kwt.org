Closest thing I can think of is the status of wizard sexuality in the Firebird Trilogy. I'll let Rolanda Hooch speak for me:

  Finnigan gulped loudly. "That doesn't sound fun."

  "No, it isn't," Hooch said, wearing a smirk oddly reminiscent of Malfoy's. "Many elders of the Wizengamot over the years have learned this lesson when they fail speak according to their coven's wishes. I say this, because this is one of the expectations of being a wizard in our society. You will get married, and will at the have two spouses. There are only forty children in this incoming class. Last year, there were eighty four. Before that, there were one hundred twenty three. Bef one hundred fifty. This school was built to house and teach up to six thousand students at any one time. We have not had a student body above a thousand for generations, and that was when we were one of the only magical schools in all of Europe. Nor are we alone---Beauxbatons and Durmstrang also have experienc population losses, as have most of the magical communities in the world. We will explore many of the theories why in his class."

  She paused and looked at the boys in the room. "Next year's class is almost eighty percent witches. Four witches for every wizard, primarily because of the stre war, and the purposeful targeting of male children by You­Know­Who."

  MacMillan raised his hand until Hooch nodded to him. "What if you're a poofter?"

  Hooch sneered. "You get married and do your duty, and then you go seek whatever pleasures you wish if your coven so allows it."

  Harry sat up---day school teachers did not talk like that. "Make no mistake," the professor continued. "Wizarding society has its expectations, and those who fail those expectations are at best looked down upon. Our population cannot tolerate any behavior that would prevent a wizard from siring children. If someone of alternate sexual orientation fails to marry and produce a child, that wizard will be bound, veiled, and sent out among the Muggles. It is harsh, and for those raised outside modern Muggle society, a facet you may not be accustomed to. However, it is one of many necessities of our society. Now, open your books to chapter one, where discuss just what it means to be magical."

Harsh.
