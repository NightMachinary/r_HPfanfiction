The fic mentioned *wizards* having children with non-magical people. (Or at least, magical people with the ability to emit sperm. That series is not a good place to be trans.) Magical fetuses need magical wombs, or else they have a very large chance of miscarriage; magical infants need magical milk, or else they have a very large chance of dying.

Unfortunately, I believe the author forgot the possibility that *witches* might have children with non-magical people when writing that passage. Neither of the problems the author mentioned apply to a magical person giving birth to non-magical offspring.

There were enough cases of magic/muggle interbreeding for Professor McGonagall to state that only one in a hundred thousand male fetuses born to non-magical parents survive, so apparently some people aren't terribly squeamish about that kind of thing.
