Three books linkffn(8629685;9646669;10373959):

The world is an AU where witches dominate males in terms of numbers but wizards are more powerful. When witches "bond" to wizards, they siphon off their magical ability to a degree. Since the witches are more numerous and wizards are generally more aggressive, multiple bonding are often mandated on wizards because they cannot be too powerful to disrupt society.

Its one of the most developed magical AUs I can think of, and it is one of the only harem fics I find I enjoy, mostly because the fic revolves around the idea of how bad harems are and trying to end their proliferation.

And the fic isn't homophobic; that passage is showing how insane their world is where they force people who have different sexualities to conform. In fact, thats one of the big moral messages of the fic.
