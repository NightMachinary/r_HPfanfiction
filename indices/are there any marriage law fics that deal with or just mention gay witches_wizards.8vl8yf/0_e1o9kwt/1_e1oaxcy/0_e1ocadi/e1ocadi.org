See, the thing is, in this fic the witch-born are an entirely different species. For them, muggles are like Neanderthals compared to modern humans.

There is no incentive for them to leave most of the time except sex essentially, and this comes at the cost of near constant pain, being stripped of your magic, monitored for the rest of your life, and leading a constant double life that you can never talk about.
