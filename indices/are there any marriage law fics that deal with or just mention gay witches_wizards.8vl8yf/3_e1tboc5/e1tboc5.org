To quote Ron Weasley: "Are you a witch or not?"

I don't really read this trope, so I don't have any fic examples, but I see no reason two wizards or witches couldn't have a child by some magical means.

Simplest solution seems to be for one of them to temporarily switch genders. I can't imagine there's not a potion for that.
