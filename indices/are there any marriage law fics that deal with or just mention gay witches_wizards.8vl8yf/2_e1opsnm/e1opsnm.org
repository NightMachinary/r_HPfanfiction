This is a bit off topic but why is it called a Marriage Law? The whole point of such stories is that the population (for one reason or another) is in a decline and the magical community needs an uptick in the birth rate to increase their population. Last time I checked, you don't have to get married in order to have children, thus you don't have to get married to have in increase in the population. I know for /some/ stories, it is for the author to pair two people together that wouldn't have any realistic chance to get together in the first place if this Marriage Law hadn't been enacted (e.g. Charlie Weasley x Hermione Granger).

However, it would be a bit interesting if the magical communities followed that of their Muggle counterparts in terms of the birth rate. I know England's birth rate is 1.81 while France is at 1.88 (according to 2016 - 2017 statistics), and while both are below the 2.1 replacement level, they are among the highest in Europe.
