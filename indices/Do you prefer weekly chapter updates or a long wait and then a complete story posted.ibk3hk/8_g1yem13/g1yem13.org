I never read a WIP (or anything that isn't already marked complete) except occasionally by accident because A) I usually knock out a book every night, unless it's exceptionally long or I'm exceptionally tired (30k-150k) and B) I have zero confidence that a WIP will actually be completed, and I hate an unfinished story. Even if they say it's already finished and they're publishing it a bit at a time, they still get abandoned sometimes.

I favorite anything I might like to read again, or that I would recommend to a friend, and leave reviews for the ones that were exceptional, even though they were often published years and years ago, but I know it's the WIP readers that really keep the writers going, so many thanks to all of you with more patience than me ü•∞

Edit: In daylight, brain at normal capacity hours, I realized I sound like an ass with my "I read 150k words every night" bit. I'm not an ass, I just have chronic insomnia, no money or desire to read anything but free HP fanfic, and no talent or motivation to write my own. I rely on you guys to keep me from going insane; you're my heroes ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üéâ
