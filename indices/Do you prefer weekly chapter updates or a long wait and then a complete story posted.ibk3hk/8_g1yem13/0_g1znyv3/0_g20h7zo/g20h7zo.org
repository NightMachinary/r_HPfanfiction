Unfinished sequels to really excellent books are the bane of my existence ðŸ˜… My one that got away though, the one that I update a review about once a year, is a Hobbit fic that's an unfinished companion fic to one that thankfully /is/ finished. The unfinished version from a different character's POV is about 100 times better though. I still check about once month for an update ðŸ˜¢
