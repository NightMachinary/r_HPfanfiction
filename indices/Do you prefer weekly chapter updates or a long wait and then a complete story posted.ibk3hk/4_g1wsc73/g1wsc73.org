I'd rather read a finished story and in any case, wouldn't want to expect an author to follow a weekly or other schedule, since they have their own stuff happening in their lives. It's fine that they post when they feel like it. It also seems to me that installment-published stories tend to not get updated after the last part is posted. This is unfortunate since lots of them could use a deep editing pass after all the chapters are written. So the end result reads like a first draft. It's ok, it's fanfic and I'm used to that, but it's an area where pro fic (not counting JKR after around volume 3 of the HP series, by which time she had grown stronger than her editors and could publish her books with all the loose ends dangling out) has an advantage over fanfic.

That all said, one reason I keep checking back here is there's a story in progress for which I'm eagerly awaiting updates ;).
