I have no preference as to how a story is posted. Whichever way best enables the writer to continue writing and feel positive about the story, I suppose. As a writer, I'm very much post-as-I-go, and the actual posting of a thing is a strong motivator for continuing. I know another writer who can't post until it's complete. So, really, whatever works for the given author is what I prefer, since happy authors are more likely to write well than discouraged ones.

As a reader, I read it all at once up to where it's current, then leave for a few years and check back to see if it's finished yet, re-read up to the present, repeat. I don't have a good enough memory to follow a story week-to-week, let alone if it updates monthly or something.
