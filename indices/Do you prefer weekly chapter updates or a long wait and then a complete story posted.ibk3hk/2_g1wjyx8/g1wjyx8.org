I prefer fics that update weekly, but anything longer than that I find I have trouble remembering what happened, so in those cases (aka most of them) I prefer the entire fic to be dropped at once.

The ideal situation, IMO, is when the author posts weekly, but has already finished the fic in full, and has announced that, so you don't have to worry about delays.
