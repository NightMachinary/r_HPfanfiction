Well, I definitely like fics that are split into chapters far more than 50k+ word fics all shoved into a single chapter. Sure, I'm going to read them all in one sitting either way, but the chapter breaks help refresh things emotionally and reduce the fear of completely losing my place in the fic thanks to a wayward flick or dropped phone lmao.

In terms of release schedules? Hmm... I'm not sure. Generally, I don't really read ongoing fics. I'm more of a binge reader, and it can be difficult for me to keep up with multiple fics updating over time. I'm also pretty wary of incomplete fics that the author may end up dropping in the future.

At the end of the day, though, I feel like authors have their reasons for releasing fics over time. I feel like the authors who have the entire story complete by the time they post the first chapter are a small percentage of authors. Many only have part of the story written. So, while they are far enough ahead to guarantee weekly updates, they don't have a complete story to post.
