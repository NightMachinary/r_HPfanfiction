A couple of reasons:

Hermione is the most popular female author-avatar character, somewhat equivalent to Harry in that regard.

This is partly because many female fans identify with her introverted bookworm persona, and partly because she's the most central female character in the books. Consequently, when people want to ship Tom Riddle with a female character without making it a blatant self-insert, Hermione is the go-to choice.

Secondly, many people prefer to ship Tom Riddle with someone who would be his intellectual equal, who could challenge his ideas and help him grow as a person.

Hermione is a logical choice in that regard because the books show that she is intelligent, driven, and occasionally ruthless. Ginny isn't as popular to ship because she's usually portrayed as less intellectual. Fanfic authors typically write her as a tomboy or a bit of a jock, and/or a little girl with a princess complex. Also, Hermione grew up amidst muggles before learning about magic, granting her a few more paralels to Tom, whereas Ginny grew up knowing that she was magical and a pureblood. Thus, Ginny doesn't have as much in common with Tom and shipping them is less intuitive.

Also, it doesn't help that Chamber of Secrets showed Tom mostly being disgusted/annoyed by his Diary interaction with Ginny. An author who wanted to ship them would have to invent a backstory in which Tom was lying about his true feelings in the Chamber, or show that Ginny later grew into someone Tom could admire, etc. It takes more character development/revisionism compared to the HG/TMR ship, which is one reason the ship is less popular.
