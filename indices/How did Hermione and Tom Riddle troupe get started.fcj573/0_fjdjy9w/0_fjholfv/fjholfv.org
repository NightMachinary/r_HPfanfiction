Thanks for taking the time to answer! What you're saying makes a lot of sense, I hadn't thought of it from that view point before.

I do love hermione in the books and she is a dynamic character. I think I have a hard time with hermione-ships in fanfiction in general because the ones I have read portray hermione as this perfect woman who just does everything right and she almost becomes more of a one dimensional character because of that.

Maybe I need to try again and find a better story to read.
