To be honest I've seen fics that fall on either side. Some HG/TMR fics portray her as preternaturally intelligent, always uber prepared, and thus able to easily get the upper hand in her battle of wits/hearts against Tom. Others make the mistake of dumbing her down to less than what she was in the books, making her fall prey to simple manipulation and often driven by hormones to do things that are obviously wrong.

It's rare to find fics that balance in between those two extremes, but I enjoy reading the stories that do.

I haven't read many Ginny/Tom fics, and the few I did try didn't strike my fancy. I would like to see what the better examples might be. Do you know of any you would recommend?
