Oh in that case, here are a few that I've enjoyed. In my opinion these all do a decent job portraying Hermione as intelligent but also balanced by believable flaws.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/][Birds of a Feather]] - Hermione is born in Tom Riddle's generation. They become friends before they get their Hogwarts letters. linkao3(15996890)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157995/1/Tom-Just-Tom][Tom Just Tom]] - While struggling with PTSD after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione buys a pet snake which turns out to be more than she bargained for. linkffn(12157995)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/][Blood and Gold]] - Hermione travels back in time intending to prevent Tom Riddle's birth, but an accident strands her much later than she planned. linkao3(10643571)
