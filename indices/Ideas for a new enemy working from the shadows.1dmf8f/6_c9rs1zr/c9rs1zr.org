Apart from Lucius Malfoy there aren't very many other adult characters who are main character-type antagonists without inventing your own. The only other one I can think of is a bat-shit crazy Bellatrix Lestrange trying to get some sort of revenge or continue on with the Voldemort-type idealism.

EDIT: Or Dumbledore. I don't know what your fic is about but if Dumbledore turned bad (like evil) somehow that could be really bad because he could be deceptive and he is so powerful.
