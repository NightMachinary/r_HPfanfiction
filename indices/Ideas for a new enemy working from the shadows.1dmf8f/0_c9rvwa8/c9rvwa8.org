Why not use Grindelwald?

A few former Death Eaters break him out. Disgusted by their simple prejudices and lack of vision, he kills them all with his Dumbledore-level skill, and heads for Britain. He feels remorse for the atrocities he committed during his younger years, but he still thirsts for power. He still wishes to see himself ruling over a wizarding world that is not hidden from the muggles, but dominating them.

Could lead to some interesting machinations / power plays.

P.S. You might head to DLP or MuggleNet for story advice.
