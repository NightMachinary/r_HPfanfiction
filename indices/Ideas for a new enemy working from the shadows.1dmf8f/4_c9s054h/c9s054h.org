I've been thinking of a relatively similar story myself. Voldemort's Horcruxes don't work. I mean, they were invented long ago (and they were relatively common knowledge - a potions teacher on the good side knows about them), why don't we have ancient evil wizards who made horcruxes ruling the world? So, Horcruxes just don't work. However, Dumbledore thinks that Voldemort actually did come back to life. Dumbledore is the antagonist while still being on the good side. He wants to prepare Harry in his normal, semi-abusive way, which isn't needed at all.

Alternatively, Dumbledore is evil. That's a fairly overused plot though, so if you go with that, it won't be original.
