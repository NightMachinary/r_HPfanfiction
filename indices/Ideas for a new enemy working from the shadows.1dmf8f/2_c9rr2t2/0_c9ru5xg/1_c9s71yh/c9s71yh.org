Honesty it's really easy to put someoe like Malfoy as the antagonist behind the antagonist. Have him scheme towards an end benefitial to him, while applying money, political pressure and the ocassional "accidental" death. Assuming that Harry is the simbol he's painted as, he would be a very valuable piece to try to draw to the antagonists side and if that fails to subtly manipulate him in a place where he would help. And Harry being a kid and not really having the understanding for politics can have the ocasional small win while still moving the antagonist's plot. I'm assuming you can go from there.
