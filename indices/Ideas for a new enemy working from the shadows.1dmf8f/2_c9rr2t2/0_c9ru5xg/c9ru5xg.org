I do like the idea of a Lucius Malfoy type character being the main antagonist, and the more I think about it the more I want see the benefits in doing so. But in that case we are dealing with a very political opponent, which leaves the problem I brought up about him being in school.

I just donÂ´t see a boy/teenager being able to outmaneuver an old fox who's been in the business for years and years, and who has everyone in his pocket.

/How would you say he could make problems for young Harry, and how would young Harry fight it?/

  What about either skipping first few years or declaring that in your fic Hogwarts starts for 15 years old to avoid "children in my story are adults" problem? Or is the problem a bit different?

This is a very good idea. Have you seen this being implemented anywhere or is it just something you came up with?

Obviously apart from here.
