  Sure the bigotry remains, and the purebloods rally to remain in power, but what happens after that?
#+end_quote

What about antagonist in form of bigoted pureblood society? Or maybe Lucius Malfoy in particular? He is already well established as pulling the strings and is far more interesting than I-am-so-unoriginal-that-I-am-unable-to-even-find-interesting-torture-and-hiding-places-of-my-horcruxes-are-hilariously-obvious. With Lucius you avoid problems caused by introducing OC and have character that may be used to spawn any type of plots without going OOC.

It also gives possibility of Dumbledore as "muggle-loving fool" rather than "this guy responsible for all problems in Harry's life".

  Is there new dark forces moving in?

Maybe in reverse of typical "UK is the only place in magical world with bigotry, all other countries are perfect" magical Britain is OK compared to other countries (Durmstrang does not admit Muggle-borns, etc) and problems are in the form of Umbridge imposed by ICW to uphold ancient and proper traditions? (see [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/19/Harry-Potter-The-Forgotten-Brother]] for example of situation like this)

  Any game of politics is difficult for a fanfiction in Hogwarts-era
#+end_quote

What about either skipping first few years or declaring that in your fic Hogwarts starts for 15 years old to avoid "children in my story are adults" problem? Or is the problem a bit different?

  Also, on another note, where would I be able to sit down of a forum and/or chat and discuss various ideas for my story?
#+end_quote

Maybe here?
