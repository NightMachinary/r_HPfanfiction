I think you already have a great example of this in OotP.... Fudge is fighting to remain in control no matter the consequences. And he knows that to change a culture, you start with the education system and curriculum. In fact, that's not the only time Fudge makes Harry's life horrible. Why not use Fudge? You could make him less bumbling than he is in canon.
