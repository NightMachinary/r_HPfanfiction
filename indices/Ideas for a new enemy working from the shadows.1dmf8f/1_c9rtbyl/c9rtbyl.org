If you're gonna have Voldemort die, there is a whole hell of a lot that's going to change. Harry won't be raised by the Dursleys. He'll grow up knowing that he's a wizard. He'll know his story, and he'll be aware of his own celebrity. His scar will be different (depending on how you interpret canon -- he'll either have no scar, or a faded scar) and he won't be a Parselmouth anymore.

You'll have to explain the backstory before you can come up with a new antagonist. If Voldemort died on Halloween, does that mean that there were no Horcruxes? If there never were any Horcruxes made to begin with, that means Voldemort's body and soul were intact. Perhaps he had a family? Maybe even children? Or, if there /were/ Horcruxes made and then destroyed, perhaps the person who destroyed them will play a role. You'll also have to explain how the Prophecy fits in. If there was a Prophecy, was it the same as in canon or was it different? In the absence of a Prophecy, you'll have to explain why Voldemort targeted infant Harry.

Even if you explain all of that away with "everything is exactly as in canon except for this one thing -- don't think about it too much!" (and that's definitely an option!) you'll still have to deal with one question: /Why/ would Harry Potter be encountering this new antagonist?

Why is this new person going after a schoolboy? Or, alternatively, is Harry the one seeking out the antagonist? If he is, why? If it is still the antagonist seeking Harry, what is their motivation? Is it revenge in Voldemort's name, and if so, are they a former Death Eater? Is it because they see Harry as a threat to be neutralized as soon as possible? Are they trying to recruit Harry into their ranks? Have they been after Harry all of his life, or does his entering school trigger the confrontations? Why are they going after Harry while he's at Hogwarts? Why can't they wait until he graduates?

If you can come up with some answers to those questions, then the antagonist will slowly become more defined. Extrapolate on the world you create and see what kind of antagonist would naturally evolve in that setting. For instance, if Voldemort is found dead, then the Longbottoms wouldn't be tortured for information on his whereabouts. If Bellatrix, Crouch Jr., and the Lestrange brothers never torture the Longbottoms, that could mean that they escape imprisonment, flee England, meet a new evil dude while abroad, and persuade him to target Harry Potter for one reason or another. There are so many repercussions of having Voldemort dead that if you just pick a consequence (like the Longbottoms being spared, or the Sorcerer's Stone never being destroyed, or the curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position being broken...) then you can follow it wherever it may lead and decide whether a new villain can spawn from that thread. By working this way, you can slowly reveal to your readers just why everything is happening, and the story you tell will be much more in-depth than "Harry is basically just a magnet for evil dark lords."
