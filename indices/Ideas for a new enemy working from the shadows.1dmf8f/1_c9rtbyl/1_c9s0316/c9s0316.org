I think that the best way to get rid of Volde permanently without caring about the 'cruxes is saying that the horcruxes don't actually work. I mean, they were invented long ago (and they were relatively common knowledge - a potions teacher on the good side knows about them), why don't we have ancient evil wizards who made horcruxes ruling the world?
