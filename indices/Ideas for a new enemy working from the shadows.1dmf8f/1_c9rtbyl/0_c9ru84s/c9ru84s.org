I realize all this and I have been working with that in mind. I would like to point you to [Lords of Magic]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I]]) by Taure if you want to see it in action. I am very sorry to say it is on hiatus. It is one of the few fanfics that deal with an AU world.
