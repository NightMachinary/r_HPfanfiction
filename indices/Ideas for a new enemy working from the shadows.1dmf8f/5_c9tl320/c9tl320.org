Well - going from the Pottermore stuff, some of Voldemort's followers viewed Harry as a potential new Dark Lord.

With that in mind - how about Lucius Malfoy and a league of former Death Eaters, is attempting to push Harry towards using Dark Magic - the yearly challenge is arranged by him to force Harry into darker and darker actions to protect him and his friends.

As a villian, Lucius also has to try to alienate Hermione from Harry - potentially allowing her to take more of Ron's part later in the story - and using his political influence to pass anti-Muggleborn laws, without alienating Harry as a potential future ally.
