Off the top of my head:

linkffn(Retrograde by Knife Hand) is Harry/Amelia.

Narcissa: linkffn(Laughing All the Way to London by AppoApples) is Narcissa/Harry (also a bit of Harry/OC, but she's dead and it's complicated anyway).

linkffn(Pet Death by JustBored21) is Harry/Narcissa, but as I recall, Harry isn't much of a character, as he's an emotionless Death for most of the story.

linkffn(Narcissa's Chance by ReluctantSidekick) is Harry/Narcissa/Bellatrix/Andromeda/Apolline, but I think Harry/Narcissa was the main pairing. (And even though it's marked incomplete, all it's missing is an epilogue.)

linkffn(Through The Veil by whitetigerwolf) is Harry/Hermione's mom. It's a short oneshot that doesn't do much with the idea, but it technically matches your requirements.

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One) looks like it will probably end up being Harry/Amelia, if any pairing happens.

linkffn(Skin Deep by ImageViewer) is Harry/Merope. Obviously that's not his parents' time, but it's still an unusual pairing, so I'm including it anyway.
