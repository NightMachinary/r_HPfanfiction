I think one of the writers stopped working on it after chapter 15, which killed the story for me.

It was really weird, because I didn't notice at first, but when I started reading that new chapter where one of the writers had left it felt like the story had lost its life. Like where before I was reading about humans I was now reading card-board cut-outs reciting their lines, even seemingly forgetting who they were supposed to portray at times.

I dropped the story after that, and then when I read stuff online about how the ending to it was generally considered to be disappointing I decided that was probably the best choice.

But the beginning of it was really good and interesting in my opinion, so now I just consider it an abandoned fic, and since one of the writers did in fact abandon I wouldn't say it's that unfair of an assessment, but definitely a jab at the other writer that some people might take issue with.
