I know it's hard to be picky when it comes to such a niche fic, but this is really hard to read, having read the full version on zetaboards. I was really hopeful after the first 2 chapters that it could be an alright fic in a genre I enjoyed, but it didn't hold up.

The writing is dull and repetitive to an extreme - the author uses the verb "stated" SIX HUNDRED AND TWELVE TIMES. Seriously, ctrl+F that shit. Also frowned. Everyone is frowning all the time. The author also feels the need to explain every action that every character is doing, including every tone of voice on every line.

The rest of my review/rant is plot based, in bullet point form, so spoilers.

[[/spoiler][Both Voldemort and Dumbledore are completely useless and act idiotic throughout the entire story, which is a huge peeve for me.]]

[[/spoiler][Harry kills the Death Eaters, and already people are talking about a third side in the war, and a "three way civil war". For now, he is one person, who stood up to the Death Eaters one time, without any support from the public, but of course, a "three way civil war" seems like the most logical assumption.]]

[[/spoiler][For such an apparently important character, Bellatrix has no personality. You could replace her with an OC and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Well, an OC wouldn't break my sense of disbelief so much.]]

[[/spoiler][Storm Chaser. Lol.]]

[[/spoiler][Why is the use of dark magic the determiner as to whether he killed death eaters in self defense or not? Also, absorbing dark magic?]]

[[/spoiler][The whole muggle interlude was lazy and poorly executed, in my opinion.]]

To sum up my opinion, it's a cool idea that's so riddled with bad tropes and awkward writing that it hamstrings itself. If you don't really care about the execution or content the plot isn't bad, and if you want a Harry/Bellatrix fic this one's fine, but I just wanted to get my opinion out in comparison to other people's reactions.

Should mention that this is the unedited version. Though I peeked at the FFnet version and it doesn't seem too different, the fic could drastically increase in quality after a rewrite.
