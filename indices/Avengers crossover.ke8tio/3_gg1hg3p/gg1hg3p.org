Linkoa3(This Gonna Be Good by GStarshine) It's a Fem!Harry, soulmate trickery, and timeline/time travel shenanigans. The first chapter really does not make that much sense, but it gets better! It's actually really good, though it is unfinished.

Linkffn(Dawn of the Valkyrie by QueenMilaAshdown) more timeline/time travel f**kery, fem!Harry, and Dudley's a wizard now.

Both are a little out there, but they're good in my opinion. There's probably more in my saved stories, but these were the first two that came to mind.
