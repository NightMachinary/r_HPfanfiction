It's magic. I assume a variety of Portkey would work. But it'd be boring if it was just a normal Portkey. I think we'd have heard of it in Canon if someone made a Portkey to outer space.

With apparition you have to have been to a certain place to travel there again. However, you can get Portkeys to a place you have not been, these are arranged to take you to /very/ specific locations, suggesting that there is a fixed co-ordinate that they link to and appear at when activated.

If I was to write a story with this being part of it, I would boil it down to how magical artefacts store their co-ordinates. Apparition I would imagine is personal, Portkeys are impersonal. For apparition you need to put yourself off balance and deeply visualise encompassing the space you wish to appear at. Portkeys don't have minds, so it must be possible for someone to translate /their/ personal understanding of a particular location and bewitch an object into a Portkey that travels to that location.

I think the space travel can occur via either stealing the memories of astronauts who have travelled to space and apparating or Portkeying there, or through the creation of a craft that can jump through space like the Knight Bus, only much, /much/ more powerful.
