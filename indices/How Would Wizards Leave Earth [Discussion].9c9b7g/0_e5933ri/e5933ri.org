When it comes to wizard space travel mechanics, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), has done a great job. For example:

- Experiments with portkeys failed as they couldn't get farther than the Moon
- Constructed a relatively small spaceship in real size, but used Expansion Charms to create sufficient living space for THOUSANDS of magical beings
- Interstellar travel was achieved using stars as heat source for Floo jumps
- Portkeys and Apparitions were used for easy travels between the spaceship in orbit and planetary surface
- Rune stones provided permanent shield charms that protected them against cosmic radiations and physical hazards
