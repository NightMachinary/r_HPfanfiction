I know you must be posting from a phone, but it's quite hard to read.

Vernon looked at the boy, and like always tried to ignore him, tried to hate him, it usually worked, but the boy's eyes, they were like Uncle Richard's had been, he would wake up screaming just like Uncle Richard too, Uncle Richard who was always kind to everyone, Uncle Richard who had to force a smile, Uncle Richard who would always show Vernon his medals if he asked, but would leave the room after explaining a bit about them, Uncle Richard the war hero, gone abroad to kick the Nazi's ass and kicked them he did, but Aunt Beth would say he left some of himself back on those beaches in France.

And Vernon wondered where the boy had left some of himself before this summer, he wouldn't eat right, he wouldn't speak right, the regular fire in his eyes was an ember, sometimes it wasn't even there.

He hoped those friends of his would write and solve this their way, he had even been paying attention to hear the damn owls, but there were no owls and every day the boy got worse, Dudley wouldn't even look at the boy, he went to taunt him and then would stop and leave, Petunia would look at him and then pretend he wasn't there.

One day the boy was in the garden and then Vernon would look at him and Uncle Richard was in his place, they were totally different, but the eyes were the same.

Shit.

"Petunia write that...that...old man and tell him something is wrong with the boy, that he is sick, he needs help"

"Wha-Vernon? S-Sick?"

"He's sick li-like my Uncle Richard, he needs-something needs to be done" he wrung his hands and Petunia was surprised to find concern and guilt in his eyes.

Vernon wouldn't say it, years of vitriol were there, but for some reason, his Uncle came to mind whenever he looked at the boy and his Uncle had said that without help...

Petunia went and wrote the letter, the second letter she had ever written Albus Dumbledore, and she told him what her husband didn't want to, she used terms like trauma, PTSD, depression, nightmares, and she warned of what may come from that, Vernon's family wasn't the only one who had members who fought in the wars.

She sent the letter, via mail, addressed to Hogwarts, like her parents used to do for Lily.

It took three days.

Three days later there was a knock on the door, and she opened to find Dumbledore there, in a very normal summer suit, his beard was even neater, and with him a woman, a few years older than her she bet, but still had an aristocratic beauty, magic, she thought wryly.

"Good Evening, Petunia, I hope all is well, this is Dr. Tonks, a psychiatrist, she's here to help Harry"

Petunia merely nodded, and let them enter, she would prefer ten times to send to boy to a normal therapist, but their damn secrecy prevented that, the woman looked professional enough, and she hoped she could help her nephew, otherwise it would be just one more sin for her to be punished by her sister.

"Old Man!" it was Vernon, he walked the hallway in large strides before stopping and looking Dumbledore in the eyes.

"Look, I don't know how your kind deals with this stuff, but something is wrong with the boy, his eyes, the way he-he does things, it's just like- like a family member of mine who fought in the War, I don't know if your kind knows what this is, and I don't care! He went there and fought against those damn Nazis and then he came back, but he wasn't right for a time, just like the boy is now, it's like he's not all there, he walks and eats and it's like a damn robot from the telly!"

The large man took a shuddering breath."My uncle got help and then got better."

"So you go up there and fix him or so help me I will send him to a real doctor for regular people and damn the whole lot of you!"

There was a pause, and Petunia could see that it was as if Dumbledore had aged ten years, his wrinkles were more prominent and despite his still straight posture, it was as if the weight of the world had been settled on his shoulders.

"I understand, Mr. Dursley, we will help Harry, no matter the cost."

The woman with him spoke for the first time "I am a trained psychiatrist Mr. Dursley, from St. Andrews, I assure you we will do our utmost to help Harry." she threw a very scathing glance at Dumbledore and Petunia had the impression they had already /talked/ at length about the situation, serves the old man right, leaving the boy here, alone, after whatever happened to him, these people truly lacked sense.

Vernon nodded and pointed up the stairs, both nodded and went up, he stayed looking at them until he heard the door open, and the boy's voice showed life for the first time, even if it was just a little.

"Professor Dumbledore!"

"Hello, Harry" came the soft voice of the man.

The door closed then, and they heard no more, Vernon grunted and went to the kitchen while Petunia followed, but then, she felt a sense of peace and hope settle on the house, and she thought she heard a soft tune, and felt just a bit lighter and warmer, shaking her head, she went to prepare tea, just her imagination, these people always made her queasy.

Vernon felt that too and looked over the window and thought he saw Uncle Richard there on the yard, the man nodded and smiled, and then Vernon blinked and he wasn't there anymore, the good feeling didn't leave him and he hummed a song his Uncle had taught him.

He wouldn't know he had saved more than his nephew that day, but for him, his nephew was enough.
