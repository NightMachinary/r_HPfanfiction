I was thinking about that, the problem is canon Dursley's are quite hard to work with, they had no redeeming qualities AFAIK, maybe Dudley in DH, but after some 10 years of crap...

In this one, they are a bit OOC because I added some background(and something more) and a level of empathy they never showed in canon(in which they totally ignored him).

In this AU however, Andi would make some sort of family therapy, after helping Harry(with the voluntary help of Fawkes, who I think has one of the coolest magical abilities, a song that gives hope to the weary, hard to get more light magic than that), in here all of them have some serious problems and a lot of resentment, but I am no psychologist(merely someone who likes to read about it) so I don't think I could do it justice to how complex and hard this kind of treatment would be, even with magical help the level of a Phoenix.

I find it much easier for conflict to be ideological or martial, psychological based ones require a certain touch to not come out as dry or just unrealistic to a point it pushes you away.

And btw, thanks for the Silver! Much appreciated.
