To some extent, yes, but it is more like developing missing pieces, than replacing them completely. However, they are by far not the only ones: just from the top of my head ... there is really not much true character of Luna, for example. All those fantastic one-liners like “It would be like having friends” are probably more correct than expected by JKR: she is not real friend with anybody in terms of revealing to anybody who she really is. You never saw true Luna in the canon.
