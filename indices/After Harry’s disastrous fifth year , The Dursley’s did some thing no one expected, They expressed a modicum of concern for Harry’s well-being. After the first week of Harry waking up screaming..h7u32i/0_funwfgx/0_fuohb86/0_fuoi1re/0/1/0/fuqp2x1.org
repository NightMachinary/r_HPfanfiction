Read the last sentence of what I wrote. I am not trying to excuse them, they are horrible human beings, but they are human beings, not caricatures we have in the books. And yes, making them realistic is tough job, but absolutely necessary if you want to write anything about redeeming them (or about their penitence, however you call it).
