  I was thinking about that, the problem is canon Dursley's are quite hard to work with, they had no redeeming qualities AFAIK, maybe Dudley in DH, but after some 10 years of crap...

The problem with canon Dursleys is that they are mostly from the first part of the heptalogy which was more like a childrens' fairy tale, and so they were more like a caricature, like fairy tale bad parents/caretakers everywhere. If you want to keep it in-universe you can say that they picture is very inaccurate, because it is a picture painted by the rebellious abused teenager. If you want to make any story where Dursleys play a significant role you must make them more human. And I don't mean make them better, they may be complete jerks, abusers, anything, but they have to be much more realistic than they are in canon.
