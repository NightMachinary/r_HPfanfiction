Theoretically, the Goblet chooses the best champion for each school. I don't think it would allow switching because being in the Tournament is supposed to be an honor. If it was something where being in the Tournament was meant to be a curse, maybe it would work that way. For instance, if a powerful dark mage back in the medieval days cursed all three schools with a tournament every 13 years, where the contestants would be chosen from a pool of offerings and the events would be created by the Goblet/magic itself, perhaps it would allow changing like that. As things are, I don't think it would make sense for it to be allowed.
