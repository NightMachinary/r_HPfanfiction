If we go with what is said in Canon . . . no. Once Harry's name is out of the Goblet, everything is over and *he* is forced to compete under a Magical Contract. Nothing can change the Champions once they are chosen, so if a sibling wants to help, he has to do something before the Cup chooses the Champions (which, depending of the plot of the fic, is not possible).

But , we are not even sure the story about a Magical Contract is true. The characters who brought and defended this theory are Moody/ Crouch Jr who wanted Harry to compete for Voldemort's plot, and Crouch Sr who was controled by Crouch Jr. For all we know, the magical contract is total bullshit and Harry could have just not showed up to the Tasks.

Since Canon isn't totally clear about the rules (and it's fanfiction anyways), you are free to do anything you want, though I'm not convinced about the Harry's sibling thing since it seems a bit too easy to abuse. If Harry can have is sibling from another School compete in his stead (since sibling would be from Hogwarts while Harry was technically entered under "School 4"), what's stopping a character like Ron to enter his name, and (if selected), to switch with one of his brother like Bill?
