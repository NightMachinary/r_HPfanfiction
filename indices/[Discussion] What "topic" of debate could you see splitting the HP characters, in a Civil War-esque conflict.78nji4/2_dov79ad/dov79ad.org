An issue I could see people argue about a lot is the questions of the Statute of Secrecy. Given different circumstances (muggles progressing, more surveillance leading to more "unexplained phenomenons"), the subject may be on the table again in the future.

I would think there are a few who would argue that the muggles have always been and will always be a dangerous variable and who prefer the Status Quo. I'd think that maybe an adult Harry would come to this conclusion. Maybe Snape and I'd think that Dumbledore also sees it that way (each of them with different words and examples, but essentially the same).

Then there are those who think coexistence would be possible since the muggle world is now enlightened and uses science instead of superstition. I could see Hermione be part of this group. Its an idealistic standpoint she would probably share with a lot of muggleborns who have a good home with their muggle-parents and halfbloods who saw this coexistence in their own family.

The third party could be of the opinion shared with Grindelwald - that wizards and witches are not protected from muggles, but muggles protected from them. I'd think that this opinion could probably be seen as valid by a broad variety of people. Essentially, it is true. Grindelwald made this point not even an hour before the MACUSA DMLE obliviated /New York/ - as in, the populace of New York. Within this group you could probably see two splitters. One wants wizards to be contained to prevent bloodshed, the other wants the containment to end which would inevitably lead to wizarding superiority.

The last group, and probably the most passive at start, is the one that simply says they don't understand them ("They're weird/crazy/idiots/...) and therefore don't want their own society to live with them. I could see Ron in this group. He doesn't have anything actively against them. But he does belittle muggles and doesn't care much for their culture or procedures. I don't think he would like to see a merge of the cultures, simply because it would rip him out of his comfort zone. And we all know, people eventually get aggressive when you rip them too fast, too far out of their comfort zone.
