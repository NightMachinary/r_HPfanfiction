Lack of benevolent actions would breed resentment though, which a demagogue-type might very easily exploit for power; wizards as scapegoats, basically.

Would /you/ be happy learning that for the past few thousand years there was an entire society of people who had A) readily available cures for most fatal illnesses and B) actual methods for /immortality/ (Elixir of Life comes to mind), but they refused to share?

People were /dying in agony/ because these elitist, bigoted rich assholes with mountains of /literal gold/ refused to share the cure for cancer and the secrets of eternal life? Granny rotted from old age - /I'm condemned to die/ - because some stick-waving robed bastard thought he'd just - you know - /destroy the Philosopher's Stone?/ For what, some kind of - moral lesson?

Immortality is something these /freaks/ value so little they just toss out artifacts granting it with the trash?

Oh, I could /very/ easily see someone charismatic stirring that pot of simmering hatred up into a political revolution...
