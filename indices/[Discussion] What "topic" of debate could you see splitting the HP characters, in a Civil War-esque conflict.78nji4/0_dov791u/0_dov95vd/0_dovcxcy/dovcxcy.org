  I'm really excited that the FB movies are about that.

The biggest problem is they are using an "asshole cop-out" to settle the conflict for the viewers.

By that I mean, that instead of actually exploring the issue and what it means they are letting one side be represented by Grindelwald, who we know is a murderous villain who betrays the cause he supposedly stands for. So the audience will be forced to disagree with his stance because Grindelwald is an asshole, not because there is actually anything wrong with the stance from an ethical point of view.

They should have made sequals that actually pitted Hermione against Harry against Ron with no clear morally superior side. Now that is an interesting movie. FB? well, we already know how it'll end...
