Magic was already limited in canon, for example apparation required the user to have seen the destination before, and the distance was so short that even Voldemort needed to fly quite a while from Nurmengard to get into apparation range.

Space could be a very big challenge especially if the laws of magic were different out there, away from most living beings.

  I'd rather think that the final question for them is: "Why should we?" Mars is a red rock. Moon is a gray rock. Venus is a hot rock.

I also think that should be their fundamental problem: an extremely arrogant and regressive attitude. More and more of Muggle world is coming to the realization that we are ultimately fucked if we do not diversify into outer space. Staying put on Earth just means inevitable extinction down the road. We might still fail even if we tried for outer space, but at least we would go down fighting and trying.

They should last longer on Earth than Muggles. But if Muggles were all dead, then they would also die out due to terminal inbreeding.
