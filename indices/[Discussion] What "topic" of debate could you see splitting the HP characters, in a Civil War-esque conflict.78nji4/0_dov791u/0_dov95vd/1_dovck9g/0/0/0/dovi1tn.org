I'll just take a guess here and assume you limit magic here in some way.

I always just figure that wizards could, in theory, just portkey a chimney up to Mars and then floo there? I don't know. But I can see something as simple as that be something fitting the HP universe.

I mean, wizards in their first year of education learn how to trick the main reason why we have problems going to space - gravity. Not just trick it. They learn how to elevate themselves over such benign things as the laws of nature, even though most of them don't realize it. I simply don't think that going to space is much of a challenge for magicals. I'd rather think that the final question for them is: "Why should we?" Mars is a red rock. Moon is a gray rock. Venus is a hot rock.
