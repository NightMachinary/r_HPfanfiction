If she were smart about it, I could see Hermione hedging her bets:

- On one hand, she (or her faction) could initiate actions to take control of key Muggle institutions and organizations behind the scene, especially the media sector. Publishing the HP Series might be a first step to test the water. The result most likely exceeded their most optimistic expectation. Muggles generally liked the idea of magic, although significant percentage of the population still hated it. They also provided handsome profits to those involved, who then used those gains to widen their influence in the Muggle world.
- On the other hand, she could build secret, self-sustaining bases in very remote parts of the world that would not only serve as a refuge for an eventual collapse of the SoS, but also for extinction level events such as nuclear wars, asteroid impacts, or super volcano eruptions.
