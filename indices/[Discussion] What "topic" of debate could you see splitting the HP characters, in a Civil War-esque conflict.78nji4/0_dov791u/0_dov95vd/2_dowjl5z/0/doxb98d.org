Apart from Kingsley and McGonagall, the Order was pretty much the Weasleys. There was also the DA to consider, in which Neville and Ginny had very significant influence.

I don't think there would be lots of mercy for the Death Eaters after the Battle. McGonagall had no problem with Harry crucioing Amycus Carrow, and she was willing to kill Slughorn even before the Battle.

Weasleys were a hot tempered and bloodthirsty bunch to begin with, and would be downright pissed after losing Fred and learning what had happened to Ginny at Hogwarts.

That left Kingsley, whom we knew actually little other than he was a capable fighter and administrator. Many fics had him giving Voldemort's Ministry collaborators a free pass, but I honestly doubted this considering how much he was promoting the DA.

I expect the DA to be the most bloodthirsty and vindictive group after being tortured all year and then losing so many friends. Kingsley inviting this group to take over Magical Britain's security forces led me to believe that Kingsley himself was also taking a hardline approach. However, offering leniency to the Malfoys showed they were still sensible enough to take a divide and conquer strategy against Voldemort remnants.
