I've always wondered what would happen with the Order of the Phoenix post-SWW. I can almost guarantee that there existed tensions between members on how the group should operate aka action vs. inaction, kill vs. capture and so on. Jumping forward to the years following Voldemort's final defeat, these surviving members are all (in)famous for their roles in the war. Celebrities, leaders and otherwise notable members of Wizarding Britain's community, essentially the new leaders to guide W.Britain to a new future.

So whats to say these conflicting ideologies surrounding the SoS are taken up by these now socially and politically powerful war heroes? Harry and his friends would of course get involved (or lead), which alongside or against their former comrades would make an intriguing story I think.
