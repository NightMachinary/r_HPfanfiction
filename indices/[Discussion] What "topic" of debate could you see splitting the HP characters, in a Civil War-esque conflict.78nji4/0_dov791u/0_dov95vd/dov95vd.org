This is pretty much it. The Statue is defining so much of the life of wizards it makes almost a better conflict than blood status, so I'm really excited that the FB movies are about that.

It defines who you can talk to freely, restricts harshly what you are allowed to do (Misuse of Muggle Artifacts), but also allows for peace.

Muggles today would start a war, at least some countries do. Breaking the statue would mean death, it would mean war. And then it would lead to wars amongst muggles, amongst wizards ans between them - but afterwards, the world might have peace.

Heck, Muggles today would definitely hold the wizarding world accountable for "crimes against muggles" like Obliviation and stuff. That alone is grounds for war.

I can easily see how Grindelwald gained followers, and how this question can easily divide friends. Hermione's approach is too idealistic, Ron's "Let's just not change anything" approach is the worst of both worlds and Harry's approach means war. And like that you have the trio separated.
