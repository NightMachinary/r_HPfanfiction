I think the big conflict will be surrounding the Statute of Secrecy. In the 16th century withdrawing from the muggle world was easy. But today, muggles are everywhere, and hiding magic from them is becoming ever more difficult, as muggles have gained the ability not only to record photographs and videos, but also to share them instantly with the rest of the world.

Wizards have three ways to react. The first is maintaining the status quo. That means withdrawing even further, limiting contact with muggles to a minimum. That would obviously be unpopular with muggle-borns and half-bloods, and the problem would continue to exist as there will always be new muggle-borns to be integrated, which becomes more difficult the more secluded wizarding society becomes.

The second option would be to follow Grindelwald's ideology. A preventive strike to establish a wizard dictatorship over the muggles. Obviously that would be against the morals of the majority of wizards. Furthermore, before waging war on the muggles, who would surely resist a wizard attempt to seize power, the magical world would need to unite, whereas in the books it is very divided.

The third option would be a gradual peaceful opening towards the muggle world. It's a utopian idea, but I could see someone like Hermione try it. I think it would be the preferred outcome for most muggle-borns and half-bloods with a muggle parent. However, it would face resistance by most pure-bloods and other conservative wizards, but also by many muggles.
