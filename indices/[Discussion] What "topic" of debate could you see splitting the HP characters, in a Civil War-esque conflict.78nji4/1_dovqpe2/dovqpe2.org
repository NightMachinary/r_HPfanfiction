I think a big one is the argument for killing death eaters vs incapacitating them. Take Dolohov. According to his wiki page:

During the first war he participated in the murders of Fabian and Gideon Prewett. He was caught, convicted and sentenced to life in Azkaban.

During the second war he was part of the mass breakout from Azkaban, took part in the battle @ the Ministry (almost killing Hermione) where he was recaptured /went back to Azkaban. After being broken out a SECOND time, he attacks Harry/Hermione/Ron in Muggle London before finally killing Remus at the final battle.

I get that these were kids books but continually allowing your enemies to regroup like that is not the way to win a war.
