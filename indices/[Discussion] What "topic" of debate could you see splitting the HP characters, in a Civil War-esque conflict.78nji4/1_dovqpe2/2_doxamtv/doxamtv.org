I get where you're coming from, but for this to be a believable plot point for me it would have to be written a certain way.

No one in the HP stories are soldiers - the Aurors are perhaps the closest, but even so the description is a rather vague combination of Policeman/Bounty Hunter/Soldier than specifically people who are trained for war.

From a utilitarian standpoint, there is no way to contest your argument. If one particular side wants to /win/, then they have to permanently disable opposition that cannot be swayed to either surrender or declare neutrality. In the case of raving, murderous Death Eaters, they would most assuredly just kill them and be done with it.

The /issue/ is the way that authors handle the above plot point. /Because/ none of the characters in HP canon (/particularly the trio themselves/) are soldiers through-and-through, they might not decide to kill opponents as readily as someone thoroughly utilitarian - or a soldier - might. And if they /did/ decide to kill their enemies, there's no guarantee that they'd just do it and be fine.

I feel like it could be a great way to explore a divide between the main characters of HP canon, but it would need - for it to appeal to me - to be approached sensibly, maturely, and with the right kind of considerations being given for things like psychological consequences and PTSD, as well as people potentially getting sucked in by dark magic or something similar.

And choosing to /not/ kill raving, murderous Death Eaters should never - in the words of Merciful!Dumbledore - be about redemption, or ending wizarding bloodlines, or whatever the fuck. It should be about a character's belief in due process (or an opposition to the death penalty, which was made illegal in the UK in the late 1960s/early 1970s), or their own /personal unwillingness or inability to take a life./

In all it has potential to be really interesting, but only if it's not approached by an author that's already decided which route is objectively best and spends the whole story going "being merciful/not-as-murderous-or-evil as the enemy is dumb".
