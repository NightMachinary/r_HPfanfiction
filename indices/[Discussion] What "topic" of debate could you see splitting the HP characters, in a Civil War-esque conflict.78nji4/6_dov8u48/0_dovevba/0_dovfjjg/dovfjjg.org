Malfoys might very well be a special case, since they had defected before Voldemort fell.

Politically speaking, it made sense to go easy on those people, or else you would force those less resolute enemies into the situation of cornered animals. As I pointed out above, granting leniency to the Malfoys could divide Voldemort remnants into turning on each other. Divide and conquer was after all a time proven strategy.

Of course not everyone would be happy with this decision. The more radical factions, including people like you, would not be satisfied until enough blood had been spilled. Your response to my comment should be very representative of what many people thought after the War, and grounds for more conflicts to come.
