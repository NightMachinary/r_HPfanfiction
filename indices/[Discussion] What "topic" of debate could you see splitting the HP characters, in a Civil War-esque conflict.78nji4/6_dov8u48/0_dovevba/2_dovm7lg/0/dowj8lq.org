McGonagall would at least suspect it due to Harry's actions in book six. He took the Dark Mark and boasted about it. We know that at least some Death Eaters gave names in order to get better sentences so I'm quite sure that someone would name Malfoy. And since the aftermath is supposed to be different from the last time, where everyone bought their way out of prison, liberal use of Veritasserum should be expected.
