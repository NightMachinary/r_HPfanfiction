From /their/ point of view. But, I mean, would Muggle authorities recognize it as a war? Hell, until the "Battle of Hogwarts", there weren't even any regular armed conflicts between the two "armies", just a bunch of skirmishes. The numbers at the Department of Mystery are still ridiculously low if you account for Wizarding Britain's small population. Nor were the Death Eaters a nation, anyway, by any definition. If it was any sort of war, it was medieval warfare at its finest.
