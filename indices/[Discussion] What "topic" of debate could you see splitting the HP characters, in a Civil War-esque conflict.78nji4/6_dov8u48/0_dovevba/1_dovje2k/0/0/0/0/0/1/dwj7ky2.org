The point isn't that it doesn't make them guilty, though I'd argue that for something "minor" like uniform it might grant them leniency; the point is that the Ministry of Magic wouldn't have any inkling those rules exist (for that matter, they would probably dismiss them if they knew because they're Muggle stuff), and thus they wouldn't take it into account in their trying of Death Eaters, regardless of how harsh/thorough they're being.
