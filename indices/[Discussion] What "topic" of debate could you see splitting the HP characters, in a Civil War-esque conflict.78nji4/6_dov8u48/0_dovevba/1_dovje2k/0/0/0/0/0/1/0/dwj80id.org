Time for some gravedigging, right?

As for the postwar situation, Hermione is guaranteed to know about it and Harry should have heard of it at some point during his muggle school-time. They were by far the two people who contributed the most to winning the war and that would put them in a position similar to the Emperor in the Colosseum. They could, through various means, force the Ministry's hand into any direction they want. I mean, Harry just 1v1ed the most feared man in the country and has the Elder Wand. There would be few who would oppose him and Hermione is no slouch either.

Edit: Also, not wearing insignias is no minor thing. Even Q-boats hoisted the proper flag before attacking. Fighting without insignia usually is punished with summary execution if you were caught, which goes double for insurgents.
