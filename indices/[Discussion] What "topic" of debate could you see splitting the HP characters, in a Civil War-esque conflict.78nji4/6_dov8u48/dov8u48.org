Because of the Dark Mark and Voldemort's terrifying presence, Death Eaters were unlikely to engage in open civil wars. However, individual betrayals, defections, and noncooperations happened even in canon. Also, I expect Death Eater individuals or factions to go at each other covertly, a killing curse that missed its ‘intended' target was perfectly valid. We never knew whether Rowle's hit on Gibbon was truly accidental.

The ‘good guys' had plenty reasons of an internal split too. The myriads of Indy!Harry fics offer good evidence to how such splits could happen. An overarching theme here is that certain elements were fed up with using non-lethal tactics against Voldemort and opted for much more ruthless measures.
