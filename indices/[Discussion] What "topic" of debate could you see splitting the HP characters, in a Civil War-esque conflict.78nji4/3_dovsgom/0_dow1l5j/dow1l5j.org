To be fair, I don't think Voldemort really hated being at that orphanage (ignoring the expected orphan angst). He was pretty much having a blast blackmailing/bullying the other kids and nicking their stuff.

On the other hand, we hardly have any example of a good muggle upbringing, with the exception of Hermione and Lily.

Points for an excellent original idea though. All the others are somehow related to the SoS.
