Should muggles be allowed to raise magical children? Harry and Voldemort would probably say no as they had shitty upbringings, and some normal wizards/witches/DEs would be against it too. Hermione, the Weasleys, the happily raised muggleborns and the purebloods who desperate want to keep mudbloods out of the world would probably argue the other way.
