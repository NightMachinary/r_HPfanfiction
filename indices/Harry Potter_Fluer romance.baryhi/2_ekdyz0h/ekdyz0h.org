/Letters/ by [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] was already mentioned. Definitely his magnum opus... :D

But you could also try:

- /Taking Umbridge/ by E.C. Scrubb, but it's still in progress. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8604692/1/Taking-Umbridge]])

- /The Lie I've Lived/ by jbern, which never got it's promised sequel. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]])

There's not much of actual quality out there for this pairing.
