Well, there are not so many of those, sadly. Linkffn(Across the time by izwan) is set in the 4th year, it's time travel though. Linkffn(The stag and the flower by reluctantsidekick) post war, but it's pure romance and is written well I do NOT really like these ones, but there are a lot of people who do, so Linkffn(Deprived by the crimson lord) Linkffn(Gods amongst men by slimah) Linkffn(His angel by durararaaa) I've never finished any of the three There is also Linkffn(Lessons from a grateful veela) (lots of smut)
