Okay in all seriousness, yes Letters is your worst story. For those who haven't realised, I only big it up on here because I know it winds [[/u/Te7]] up. He'll get revenge by including a scene where Harry has waffles for breakfast. Or prefers Irish whiskey to Scottish whisky. Or supports Manchester United.

I still say that you're too harsh about Letters. I can't disagree with anything you say about the story but it misses the point that even TE7's worst story is better than most of the other crap out there. I particularly like the way Krum mentors Harry because he wants the challenge, for example. And Daphne's pure Slytherin conversation with Fleur, outlining her plan for ending up with Harry, is brilliant. And yes, that's what spurs Fleur into the really questionable decision to finally have sex with Harry, but hey.

For the record, it was when you did the Christmas bonus that we first really started corresponding. I'd replied to the Reddit thread where you asked which one you should do and then ended up beta'ing when you decided to do them all, and then came on to LdS too.

I thought you preferred LdS to VP. For me, and I know I've rattled on about this by email at great length, VP is my favourite. And if you go nuts when people like Letters, I get frustrated when people don't get VP. LdS is in many ways a better story with far more layers and subtlety, but VP is such a sweet story that it always brings me back. So you've definitely advanced as a writer. You were just starting from a higher base than most.
