Just the plot, characters, actions, motivations, and style.

Now, don't get me wrong, Letters served a purpose to me both emotionally, which, frankly you'd have a better chance of prying the personal details out of VP than you ever will Letters, and as a writer. I'm probably never going to be drunk enough to discuss what I was going through when I wrote Letters. And I'm well past a point in my life where I need to. But it helped me through a time that I'm not sure I would have ever gotten through without it. This reminder is both the reason I detest it, and the reason why I keep it around.

Letters was the first novel-length piece of writing I actually finished. That always sounds dumb when I type it or say it. But it showed me that I could actually write a story, from beginning to end, and that was a big deal to me at the time. Unfortunately pretty much everything in the middle happened.

The first six chapters are, well, they're bad. There's no real getting around that. They're just bad. I literally copied parts of Goblet of Fire FFS. I tried to tease a Formula 1 theme through the entire story that goes absolutely nowhere and serves no real purpose except to make the Magical world Muggle. It's bad.

And then I was so shocked, so amazed, so awed that people were actually reading it and reviewing it that I.....excuse me while I go vomit...listened to their opinions.

I legitimately altered my original plan of the story based on reviews. I gave characters more screen time, as it were, based on reviews. I altered plot points based on reviews. Now, some of the changes were good, I'll freely admit that. Some of them...weren't. Every chapter became nonsensicaly formulaic. They're literally all the same. It's either 'Quidditch or Tournament scene, Fleur scene, Daphne scene' just jumble the order. It's like reading a bad sitcom. I don't remember if I commented on it or not when writing the Christmas Bonus chapter a few years ago, I don't think I quite had the same relationship with [[/u/rpeh]] at the time to point it out. But I wrote the Letters chapter in like two hours. Because it's so formulaic.

There's no real plot to it. There's no real villain. Harry...sort of...develops but none of it is earned. The scene with his parents at the end is comically bad.

I can open any chapter of any one of my works (excluding the first three chapters of Princess which are equally as horrible as the first six chapters of Letters) and be rather amused by it. I can't do that with any of Letters.

All-in-all - I caved. I wanted to write a story and I didn't really. I wrote a loose collection of scenes about Harry Potter and two girls that were interested in him because....reasons. The less said about the fact that an adult witch is attracted to a fourteen year old boy the better. Or the fact that she sleeps with him after another girl makes her jealous. That's not problematic at all, right!

I've always said that writing needs to be real. People interoperate that phrase wrong. It doesn't matter if the world is magical. People are still people. There has to be something that makes it Human, or what's the point? And nothing in Letters is Human. It's saccharine, it's fake. It's just...wrong. The only thing I really stuck to my guns on was Harry losing to Krum. And I just got a review a few days ago complaining about that. Yes, I read reviews on nine year old stories. It exists because I pretty much said 'let's make Harry and Fleur get together!' and now...well...most people on here have probably had some encounter with my ravings about 'shipping'.

In my head, Every single thing about Letters is an abject failure. I did every single thing I said I wouldn't do. Every. God. Damned. One. Everything about it is just a failure. It drives me nuts when people call it my 'best' work. Because it's just...not. It's not even in the same stratosphere as Vitam Paramus or Limpieza De Sangre. As an actual 'story' it's worse in every conceivable way. It has worse plot, it has worse ideas, it has worse characters, it's not as well written. The only thing it does better is fluffy-plotless romance. Which is quite possibly the thing I hate the most. If Letters is my magnum opus, then, honestly, I should just throw Ithica and CtS into the fire and call it a fanfiction career. Because if that's the best I can be...I've wasted ten years of my life.

I consider Vitam Paramus to be my best work. Although depending on the day I could be convinced it's LdS. VP certainly means more to me than LdS, which may very well be why I give it the nod. I get a lot of the complains about it, it is perhaps too slow. But it's supposed to be. It's filled with broken people who don't really know how to communicate their thoughts and feelings so sometimes the conversations are like pulling teeth because sometimes that happens. They don't know how to deal with each other.

But there's more to it than that. VP is the polar opposite of Letters in a variety of ways. Both are more personal than I'll ever talk about. And one represents me caving while one doesn't. I could go on for a while about that. But I'm still sober so I'm not going to.

As a whole, Letters represents me failing myself. And I'm never going to be able to see it as anything but that.
