I forgot to mention in the first chapter author's note: the idea of Harry with Dumbledore's memories was originally done by Taliath with the fic "In Light of Silver Memories" which I mentioned in the title here.

When I upload chapter 3 (this weekend, if I continue writing at the current rate) I'll edit the chapter 1 author's note to say this.
