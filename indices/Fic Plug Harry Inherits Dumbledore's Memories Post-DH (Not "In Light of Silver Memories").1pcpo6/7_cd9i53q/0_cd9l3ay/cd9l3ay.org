They're something of my own creation which have appeared in my other fics.

Most charms are literal charms: you cast them directly on the thing you want to affect. So if you want to protect a certain area, you go around that area casting spells at the border to create a "property line".

An ideal charm is cast symbolically rather than literally. You want to guard against entrance, you place a charm on an object with symbolises entrance, like the front door. It now protects the whole house against entrance. You want to protect against fire? You cast the fire-dampening charm on the oven, and now the whole house is protected against fire.

A like-for-like comparison of charms will show that ideal charms are typically stronger. However, they do possess certain weaknesses too, as shown in the fic.
