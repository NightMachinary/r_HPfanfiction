Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Is there something else are you looking for here? It's not as if this will make too many AU changes, unless you have Harry die in the graveyard.

Although... Harry is already immune to death by then. So he loses his Horcrux early? Huh, may be it will cause AU changes after all. Still, seems like an extremely roundabout way of doing it when you can just have Voldemort hit harry with a killing curse anyways.
