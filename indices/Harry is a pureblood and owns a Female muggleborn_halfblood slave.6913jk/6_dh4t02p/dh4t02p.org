I have on multiple occasions requested fics dealing with the concept of slavery in the wizarding world. Usually focusing on Muggle/muggleborn slavery, where for example Voldemort has taken over and its commonplace, or Harry buys female muggleborns (like Hermione) to save them, or even "Sex slave" associated ones.

Sadly I almost never get any responses because it seems as if people are just afraid to write about the subject. Slavery is after all, a touchy subject in the real world and likely hard to write. But its too bad in a fictional HP Wizarding world, it cant be explored further, especially as slavery IS a part of cannon.
