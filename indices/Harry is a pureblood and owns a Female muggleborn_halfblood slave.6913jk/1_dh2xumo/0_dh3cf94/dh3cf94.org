Well, it's not slavery - the Patron system was installed after outright enslaving muggleborns was outlawed in the 16th century. And custom and peer pressure pose some limits on it. (And ironically, while most purebloods get emancipated once they are adults, the purebloods of the rich families usually don't get emancipated and live under the thumb of their head of family since that means they have access to the family fortune and get a shot at becoming head one day.)

But most important is that a main part of the story is the fight by both Harry and Hermione to change the entire system. It's not a "Hermione learns to be happy to be a third-class citizen" story.
