So glad you liked it!! As I said, it's one of my absolute favorites also. I love many of this author's other stories too (Men Who Had Mothers is a sentimental favorite - it's very odd though! - Haute Allure is a cute riff on the fashion industry and veelas, and I also love Golden Age, which is the best Hufflepuff story ever), but none as much as this one.
