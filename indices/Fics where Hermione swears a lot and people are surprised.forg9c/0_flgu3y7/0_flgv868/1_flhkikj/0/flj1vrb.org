I remember a post from like twitter or something yonks ago claiming Rowling meant for Ron to swear a lot more severely & just a lot more than usual but her editor told her to cut it out real quick. It's probably fake but if memory serves Ron is the one who curses the most (stuff like bloody hell, Merlin's various body parts or under clothes, etc. not slurs. Most slurs is probably like,,, Bellatrix)
