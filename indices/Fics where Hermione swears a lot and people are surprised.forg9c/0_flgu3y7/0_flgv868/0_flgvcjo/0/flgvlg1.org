True - and that does bring up an interesting note. Why are all the insults Pureblood to Not-Pureblood? There's no insults Muggleborns or Halfbloods get to use against Pureblood types. 'Death Eater' is more of a description than an insult, since pretty much all of the people who get called that actually are one, and 'scum' is a Muggle word too.

Where's the exclusive Wizard anti-pureblood slurs? :D

EDIT - We need to get that person who's doing word-count patterns of Goblin Gold and such throughout the series to do one on Slurs, too. :D
