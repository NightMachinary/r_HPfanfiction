I mean sure, it's a crap insult, but it still exists. There's also times when old powers and new powers have come into conflict and the new has created slurs for the old as they become beneath them. Plus, if you're one of those people that conflates national/class slurs with ethnic slurs (which would be possible, given how Blood Purity does cross those boundaries with 'Blood Traitors' including lifestyle and traditions/culture as well as consorting with Muggleborns), then there's a significantly larger breadth of resources to draw on there.

(EDIT - changed the word opportunity to resources because I realised that was just a weird fucking phrase to use in this context, egad).
