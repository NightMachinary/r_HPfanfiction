I recently dusted off my notes for linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) because I was thinking about something very similar to this. For the uninitiated, Harry gets turned into a five-headed dragon. When testing out whether or not he can still use magic, he found that even when he was using a wand, he could breathe out spells as if they were dragonfiire from any head's mouth, regardless of which head cast the spell.

My plan for it is that they can use each other as wands, even when separated by magic, as they're all a singular being. One casts a spell, dealing with the complex mental requirements and the magical strain, while another simply exhales the completed spell onto their target. I had an idea for a scene where one of the heads is speaking with someone they don't like - Malfoy, for example - and the other fires a confundus through his mouth in order to do something like Kaa's hypnosis from /The Jungle Book/.
