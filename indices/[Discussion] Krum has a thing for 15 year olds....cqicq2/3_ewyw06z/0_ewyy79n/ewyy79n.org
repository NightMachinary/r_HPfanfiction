He was dating a 15 year old Hermione in Goblet of Fire. He's an old 7th year (he turned 18 in the summer, so technically he would have graduated if not for some reason), and she turns 15 September of that year. It was confirmed they made out and that he tried to invite her over the summer to Bulgaria. Even worse, the movies made jokes about it... (I follow book canon, but that's just icing on the cake)

The wedding scene was a bit more innocent, but I just wanted to make a point about the character. I think you got that mixed up.
