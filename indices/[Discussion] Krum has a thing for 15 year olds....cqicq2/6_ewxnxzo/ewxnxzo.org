Hermione was a few months off the legal age of consent is clearly both mature, intelligent and assertive enough to handle herself, and there's no suggestion of any kind of physical intimacy anyway. Plus, Krum's inital attraction to her is explicitly based in her personality, which is unlikely to change too fundamentally as she ages, rather than her pubescent looks.

It's maybe a little odd, but certainly within the bounds of normal or acceptable behaviour for the time and place.
