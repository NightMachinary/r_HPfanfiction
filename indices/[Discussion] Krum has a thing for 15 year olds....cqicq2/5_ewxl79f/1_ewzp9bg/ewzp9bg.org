I hate the term 'mature beyond her years', people call me that and it doesn't mean that you're more prepared or better at anything than others your age, it just means that you appear more in control. In truth, you're just as vulnerable as others your age only better at hiding it. I realize I've just babbled on, but I had to say that. I can see why people would think it was acceptable or unacceptable, but I think it the problem isn't the physical age difference but the mental age difference. Krum would, being 18, have experience. Hermione on the other hand is, though highly intelligent, naive to the world of dating and the emotional strain of it.
