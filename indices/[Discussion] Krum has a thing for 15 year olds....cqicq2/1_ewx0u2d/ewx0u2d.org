I like the theory that Viktor choose Hermione because she was a known mudblood:

fanon: there aren't muggleborns at Durmstrang, he sits at Slytherin table, with a very chatty Draco Malfoy, mudblood Granger this, mudblood Granger that, and Viktor thought, ‚ÄùI wish to know a mudblood, she will be fascinant" (as Arthur Weasley think about dancing with a muggle).
