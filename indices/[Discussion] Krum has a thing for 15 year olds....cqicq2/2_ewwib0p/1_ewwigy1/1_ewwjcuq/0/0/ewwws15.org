Close, '18 or something' according to Ron at the world cup.

“Really grumpy?” Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. “Who cares what he looks like? He's unbelievable. He's really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see.”

If Drumstang follows the same rules as Hogwarts, unless he failed a year and was set back, Krum couldn't have been 18 at the world cup. A whole lot of supposition with no proof one way or the other, but that's what a fandom is all about.
