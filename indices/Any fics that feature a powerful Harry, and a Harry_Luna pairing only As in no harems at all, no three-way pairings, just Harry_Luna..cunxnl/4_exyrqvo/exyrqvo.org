It's debatable how powerful Harry himself becomes in the story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]] (he does manage to become an Animagus), but unlike Canon!Harry, he gets quite a few competent adults on his side and personally takes down Voldie without even needing his wand.

All this without being publicly recognized as The-Boy-Who-Lived...
