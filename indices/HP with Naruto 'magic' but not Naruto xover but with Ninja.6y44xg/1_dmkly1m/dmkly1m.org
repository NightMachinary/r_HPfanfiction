The only story I can think of off the top of my head which has Naruto-inspired elements without any actual crossover is linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope by OnTheImportanceOfLungs).

There's also linkffn(Kaleidoscope of Magic by karldin) but I only found that while searching for the first one and have no idea if it's any good.
