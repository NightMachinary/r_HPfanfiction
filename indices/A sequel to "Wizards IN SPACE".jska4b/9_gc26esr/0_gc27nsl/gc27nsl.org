Thanks for reading. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

Don't worry about the scene breaks, I'm working on fixing them. They work fine on ao3, but ffnet seems to be a bit more capricious.

I'm writing them as they come and I plan to release them one chapter at a time. I haven't settled on a posting schedule yet as my work situation is pretty much in limbo right now and could change at a moment's notice. I'll be going for a chapter every one or two week until that changes.
