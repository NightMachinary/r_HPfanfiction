Great story, love that it's getting continued. My only suggestion is to put some sort of break in between scenes, took me awhile to realize you jumped over everything after the talk with Dumbledore until he got back on the ship.

Also... something I thought would be cool if the original fic continued - have Harry bring Sirius onto the ship. He clearly hates Grimmauld Place, so this would be a good way to get him out of there. And, from an outside the story perspective, with Sirius living after 5th year you would need to think of a way to integrate him into the rest of the HP plot. By bringing him onto the ship, you're basically bypassing that problem entirely.

Are you writing/posting this as it goes, one chapter at a time? Or do you have some already written and have a plan for a posting schedule?
