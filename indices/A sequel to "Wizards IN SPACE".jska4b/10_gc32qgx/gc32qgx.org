One of the things that really sets the tone of esama's DSS stories is that the spaceship is /so much more important/ than Umbridge, Voldemort, etc. They're /there/, but Umbridge gets dealt with almost as an aside, the Department of Mysteries fight never happens, and the Ministry getting taken over by purebloods is just background for Clarissa Edgecombe to get hired at Enterprise.
