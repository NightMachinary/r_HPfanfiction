I agree, but while that works great for a short fic that only deal with the initial discovery of the ship, it's untenable on the long-term. The kids would not abandon their families in the middle of a war to go out on a joyride throughout the galaxy. Even a part of what they do is directed toward helping out where they can like the creation of the protecting clothing.

It was also esama's wish to ignore all of this to focus on the world building. And while I respect this choice, I want to do something else. It might not be in the same vein as the original fic and it might not please everyone, but this is what I'm going with and I'll hold on to it.

That's not to say that the ship will be in the background of the war. I have no interest of just writing a war rehash fic. But some loose ends must be dealt with before exploring the full potential of the idea.
