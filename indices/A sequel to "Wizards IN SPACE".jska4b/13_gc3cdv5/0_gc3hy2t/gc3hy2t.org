Hey there. Thanks for reading. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

For your question, no, Voldemort is not in the open. The battle at the Ministry never happened and Voldie never revealed himself to the world. That also means that Fudge is still in power and the vast majority of the British wizarding world believe everything he says about Harry and Dumbledore.
