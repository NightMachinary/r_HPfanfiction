Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay fulfills exactly /half/ of your request. No harems because, well, he's a freaking /dragon/ going to a school that decidedly doesn't have any eligible dragonettes.

It's the only "Harry = dragon" fanfic I've ever found that's any good, and it's an unabashed "for the lulz" fic.

I'm not sure if any fanfics even /exist/ where a dragon-Harry has a harem. There's /plenty/ of fics where Human Harry has a harem (although Poe's Law is, if anything, an understatement for those - 99.99999% of those fics are crap), and a few fics where Harry's a dragon (again, most of which are bad), but I don't know of any that combine the two...\\
And if one exists, I'm not sure if I'd inflict it on a sane person to read.
