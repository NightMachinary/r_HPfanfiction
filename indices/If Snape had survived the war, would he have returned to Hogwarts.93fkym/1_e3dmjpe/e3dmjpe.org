I doubt he'd have returned to teach... Teaching was something he was forced to do rather than something he truly enjoyed. I think he probably would have started an apothecary or done experimental brewing. And I have a hard time picturing him staying in England for very long. He probably would have gone to Diagon Alley or Hogsmead once, been accosted by obnoxious "fans" and run far far away. Snape always struck me as intensely private, and I think he'd have found being a "hero" and being in the limelight fairly painful. I figure he'd head to another English speaking country and settle there to be the local brewer and curmudgeon.
