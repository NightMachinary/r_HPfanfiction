no. he dislikes teaching. also, spy or not, snape still did kill dumbledore on school grounds. it'd just be kind of awkward for him to still be there after. dumbledore was also one of his only allies and reason for being at hogwarts. i really don't see him opening a store or working some 9-5. how do you transition from being an infamous deep cover terrorist agent to normal life? nobody else's reputation is as complicated as his. besides sirius i guess. he'd probably travel the world or something, and live off of his magic.
