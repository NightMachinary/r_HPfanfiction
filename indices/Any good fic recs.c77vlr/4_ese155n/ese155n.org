I probably rec this too often, but I love linkao3(Fate is a Four Letter Word). It is post-epilogue and has a good amount of the next-gen characters, although it isn't Albus/Scorpius and focuses on Harry. A lot of people write it off because of the ship Harry/Kingsley/Snape but honestly, you can skip the romance part and it's still a good read.
