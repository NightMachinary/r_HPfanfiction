This gives me the idea that Hermione would get this idea from her time with a turner. After so many times using it she notices a few milliseconds where time around her slows down before turning backward.

She spells the turning hand so that instead of turning back just enough resistance is applied to slow it's forward advance to 50% and notices that she's now moving twice as fast as the world around her.
