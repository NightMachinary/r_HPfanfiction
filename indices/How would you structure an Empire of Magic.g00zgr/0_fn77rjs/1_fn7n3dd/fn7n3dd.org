I like and agree with most of this. The only real thing is the thought that the witch hunts would never have happened. Well, of course they could have. And based on what we see, to the broader wizarding community it was seen as both horrible and an indication that Muggles couldn't be trusted and also somewhat laughed at since, almost verbatim quoting, "Muggles are very bad at recognizing magic" and so almost never caught a wizard. Even the notorious cases turned out to be people getting caught on purpose and using things like the Flame Freezing Charm to make it harmless. But before they became an insular community, they more or less just worked with and lived under the presiding government, like other citizens (except where specifically magical matters were concerned).

Really though, it's that it's wizarding law to avoid using magic on Muggles as much as possible outside of threats to life or the SoS. Of course, sans ethics wizards could trivially take over the Muggle world. Imperius, any kind of Masking or non-detection spell (on a person or location), and Transfiguration is just unstoppable by non-magical means.

So I don't think Rowling's world is really that hard to make sense of in that regard, though the Inquisition should have, perhaps, been mentioned too (I can't recall if the books/side material ever mention that as a major factor for the SoS). Most people, even in stories with superpowers, aren't interested in taking over, even if they technically have the ability to do so. But please let me know your fanfic username and website. I'd love to keep an eye out for this story of yours!
