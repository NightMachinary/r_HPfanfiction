My world started as a fanfiction world. After about 30 pages of notes I scrapped about a quarter of them and rewrote them to an original world.

My world has everything going absolutely completely fucked when the Spanish conquest of Central America starts.

Local magicals use mass sacrifice to fuel huge spells creating wizard killers as a last desperate fuck you to the conquering intruders.

The whole place turns into this death trap that is slowly trying to expand. So magicals have to come forward and help stop the breach. This leads to a whole new world.
