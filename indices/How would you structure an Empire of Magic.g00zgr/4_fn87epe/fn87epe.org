Population is still 99% muggles ruled by the rich wizards, with poor wizards somewhere in between. Muggles use magical gadgets and technology. Like guns that shoot simple pre-loaded spells. Or cars with hover charms. With technology enabling mass production of magical items, the population grows and it needs to expand, which is made easy by magic negating gravity and conservation of momentum. Basically it becomes Star Wars.
