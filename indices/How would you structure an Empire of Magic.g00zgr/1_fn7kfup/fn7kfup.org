Do you mean the Empire to be structured in a way that would make a good narrative or a way that would be lasting and workable?

If the latter, somewhat like the Elf Empire in Laundry Files, most likely. A strict hierarchy of enchantments and strict, detailed vows well written to ensure loyalty/efficiency/actions taken for the good of the Empire.

Local authority that answers to regional authority that answers to sector authority that answers to grand authority that answers to the Emperor, each needing to swear vows before taking their positions. Probably some secret police observers around indoctrinated to be loyal to the Emperor.

If the former, probably without the vows (or with far simpler, looser vows) and a lot more political jockeying and such.
