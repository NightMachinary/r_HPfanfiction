Well, similary to how you would structure a regular empire: A strong military force, a nationalistic propaganda culture, an impressive use of Logistics and civil construction/service system to mantain your empire. Imagine a Sacred High Emperor sustained over a court of Noble warlocks and courtier wizards, below them a highly militaristic culture (every wizard/witch must undergo military training) comprised of support/specialist magical units, below them a huge army of magical creatures. Imagine a warfare doctrine based on this. This Magical army is not only for war, it uses it's might to build portkey/Floo Networks and many magical impresive structures. Add that to an eficient secret order controlling everything in the shadows and I believe you could pull it off.
