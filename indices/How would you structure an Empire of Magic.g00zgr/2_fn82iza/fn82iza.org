What does 'Empire of Magic' mean?

Is it a magical empire that controls everything? A magical government that styles itself an empire? Something else?

That obviously makes a big difference! For instance, a magical government styling itself an empire could be a magical Roman/Byzantine Empire - in which case, instead of a Minister of Magic, the head of the government could be an Emperor, and working along a magical variation of Roman/Byzantine institutions (I've got a penciled in version of this for a potential fic idea I've been kicking around). But that's just a title, really - it could be a powerful magical nation, but at its heart it'd be an updated version of how we think the Roman state was organized in, say, the 10th century (kinda like the Ministry for Magic is similar to 20th century Britain in its organization, at least in my mind).
