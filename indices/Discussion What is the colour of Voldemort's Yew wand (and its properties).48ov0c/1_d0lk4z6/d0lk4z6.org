You're correct. Voldemort's wand was distinctly chosen by J.K. Rowling for the films, according to prop director Pierre Bohanna, and "it was meant to look like a bone".

As wand wood comes from magical trees, my guess would be that most wands (if not all of them) are carved from the living sapwood. Otherwise, "dead" wood may not carry the magic that is sought after when making a magic wand in the Potter universe.

I also wouldn't say Voldemort's wand is "unyielding". I would assign him the "hard" flexibility, simply because can (and has) changed his mind on certain things. For example, the 16-year-old Riddle from the Diary changed his mind about "killing Mudbloods".

As for the brown-colored wand, Voldemort used Lucius's wand, which is made of elm. I have a custom elm wand, and it's brown-colored. I wouldn't really think much of Voldemort using a brown-colored wand, but I would prefer his yew wand to be made from the living sapwood, as it makes more sense.
