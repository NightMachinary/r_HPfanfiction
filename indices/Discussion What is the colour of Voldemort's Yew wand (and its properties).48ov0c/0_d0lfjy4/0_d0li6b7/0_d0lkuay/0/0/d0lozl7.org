I referenced that in my latest story:

Excerpt: (lead instead of graphite is on purpose, he was born when pencils WERE lead cored.)

Harry thanked Mrs. Barq for his lunch and walked her back to the door then settled at the small table as his grandfather appeared. "I forgot to explain the measurements thing yesterday." Harry nodded.

"Magic is very difficult to quantify. We can really only do so by the ease at which one magical person can do something compared to another. Albus is very good at magic, therefore people assume he's stronger than others.

"But I've seen magicals who struggle to do even the simplest charms cast a difficult charm like the patronus. A spell to create a corporeal feeling of pure happiness to drive away minor demons. So trying to measure magic is perhaps impossible."

"Then why did Mr. Ollivander try?"

"He's not really trying to quantify magic, he's attempting to create a chart of characteristics of magicals to make matching students faster. You took quite a long time AND damaged the shop some. Now imagine having to do so with fifty to a hundred new students each summer?"

Harry nodded. "What about making wands? Can people make their own?"

"Anything can be a focus BUT there are a dozen really good magical woods and pairing them with magical cores helps focus your magic. In fact, muggle pencils? A fine makeshift focus if you replace the core of lead with occamy silver bonded charcoal. I used one like that in the forties for a couple years because I was too busy to go to Diagon Alley to get a properly attuned wand. My first wife was rather annoyed. She found it unbecoming of our station in life." He chuckled at the remembrance and was lost in thought for a few moments. "You would have liked her. She so wanted children but died from dragon-pox. She was always somewhat sickly."
