I was just discussing this with my brother the other day and it dawned on me that the reason I enjoy it so much is that each story (in theory) has it's own plot, but you don't have to invest any time learning the worldbuilding. If you think about any other really long series, such as say LotR, GoT, and Dune, with fanfiction you get those same plots but in half or fewer words because you're not spending any time on back story. It's all here and now. You don't have to redesign Hogwarts, it just is.

moshpitstories puts it very well in the summary of Natural Order:

  If you've got a chance to do it over again, why putz around? You know the game, you know the players, and you know the goal. It's time for Double Jeopardy, where the scores can really change.

Or at least the objective is something like that. There is obviously huge piles of shit and a huge section of the fandom dedicated to porn (and a lot of overlap there) but finding and following the gems makes up for it.
