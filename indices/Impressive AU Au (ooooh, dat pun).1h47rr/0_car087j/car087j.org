[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger]] Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow. Very popular, and very AU; basically, Remus meets a young woman in a park and she's dreamed about what really happened on Halloween. Things are vastly different once Remus knows the truth about Sirius. It's a five book series, though the fifth is a WIP.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave. Very AU and quite well known; it runs on the premise that Harry has a twin brother who is the boy who lived, and it's pretty much about how Harry's life has changed accordingly. There is slash in later books, but if you want something AU, this unrecognisable from canon by the seventh and final book (which is completed).

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=321302]] Innocent by MarauderLover7. Also very AU, but not as well known as the other two; Sirius breaks out of Azkaban when Harry's eight and takes him from the Dursleys, and things start to change from there. It's a WIP.

All of these are very AU, but Saving Connor definitely deviates the most - the other two twist canon more than change it entirely. :)
