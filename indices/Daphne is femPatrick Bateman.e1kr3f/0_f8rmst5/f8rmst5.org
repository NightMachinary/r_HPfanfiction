"New wand holster. What do you think?"

Amidst impressed whistles, Tracey looked up from her Potions essay, sighed, and went to join the small group gathering around one of the side tables.

"Picked it up from Ollivander's yesterday," Daphne's smug voice continued. "Genuine verdant leather, and the buttons are refined ferrum."

"That's very cool, Greengrass, but that's nothing." Malfoy slid his own holster across the table. "Emerald hide. Forged-iron buttons."

Tracey looked from one holster to the other, and decided that if she had to deal with /four more years/ of Pureblood Posturing, she might as well have some fun, even if Daphne was her friend. She picked up Draco's holster.

"That's really /nice/, Malfoy. How did you get so fashionable?" She glanced over at Daphne's face, and fought back a smile at how her expression had no discernible change whatsoever.

"Impressive. Very nice." Daphne stiffly said. "Let's see Zabini's holster."

Zabini, with a smirk, undid his holster from his wrist and held it up to the firelight.

Oh, what Tracey wouldn't give to be a /Legilimens/ now.

Meanwhile, Daphne's face was frozen as she examined the newest contender. /That subtle jade coloring. The fine polish of the buttons. Are those-are those his initials?/

The holster fell to the table from trembling fingers, where it joined its identical green twins.

"Daphne? Something wrong?" Tracey asked.
