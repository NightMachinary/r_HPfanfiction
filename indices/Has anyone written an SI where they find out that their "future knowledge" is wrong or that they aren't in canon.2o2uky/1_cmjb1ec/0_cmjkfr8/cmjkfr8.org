given that the closest I've come to Non-HP is crossover fics I couldn't say for sure... but I wonder if some of it is that Harry isn't the kind of person whose life we'd want to experience personally? Like, outside of fanon, theres no established means of avoiding the fact that the hero of our story needs to die... And we have no guarantee that we can mimic the events that led to Harry managing to have death itself not stick.
