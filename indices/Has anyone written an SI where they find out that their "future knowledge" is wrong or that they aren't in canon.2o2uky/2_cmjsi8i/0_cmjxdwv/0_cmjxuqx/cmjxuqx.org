Curse of Truth is the kind of story you read when you want something funny rather than something immersive and serious... save the rec for a rainy day when you've just finished something depressing and then go find the Omake where Luna and ?Bud? mock Lucius and Draco's obsession with their hair.

Alternatively go read anything the sorting hat says in The Lie I've Lived
