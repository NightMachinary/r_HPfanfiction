I think I'd like to do that, but Curse tried to be emotional too and the imo creepy relationship between Bud/William and all the girls just makes it very off-putting for me. I'd rather read something like Lie, a Black Comedy, Bungle in the Jungle, Oh God, Not Again! or All The Dementors of Azkaban.
