One that springs to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]]. I saw it recommend on the sub some time ago, but I'm not sure if I'd repeat the recommendation. The main character is quite the Mary Sue who wants to pursue a romantic relationship with 14-year old Hermione, while he himself is implied to be 18+ (he's in a 14-year old body though), and flirts with every girl he comes across including the 12-year old Astoria Greengrass.

On top of that the pay-off is extremely weak imo. The whole story builds up to his big secret coming out, but the big secret is apparently not that he's in what he believed to be a fictional universe, but just his future knowledge, which was extremely disappointing to me as the former coming out seemed extremely interesting to me if handled well.
