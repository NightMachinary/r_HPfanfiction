Consider a story like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors][Vapors]].

The main character, Aiko, is clearly an SI OC. Twin sister to Naruto, she is reborn in this world with knowledge of the anime and a largely developed adult psyche.

And that's all there is to it. Most of her old personality is purged through time. She remembers little enough of her old life, and the various technologies and concepts of her old world are mostly ignored as benefits except for certain ways of thinking - the application of the scientific method being notable.

Of course, SI as a term is not disparaging. Neither was negro, once. It's simply how many of its kind turned out to be, as a natural consequence of the demographic of authors inclined to write SI fiction.
