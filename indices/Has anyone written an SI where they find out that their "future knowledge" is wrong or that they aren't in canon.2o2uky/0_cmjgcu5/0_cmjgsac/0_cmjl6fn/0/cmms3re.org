I think of a SI as a story request as only applying where it is literally the case - the character is from the real world and somehow ends up in the story. Granted, I've only read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][one which applies]], which all the reviews I've read state being suprised as to liking it. (Doesn't particularly apply to OP, btw, although it is largely well written).

I believe SI when not meant as such is generally used as a disparaging term for a OC, as you outlined.
