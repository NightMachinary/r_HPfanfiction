I have a story that I'm currently publishing in which the next chapter features Harry vs Viktor in the Quidditch World Cup. The only problem is that I haven't written the chapter yet. Also, much of what I've already published doesn't feature Harry playing Quidditch, but instead focuses on a growing Harry/Hermione relationship. Not sure if that floats your boat or not.
