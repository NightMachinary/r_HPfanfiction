I'll second the recommendation, but to expand: Sirius accidentally escapes Azkaban five years earlier than canon, and since he doesn't have any leads on Peter this time, he instead goes to check on Harry. And finds him unhappy with the Dursleys, and offers him another home. Cue a massive uproar throughout the wizarding world; not only has Sirius Black escaped, but he's kidnapped Harry Potter, no doubt to perform some dark ritual for his master!

Lots of really good characterisation of Sirius, Remus, Tonks, eight-year-old Harry, and even Severus. It's really sweet to see Harry getting a childhood and a caring parental figure, albeit one who's often immature and has had his head knocked around by Azkaban. Sirius still does his best for James' son.
