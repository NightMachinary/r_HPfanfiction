I don't remember the name, because it's been too long since I read it, but there was a story in which Harry was a rhinoceros animagus.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/82/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual][chapter 82 of Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual]] by Clell65619, Harry is a honey badger animagus.

In linkffn(Loyalty by Whispering Darkness), Harry gets sent into the Naruto universe, because his animagus form can't exist in his.

In linkffn(Harry Mewter by Alex Ultra), Hermione brews an incorrect animagus potion in 2nd year, and the trio all become pokemon.
