A couple of stories that I know where Harry helps Draco during 6th year are:

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=7040][Harry Potter and the Bound Prince]] (I thought the characters were OOC in this but you may like it). Apparently there are a quite a few sequels to this story and the sequels were better received than the first story. [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/53034-the-bound-prince][Link]] to ratings page for the story and sequels. [[http://www.slashpervert.com/BPseriesPage/BPseries.html][Link]] for all of the other stories in the series.
