Ah, such a difficult request you ask.

There are infact plenty of Haphne fics, however, most of them are infested with Weasleys/Dumbledore/Hermione bashing. If not, 11 year old adults who are masters of occulmens, as Occulmency/Legilimency is commonly taught among pureblood families.

If you don't mind those baggage, I can recommend you some fics.
