LOL this is by far one of the most amusing questions I have read on here. Its just such a minor and odd part of the HP universe to wonder about. I love it.

My theory is simply that because its a train/travel station, there are free limited time parking spaces in the area. This is true at least over in the US at many such stations. Either that or they simply didnt care being wizards and will get a parking ticket.

However a more fun theory would be that there are parts of it we dont know but only Mr Weasley knows. Like, we know it flies and has an expanded inside... but maybe it can go invisible, or compress to fit in a tiny spot, or be shrunk down to be put in a pocket, or parked mid air, or who knows what.
