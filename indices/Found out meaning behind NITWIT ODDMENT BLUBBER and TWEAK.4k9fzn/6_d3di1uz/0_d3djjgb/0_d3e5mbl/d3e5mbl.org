See a pattern there?

Look, I see what you're trying to do, but it's nothing but a cute, implausible theory, and one that pretty much takes the meaning out of that scene. The whole point of it was to establish Dumbledore as a "kooky" character. You can apply those four words to pretty much anything you like, even defying House-Elf naming standards, but don't take it too far. Making these words utilitarian robes them of their importance.
