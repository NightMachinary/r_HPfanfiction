I don't think there /is/ any kind of naming convention with House Elves. Dobby and Winky both ending with a Y could be a coincidence, and Kreacher is just a bastardization of Creature. I could totally see Dobby being formally named Dobbins, or Winky as Winkle.

Or they could just as easily fit in. "Winky! Pinky! Dobby! Rye!"
