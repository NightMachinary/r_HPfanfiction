I remember a comment from a game dev, a couple of years ago lamenting the fact that there wasn't a good Quidditch video game. If they are to be believed, JK was *very* protective of her IP. No one else was allowed to name anything or use their own ideas because JK was still writing the books and wanted to keep her vision clear. Everything had to be vetted through her and she didn't have the time/interest to flesh out a game world.

So if we take that as true, then Hooky, as a name was probably vetted by JK at some point to fall in with her internal naming convention.
