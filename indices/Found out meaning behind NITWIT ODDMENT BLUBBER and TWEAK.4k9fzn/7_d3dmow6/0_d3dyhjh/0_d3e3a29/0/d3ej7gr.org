Forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't Hokey just from the games and such, not the books? I wouldn't even count him, and three elves is not a large enough sample size to determine a pattern.

Nitwit, Blubber, and Oddment could all be relocated from old families who died out or were put in Azkaban during or after the first Voldemort war. Perhaps insult names are the norm among pureblood families who practice darker magic and Malfoy only named Dobby differently because he wanted to pose as a moderate.
