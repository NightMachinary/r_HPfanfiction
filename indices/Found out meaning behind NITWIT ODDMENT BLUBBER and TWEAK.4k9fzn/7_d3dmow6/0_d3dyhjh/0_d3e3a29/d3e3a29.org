Dobby, Winky and Hokey all share a pattern implying that house elves name themselves, i mean can you imagine Lucius thinking Dobby was a suitable name. The only one who bucks this trend is Kreacher who is an old elf raised in the house of Black who still rutinely decapitate and mount their servents. To the Blacks of old a /creature/ like that would be unworthy of a name.
