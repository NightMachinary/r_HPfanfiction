It's a fun theory but it doesn't hold with the naming conventions of the rest of the house elves. The surface level reading would say that this is just JK showing how whimsical the magical world is and what an oddball Dumbledore is, which is played for great effect against his later demonstrations of power. Also- kids book, that line was hilarious to 10 year old me.

But if you look a bit deeper, put yourself in Draco's shoes. You've just left your home and the watchful guard of your parents for the first time only to be placed under the thumb of a man your entire family despises, the one the dark lord feared! Dumbledore could look quite intimidating, sitting at the high table, on what is basically a throne, resplendent and powerful. Draco's boogeyman is sitting not fifty feet from him and we know that Malfoy isn't a very brave person ultimately. Then the defeater of Grindelwald stands up and says /“Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”/. Rather disarming don't you think? Would that be enough to shift Draco from awed fear to scorn? After all Dumbledore can more readily work with a scornful opponent than a fearful one.
