Excellent counterpoint but if not something nonsensical as a house-elf name what WOULD be a house elf name? (Don't name canon house elves please).

Plus Dumbledore never considered Draco an quote unquote 'enemy' even on his deathbed as you most likely recall. I doubt this would be the first time Draco has seen Dumbledore as him being pure blood. He most likely saw Dumbledore before and Lucius wouldn't mention to his own son that Dumbledore was stronger than the dark lord. He would have spoken of him with scorn and disregard most likely. Nothing more than a nuance.

On a opposite not however. Dumbledore COULD have done that as a way to ease Harry's fears or worries. (Legilimens!Dumbledore theory here.)
