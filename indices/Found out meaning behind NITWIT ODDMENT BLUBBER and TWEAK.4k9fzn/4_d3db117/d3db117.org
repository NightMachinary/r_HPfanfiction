I thought he was mentioning the different houses by calling out the reverse characteristic of them.

Nitwit = Ravenclaw (definitely not nitwits)\\
Oddment = Slytherin (They try to be something more than just "oddments")\\
Blubber = Gryffindor (they're so courageous that they don't blubber(cry))\\
Tweak = Hufflepuff (they don't need to be tweaked to fit in and be down-to-earth)
