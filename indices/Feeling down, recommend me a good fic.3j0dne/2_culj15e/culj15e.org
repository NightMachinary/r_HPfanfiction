linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus) is the first part of a trilogy. Harry/Daphne, Neville/Hermione.

There's also a sweet oneshot by the same author, not in the same verse, about a burgeoning Greg/Hermione.

linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66) is a Harry/Morag along the veins of the 'Harry has everyone betraying him' trope.

When I'm down, I gravitate to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion by Rorshach's Blot]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] as guaranteed pick me ups. ;)
