Forever knight. Its on portkey and is up there as one of my favorites. After the prologue, the story is really fluffy for the first couple chapters but after that, it becomes really good. One of my all time favorites. HHr though. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]
