No patronizing was intended, I just really don't know what you mean. There are possible multiple official ends of the WW2E (The Second World War in Europe), but May 2 is not one of them. The only thing which happened on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2][May 2]] was the Soviet announcement of the Fall of Berlin, which doesn't sound like any official even at all. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender][May 8]]. And the last large German troops capitulated in Prague, Czechia on the same day. And the last shot was fired on May 11/12 around the small village of Mil√≠n in Southern Bohemia. What did you mean?
