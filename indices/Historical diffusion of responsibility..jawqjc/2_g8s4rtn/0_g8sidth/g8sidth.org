The Battle of Hogwarts starts the day before it ends and it mostly happens because Voldemort finds out about the Harry's Horcrux Hunt. The two events couldn't have been related since up until the day Harry broke into Gringotts, he laid low for a month. Unless, through some mental gymnastics, you assume that Voldemort had something to do with testing the power of his new wand on the Muggles. I believe JK chose 2nd of May as the end of the second war in order to match the date that WW2 ended in Europe.
