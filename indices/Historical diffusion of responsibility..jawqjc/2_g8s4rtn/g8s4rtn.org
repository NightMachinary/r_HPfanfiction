You are not *completely* ridiculous, but:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's Law]] knowns no mercy: ninety percent of everything is crap. It certainly applies fully to fanfiction stories. Again ninety percent of crappy fanfictions are just boring or poorly written, but there are ten percent of crap which have some really horrible ideas like what you have described. Do with it just what you do with the rest of the crap: step over it and wash your shoes if you step on something.

2. The relationship between The Troubles and the Harry Potter universe is strange one and never fully understood. The fact that [[https://youtu.be/j48XwoTeFC4][Good Friday Agreement]] was just 22 days before the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts][Battle of Hogwarts]] is just something which cries for more investigation, but AFAIK nobody did it. It is just mentioned in “Sanctuary by Sheankelor” linkffn(12015723), IRA terrorists are used by Lucius Malfoy in “[[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian]]”, but I would say that generally this is largely unused area.
