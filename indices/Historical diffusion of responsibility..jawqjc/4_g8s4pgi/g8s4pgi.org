Isn't the Hitler being Grindelwald's Puppet thing something Rowling made up? It sounds familiar, but I can't remember if it's a fandom thing or an extra-book canon thing.

I don't really have any particular opinion either way myself - but I'd imagine those people aren't actually trying to say that those IRL monsters weren't responsible for their actions. They're not writing Harry Potter fanfiction and expecting people to go "Yes! The IRA didn't do all those things they did! It was the Wizards!", on account of the Wizards not actually existing.

So, yeah. It's an interesting question - is removing responsibility from real people in fictional contexts a problematic thing to do? - but I definitely don't have an answer to it.

Would you have as much of a problem if they put a disclaimer on it or something? "This is fiction, these people were dickwombles in reality." or the like?
