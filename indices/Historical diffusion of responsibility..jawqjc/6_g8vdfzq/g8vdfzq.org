You're not ridiculous. These authors are trying to take a short cut to beef up the characters ("you know how Hitler was evil? Actually, Grindelwald was the REAL Hitler!") but they just cheapen their stories and mock the IRL victims ("what if your pain was just a story? What if all the suffering and death of the Holocaust/Troubles/etc. was just fiction for entertainment?").

It's good when fics take real world history into account and great world building to show how that could have intersected with the magical world. But don't dismiss the history or co-opt the victims' stories.
