I'd say the better way to handle it is to have it be more a case of wizards exploiting events/movements in the Muggle world to their own gain. For example, I've seen at least one or two fics in which the Troubles were used as a cover explanation for some Death Eater attacks, possibly making the Troubles worse in the process.
