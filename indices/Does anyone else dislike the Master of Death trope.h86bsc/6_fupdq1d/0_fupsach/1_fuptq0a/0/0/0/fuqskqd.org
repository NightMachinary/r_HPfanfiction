To me, the issue there is that it's not really Harry - it's more like generic good guy wizard.

Ron, Hermione, Luna, etc all have more independent character traits that make them more interesting in crossovers while staying in character imo. And I mean with them individually, not as a group - though the trio going to a different universe would be much more interesting than Harry alone imo. (Or the trio + Voldemort or another antagonist could be interesting too)
