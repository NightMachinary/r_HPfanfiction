Yeah, in a crossover Harry is a terrible character to focus on IMO. He's so defined by the characters around him in canon that taking him away from that just makes him a generic character, more or less.

I think Hermione, Ron, Luna, or a bunch of others from HP would be a lot more interesting in crossovers - or, my actual preference, crossovers with people going to the HPverse instead usually work better for me.
