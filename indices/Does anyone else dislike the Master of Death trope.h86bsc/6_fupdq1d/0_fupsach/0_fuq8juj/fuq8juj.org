It's really interesting!

I feel the same and that's exactly why I prefer non Harry-centric sorties. He's too much of a blank slate for me, he feels like OC in every other fic. I find it more interesting to read characters like Hermione and Ron changing, adapting and developing, than Harry just getting ‘different settings'.
