That's so interesting - I feel the exact opposite. Harry is the "neutral mask" of canon, so he can be anything an author wants. Ron and Hermione have very distinct personalities, which is why we notice so immediately when they are OOC.

It's fun to see the different things people look for in fanfiction!
