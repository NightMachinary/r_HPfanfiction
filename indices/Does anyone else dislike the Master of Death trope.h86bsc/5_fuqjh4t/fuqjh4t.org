The Master of Death trope is one that's very very hard to do properly - particularly since it doesn't really fit well into the universe, IMO.

I don't mind if it's used as a setup for something like time travel or universe jumping or the like - then it's just a convenient way to have Harry go back in time.

But as an actual thing, OP main characters are very hard for me to enjoy - and just giving Harry a super powerful boost isn't all that fun.

I think to make it interesting, it would need to be a story that works around that power - I suppose some sort of slowly losing his humanity could be workable.

I much prefer other ways of powering up the protagonists, that take more effort on their end.
