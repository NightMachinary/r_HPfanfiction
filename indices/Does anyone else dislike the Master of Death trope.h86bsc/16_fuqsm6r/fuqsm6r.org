I like it when the combination of the Hallows does something, not being able to control Death, but as in, each of them have different abilities that when combined make one more powerful

I think my favorite one had the Cloak at the full power being able to absorb and shield against all kinds of spells, other had the Stone being the ultimate necromancer tool, temporarily raising recently dead enemies as thralls to fight on your side.

The Wand is mostly just a super wand that lets people do stuff normally impossible(like fixing a broken wand) or cast stronger spells. The best one I've seen is when it's an artifact that can turn into a scythe and was connected to necromancy(the setting has high power levels)
