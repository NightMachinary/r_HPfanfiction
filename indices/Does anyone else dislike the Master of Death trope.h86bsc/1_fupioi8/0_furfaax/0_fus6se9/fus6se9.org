Didn't they have to underpower everything to keep a few of the avengers relevant? That, and the comics give everyone insane levels of power due to how long the comics run, with how they need enemies of increasing power. Like in Dragonball, once they added in power levels, things became redonkulous. At the start of DBZ, 9k was a big deal, and then when Frieza showed up, it's millions. Then near the end, it's in the trillions.
