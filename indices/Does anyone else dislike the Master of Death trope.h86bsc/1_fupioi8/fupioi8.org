Truthfully it depends on the setting. Magic by itself is borderline overpowered in a something like MCU but put canon Harry in the comic version and he needs the boost to stay relevant It also depends on the how, did he just get a boost from becoming the mod or did he become an immortal world hopper who slowly grows in power I dislike putting an overpowered MOD Harry in a low powered setting and then him waving his hand and fixing everything
