As I am currently writing a MoD!Harry, I guess I'm guilty of perpetuating this trope. I don't see it as often, and several of the examples where it was used were in stories that I enjoyed, like Rise of the Wizards.

I generally prefer super!Harry stories, and the MoD concept is loosely canon (even though it is entirely undefined). It's more logical than "Gringotts powerup!" or "Black library study!" or "Founders Knowledge!" stories, after all.

I think the super!Harry trope is more problematic as a whole than simply the MoD! subset in particular. But again, just one guy's opinion!
