Me. It screams OP and clashes too much with my interpretation of canon. I've always though MoD meant nothing, just that a person was ready to meet Death â€˜like an old friend' and wasn't afraid of it, accepted it. Hallows are just powerful artifacts, not something that really gives you special abilities.

The only time I'm ok with MoD being some sort of... wizarding superhero is when the Hallows are used as a starting point for a plot (like exchanging them for a time/dimensional travel or someone's resurrecting; somehow messing up with them so you're cursed or thrown in other time)
