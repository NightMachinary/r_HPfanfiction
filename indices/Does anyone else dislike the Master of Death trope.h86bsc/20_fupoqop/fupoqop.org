I only like it when it's used for interesting effect.

Like, someone who actually /was/ master of death would gradually become separated from the mundanity of life and would sort of become otherworldly and separate from the daily concerns of humans in the way that the gods do in some lore. Or Or they do their best to remain connected to something, and the conflict in the story comes from them trying to deal with what amounts to immortality.

Like, you live so long that you forget what it's like to be human (sort of like a less interested version of Ego from GUardians of the galaxy 2) or you've lost and will continue to lose everything you've ever loved.

I've seen it done twice in ways I liked, one was for humorous effect and one was sad.
