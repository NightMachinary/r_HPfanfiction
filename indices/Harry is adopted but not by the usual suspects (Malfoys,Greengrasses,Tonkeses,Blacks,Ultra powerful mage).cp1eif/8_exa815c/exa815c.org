Most of the "Harry gets adopted" stories I know of are crossovers, involving everyone from Batman to Godzilla as an adoptive parent. Some that aren't crossovers are:

linkffn(Fate's Mistake by kb0). Harry gets adopted by the Diggory family.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny). Adopted by goblins.

linkffn(125850897). Adopted by a gurkha. Used the number because the title contains parentheses.

linkffn(Lucky Harry by pygus). Adopted by the Delacours.

linkffn(Marked by Fire and Thunder). Adopted by Odin (not a Marvel Universe cross).

linkffn(Second Chances by Zaxarus). Adopted by the Pinegrews.

linkffn(The Paths Diverge by Vaneria Potter). Baby Harry wanders from the doorstep, gets adopted.

linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089). Adopted by Amelia Bones.
