I dunno, a lot of families count as 'usual suspects' for adopting Harry. Grangers, Malfoys, Tonks, Gringotts goblins, centaurs, intelligent-dragons, Harry Dresden, Tony Stark...\\
Strangely enough, I don't know if I've seen that many Weasley-adoptions...though there's Like A Red-Headed Stepchild (the one by mugglesftw).

Hmm...who could the newest unusual suspect be? Not Potter-family house elves, that's been done...not Umbridge, that's been done...not Snape, that's been /over/done...not Hagrid, not Lupin...not Newt Scamander either...

Ooh, what about Viktor Krum? As in, his parents? James & Lily's flight from Voldemort takes them to Bulgaria, where they strike up a firm friendship with the Krum family. Voldemort kills Lily and James, but unbeknownst to anyone in Britain, Harry survived and was adopted by the Krums, rising to become a Quidditch natural like his brother Viktor.
