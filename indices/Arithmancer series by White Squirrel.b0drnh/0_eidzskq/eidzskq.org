Have you read DrizzleWizzle's series? I know the plot is quite different (it's a Slytherin Harry fic), but it's quality is on par with White Squirrel, in fact I would go so far as to say that his rewrite of the 5th book is better than the Archimedes series, but that could be a matter of taste! Basically, long story short - if you want a similarly well written story that improves on canon realistically, definitely check the DrizzleWizzle series :))
