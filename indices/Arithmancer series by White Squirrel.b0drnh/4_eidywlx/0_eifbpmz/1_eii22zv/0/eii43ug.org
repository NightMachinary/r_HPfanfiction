I like both. Animagus has IMHO some problematic empty parts (like authors was thinking how to continue and tried different attempts), but some parts are extremely good (mostly those which are not writing into the canon story: beginning or the third year with werewolves). I wrote [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][a complete review of the series]] (and some other stuff).
