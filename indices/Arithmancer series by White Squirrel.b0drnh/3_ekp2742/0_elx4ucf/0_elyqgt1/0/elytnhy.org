Really? o.O

Personally I feel /Annals/ is just as important to the series as the first two. I love that WS didn't just let things drop after the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. It feels like many authors think "Oh, the war's ended, someone won; end of story" or "War's over; fast forward to main character death after they've lived a long and happy life". However, there's this long period in the middle there that it seems many authors tend to ignore - sure, someone won, but how does society rebuild? How do people move on? How do people deal with PTSD, with trying to live normal lives again? The end of the war is the end of one story, but more often it symbolizes the start of another that far too few bother to explore, and is something I sorely feel is missing in general fanfiction. /Annals/ filled perfectly a hole I wanted filled :)

Then again, I can certainly see how it isn't as exciting to others!
