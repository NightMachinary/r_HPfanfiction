I finished Lady Archimedes. I haven't finished Annals of Arithmany, I don't think. I got a little bored/fatigued with some of what was going on there. But I'm curious which part you are referring to, and don't want to spoil it for others. DM me if you want.

Oops, I misread your comment. I get it now. And yeah, I agree!
