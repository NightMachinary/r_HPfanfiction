There's a story that's similar enough for me to recommend it, though I apologize for not being able to remember the name.

Sometime after the epilogue, Auror Harry Potter gets a package in the mail that, when opened, causes him to go insane (or die/headaches/get angry/breaks up his marriage?). Hermione does some time travel shenanigans that helps solve the situation in a, well, unconventional way.

It's HP/GW and HG/RW to start but ends as HP/HG.
