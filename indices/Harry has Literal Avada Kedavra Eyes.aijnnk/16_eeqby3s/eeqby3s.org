linkffn(Fate's Gamble)

by Lupine Horror, is not exactly the idea, but it's delightfully better: Harry Potter is rescued from the Dursleys by...Zelretch! Specifically, Z "throws out" his Kaleidoscope power, and Harry catches it. He winds up on Gorgon Island, and long story element short, gets blood adopted by Z, Waver and Medusa's other sisters (they're divine immortals, so can survive their sister eating them). He winds up sporting a similar blindfold to Medusa's, for the same reasons. I highly recommend it, if only for the massive amounts of trolling done by...well, everyone, really.
