Basilisk born by Ebenbild sorta has this, except it's one of those creature inheritance stories where Harry gets adopted by someone whose father was a basilisk and inherits the basilisk kill people with a glance thing, and also a convenient second set of eyelids that blocks the killing gaze. Not a residual effect of the curse, but he does kill someone with it.
