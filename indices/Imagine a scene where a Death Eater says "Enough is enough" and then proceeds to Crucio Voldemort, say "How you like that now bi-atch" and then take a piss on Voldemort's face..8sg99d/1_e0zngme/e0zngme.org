Perversely I already get that kind of satisfaction whenever Voldemort Crucios his followers. They're pureblood bigots who hate and torture Muggles (...that's us, btw.) Lord V seems to care more about concentrating his personal power, so if he wants to be all "You've disappointed me, Lucius." *zap* *zap* *zap* before whipping it out and humiliating the snooty prick...

But of course even Malfoys deserve due process and I would never condone abuse.
