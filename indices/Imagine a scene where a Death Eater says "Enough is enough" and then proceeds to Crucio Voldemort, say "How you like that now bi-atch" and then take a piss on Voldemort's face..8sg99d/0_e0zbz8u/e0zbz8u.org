Interesting, but one alone could probably not do it - but how about a conspiracy among DEs to really trash Voldemort (maybe even without being identified by him!) so that he learns that torturing your followers isn't great, especially since they can strike back!

Would love a Voldemort that got a reality check because his DEs had enough!
