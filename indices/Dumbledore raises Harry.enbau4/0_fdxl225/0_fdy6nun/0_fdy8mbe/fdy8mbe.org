I actually stopped reading right around those chapters, to be honest. I really enjoyed the beginning and the dynamic between them, and then like you got a bit weirded out. I've considered picking it up again but haven't yet done so. But it was refreshing to not see a soldier Harry and mastermind Dumbledore.
