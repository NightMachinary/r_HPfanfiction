I wanted to like this because fics with a Dumbledore who's not a moustache twirling villain are few and far between, but some things about it really weirds me out. There's a lot of sex discussion between (child) Harry and Dumbledore, and even a scene where Dumbledore accidentally casts a kind of tickling charm meant to be used by couples on Harry. He then teaches Harry, who is like 12, said charm, though reluctantly, clearly under the premise that it will be used for sexual purposes.

I don't know if I'm overreacting or not, but around then I stopped reading. Worth mentioning that some of the authors other stories are Dumbledore/underage Harry fics. I don't think the author is implying anything or planning to make this fic anything like that, I'm just saying it made me uncomfortable. But hey, maybe I'm a prude.
