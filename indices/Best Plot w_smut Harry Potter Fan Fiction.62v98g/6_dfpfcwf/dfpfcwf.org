Well... Can think of a few on the top of my head, but I have to insist that these stories generally can't be as good as those without smut.

linkffn(5790760) Seaching For The Power. For the first 20 chapters or so it's quite plotless though. Still have something going on there, but it's overshadowed by smut. Got better later on if you still haven't got bored of all the constant "action".

linkffn(11035814) Harem War, Vance McGill version, much better than the original. Too bad the update is slow and it stopped at a rather interesting point so...

linkao3(386831) That Need, from ao3. This is smut with slight plot of the trio + ginny discovering...well, that need. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for since it's rather light hearted, and the plot is not that noticeable, still, the story flows quite nicely...Oops, forgot that you don't like male slash. There will be some here so you can skip it if you want. Still a nice story that I want to recommend though.
