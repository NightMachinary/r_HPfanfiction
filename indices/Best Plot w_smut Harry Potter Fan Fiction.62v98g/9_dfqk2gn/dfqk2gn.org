If you're up for slash, I have to recommend Danse Russe by Frayach linkao3(454721). Drarry. This is one of the most literary, gorgeous explorations of love that I've come across in HP fanfiction. It's dark, erotic and heart-breaking. This is /not/ a magical bond fic; "Bond" in the summary is just that - an emotional bond. Danse Russe is actually a sequel to calanthe's Mudhoney Trilogy, though you don't have to have read the Trilogy to follow Danse Russe. The MH Trilogy, FWIW, is a series of three /extreme/ BDSM Drarry short stories. It's definitely not for everyone.

Frayach has written a number of stories in the HP world, and she "specializes" (for want of a better term) in bringing dignity and beauty to sexuality, including some of the most extreme kinks. She only writes male slash, though, so maybe not your thing. However, if you're looking for top-quality, literary-style erotica, I can't recommend Frayach highly enough.

Edit to add: For a classic recommendation of high-quality writing/plotting + smut, Isolation by Bex-chan is a great choice. Dramione. linkffn(6291747)
