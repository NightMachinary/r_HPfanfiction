linkao3(714361) Tried that one, but I'm not a fan of SS/HP, so my review are kind of mixed, but it was really well-written and the ideas very interesting. Features all kind of E-rated content, there's even rape (although not the SS/HP part)

linkao3(The Courtesan) Again, I'm biased, but because LV/HP are nearly almost the only kind of fic I read.

linkao3(Corvus Fallere, Book 1)
