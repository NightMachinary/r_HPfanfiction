If you make one response and then your next is "confirming I'm not worth talking to" while hinting you couldn't possibly follow up on the questions you posed me and I answered, that's literally being the opposite of respectful and is a completely pointless comment meant to passive aggressively imply that you disagree with me and think I'm an idiot without actually saying it.
