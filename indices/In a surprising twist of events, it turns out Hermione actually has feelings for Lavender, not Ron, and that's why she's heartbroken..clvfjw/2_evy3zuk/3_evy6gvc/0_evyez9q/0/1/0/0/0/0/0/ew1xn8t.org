  If you make one response and then your next is "recusing" yourself from a conversation while hinting that you couldn't possibly phrase something in a respectful manner while discussing the topic with me, that's literally being the opposite of respectful and is a completely pointless comment meant to passive aggressively imply that you disagree with me and think I'm an idiot without actually saying it.

You're an idiot, and I disagree with you. I recused myself because my original comment was meant to jokingly remind you of the exact wording of the comment you'd followed up on, which was obviously negative. I assumed you'd forgotten when typing your own comment, then realized that you were 100% serious when you replied to me.

  Do you genuinely think that everyone has to believe that Ron belongs with somebody or else they're Ron bashing? That seems irrational, yet that's what's being implied by labeling someone saying "Ron's unfortunately destined to be forever alone tbh" is Ron bashing.

There is a massive gulf between 'Ron doesn't necessarily have to end up with someone, and that's not an indictment of his worth of a person' and 'Ron is literally destined to be alone forever because of who he is as a person.'
