Yes, unless you think someone's worth is entirely linked to their relationship status.

I personally don't think Ron is suitable for romantic relationships. The Ron bashing goes too far, but I can't imagine ever willingly reading a fic where Ron is in the main ship.

That doesn't really mean the character is terrible in and of itself, especially coming from f/f fans (which the original poster and myself both are, even if good f/f is a rarity in HP)
