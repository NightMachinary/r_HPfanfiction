If you make one response and then your next is "recusing" yourself from a conversation while hinting that you couldn't possibly phrase something in a respectful manner while discussing the topic with me, that's literally being the opposite of respectful and is a completely pointless comment meant to passive aggressively imply that you disagree with me and think I'm an idiot without actually saying it.

Which is fine, but it seems a bit childish to go about it in that way. I don't think it's 100% neutral, but I don't think it's more of a hint at being negative when it's on its own. Do you genuinely think that everyone has to believe that Ron belongs with somebody or else they're Ron bashing? That seems irrational, yet that's what's being implied by labeling someone saying "Ron's unfortunately destined to be forever alone tbh" is Ron bashing.
