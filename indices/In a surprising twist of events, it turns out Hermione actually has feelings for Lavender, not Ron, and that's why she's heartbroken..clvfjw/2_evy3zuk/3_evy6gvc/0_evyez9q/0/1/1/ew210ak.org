  I'm going to recuse myself from this conversation, since I don't think there's a respectful way I could address you judging someone to be 'unsuitable for romantic relationships' as not negative when it's an evaluation of their character.

I find this interesting. In the golden age of Harmony/Lunar Harmony fics. Ron was a (barely) self-aware stomach, one step away from being actual Hitler (there might have been a fic where he was Hitler) who crucios mudblood puppies for fun. The Ronbashing is extremely toned down from the days where it was common that Ron secretly hated Harry and was just in it so his family could snag Potter's enormous fortune and he could finally live out his dream of owning the chudley cannons. There were even fics that invented a new way for Ron to die in each Author's Note/Disclaimer. Now the most I see in Ronbashing fics is him have poor table manners or him being downright jealous of Harry. Which, actually happens in canon, and usually he grows out of these behaviors.
