Yeah, I don't really miss the days of incessant Ron-bashing in like every single fic under the sun tbh, but it feels like the exact opposite now where you can't have a negative opinion about Ron or people will jump down your throat for Ron-bashing, even over something as silly as thinking Ron is unsuitable for romantic relationships.
