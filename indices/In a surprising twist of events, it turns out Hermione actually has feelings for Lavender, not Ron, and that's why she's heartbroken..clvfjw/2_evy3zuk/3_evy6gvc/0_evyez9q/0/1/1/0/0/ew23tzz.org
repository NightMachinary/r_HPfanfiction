I really try to stay out of the fanfic community. This is going to show my age, but I remember the days when Leaky Cauldron, DLP, and the even the Sugar Quill were filled with pages upon pages of posters engaged in flame wars, saying absolutely vile things about every pairing under the sun except H/Hr, and I think this has skewed my attitude toward any fanfic community. The only reason why I browse HPFanfic is that some of the recs are amazing. But, I really needed to chime in on this discussion.
