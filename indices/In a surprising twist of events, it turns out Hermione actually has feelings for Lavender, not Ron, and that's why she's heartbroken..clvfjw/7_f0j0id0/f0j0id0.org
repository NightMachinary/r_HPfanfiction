I don't know what to feel about so many threads discussing the Ron Bashing in this post, while ignoring the slight- I can admit it is a... usual, even canonical joke - bash done to Lavender. She is a sixteen year old girl. Yeah, who had weird school experience with random weird things every end of the year, but... She is just a student. She is noy part of the social circle of the trio. With her first serious crush. Who she is dating. Probably her first relationship. Are you going to tell me we were the height of maturity at 16? Aaaaand I love? For the first time?? Honestly???

Actually commenting on the post, it would have been pretty awesome and Hermione's grumpiness could be that she is questioning herself. I would totally read something along those lines.
