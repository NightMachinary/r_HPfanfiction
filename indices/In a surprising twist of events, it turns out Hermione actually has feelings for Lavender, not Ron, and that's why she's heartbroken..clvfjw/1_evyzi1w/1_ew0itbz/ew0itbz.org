Hah! I actually drafted something similar a few months back but was never able to finish it. Harry was upset that Cedric was going to the Yule Ball with Cho. Cedric thought Harry had a crush on Cho, so he asked her to the Ball to make Harry jealous. Cho knows what is going on and accepted to try and get them together.
