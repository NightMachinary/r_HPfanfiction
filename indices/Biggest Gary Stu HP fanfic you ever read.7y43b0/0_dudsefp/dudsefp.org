Oh, the one where Harry is a science genius that ran circles around everyone. It was somewhat of a SI fic for the author who didn't deserve a fucking bit of praise for that long, convoluted shitstorm of a fanfic. It was the Shades of Grey of Potter fanfiction. Methods of Rationality my ass. Ugh, I've never wanted Harry to die a more painful death than Ramsey Snow by chapter fucking three in my life.
