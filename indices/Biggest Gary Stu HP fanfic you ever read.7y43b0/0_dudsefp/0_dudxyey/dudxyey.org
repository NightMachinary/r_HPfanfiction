I wholeheartedly agree. Everyone says that it makes sense by chapter 150, but that's bad writing if you take 150 chapters to explain why the MC is a dick. Harry doesn't come across smart, he comes across as a whiny smartass. I get that he is supposed to be the "revenge" of the bullied smart kids, but he's more the personification of that weird kid who used to play around with his gas lighter and derailed the lessons with off topic questions you ought to ask after class.
