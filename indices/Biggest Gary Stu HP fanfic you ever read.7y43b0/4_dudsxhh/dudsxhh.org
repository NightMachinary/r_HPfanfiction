Any HP fic by stargatesg1fan1. One of his stories is nearing 1,000,000 words, shit ton of crossovers, and no challenge for god!Harry who is more powerful than all of the other gods, killed, and absorbed Hades. This Hades, by the way is more powerful than any other Hades you've ever read, and Harry killed, and absorbed him, while he was already a god. Harry can b****slap Superman, give a wedgie to Thanos who has all the infinity stones, basically massively OP.
