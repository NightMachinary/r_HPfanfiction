That's your opinion, but for me that's how I end written posts/comments/letters/etc... I find it hard to believe that this is such a problem for you, that you have to argue about it for hours. This is just how I end most things I write. If you have such a problem with it, ignore it, or block me. Stop arguing about how I finish what I write, like a 10 y/o with something to prove.

Thanks,

Warryn.
