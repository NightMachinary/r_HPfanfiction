I'm sorry. If it helps, if you want a story where you can just watch the main character steam role everyone, and get all the girls, it's not too bad I guess. It has decent pacing, and decent grammer. It's not bad if your looking for a wish fullfillment story, I mean there is a reason Superman is so popular.

If your looking for a story with good plot, good character development, and where the mc struggles, even just a little bit, this isn't the author you're looking for(ha, just realised, Star Wars reference).

Thanks,

Warryn.
