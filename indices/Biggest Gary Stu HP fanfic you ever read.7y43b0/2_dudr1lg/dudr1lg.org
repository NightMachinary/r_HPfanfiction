My Top 3:

- Harry Crow by Robst\\
  I don't think I have to explain this much. Harry is the biggest Mary Sue ever. He is literally outwitting everyone, the perfect gentlemen at eleven, can defeat any fighter no matter their skill-level, everyone not-evil loves him, and he gets the highest titles and honors at the youngest age.\\

- Partially Kissed Hero\\
  Much more eloquent people have described this, but the MC also does everything right - always. Everyone that is disagreeing with him is evil.\\

These two fics are just bad.

- Core Threads\\
  In this Harry accidentally conquers an entire world, can do everything at Lightspeed and has no limits to his abilities. Oh and he's also 100% good and never abuses his power.\\

This one can actually be fun to read, just for the heck of it.
