By revolutionize I mean how quickly Harry can eradicate blood purity prejudice, convert Draco, make everyone love goblins, fix Slytherin house, uncorrupt the ministry, and still have time to train a group of super soldiers and then kill Voldemort. They're all incredibly long winded stories about Harry solving every problem ever imagined before his third year.

Edit: all of robst's stories are fine if you want a feel good story about Harry being perfect. They're just not my cup of tea at all
