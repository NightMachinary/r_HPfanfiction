I just wrote this in another thread but all of robst's (Harry Crow author) stories are just an exercise in how quickly he can "revolutionize" the magical world. I will say the Core Threads is actually ok. Just finished reading it and it wasn't great but I don't regret the time I spent reading it. Its over the top and super out out of Canon and I really dislike the superfriends trope (Harry creates a gang of friends with amazing power that he personally trained from year one) but it was overall a decent story and didn't take itself too seriously which is the problem that I always have with OP!Harry stories
