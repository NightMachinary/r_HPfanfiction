Probably because the anti Muslim rant. It seems to become a more common sentiment in the western world and for every person complaining about it here there are a few who like it but just don't come here (this sub is relatively small after all). I mean, the Harry Potter fanfiction community seems to be ok with evil concepts neither Hitler nor Stalin ever dared to touch (marriage laws and similar forced marriages), so you can expect a certain degradation of the moral compass.

Personally I've never read it and frankly I don't care about it since the fic is supposed to have worse issues. However, a growing dislike of Islam is not surprising due to the events of the last 17 years. And if an opinion becomes popular in society at large, it will make it into fanfics eventually. And since more and more people share that opinion, it gets you popularity.
