Pretty much any story with a political Harry where everyone just bends over. Harry has dirt on exactly two people, Fudge (random arrest of Hagrid) and Malfoy (attempted killing curse after the CoS). He has no evidence of anything else (He didn't actually see Malfoy slip the diary, Sirius was locked up by Bagnold and Crouch and Fudge can claim that the dementor with Crouch Jr was an accident). Besides that, Harry has some goodwill, but that's it.
