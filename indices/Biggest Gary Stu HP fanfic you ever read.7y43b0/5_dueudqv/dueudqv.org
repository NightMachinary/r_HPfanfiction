Heartlands of Time/ Wastelands of Time. Great stories to be honest, but Harry is a bit overpowered from having lived multiple multiple lives and knowing where to go and what to do and getting both Fleur and Tonks multiple multiple times.

Again though, great stories and I'm looking forward to the second one being finished.
