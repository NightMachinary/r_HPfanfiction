Perhaps he pointed out that as he was going back to a muggle orphanage for the summer where it probably wasn't a good idea to leave a Hogwarts award lying around on a table, or it was awarded when he was back at school and didn't want to sleep next to it in his dorm room. It was temporarily put in the trophy room for 'safekeeping' and was promptly forgotten about. Or perhaps that is part of the award. You get immortalised by the trophy being on display for future students for ever more. It isn't any more silly that getting something shiny to collect dust on your mantlepiece and get thrown out by your grandchildren.
