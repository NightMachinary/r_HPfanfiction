Random thought, Why would Hogwarts keep a "Special Award for Service" in the trophy room in the first place?

I would imagine an external award or something like a Quidditch tournament Hogwarts won against Beauxbatons would be a good candidate for the trophy room. An award Hogwarts gives to a specific student for a task like this would be for the student to keep, not for the trophy room.
