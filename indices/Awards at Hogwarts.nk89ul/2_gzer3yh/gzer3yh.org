I honestly assumed that we just didn't see it because Harry didn't care about it but I assume that quiditch cup winners are listed there as well as academic awards which again of the trio only hermione would have cared about them so were again not mentioned

one idea I had was that the reason we dont see rewards being given out for academic achievements or other such awards that weren't up to the discretion of the headmaster (COS) was that they required a consensus from all four heads of houses and snape was petty enough to not allow anyone not from slytherin to get it and that by the time canon started people had just stopped trying to get them
