Well, I might suggest that a boy cornering a girl to shame her about her "clit," isn't a K+ rating. That is a very specific sort of scenario that some readers seem to like; you do allude to something sexual happening in your summary, so it isn't like you are giving no warning. But you might get more of an audience who seeks out this specific motif if you are clearer in both your summary and your rating.
