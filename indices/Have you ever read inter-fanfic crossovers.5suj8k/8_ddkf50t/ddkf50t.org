Oh! I remember one which is over 10 years old by now ( have I really been reading Harry Potter fan fics so long?).

linkffn(Complicated by Neurotica) is a cross over story of the Dangerverse by Whydoyouneedtoknow and Neurotica's Truth's Universe.

Also, whydoyouneedtoknow also wrote a cross over story between those two universes. linkffn(Dangerous Truths by whydoyouneedtoknow) .
