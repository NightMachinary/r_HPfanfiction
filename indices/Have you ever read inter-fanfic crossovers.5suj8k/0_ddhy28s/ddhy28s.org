Well if you're familiar with the Spacebattles & Sufficient Velocity websites, there is a whole craze about Planetary Annihilation/Multicross Self-Insert fanfics where the author inserts themselves into the body of a Von-Neumann type machine called a "Commander" and goes traipsing about the multiverse (Warhammer, Halo, Stargate and a helluva more) fucking shit up. It was started by Drich, and taken up by others like Tiki Tau, Torroar, Fusou, Faith. Now the above five basically have the largest and oldest fanfics of this type, and are pretty famous for them, and they've gotten together, and have started merging their stories into one storyline (each of them has like a hundred chapters written; Drich has like 200-300). So your idea of merging with a friend definitely wouldn't be unique, or even close to a big project, but it could turn out great. I'd say go for it. I can't link you since I'm on my phone, but just Google something along the lines of "PA multicross SI." You'll get a fuckload of fanfics and the trick is separating the crap from the gold. Have fun, and good luck with your story :)
