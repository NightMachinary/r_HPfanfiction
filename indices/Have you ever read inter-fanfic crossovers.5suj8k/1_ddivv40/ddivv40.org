Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]]'s works. She writes a good number of stories and has written crossovers between her different stories. The crossovers are noted in the summary, so they should be easy enough to find.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge][Copperbadge]] has also written crossovers using [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47][scifigrl47]]'s Marvel OC character DJ with his own Izzyverse (another Marvel OC). They're the last two fics of [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/141054][The Izzy Chronicles]]. You can find DJ in the series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/18990][Tales of the Bots]].
