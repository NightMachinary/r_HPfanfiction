Oh! In "Unbuttoned" by lastcrazyhorn a version of Snape from another fic appears to give this Snape advice, (at least, I think it was Unbuttoned? I know it was one of lastcrazyhorn's fics). I've also seen a fic special she wrote for Snape's birthday that featured every Harry from her fics coming to celebrate.
