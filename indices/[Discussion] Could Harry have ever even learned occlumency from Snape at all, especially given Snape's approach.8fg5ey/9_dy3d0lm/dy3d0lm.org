I think it depends on if we decide if Snape was trying to teach him or not. If not: then he was probaly harming him, or atleast opening his mind more.

If he was; we can guess that repeated attacks might teach the mind to defend against intrusions like a knee-jerk reaction, as a quick automatic way to escape visions. -this is most likely very basic defense as volde using legilimens on snape with automatic defence of kicking volde out would probaly get snape killed.\\
Therefore snape have to have a defence that is not reactionary. Harry is not taught this, so harry will not be able to defend from others.

Or: repeated attacks will make the brain create shields and/or train the brain to better push out attacks, but nothing else.

Depends, what is occlumency? Shields? Misdirection? Mindscape?
