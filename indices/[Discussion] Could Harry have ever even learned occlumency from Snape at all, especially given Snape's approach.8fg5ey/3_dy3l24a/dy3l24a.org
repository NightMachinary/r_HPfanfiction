There was a thread on Occlumency recently with a lot of good headcanons proposed ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/89zk7h/thoughts_on_occlumency/]]). I have a somewhat dark take on the Occlumency, in that if the training doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong. This is because what the attacker can send at you is only limited by their own imagination and squeamishness, and if you aren't ready to shrug off the worst of it, they'll get through.
