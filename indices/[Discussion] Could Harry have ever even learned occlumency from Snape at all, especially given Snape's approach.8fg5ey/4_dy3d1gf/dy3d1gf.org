My personal headcanon is that it would never have been possible. That is, Harry could have mastered clearing his mind and whatnot, but given that the connection was a soul piece stuck in Harry's head, the attacks came from within - it was not an external influence, but an internal one. Had Harry not casted /Sirius' Greater Grief Shield/, I think Voldemort would have slowly gained more and more access to Harry's mind, eventually using the connection to either drive Harry insane or to subvert his actions.

I just think of Snape and Dumbledore in a floccinaucinihilipilificationa comic, with Dumbledore going "Just teach him occlumency or whatever"
