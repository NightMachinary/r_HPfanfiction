Harry was letting Snape into his mind, a very vulnerable place that was already somewhat damaged from Voldemort's visions. Snape does not like Harry, and even if he wanted to help, which I doubt he did all that much, that instinctive dislike would have tainted his efforts. Trust and neutrality would be needed for best effect. Snape teaching Harry would be like using a rusty nail and barbed wire to sew a wound closed. Yeah, you might get there in the end, but it's prone to infection and probably hurt more than the wound itself did.
