According to JKR, the issue was Occlumency clashed too much with Harry's character, unlike with Malfoy's ability to pick it up easier.

  "...I think Draco would be very gifted in Occlumency, unlike Harry. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories.

I'd also say that having Snape be his teacher made it definitely impossible. Even if Harry would otherwise want to learn it, he and Snape's mutual hatred of each other just resulted in inevitable failure. From the beginning, Snape's explanation to others was Harry was in remedial potions, and he clearly took more pleasure in breaking into Harry's mind (and Harry's dislike of learning from Snape) would obviously not work, just look at their relationship in Potions class.
