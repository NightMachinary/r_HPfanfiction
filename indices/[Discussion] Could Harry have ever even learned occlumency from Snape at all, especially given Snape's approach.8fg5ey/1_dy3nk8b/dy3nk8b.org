Harry was not in a good head space during OotP for a number of reasons - Dumbledore was ignoring him, Cedric had just died in front of him, Umbridge was at Hogwarts and literally torturing him every night, the Wizarding World thought he was an attention seeking liar and he was worried about Sirius all alone at Grimmauld Place. Oh Yeah and EXAMS No wonder he couldn't clear his mind - he might have been able to do better had he not had so many external stressors (IIRC Snape wasn't too horrible to Harry during their lessons - snarky yes - he even gave Harry a back handed compliment when he managed to break into Snapes mind).
