I'm not even sure Harry actually wanted to learn it. I mean yes, they told him he should, but for him he just saved Arthur's life, Voldemort's visions were something he could use to protect his loved ones and to find and destroy Voldemort. + yeah Snape approach not being exactly what it takes to make a student really wanting to learn...
