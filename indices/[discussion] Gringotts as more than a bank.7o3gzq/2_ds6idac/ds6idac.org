In my opinion part of why they write it as more is because its easy. We know little about it so you're not 'wrong' if you write it doing these other things. You might not be right but canon doesn't say explicitly that these things don't happen. I'd sigh if I read it but I wouldn't move on like I might if Wizards don't need wands or something else that is both unnecessary and contradictory to canon.

A big question mark is what else do goblins do and where the bloody hell are they? Do they really just have a bank and their entire species is there grumbling away at helping humans? We know they have rebelled but otherwise we know so little about them and perhaps most importantly we don't see them outside of Gringots context that surely there has to be something else going on?
