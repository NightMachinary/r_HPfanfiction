  I mean, if professor Binns succeeds in passing Umbridge's audit of his classes, his negative portrayal of Goblins, constantly talking about the Goblin rebellions, must be ministry approved.

Dunno. Maybe it is, maybe it's not; I don't think him passing Umbridge's test is really definitive, because he doesn't /only/ talk about Goblin Rebellions; it's just as likely (and rather funnier) to imagine Umbridge came in while he was droning on about the minutiae of the youth of Ulric the Oddball, was bored out of her skull, found nothing Ministry-objectionable to what little she heard, and decided to quickly move on without hearing any more.
