I do agree, it's easy, but I just always find it so implausible, generally i find we know so little about goblins that they're easily mischaracterised.

I do wish we knew more about them, as Gringotts being a gathering place for all of them just doesn't seem right. In Fantastic Beasts we see goblins working a bar and the wiki says one works as a bell boy for MACUSA, so clearly they don't only employ themselves at Gringotts or at least they don't do so in the US.

Then there must also be some form of goblin leadership, since they communicate to the MoM through the Goblin liaison Office. Of course, there is also the possibility the MoM tries to restrict or organise the Goblin's leadership so as to prevent further Goblin Rebellions, seeing as they seem to have a fairly negative and controlling relationship with Goblins. I mean, if professor Binns succeeds in passing Umbridge's audit of his classes, his negative portrayal of Goblins, constantly talking about the Goblin rebellions, must be ministry approved.

Ah man, it's all a really interesting topic and just supposing that all Goblins live in Gringotts and that it serves as more than a bank seems simplistic and unlikely.
