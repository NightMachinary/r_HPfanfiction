I have no problem with the Gringotts being more than a bank, but most people just go overboard. Ancestry office - it would make sense for Gringotts to have one for inheritance purposes but it would alos make sense for this to be in the ministry. Rituals- hmmm, this one stretches things a bit. Purchasing basic things for the main character and doing all sorts of other itty bitty jobs - this is just silly. Fascilitating the purchasng of Property and other high value items - can see this happening. Etc.
