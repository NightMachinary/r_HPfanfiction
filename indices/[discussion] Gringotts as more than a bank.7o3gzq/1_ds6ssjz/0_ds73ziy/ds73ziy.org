Yes, estate planning -> inheritance dept -> ancestry rituals kind of makes sense. And investments -> real estate -> warding (to protect your investment). And even, interfacing with muggle banks -> providing muggle IDs (since purebloods presumably don't have a muggle birth certificate to get legit ID).

But the special portkeys, and non-real estate shopping, and healing are all kind of odd, no relation to finances at all.
