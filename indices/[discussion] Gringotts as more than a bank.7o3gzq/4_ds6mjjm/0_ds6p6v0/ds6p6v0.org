There was the group of goblin creditors who followed Ludo Bagman around at the Quidditch World Cup, and then at Hogwarts.

Only seeing goblins at Gringotts otherwise is just a consequence of seeing the story through Harry's POV. The only public places for wizards that he ever really visits are Diagon Alley and Hogwarts/Hogsmeade.

It's not unreasonable to assume that the goblins have other premises to sell various goods and services, it's almost certainly more that Harry never had a need to visit one of those places, so we never see it.
