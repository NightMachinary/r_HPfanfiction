The goblin nation can do a multitude of things for you, and goblins seem to be restricted to Gringotts in canon. (We only ever see one goblin outside, right? And they were kidnapped by Voldemort.)

So you can't go to Thraknash's Enchanting Emporium in Hogsmeade; if you want something that Thraknash enchanted, you have to go to Gringotts. Meanwhile, the goblins want as many customers as possible (capitalism ho!), especially foreign ones because they seem a mercantilist sort, so I'd expect them to offer as many services as they can. For a hefty fee.
