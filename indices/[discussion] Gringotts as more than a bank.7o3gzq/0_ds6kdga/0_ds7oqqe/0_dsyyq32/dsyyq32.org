The problem isn't so much that Gringotts does more than just storing money. Private banks in the real world will do more than that as well.

What is unlikely is that they do all those services themselves. It would be far more likely if they would contact Lawyers for you and stuff like that. Another problem is the fact that for some reason wizards in those fics enthrust them with litteraly every important service while Goblins and wizards ar not exactly friendly.

The biggest problem i think is more that Gringotts is presented more as some sort of super entity where all Harry's problems get solved in one go. He enters the bank and when he exists it he is in total mary sue mode controlling the world
