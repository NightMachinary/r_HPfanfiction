I came here to post this very thing. It is clear from this alone, along with the whole "will reading" aspects of canon, that Gringotts is NOT just a bank. Goblins also clearly do other odd jobs, hunt for treasure and information, and serve as guardians and executioners of wills and other legal documentation.

It's only logical to ALSO imagine that they (Gringotts and the goblins) serve as some sort of investment and financial transfer system as well, which also happens to be a discussion that was recently had on this subreddit. The wizarding world would not be able to function as canon describes without such a system.

Now... the jump into magical aspects might be a bit of a leap, but if they have to deal with wills, it only makes sense they can test inheritance of some sort. And if they are utilizing curse breakers, it also would not be a surprise if they don't just use them for tombs but also for objects and perhaps even individuals willing to pay. This means its also not outside the realm of possibility that one might use Gringotts to have other magical issues fixed (as you said, magical blocks).

The point is, Gringotts is definitely more than just a storage repository and bank for Wizarding gold. They clearly do much more than that going by both aspects of Canon, AND logical conclusions drawn from the canon world and how it functions. Where you draw the line on what they are capable of is the real question.

*Edit:* I personally don't really have a problem with it going much further into things like rituals, provided the fic does its job and provides some background and detail to the matter.
