There aren't many, not really, Basilisk Eyes (already recommended) portrays the disability well. But it's so slow and focused on the various disabilities of the characters, that it's a slog to go through.

This one Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor linkffn(6554218) is way more concise and written with true understanding of what blindness would entail. It's not great, it aged a bit and it lacks knowledge of canon, but as far as a blind character portrayal, I think it's best.
