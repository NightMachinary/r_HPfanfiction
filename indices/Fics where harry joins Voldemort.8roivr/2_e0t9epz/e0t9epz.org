If you also included Harry joining Voldemort because he was raised by him, then also check out the Dark Prince trilogy, and A Shattered Prophecy.

neither of them are, exactly, well-written in terms of language, pacing etc, but the plot is quite interesting and they're also classics of the LV raises HP trope.
