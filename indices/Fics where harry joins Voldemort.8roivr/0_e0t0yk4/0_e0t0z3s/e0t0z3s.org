  Tom Riddle has been trapped in a diary for 50 years and now that he is out, he has a lot of work to do. Harry learns a new prophecy that will change his path forever. It is up to Severus Snape and Hermione Granger to find a way to save the kidnapped boy-who-lived, but is Snape even really trying? Meanwhile, Remus Lupin is out of a job and living with a new pack. Can Sirius convince him he isn't an evil kidnapping murderer? (Harry didn't defeat Riddle in the second year. Sirius Black really was a death eater and manages to capture Harry in the third year. Dark Harry, Dark Sirius TR/HP, RL/SB)

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  One night, Harry Potter had suddenly gone berserk, savagely killing nearly the entire Order, but leaving only a certain brown-haired bookworm alive. Despite the past, he joins Voldemort, eventually becoming his right hand. Revenge is what motivates him, obsession is what controls him, and despair is what haunts him. Hermione seems to be his prisoner, until she becomes so much more.

  After being raised in an orphanage, Harry Potter is visited by his new headmaster and brought into the world of magic. How will an abused Harry fare in this new world? Slytherin!Harry, Dark!Harry, limited bashing. Sequel is up! HP and Salazar's Legacy

  Two-shot. AU of POA - Snape got his way and Sirius was kissed. Dumbledore wouldn't rid the world of his pet, but if Voldemort would, then Harry would be happy to do anything the Dark Lord asked of him. Beginnings of HP/LV.
