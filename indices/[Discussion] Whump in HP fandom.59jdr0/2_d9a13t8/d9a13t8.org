HP is about a bunch of teenagers trying to live their lives under growing oppression, whereas most whump!fics are about adults (usually with a support system) being ground down by circumstances until the bare bones of who they are is showing.

If Ginny Weasley had been ten years older, her situation in COS would have been prime whumpage material. However, she's 11, so her recovery from being mind controlled into a serial killer is just horrifying because she's a child.
