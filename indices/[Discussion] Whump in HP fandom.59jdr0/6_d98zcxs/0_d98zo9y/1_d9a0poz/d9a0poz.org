Rigel/Harriet has specific goals & is willing to put up with shit to achieve them. I think it took until the third year climax for her to draw a line in the sand and decide that her goal to attend Hogwarts and impersonate her cousin is less important than keeping the bad guy from getting ahold of her magic and becoming a Big Badâ„¢. CanonHarry just wants to be normal and loved, so dumping stuff on him feels cruel to me.
