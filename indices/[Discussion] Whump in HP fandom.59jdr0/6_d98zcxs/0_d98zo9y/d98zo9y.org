Yeah, I'm generally only occasionally into it, but I was thinking about how the Pureblood Pretense is pretty much the only time I actually really enjoy seeing whump. I know what traits that character had that made whumping her interesting, but I can't quite put a finger on what traits canon!Harry doesn't have that makes him not very fun to whump. Or any of the characters, really. I can't tell what's missing.
