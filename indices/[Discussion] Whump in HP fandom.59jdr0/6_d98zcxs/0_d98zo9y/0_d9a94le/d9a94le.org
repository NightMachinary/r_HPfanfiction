It might be that hurt/comfort is kinda done a lot anyway. Just not in large enough quantities to be considered whump? Like reactions to his abuse at the Dursleys, losing Sirius + Dobby + Hedwig + all those other people. In fact, a lot of that is in the books as well. I think it might be because most people already feel sorry/sympathetic for Harry, there's no need to use whump to make him sympathetic.
