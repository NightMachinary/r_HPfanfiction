I only ever heard the term used in the Stargate SG1 fandom around the turn of the century and not anywhere else, so I'm a bit surprised about you bringing it up here or that it still exists today, for that matter.

That said, there are a number of darker HP stories that would fit the theme, but the fandom never went so far as to get organized about the topic. In my opinion that's a good thing, because Stargate was a military-themed scifi show, while HP is a children's or young-adult series with a very different target audience both in their original and the fandoms.
