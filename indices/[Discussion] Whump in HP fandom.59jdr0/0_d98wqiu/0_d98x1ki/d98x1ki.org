Whump is basically when a character gets hurt a lot, and usually there are looks into other people's reactions to it. It's kind of hard to explain.

Whumpage is the act of the character being hurt (e.g. this fic contains excessive whumpage). There's Xwhump where X is the character getting hurt. Sometimes it's accidents, or getting tortured by an enemy, or getting seriously ill.

It might be an older term that's not used as often any more, but I might be thinking that simply because in the past couple years I've read primarily HP fan fiction, where the term isn't really used at all.
