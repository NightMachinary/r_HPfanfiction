I hate it it - why? Because if your plot is actually "X got hurt and how people deal with it" then your fiction is probably going to be pretty boring (note: I've got no problem with characters getting hurt if you have a decent plot - but without that it's just "let's screw character x over, that's going to be fun" and it's not fun for me!)
