I...have never heard this term before. Does what happens to Snape in linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood) count:

  "Well," Snape said to himself. "At least things can't get any worse." As if fate had been challenged to prove him wrong, the oily man felt a what seemed to be a tentacle caress his shoulder. "Oh bugger... no... no wait, that wasn't an invitation... NOOOOOOOOOO."

Just one of many "comical" things that happen to Snape in that fic, many, many times. The fic overall is pretty good, but the Snape torture is it's worst aspect by far. It's not funny, clever, or well-written.
