I found some parts of the story amusing [[/spoiler][like the Dark Lord Ron, him being the one who gets a harem for a change, and Harry and Hermione deciding to take up a life of crime]], but the whole "rape is hilarious!" thing is just gross. The story line with [[/spoiler][Dean being repeatedly assaulted]] fell into this category for me too.
