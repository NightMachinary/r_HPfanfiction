Quite presumtuous of you to call other people idiots.

Still - why does it NEED a scientific explanation?

It's "magic" for crying out loud - could be that magicals control whatever made the Big Bang happen!

Note: However - if you use a scientific explanation for a fan-fiction than that's fine! Other people use stuff like "magical-cores" (not canon if I remember this right!) and building elaborate defenses the mimick real life structures for occlumency etc., so if it works for your fanfiction and adds to the story? Why not!
