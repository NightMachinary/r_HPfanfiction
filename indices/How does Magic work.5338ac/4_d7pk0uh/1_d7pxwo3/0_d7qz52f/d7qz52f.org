To be fair, though, looking at OP's comments here I think at least some of the people who downvoted the whole post did it after looking at those and deciding that this post is a pointless piece of excrement and thus should be downvoted due to not having value.

I mean, opinions go in many ways, but when someone asks for theories and then, when someone gives them a theory, immediately go for “You clearly don't understand” and “[I] wanted to see if people [...] were smart enough”, it's bound to make people think of it and thus treat it as a trolling attempt.

Because seriously, that's arrogant as ... fjord, and people aren't going to be lenient in their judgment when judging someone who'd shown themselves to be full of themselves for seemingly no reason.
