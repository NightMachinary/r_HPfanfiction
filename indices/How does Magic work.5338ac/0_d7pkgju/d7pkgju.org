Given the proven existence of a soul in HP-verse, my interpretation is based on the allegory of the cave : we are souls, tied in our bodies while alive; the physical world is but the shadows one can see, and magic users are those whose hands are free to make a shadow play.

Searching for a "scientific" explanation to magic (something that is never done in canon), is in my mind an error, for two reasons; on one side, a scientific explanation takes the magic out of the magic (you can create a laughing gas? great, so can I, I just need a chem lab); on the other, the fact that the magical world is still hidden around 2017 (epilogue) means that satellites cannot see Hogwarts, that not a single city planner find weird the hole in London where Diagon alley is, the existence of the fidelius means that information can be manipulated on a global scale (and without caring for distance nor specie). Magic does not manipulates probabilities nor matter, it manipulates reality and/or the perception of reality.
