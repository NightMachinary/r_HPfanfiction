You clearly don't understand what I ment with probability. Quantum Probability works perfectly with this- The fidelus charm for example. It changes the probability of everyone forgetting where the location is, with the exception of a few people. For satellites, the probability of them not being able to see it increases. However, I do thank you for actually responding without idiotic ramblings of science "Blowing up" when magic is near.
