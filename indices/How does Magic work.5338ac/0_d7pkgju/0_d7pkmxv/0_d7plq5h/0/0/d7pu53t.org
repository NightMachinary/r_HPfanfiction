I think your missing his point. He's pointing out that HP canon allows for the existence of souls (or at least some persistence of the human consciousness after death). Therefore any theories must allow for that.

Now, blending the quantum mechanics theory with multiple dimensions (spatial, not Multiverse or Parallel dimensions) could allow for something plausible.

Say that the wizard condition allows access to a higher dimension(s), and manipulation of energy or probability states in this higher dimension might trickle down to the 4-space we occupy normally.

Now perhaps continuous access to this dimensional plane leaves a residual energy imprint, which can allow (or cause) a persistence when death is cause by a traumatic event.

As for something like time travel, again, if time and space are the lower four dimensions, perhaps translation in the upper dimensions can cause a displacement only in the temporal dimension.

I can understand the gp post's sentiment regarding the wonder of magic, but I feel that a scientific explanation can be equally amazing and wondrous, but maybe I'm biased as an engineer with physics background. The very nature of our universe is so amazingly complex and elegant, it has a magic of its very own.
