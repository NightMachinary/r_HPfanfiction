I think it has absolutely nothing to do with science. Why does more advanced technology fail around highly magical areas? Magic doesn't give a shit about the rules, and the highly literal nature of muggle science/technology can't handle it, and so stops working. I don't think it blows up, burns up, whatever. Just fucking stops.
