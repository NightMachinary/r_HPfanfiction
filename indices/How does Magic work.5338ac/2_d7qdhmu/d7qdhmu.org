Magic works by way of magic. But if you want to be nitpicky, HP magic is based on concepts and symbols.

The Shield Charm isn't a manifestation of a particularly shaped arrangement of carbon nanotubes that stops things from getting through, it manifests the concept of protection. The Levitation Charm has nothing to do with atomic numbers, it simply makes things fly. Why? Because. Because it's magic. It's unexplainable. We can derive Rules of Magic, but that's it. Magic isn't implied to be some cosmic force, the SW Force, or some yet undiscovered scientific phenomenon that wizards can manipulate. The dictionary definition of magic would be "it's magic".
