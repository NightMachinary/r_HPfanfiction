If you are ever in doubt for a "monster-of-the-week" plot, there is nothing like some good old-fashioned globe trotting. Send Dumbledore and Riddle too Egypt, or Russia, or Paris, or America, and interact with the wizarding cultures and villains there. Both Riddle and Dumbledore would, I imagine, be very interested in these cultures academically speaking. And there's loads of interesting UFO sightings in the '50s and '60s that they can investigate/be responsible for.

We know that Riddle was interested in the Founder's Artefacts, and you could with a stretch extend that to magical items in general. Tom Marvolo Riddle and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, as it were.
