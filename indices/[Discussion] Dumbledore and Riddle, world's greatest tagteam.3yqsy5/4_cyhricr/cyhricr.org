This idea reminds me of Rectifier, actually. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/]]

It sounds great! It might be interesting to see Tom's reaction to the hippie movement in the 60s/70s. Or the development of Communism in China (PRC started 1949) and how that affected Chinese wizardry. And yes, I'd recommend globetrotting, but possibly also an in-depth examination of other magical schools. Tom did want to be the DADA professor eventually, after all. He could amass tips from other schools to help him in his hypothetical professorial retirement.

Tom was highly ambitious and saw the magical world as a refuge from non-magical people, so Muggle/Wizard relations would probably be something he'd be interested in. Best of luck!
