I think a few good scenes can tell a lot of important parts of the story - think Big D's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]]. Tells us everything we need to know about the character, hints at a lot of other shit, and leaves us wanted a lot more. Done right, it's great.

Now, the important thing about a story like this is choosing the right scenes and making believable jumps from the characters we have established - Dumbledore (if you're changing him at all), teenage Tom Riddle from the scenes we have of him (Diary and Slughorn memories), and Voldemort. You want to take the jumping off point you know, Tom Riddle, and avoid the direction you know he's going by throwing a few particular curveballs, so they'd better be big ones. A few conversations with Dumbledore, who he already hates, aren't going to do it.

Done right, this could be cool. I posted a one-shot a while back about an alternate universe "good" Tom Riddle who teams up with Dumbledore and Harry to stop Voldemort. Feel free to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900724/2/Seven-Deadly-Drabbles][read it]].
