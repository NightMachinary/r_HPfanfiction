  A few conversations with Dumbledore, who he already hates, aren't going to do it.

My fic's changes start from when he was left at the orphanage; one of the most important ones is that since his Gaunt heritage is fairly public knowledge he can't go Heir of Slytherin on everyone's asses (that would be, like, just dumb). So he's still fairly stable - he hasn't made the diary horcrux - and while he's wary of Dumbledore's power and wants to one-up him he doesn't yet have reason to be flat-out paranoid of him. His plans are still "get close to him, learn his secrets, ???, profit", not "oh my God oh my God he knows everything kill him kill him /now/"

Excuse me while I shovel all your ideas into my bag and sprint away :D A big part of my timeskip troubles is that I need to bridge not just Tom and Dumbledore, but also the rest of magical Britain without the threat of Voldemort hanging over them. Young, okay-she's-insane-but-she-doesn't-have-an-absolutely-horrific-outlet Bellatrix is a joy to write; the whole Black family in fact. Sirius actually ends up in Slytherin :O
