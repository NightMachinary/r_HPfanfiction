Which pushes him to walk the path of the second Peverell brother, not the first (ironically fitting, since his family heirloom is the Resurrection Stone after all). And his reasons for doing it would be a fascinating mystery; because he feels he owns her/wants to keep her by his side, or because he thinks she should have a proper shot at a full life? Would he end the spell/ritual if she no longer wanted to be with him? At the very least it shows he does value human companionship.

He definitely wouldn't kill himself to follow her though. That would just be /strange/.
