30 years of character development via a highlights reel? Well, off the top of my head...

If Tom is still /Tom/ then he'd have some sort of grand aspirations, even if they aren't to rule the world. He's got to have /something/ he's working towards.

Dumbledore meanwhile, is struggling with either gearing up to join the war against his old [friend or lover - depending on how much focus you want to shine on them] Gellert or dealing with the emotional of having just done that. As a wizard at 64 though, Dumbledore is in his prime, not pushing the limits of retirement he can be far more active in his pursuits.

Working together? They both have a love of magic and pushing boundaries. I could easily see one subplot starting with Tom walking into Albus's office and asking a "simple" question. Think the scene with Slughorn but instead of horcruxes maybe something about time turners or any of a number of other ideas that in the end, just doesn't pan out the way they wanted. Perhaps they wind up with some new piece of information but not the one they wanted (penicillin was an accidental discovery IIRC)

Alternatively, either of them could be working on some political deal that forces one or the other to attend some manner of get together where Tom meets a girl. In canon, one of his defining traits is that he was literally INCAPABLE (according to Dumbledore) of feeling/experiencing love, so simply demonstrating that he has that capacity, even if you gloss over them courting and then breaking up entirely off screen, would indicate a great deal of change from canon Tom.
