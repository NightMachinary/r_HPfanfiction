I've been thinking about everything you guys said and I sort of narrowed the advice down to three points:

- Something big: Tom has great ambitions, after all

- Something challenging: stakes have to be high enough for Dumbledore to leave Hogwarts

- Something moving: has to be enough to drag out Tom's emotions, and have him make choices based on them

- Something out of Britain: It's canon that Tom left the country, and even though he's changed here there really is no reason why he wouldn't still leave. And from Dumbledore's story a world tour is kind of traditional? Plus exploring other magical communities is fun

- Something Muggle-related between '45 and '73.

- Something morbid, because I'm evil.

So at the end of the day one plot bunny woke up early and I've decided Tom is going to travel through East and Southeast Asia, looking for alternatives to horcrux-style immortality, but then he finds out that (/gasp/) the Muggles' nuclear weapons wiped out an entire magical community in Japan. And what's worse, the radiation is causing some weird effects in witches and wizards, and the Ministries have been keeping it a secret from their citizens. Oh noes! He's /furious/! There's a rebel faction that's furious right along with him! Kill all the Muggles! The International Statute of Secrecy is about to collapse! Dumbledore has to stop him!

...or something like that.
