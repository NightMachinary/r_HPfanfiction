So uhhhhhh... if you need a beta or whatever I'd totally be willing to read your fic... and uhhhh recommend stuff! Yeah, no ulterior motives. Just looking to help.

In all seriousness, I am a half-way decent proofreader for grammar, overall sentence/paragraph structure, and word usage. I'd be more than willing to assist if you need it. Also, your story sounds really fun and I look forward to reading it whenever you decide to post it.
