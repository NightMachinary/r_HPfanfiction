As someone who loves reading OCs (specially if the OC has a major role on the story) I think that a well-written OC, besides being a well thought character with a realistic personality and background history, needs to add-on with something unique to your fic. What I mean is... We don't need another bookworm girl who is super intelligent and get all answers correctly. We already have Hermione, who already does this job brilliantly. Why instead don't portrait a pure-blood girl who is having all her old values shaken?

And then you guys will ask me: Wouldn't be better to use Daphne instead? Well, I personally would find that much less attractive, even that character being almost an OC by all means. I much prefer a blank slate character that you could make it be Draco's sister, Bellatrix's daughter, Harry's half-sister from James secret mistress...

I know that unfortunately these tastes of mine are not very popular, because not only there are not many good OCs fanfics around, but I think that the fandom demonizes OCs so much, that some authors might be intimated by that and make then even more rare.
