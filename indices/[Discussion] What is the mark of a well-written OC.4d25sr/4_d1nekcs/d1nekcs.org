The key to a good OC is that you have an actual reason for it being in the story. It's not just "I have this cool idea for a character."

No. Unless the story is entirely impossible to do without the OC, keep it out of the story. This is Harry Potter FANFICTION and there is very rarely any point in adding OCs.

Aside from that, all the stuff that makes a well-rounded character. Goals, aspirations, fears, loss, flaws.
