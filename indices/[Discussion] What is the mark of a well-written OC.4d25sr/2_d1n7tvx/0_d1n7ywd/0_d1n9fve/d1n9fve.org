Even the Triwizard Tournament was pretty much a giant visiting student program. Rowling doesn't show it because Harry has no reason to see it, but the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang contingents /probably/ didn't just miss out on nearly a year's worth of classes and their final year at that. Many of them likely had to take NEWTs or the equivalent after the tournament.
