Besides the points already mentioned, I have to feel the OC has a history. It could be mentioned briefly (like 'a small scar on her chin from trying to fly her dad's broom') or existent in her personality (Lily tried teaching her to play nice, but James made her his partner in crime). Following along from that, her past has to link to her future. (James realized he taught her jokes but didn't teach her not to go too far.) History makes a character feel real and not like they were born on the first page of the fic.

Another thing to remember is that 'this character is like their parents' is not a good enough motivation. Harry is not exactly like either of his parents, even if you merged them together. His history and his interactions made him someone unique. When it's children of established character, people tend to do that. When they're not self-inserts, they're still a flat copy of their parents.
