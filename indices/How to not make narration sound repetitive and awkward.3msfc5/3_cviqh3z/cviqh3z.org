I prefer to use pronouns, or say "witch or wizard", or put witch/wixard into a noun group eg. "the green eyed wizard" - but use these descriptions sparingly. With narration, trying breaking it up by having the beginning of your sentences start with something other than a character's name/pronoun/description.

Examples:

"Looking around the room nervously, Harry then whispered..."

"There was a pause before Hermione began to speak..."

Also, when writing dialogue, once you've done the initial "he said/she replied", you don't need dialogue markers to indicate who is speaking.

Example:

"What do you mean it's a horcrux?" Harry asked, dumbfounded.

Hermione sighed before replying. "It's obvious, isn't it?"

"No, not really."

"Oh, for goodness sake! I am I the only person in the world to have read Hogwarts: A History?"

I guess my main advice is to shake it up a little. Hope that helps a little!
