You make a valid argument. In retrospect, I may have made too many assumptions with my comment, and focused too much on my personal preferences without accounting for other perspectives.

I think if I had to specify a moment where I think a description goes overboard, it would be when it feels too much about itself, meaning that I walk away from it remembering the sentence more because of how intricately worded it was, rather than because of what the sentence was actually showing me. It isn't that I am completely against descriptions as a whole, but I am against trying to describe detail in such excess that the reader loses sense of what they're actually reading.

For third person limited, I like to follow a rule by which I only describe what the character is seeing, so if the character is in a circumstance in which they pay close attention to their surroundings, the level of detail increases, but if they're, say, running into a place they don't know, details are very sparse because they as characters would not be catching sight of these details in the middle of the action.

I do agree that my original comment was far from the best way to express this.

Ninja edit: On the topic of 'said' and 'asked', I also should have specified that I believe they should always be used, unless having another verb in their stead is absolutely necessary to express something that otherwise might have been unclear.
