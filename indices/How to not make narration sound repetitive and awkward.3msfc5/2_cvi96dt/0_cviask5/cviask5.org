  If you clutter the text with too much description, too much detail and overly verbose words, that only has the effect of taking the reader out of it.

  This means, no 'replied', no 'questioned', no 'responded', just 'said' and 'asked'. (...) Of course, there are situations where you might want to use those things, but the general flow of the narrative is in no way made smoother or easier to read if you don't fall into the habit of writing in a concise, simple and to the point fashion.

This is way too restrictive and assumes that we all want to read (and write) plain, direct prose. Epithets are a novice's error, except when consciously used for effect, and no, I wouldn't endorse them. But dialogue tags ought to allow for /some/ variety beyond 'said' and 'asked.' No need to lay it on thick, I don't mean that, but the constant harping on 'said said said' is a modern affectation. I realize dialogue tags can be intrusive or redundant, but that's down to questions of skill, and basically you're telling authors to ignore a whole bunch of tools in the writer's box of tricks. How else can they learn if they don't try them out and reject or adopt them through trial and error?

I like description. I like to write it and I like to read it, and I've backbuttoned out of plenty of fics that bored the hell out of me because the prose was clear, flat, and lifeless, devoid of sensual impressions or sense of place or atmosphere. Easy to read, sure, I suppose you could call it that, but I'm not a beginning reader. I don't need to have the path cleared for me and all lyricism or variety removed in case I'm tempted to 'skip it.' Readers who skip are not very good readers, IMO. They want the bones and will happily leave the rest, and that's fine. I don't write for them, and I won't care about stories that strip everything to the skeleton for fear of making it too hard for distractible readers.

Let people have fun playing with language and learning what works and what doesn't on their own terms. Subtlety is not the same thing as removing all markers, invention, wordplay, lavish prose, and haunting and gorgeous description. There has to be a better way to advise writers to avoid, for example, detailing every article of clothing their MC wears or rhapsodizing over clich√©s about alabaster skin and viridian orbs without insisting that they all write to the same mass-produced 'transparent' standard.

Also, the point of your last line is somewhat obscured by the use of a double negative, but I think what you're implying is that simple and concise will fetch you more readers because it's so easy to read. If your goal as a writer is popularity, then have at it. But if you enjoy writing as an art or a way of exploring character or as emotional theater, go ahead and plunge into the deep end, don't just paddle in the shallows. In my experience, it's way more fun, even if you sometimes make a fool of yourself.
