I would say, try not to fall into the temptation of going for ambiguity over clarity and simplicity. It depends on who you ask, but I think that the general consensus in anything writing is that you should let it be a "seedling" of sorts which sparks the reader's imagination. If you try to forcefully tell the reader too much, it feels like a droning in the head; reading and categorizing information about the story rather than letting the mind run free.

Thing is, as a writer it's not as easy to realize this, because you might spend a few minutes on each sentence, worrying about how best to word it, but often a reader will "skip" over some words in the narrative, while still picking up the information they need. If you clutter the text with too much description, too much detail and overly verbose words, that only has the effect of taking the reader out of it.

This means, no 'replied', no 'questioned', no 'responded', just 'said' and 'asked'. No descriptors like 'the Boy-Who-Lived' or 'the bushy-haired witch', just 'Harry' and 'Hermione'. Of course, there are situations where you might want to use those things, but the general flow of the narrative is in no way made smoother or easier to read if you don't fall into the habit of writing in a concise, simple and to the point fashion.
