Use the name once per paragraph, but try not to bunch them all at the front every time.

Do NOT succumb to the urge to poeticize the person by calling them 'the Chosen One', 'the Slytherin Prince' or 'the happiest pair of Pillows in Hufflepuff' unless the viewpoint character is likely to call them that.
