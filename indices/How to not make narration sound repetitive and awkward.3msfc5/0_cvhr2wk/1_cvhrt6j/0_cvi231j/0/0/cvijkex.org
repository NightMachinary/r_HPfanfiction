Coal black eyes, how could I forget! That thread also had a lusciously disturbing discussion about orbs if I remember correctly...

 

Recently read this fic linkffn(Never Let Me Go by merrygolds) wherein /orbs/ is used 4 times in 3 chapters. My favorite is /electric orbs/ in chapter 1. The innovation of electrified facial orbs is a great leap forward in the field of unintentional body horror literature.
