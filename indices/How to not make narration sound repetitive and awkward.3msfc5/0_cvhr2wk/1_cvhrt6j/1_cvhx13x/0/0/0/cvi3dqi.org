It's really silly to never use a style of writing. In most cases it will not be appropriate, but to make a stupid rule about descriptions based off of inexperienced writers is not appropriate either. Steven King uses them, and so does JR Tolkien. I'm not saying your average writer is either of those two, but pointlessly limiting yourself doesn't make you a better writer. It may make you slightly popular on the DLP forums though.
