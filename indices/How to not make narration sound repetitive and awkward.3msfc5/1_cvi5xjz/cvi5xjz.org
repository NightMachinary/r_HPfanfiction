Here's my opinion: Do not repeat the name unless necessary, always prefer synonyms. Not ridiculous ones, you're not a 18th century writer wanting to imitate Homer... use logical ones. (try to use neutral one "his friend" "the other" rather than "the brunette" or "the ginger") Here's how I do it: -pick a "main character" of your paragraph, always the POV if possible, if not the more active one. this one is HE (or she). For the other characters use adjectives. -As my English teacher used to say only write "but", "and", "if", "or"... if you have no other choice

let me demonstrates with your example: "Harry said...he asked... and went to the store with Ron. He picked out oranges while his friend picked out apples. He then walked home and Ron ran.

when there are more people try to stay consistent : "his friend" must always be the same person for example, and in those situation you pretty much have to juggle with the pronouns (and you may have to repeat names here or there).
