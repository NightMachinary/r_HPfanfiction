  It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.

  When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all.

From those quotes, we can deduce that the tickets probably are checked, but it happens when the students arrive on the platform, not on the train. I'm guessing that it was just too small of a detail to bother mentioning. Or maybe the tickets are magically scanned or something.
