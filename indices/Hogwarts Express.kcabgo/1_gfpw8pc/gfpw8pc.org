When I lived in England and was poor (in the late 90s, early 2000s) I constantly rode the train without paying. Yes, you were technically required to have a ticket, but between some stops, I knew the chance of running into a ticket inspector was nil. So like the petty criminal I was, I planned out all my train journeys as shot hops, getting on and off at rural stops that were usually unmanned, especially after hours. 95% of the time, nobody checked the tickets. On the off chance they did, I pretended to be either drunk (depending on the hour) or a very guilty stupid young adult who was late for work/an appointment who KNEW she should have a ticket, but who barely had time to jump on the train, let alone wait in the queue for the ticket machine. (Being able to manufacture tears on command helped).

I have no idea if you'd still be able to get away with this today but at the time, it was eminently feasible.

Anyway, the point of this story is that /instead/ of sloppy world-building on JKR's part, I'm choosing to head canon it as a cash-strapped Harry realizing ticket enforcement was lax and saving his money.
