Well, if a chihuahua started barking and growling at a baby, it would obviously be a problem, but that doesn't mean that I have to punt the chihuahua clear across town. I just have to convince him that I'm a /much/ bigger and meaner dog than he is, and that'll be enough to get rid of the problem 98 times out of 100.
