Well, magic is all about intent, right? It's never explored, but maybe that includes the magic of magical creatures; we know from Fantastic Beasts that demiguises can choose to be visible or invisible. Dementors can choose who to suck on, even if they can't fully control their aura. Maybe the dragon didn't really want to hurt Cedric, just wanted to scare him.
