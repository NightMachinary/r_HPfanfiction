Rowling = Lockfart!\\
She gives Harry the 'GIFT' of Parseltongue and then fails to utilize the plot device in the rest of the books!! :p

One of the best utilizations of this ability is the late, Great Bobmin356's "The Queen Who Fell To Earth" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth]]

It's the 1st book in an HP/"Dragonriders of Pern" crossover series. Absolutely magnificent!

Unfortunately, Bob passed before he could complete the final arc. :( I still grieve his loss.
