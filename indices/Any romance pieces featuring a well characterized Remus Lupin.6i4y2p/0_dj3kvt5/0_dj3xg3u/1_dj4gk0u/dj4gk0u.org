If it helps, here is the complete summary:

/A post-DH AU in three parts. Even in the best of all possible worlds, happy endings aren't for everyone. Long after the Battle of Hogwarts ends, Lavender Brown must fight for her own happy ending. Remus Lupin will help her, because no one has ever needed him like this./

It does take place over the period of several decades and Lavender's growth is very realistic and true to her character. She's still the same Lavender underneath but her experience during the Battle of Hogwarts changed her.
