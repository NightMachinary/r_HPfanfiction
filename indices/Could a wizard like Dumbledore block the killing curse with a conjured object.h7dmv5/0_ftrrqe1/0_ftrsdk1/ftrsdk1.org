No, he uses stuff that's already around. (In the books, haven't seen the movie)

Still, the implication in canon is that a conjured object and a found object should be the same, so not only could he, but canon-level Harry could, too. Maybe conjuring would be too slow in most situations, so one could prepare a battlefield, but not conjure on the fly?
