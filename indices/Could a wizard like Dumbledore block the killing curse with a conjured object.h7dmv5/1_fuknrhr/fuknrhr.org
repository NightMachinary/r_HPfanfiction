I think it's up to the author.

On the one hand, physical objects are known to block the killing curse, if they are of the right kind of object (hint: clothes aren't).

However, we know that the nature of conjured objects is one of non-being and that they disappear after a period of time. Even if they are physically identical to objects whose fundamental nature is that of being, they are not magically identical, and that gives you latitude to do what you want.
