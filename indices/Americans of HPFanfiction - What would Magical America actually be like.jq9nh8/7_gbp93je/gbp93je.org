The two biggest problems with what J.K. Rowling's written about magical America are firstly, how she handled Native Americans; and secondly, her utter failure to say anything about slavery and the Civil War. As for the Scourers, you really have to ask yourself, what the hell was going on in the North American magical community prior to the Statute of Secrecy that had something like a third of the community willing to sell out the rest of them?

With slavery, I don't really see American magicals as slave-owners; anything a human slave can do, a house-elf can probably do better. On the other hand, before the Statute and Rappaport's Law I can totally see them as slave-/traders/, because a wizard who knows Aguamenti and can cast Expansion Charms can transport more slaves across the Middle Passage and deliver them alive on the docks of Kingston or Havana than a Muggle could. And God knows the demand for slaves on Caribbean plantations dwarfed that in the Thirteen Colonies; the average working life-span of a newly-arrived slave on a sugar plantation was around seven years before they died or were mutilated in a horrible fashion (snakes, machetes, grindstones, boiling cane syrup...)

In MACUSA proper, I suspect the authorities would have had to monitor the southern plantations for slave-born magicals, because leaving a magical child in slavery sure as hell sounds like an easy way to make an Obscurial.

With Native Americans, I can easily see a lot of tribal magicals trying to resist compliance with Rappaport's Law and the MACUSA authorities coming down on them like a ton of bricks. If the removal of those Native American witches and wizards makes it easier for their non-magical relatives to be driven off their lands, that would have been no skin off MACUSA's nose.
