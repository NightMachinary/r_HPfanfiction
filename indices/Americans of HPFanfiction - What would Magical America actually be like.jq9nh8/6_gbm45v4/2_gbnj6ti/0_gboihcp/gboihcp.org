First, I wouldn't imagine it as full on eugenics, more how they raised them. I.e raise them to be slaves. And I could see America back then doing it, America used to be kinda fucked up. But it could still be something the former slaves could come back from. Like they are still human and if they are broken out of the slave mentality they could become functioning members of society.

To the second thing. A little bit of both. They wouldn't have the resources and it would be associated with the rich.
