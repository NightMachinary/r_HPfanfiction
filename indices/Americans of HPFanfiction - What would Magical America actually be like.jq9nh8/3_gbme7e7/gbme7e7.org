quickly jotting things down, I'll try to edit this later

as always in hp stories there are two main approaches to depicting society; a satirization of the modern day with bits of folklore and a historical reconstruction more akin to alternate history. the first is what Rowling does, so that's what I'll start with.

in order to write satire, you first have to decide what aspects of society you want to focus on (this is your main question). different people will have different opinions on what's most important/appropriate, but I think there are a few things which stick out when we look at canon. JKR focuses mainly on nobility politics (doubling as a racism allegory), consumerism, and bureaucracy; as an american the first things that jump out to me are commodity worship, political theatre, and stubborn independence. there are lots of ways to then handle these ideas but one possibility could be to equate wealth with magical power and have political leaders selected via a wrestling-style cage match, with the audience voting on the winner. or there are less absurd options, lol.

in order to answer your question about how unified I think america would be, my answer is ‘not at all.'

for the alternate history perspective, as usual it would take research. america's current culture is far younger than most of europe's, so imo you would need to look at the influences separately. i.e. what did the americas look like before colonization -> what did europe look like when it was colonizing america -> how did the colonization merge or change the existing cultures. I'm not at all well-studied on first nations culture so don't know that I can say the best way to portray it but I think the best thing to keep in mind is the enormous amount of variety. america wasn't one unified nation before colonization, it was countless relatively small cultures which had been mingling for centuries. for specific ideas I usually read folk tales from the culture I'm studying.

if I had to pick a single approach for this sort of portrayal, I would prob make the country a bunch of distinct communities with only a loose overarching structure. this sort of gestures towards both the nature of tribes and states and provides a lot of options to expand on. if we keep population levels approximate to Rowling's, that could mean something like a few hundred towns ranging from a few dozen people to a few thousand people, scattered around the country.

kind of running out of steam here, but as a final note I generally find the ‘other culture knows wandless magic' thing kind of boring. obviously there's a reason wands exist, so if you want another culture to not use them it makes more sense to focus on what they /do/ use than what they don't.
