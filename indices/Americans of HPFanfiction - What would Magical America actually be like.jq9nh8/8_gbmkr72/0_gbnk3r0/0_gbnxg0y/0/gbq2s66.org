So, maybe a general term like Magical/Mundane with specific regional differences dotted around? eg. A big Muggleborn uprising in one area of the country might lead to Muggleborns being known by a nickname from the leader of the Rebellion. Like we in the UK used to call Police 'Peelers' after the guy who founded them.

Good idea on the cultural areas thing though. I have a copy of that native tribes map that made the rounds on Social Media a while back, plus one for the European interests in the Colonial days. I can find a lot of that off the back of those.

That is also true. It really does seem to depend on how isolationist each magical bit would be. Would the French Magicals stick to French territories, and the British Magicals stick to British territories, the Dutch Magicals the Dutch territories, and so on? There seems to be some variation in opinions on that.
