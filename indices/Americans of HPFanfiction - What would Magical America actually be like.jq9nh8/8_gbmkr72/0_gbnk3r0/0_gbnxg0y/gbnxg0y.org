Around my area it would probably be something Najavo related, but you're probably better off going with something like Magical/Mundane across the whole country.

If you want to really narrow it down, look into what cultures were in the area you're writing and see what their shaman/medicine man/etc were called.

Edit: But that also depends on if the American magic society is less diverse than mundane society. With floo and apparation the world is a little smaller, so it may not have developed the same differences that the real life states did.
