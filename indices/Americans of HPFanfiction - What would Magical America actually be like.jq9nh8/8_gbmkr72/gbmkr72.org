Really the only bit I know about Rowlings America is the term no-maj and its terrible. It sounds like a racist term one little group came up with that a foreigner overheard and assumed was what we all called muggles.

Realistically there would be about 7 or 8 different terms in use depending on the area of the country (like with soda, pop, coke, etc)

For fic purposes though if I wrote in America I'd use wizard and mundane
