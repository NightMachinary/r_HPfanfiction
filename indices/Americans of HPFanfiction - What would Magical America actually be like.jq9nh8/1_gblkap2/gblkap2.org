1. I hate the term no-maj. I like the idea of Scourers(?), but I feel, and correct me if it's there, the religion element is missing from the narrative. A large group of American wizards, I feel, should be prime for a Voldemort or Grindelwald like wizard to radicalize them. Overall I'm fine with it.

2. Unified

3. I think some would have taken advantage of slavery

4. I think the magic of natives, colonists, and Africans would have melded together, but some parts would remain separate. I do like the idea of Natives (and Africans) being great healers and fantastic at wandless magic.
