To start, thanks for commenting and giving me lots of ideas. I'm going to ask a lot of questions though, and I apologise in advance. Feel free to answer as few or as many as you like. :)

#+begin_quote
  I hate the term no-maj
#+end_quote

Is it just a clunky term or does it feel not-American? Is there a term you'd prefer, or a particular criterion you'd see as making a term like that feel right?

#+begin_quote
  the religion element is missing from the narrative
#+end_quote

I admit, I haven't looked overly intensely into the Rowling version yet, but I don't believe there's any blatant coverage of it. There may be some subtextual elements of it in there though.

#+begin_quote
  Unified
#+end_quote

Why do you think that?

#+begin_quote
  some parts would remain separate
#+end_quote

Like hoarding certain secrets, or like specific practices are preferred by the different groups?

#+begin_quote
  I do like the idea of Natives (and Africans) being great healers and fantastic at wandless magic
#+end_quote

I like that as well. Feels more Druidic and 'in tune with nature' and such.
