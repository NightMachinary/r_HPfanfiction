Dude, if you haven't read the Alexandra Quick series, by inverarity, you're missing out!

It's a nearly completely original story that takes place in the midwest starting in 2007, IRC. It's got native american magic, Appalachian magic, conflicts between chinese and Japanese magical cultures in america, and so much more.

It treats america as a real magical melting pot, and focuses a lot on all the smaller magical communities that exist in the world outside of Britain and a little bit of greater Europe.

It is not based on JKRs magical america, because frankly, her version of magical america is not very good.
