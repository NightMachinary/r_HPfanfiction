I am american, and I've lived all over the country. I really enjoyed the world building, particularly how portions of nonmagical America affected the magical ones. Even more specifically, things like the hippy communities of California, the coastal communities of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but the best is the small-town mundane descriptions of living close to a highway. I mean, the detail of it all, including esoteric aspects of Appalachian life and Indians in the southwest. It's all very accurate and super relatable, too.

That being said, write what you know. If you don't know, it might but end up sounding weird.
