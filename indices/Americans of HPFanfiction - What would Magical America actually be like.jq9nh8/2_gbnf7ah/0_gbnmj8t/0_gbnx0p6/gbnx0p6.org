I'm happy to give my 2 cents! For context I'm a white female from the Midwest born in the mid eighties. I'm definitely no expert on Native American culture, some others in the thread had good ideas about how to get more info about that.

I love the idea of Elizabethan Doc Browns! American culture has a very strong bias towards the next big thing that pushes innovation. I would expect more wand cores, more different types of focus objects, staffs and awls, etc.

Regarding travel, people adventurous enough to leave everything behind and start over are frequently willing to do it again and again looking for the opportunity they were seeking (think Oregon trail, etc.). Life for colonists was often very difficult and groups of people couldn't afford to completely isolate themselves. They needed to be able to trade, a lot of them (maybe all?) needed help from native peoples before they could reliably plant and harvest crops. Ships arrived in the Americas with the wrong tools, the wrong seeds, the wrong skills. I just don't think that complete isolation is likely or feasible except for maybe a few outliers. You'd definitely get concentrations because people tend to clump around other people like them.

Depending on the time period I could definitely see the xenophobia being focused outwards towards non-magical people.

My guess is that US is that magicals would have house elves and magic which would be more efficient and cost effective than enslaving non-magical people so they'd view it as a muggle or mundane problem that didn't particularly effect them. This one is more subjective though, there are a lot of possibilities and paths this could take.

As for dominate native magic I think you could choose any of large successful societies of Central or North America. My understanding is that native populations had way more mobility than modern people imagine and with that comes trading, war, and intermarriage so there would be common threads of culture and magical practices throughout.

Considering Cortez, I could see the magicals from the first contact locations being able to get away and warn the others. Then the other locations could be hidden and protected before the Cortez and his troops reached them.

For terminology I like someone else's suggestion of “mundane” or “muggle” or “mugs” depending on how old the term “muggle” is. To me “no mag” doesn't follow the normal pattern of English language slang, it's awkward to make plural “no mages”?, and when plural it's too long. We tend to stick to 1 or 2 syllables if you think about slang terms for groups of people: “Dems,” “Tories,” “rednecks,” etc.

The Ilvermony houses remind me of a fad in maybe the 30/40/50s of “Indian” themed summer camps for children that were pretty ick looking back on them.

I think you probably have the right of it with learning by observation and pitching in (modern day on the job training lol). Then you are learning what's useful to your role in the community. Maybe something like guilds?
