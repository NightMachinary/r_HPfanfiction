  American culture has a very strong bias towards the next big thing that pushes innovation.
#+end_quote

A most excellent point. I'm definitely getting an image of a kind of Crystal Palace-era Magical Great Exhibition crossed with a Flea Market where people hawk all their fancy new experimental gear. Would you think that sort of experimentation would be legally regulated, or would they leave it at "don't reveal us to the Muggles and try not to die or kill people"? Either way, I can see a Nerdy Knockturn-Alley Grey-Market in experimental doodads popping up. :D

  I just don't think that complete isolation is likely or feasible except for maybe a few outliers.
#+end_quote

A very fair point. Maybe not for the Muggle Stuff (though some might resort to trading with Muggles to get resources or techniques they don't know how to do with magic - that innovation aspect of America, yes?), but I can definitely see the new immigrants having to trade in Magical Specialisms and Resources such. "Our potioneer can't make Potion X, so we'll trade you a gallon of that for this kilo of Dragon Scales" etc. Plus, America does love its entrepreneurs, right? I can't remember when that 'Haves and Soon-to-Haves' nonsense started exactly, but I'm pretty sure it was fairly early on. Maybe a few travelling Sales-people out to make their fortunes, perhaps? :)

  the wrong tools, the wrong seeds, the wrong skills.
#+end_quote

Very good point. I hadn't considered that the Magicals might fall into that same 'diving into the unknown without the right equipment' pitfall that the Muggle Colonists did. That's a very interesting foundational factor to play around with, their lacks and the ways they might bend to meet them.

  Depending on the time period I could definitely see the xenophobia being focused outwards towards non-magical people
#+end_quote

Could you elaborate on this? I'm not making the connection to whatever you're referring to here, I'm afraid.

#+begin_quote
  This one is more subjective though, there are a lot of possibilities and paths this could take.
#+end_quote

Yeah. There have been a lot of different tones and responses taken to that by Americans here, so I'm expecting that'll either be determined by my next-steps research or left to my discretion.

  Considering Cortez,
#+end_quote

That could be fun. I like the idea of little pockets of highly survivalistic Aztecs hiding out from the conquistadors. Kind of fits their tradition and founding myths. :)

#+begin_quote
  the normal pattern of English language slang
#+end_quote

Those guidelines make sense. Convenience and Cadence. I'll keep that in mind, thanks!

#+begin_quote
  “Indian” themed summer camps
#+end_quote

I just googled that and... yeah, ew. Very Peter Pan-movie Native American tones to that.

#+begin_quote
  learning what's useful to your role in the community. Maybe something like guilds?
#+end_quote

Yeah, that could work. A little more emphasis on training than regulation and standardisation, that could definitely provide a nice balance between the two traditions.
