First off, thank you for the novel! Feel free to keep talking, it's very interesting to read and the more info I get from actual Americans here, the more realistic and accurate my eventual portrayal will be. :)

Also, apologies for all the questions. Feel free to answer as few or as many as you wish. :)

  a different approach to magic
#+end_quote

Magical Radicals is an interesting approach - kind of makes the 'America is the land of magical technology miracles' trope from old 'Harry goes to America' fics seem more interesting, too. :)

I also kind of like the idea of a country founded by a bunch of Elizabethan-era Doc Brown types. :D

#+begin_quote
  ease of travel
#+end_quote

Travel being easy doesn't necessarily mean you'd actually make the trip. If Magical America was a bunch of xenophobic compounds of Magicals trying to be as isolated as possible, they would probably not make those trips, no? You think there would be that kind of interaction?

#+begin_quote
  see what would have happened with those people
#+end_quote

Do you have any opinion on what might've been more likely to have happened? Would there be that same Abolitionist movement in the Magical world as there was in the Muggle? I have ideas, but I'm coming at this from a British perspective, so I'd value the opinion of an actual American. :)

  Would blood magic and sacrifice have a greater role because of Aztec practices
#+end_quote

That is a solid point. I hadn't considered drawing things in from as far as Central America. I was thinking more natives like the Cree or Iroquois or Lakota. I suppose the Spanish may have pushed that with Cortez, huh?

#+begin_quote
  immune due to magic
#+end_quote

I'm of the magic overwrites mundane reality school of thought, so I'd definitely say the magical natives would've been immune to the Muggle diseases at least. Not the Magical Ones, most likely, but definitely the Muggle ones.

#+begin_quote
  The term for muggles
#+end_quote

No American likes the no-maj, huh? :D

Is there a term you think would fit more accurately? Or a criterion a term might need to meet to seem more authentically 'American'?

#+begin_quote
  certainly can't just slap Native American names
#+end_quote

Amen. Though I can see someone trying that to be inviting to those cultures and said cultures just taking one look and unanimously concluding "Hell no." :D

#+begin_quote
  native magical teaching would be more based on mentorship
#+end_quote

From my understanding, this is about right, though a bit less singular than the mentorship term implies. If they wanted to teach hunting, a team of hunters would take a group of boys out and would teach together. Wikipedia calls it 'Learning by Observation and Pitching In', which is a technical term I actually kinda like. :D
