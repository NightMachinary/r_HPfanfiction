I would definitely expect to see a lot of variety in background and reason for immigration. The colonies first immigrants included a lot of religious radicals that wanted to practice their own version of Protestantism so I could see magicals coming wanting to have a different approach to magic.

I think because of the relative ease of travel you'd see much more mixing of magical culture even though certain areas would have greater influences from the areas their immigrants were originally from. Like a Scandinavian flavor in Minnesota, or Scots/Irish in Appalachia.

I would think that you wouldn't get as much of African magical culture through the slave trade because magical people in Africa would have probably been able to better avoid capture by non-magical slave traders. You would have muggle born enslaved people born in the US, so it'd be very interesting to see what would have happened with those people, would they have been left in slavery to find their own way or removed from the community of their birth and brought into the greater US magical community? I could see magical enslaved people being a huge part of the Underground Railroad.

I think there'd also be very strong influences from the native population and their intrinsic magic of the land. Would blood magic and sacrifice have a greater role because of Aztec practices?

Consider that scholars believe about 90% of the native population died as diseases like small pox spread through an immunologically naive population. Would the magical natives been immune due to magic or would they have suffered similar losses? The answer to this question in your universe would drive how much the magic of the America's would influence the US magical population.

Rowling's stuff about the US seems pretty inappropriate to me. The term for muggles sounds like a racial slur to me to be honest. You certainly can't just slap Native American names on the school houses on top of a European style school culture. I imagine native magical teaching would be more based on mentorship and apprenticeship, with way more varied specialties and strengths depending on the tribe and their culture.

Sorry about the novel, this is a very interesting concept, can't wait to see what you write!
