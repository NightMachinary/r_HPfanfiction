Harry loves potion-making in this fic, though he isn't great at it at first - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335]])

The learning is a bit more of a past-tense thing, but Harry is a curse breaker in this fic - linkffn(13318951)

I don't really know what to exactly say about this fic, but Harry and Dumbledore's method to approaching magic is really cool to me. It hasn't updated since 2015 though, so keep that in mind when deciding if you want to read it - linkffn(10758358)
