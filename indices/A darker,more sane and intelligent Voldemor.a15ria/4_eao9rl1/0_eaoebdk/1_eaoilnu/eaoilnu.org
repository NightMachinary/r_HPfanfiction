From what I've seen? Mostly because of Harry, who is frequently arrogant, condescending, and inconsiderate.

I'll say, though, that I didn't find that that spoiled the story. He isn't actually /malicious/, he's actually very loyal to people he respects. He wants to save everyone in the world from dying and combine magic with science to advance the human race beyond anything imagined before. He hates bullying and injustice. And his character flaws do come back to haunt him, repeatedly.
