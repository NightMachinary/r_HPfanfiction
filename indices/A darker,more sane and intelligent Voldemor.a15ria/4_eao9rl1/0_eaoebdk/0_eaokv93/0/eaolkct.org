I don't have a problem with people not liking it, people like what they do and don't what they don't. But part of the point of the story is that Hatry's iamverysmart-ness comes back to bite him in the butt. That's one of my favorite things about it. It's also one of maybe 10 fanfictions I've read that holds up or gets better on a reread. I liked what you had a gripe with, but I get why you don't.

I get really strange obsessions and really bad memory so I've read it all the way through 4 times since it's finished and listened to the fan-made audiobook maybe 10 times? I also listen to it while just doing stuff sometimes. So I have a lot of analysis of the themes, and I think the thing you have a problem with actually adds to the theme that we have the power to defeat death. But. Anyway. I'm glad you like fanfiction now.
