  But part of the point of the story is that Hatry's iamverysmart-ness comes back to bite him in the butt. That's one of my favorite things about it.

Mine too. It's like one of those indie!Harry fics, where Harry feels superior and mouths off, except the adults behave like actual adults and don't really give a shit about the opinions of an 11 year old. It's a neat subversion of that kind of trope.

Edit: Oh and of course how being smart doesn't give you a guarantee on being right. I really like the whole vibe of the protagonist not just being the author's pet and always being correct about everything just because of author fiat.
