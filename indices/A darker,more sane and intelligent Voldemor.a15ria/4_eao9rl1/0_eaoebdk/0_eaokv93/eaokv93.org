I'm honestly not sure why it gets so much flak, considering there are far worse fics out there. The thing I've seen pop up a lot is that Harry is too [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] or that there's way too much going on in a single year to be realistic and that the author spends too much time on certain philosophical or scientific ideas that don't advance the story. All those criticisms are valid to some extent (and I know there are several more critiques, I just can't remember them). I remember that my personal gripe with the story was that one of the characters gets resurrected like a comic book character.

That said, this was the story that got me into fanfiction. After I worked through that boring first chapter, I laughed my way through the next half dozen or so. I spent all my free time for a week just reading through the story. There was so much going on, from all the philosophy, math and science, to the Ender's Game styled battles.
