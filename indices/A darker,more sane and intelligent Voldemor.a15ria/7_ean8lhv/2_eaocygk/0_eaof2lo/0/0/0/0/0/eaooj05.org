Not every single point of divergence fic is an AU, but there are some AU's that are single point of divergence. Like "The Potters don't change secret keepers".

I'd even go so far as to say that the amount of divergences isn't really that important to the question whether something qualifies is an AU or not. AU has more to do with quality of those divergences than quantity. It is useful though to differentiate between single point of divergence, multi divergence and everything-and-anything-is-just-very-different AUs.
