Also, nice job of alternate worldbuilding. You've actually got me thinking, we really should have separate terms for AUs based on single or multiple points of divergence, where ideally canon proceeds as normal unless rippled, vs AU that's really reimagining the whole setting. I think that the latter better fits the term "alternate universe".
