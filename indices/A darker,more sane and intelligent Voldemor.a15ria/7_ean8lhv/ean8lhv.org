Voldemort in my story "Patron" should qualify. He and Dumbledore fought the war like a game of chess- move and countermove, and they had plans that advanced their goals even if they failed. For example, Harry was forced into the tournament as a way to distract Dumbledore from preventing Voldemort's resurrection, to make him lose face at the breach of security, and if Harry died in the sabotaged tournament, that was a bonus.
