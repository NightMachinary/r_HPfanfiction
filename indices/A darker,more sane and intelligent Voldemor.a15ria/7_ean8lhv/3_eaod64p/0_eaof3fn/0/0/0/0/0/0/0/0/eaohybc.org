In canon, he casually pondered murdering a random child in canon, on his way to murdering Harry and his parents. He and his followers murdered children and started a genocide of muggleborns, tortured a teacher to death as evening entertainment, and scared Britain so much, even after his apparent death, they were afraid to say his name. He murdered his own family - both the Riddles and the Gaunts - and committed murder as a teenager and then again and again for his rituals.

It's just that in canon, most of his crimes aren't happening on screen, so to speak.
