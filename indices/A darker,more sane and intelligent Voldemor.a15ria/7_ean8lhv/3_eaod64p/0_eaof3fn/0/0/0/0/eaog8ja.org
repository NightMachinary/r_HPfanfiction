Well, of course, the magical bond is bad - the entire setup, the entire retainer system in the story is a bad thing. The story is about overcoming that unfair unjust system as much as it is about defeating Voldemort.

This is not a story about Hermione happily accepting to remain a third-class citizen as long as she is with Harry. This is a story about Harry and Hermione fighting and defeating both Voldemort and the system.
