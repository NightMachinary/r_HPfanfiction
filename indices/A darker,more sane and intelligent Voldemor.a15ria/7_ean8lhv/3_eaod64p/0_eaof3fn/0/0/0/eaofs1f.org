Hmmm. Well yes I mean I don't like forced magic bonds in fanfics so that is a something that did contribute. :( I am a very strong believer in free will and I hate the idea of unbreakable vows or bindings and stuff. :( So yes your Hermione having a prodding bond to twist her mind is just horrible to me! I mean especially yes because it is pushing her to save Harry's life later? It is kind of terrible that it would force someone to go into danger like that. Also what is the point of saving someone if you're forced into it? It's not selfless. :(
