This is a fic where Canon!Harry immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts gets pulled into an AU by an Order that's on like their fourth Harry Potter. It's been awhile since I read this, so I forgot a good portion of it, but I remember enjoying it and that a line from the AU Dumbledore went something like: "In your world's Voldemort, he was insane. This one isn't."
