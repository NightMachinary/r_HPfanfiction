I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

(SELF-PROMO) I have my fic Broken, where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]); linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]).

Strange Vistors is another one that has Ron equal to Hermione and Harry. He's also learning Healing from Hufflepuff. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) is a classic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13128275/1/]]) is good too.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Ron/77651/][Good Ron Community]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fanfiction-Starring-Ron/130651/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Fanfiction, Starring Ron]] has some good ones. Check out Pinky Brown, s/he has a lot of detailed Ron fics.

And, for a Champion Chef!Ron with Wizard!Gordon Ramsay, check out linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206]]). Defies pretty much all the usual tropes. Well-written OCs. Has a happy ending.
