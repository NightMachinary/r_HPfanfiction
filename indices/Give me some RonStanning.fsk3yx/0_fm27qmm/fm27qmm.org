It's both funny and annoying at the same time how so many writers bash Ron. I once started reading a time travel fic set in 70s/80s and the writer still wrote a whole paragraph of Ron bashing even though he doesn't even appear and it has literally no impact on the plot.

Unfortunately, I've yet to read a particularly good Ron-centric fic.

Hopefully as the fandom grows older, this childish hate towards Ron (and characters like Molly Weasley and James Potter) will decrease.
