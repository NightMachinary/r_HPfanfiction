His actual signature is [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/f/f0/Harry_Potter_sig.png/revision/latest?cb=20150826224906][this.]] (it's in the Fantastic Beasts book). You might be able to just insert this into your document in the right place? I don't think there's a widely available font that matches his signature.
