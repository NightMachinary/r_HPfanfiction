Lily & James's sacrifices combine to endow baby Harry with powerful protection against death, turning him into an instinctual phoenix animagus (or, maybe a benedictus? Opposite of a maledictus?).\\
Raised by a choir of wild phoenixes, on his eleventh birthday (in two senses, given phoenix rebirths) Harry is located by Hagrid and successfully convinced to come to Hogwarts to learn human magic.

But, there's a catch; Harry's entire adopted family of phoenixes is coming along too. We're gonna need a bigger Owlery.

Consider the following scenes:\\
* Harry is bright and cheerful and quite intelligent, but he hasn't learned to read and write yet. How do the various professors handle this obstacle?\\
* Harry's family, the choir of phoenixes, are quite interested in Quidditch matches, and Lee Jordan thinks it'd be awesome to have them play. How does a flying phoenix match up to a Seeker on a Nimbus 2000?\\
* Professor Quirrell and Voldemort are made more than a bit uneasy by the presence of so many phoenixes, but they can't just abandon their plan to get the Philosopher's Stone. Or maybe they can; how do the two adapt their plan to get Voldemort a new body?
