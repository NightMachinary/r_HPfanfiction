Fuck it, I'll double-dip:

After Cedric's death and Harry's less than empathetic behavior during their ill-fated romance, Cho Chang begins to undertake various activities to take her mind off her grief. As time passes, she develops an inner calmness that cannot be shattered.

Little does Cho know of the prophesied fate awaiting her, for the Dark Lord must be vanquished by the Cho-Zen One.
