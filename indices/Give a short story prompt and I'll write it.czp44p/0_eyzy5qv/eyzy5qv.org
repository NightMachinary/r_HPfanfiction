After the Battle of Hogwarts, the Shacklebolt Ministry rectifies many oversights of previous administrations as to the guilt or innocence of various wizards and witches. As such, it has been decided to rescind the Order of Merlin originally given to Peter Pettigrew. Someone has to inform his mother as to why.

'Someone' in this case, is junior Auror Ron Weasley.
