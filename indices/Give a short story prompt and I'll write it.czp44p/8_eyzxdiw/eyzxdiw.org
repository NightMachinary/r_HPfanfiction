Don't worry, you're breaking no rules that I know of!

How about... hm... I know! The Brazilian Boa Constrictor returns to Britain to congratulate Harry after the Battle of Hogwarts, having struck it rich in Brazil and integrated himself into the magical community there (more or less), which isn't as prejudiced against snakes and Parselmouths as Britain.
