A rewrite of the epilogue where "Harry" is actually Dumbledore who took possession of Harry's body in the Forbidden Forest (during the /King's Cross/ chapter in DH). He thinks about the steps he took to ensure that Ron and Hermione are "happy", Malfoy is "redeemed" and that his dear Severus is honored as he should be.

And that, in the end, /all was well/, no matter that the small and now easy to ignore voice of the boy in his head was screaming in despair.
