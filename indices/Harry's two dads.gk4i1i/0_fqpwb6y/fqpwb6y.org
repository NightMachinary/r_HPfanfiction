This leads to Harry getting a conversation from Sirius (separately) about how both he and Remus are taking care of him as just friends though Harry shouldn't tell Remus about his secret crush on him.

On the other hand, unbeknownst to the previous conversation, Remus brings Harry to the side and says that he doesn't mind saying that they are his two dads because he secretly developed a slight crush on Sirius... but not to tell Sirius! No, don't tell Sirius, because he'll probably reject him because he's a werewolf. Harry just laughs and calms him down, saying that he won't tell Sirius.

So, Harry hatched a plan and offered his two dads to make dinner and got help from his friends to set up a candle-lit dinner with a bouquet of roses, a fancy three-course meal, and boxes upon boxes of chocolate with love letters addressed to each other (and the twins giving them handcuffs with the explanation, "you'll understand when you're older Harry.").

As it came as a total surprise, both Sirius and Remus were gaping like fish, but they decided to play along, for Harry's sake, and then they started getting into a deep conversation before one of them accidentally confessed their love and it went on from there.

Turns out the rumors about Harry's two dads had some merit after all, and there were various amounts of money being passed around once the story came to fruition. And the family of three (or four, because Harry counted Kreacher, much to Sirius's chagrin) were never happier.
