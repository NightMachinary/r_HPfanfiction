Hollow. Its Godric's Hollow.

Do you remember the pet peeve thread from yesterday? Yeah... that's exactly what we talked about there. You may have some errors, in both grammar and typos, but at the very least get the names right.

Also, these "Voldemort adopts Harry" stories never made sense to me. The prophecy is pretty clear.

It doesn't make sense for Voldemort to keep Harry around. Voldemort's entire scheme builds on the fact that he's top dog. Why would he nourish and raise someone prophesied to have power dangerous to him and his rule?

This doesn't mean you shouldn't write this, don't get me wrong. But it does require some additional reasoning as to why he doesn't just kill off the nuisance of a potential threat to his power.
