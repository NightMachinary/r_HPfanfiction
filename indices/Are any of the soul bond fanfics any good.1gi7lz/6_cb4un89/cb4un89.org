[[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On the Last Day of Our World]] by Sansa. Harry/Draco. The soul bond isn't the main focus of the story but happens later. I'll try to sum up the fic for you.

When Harry and Draco are locked up in detention and find themselves bathed in white light, nothing seems out of the ordinary; however, when they step out of it, they find themselves entirely alone in the world. The phrase 'not if you were the last man on earth' starts to seem a little extreme as the pair makes their way around the world while the wizarding world is torn apart by the Dark Lord. NC-17.
