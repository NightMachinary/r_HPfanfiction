I'd have to recommend two stories by one of may favorite writers, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2036266/DriftWood1965][DriftWood1965]].

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] is a Veela bonding fic, and it is a great deal of fun to read.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past][Harry Potter and Future's Past]] is my personal favorite of the time travel soul bond fics. The first few chapters are a little silly, but when you get to the Department of Mysteries... well, I think it's the best damned DoM rewrite I have ever read, and I have read /quite/ a few.
