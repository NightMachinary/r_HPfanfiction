The best counter to this that I've seen is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568/1/The-Harmony-Bond][The Harmony Bond]]. The shitter is that it was a WIP, but I'm not sure if it will be finished cause the author is going through some stuff right now.

I mean they do get together eventually, but there's some serious issues at the start.
