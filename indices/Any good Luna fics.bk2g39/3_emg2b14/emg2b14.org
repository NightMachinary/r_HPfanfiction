"I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love" by billowsandsmoke is a canon-compliant, wonderful story about a friendship between Snape and Luna.

It's not romance, and fair warning, it's sad (considering what happens to Snape) but also funny, very touching and a great portrayal of Luna, in my opinion.
