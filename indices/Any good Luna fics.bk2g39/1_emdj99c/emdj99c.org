Anything? Well how about: /Friends/ by /the psychotic house elf/ (formerly glue and tar) on ffnet?

Summary from ffnet:

#+begin_quote
  Instead of making new friends on the Hogwarts Express in 1995, Luna loses the only one she has. In the lonely year that follows, she discovers just how well the name 'Loony Lovegood' fits her. Insane!Luna. Very dark.

As the summary indicates, it's very dark. But as it's only 21k words, it's a quick read.
