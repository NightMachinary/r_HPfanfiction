It's been discussed a few times. The general resolution I've seen is that it doesn't matter because pretending that they aren't forcibly taking it isn't the same thing as actually being willing.

The one time I've seen an interesting take on this was in an Manipulative!Dumbledore story where Harry only considered him an enemy and barely cared about Voldemort, meaning his blood was no longer valid for that particular ritual.
