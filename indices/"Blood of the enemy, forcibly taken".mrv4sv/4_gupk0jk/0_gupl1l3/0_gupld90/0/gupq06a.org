Isn't it obvious what the difference is? In your scenario, it is forced "consent", in my scenario, it is actual consent because Harry is quick on the uptake and /wants/ them to take his blood so that it will fuck up the ritual.

The difference is that he's not verbalizing agreement because he's forced to do so, he's verbalizing agreement because he chose to do so.
