  The word forcibly means using force or violence. The implication of the word can be interpreted differently from person to person, so I highly doubt that the ritual would be restricted to the interpretation of some people and not others.

I don't think that's right, because you don't /need/ to use force to get something from someone who is already willing to give you that thing. You could, but if they'd just as well give it to you, it's closer to BDSM play than anything...

  Besides, isn't claiming that willingly giving blood will negate the ritual also a semantics game?

Quite the opposite, I think the question of consent is very relevant and substantive, I think that it's the critical question here. Contrast with your entire point, which hinges on the mechanics of how you take the blood and a semantic interpretation of the word "force" which somehow doesn't take into account the subject's will.

Like I joked before, in your interpretation the deciding factor seems to be that Harry is in bondage gear, which is a rather ridiculous criteria for a ritual like this.
