Strong disagree. The ritual specifically calls for it being taken unwillingy, you can't just substitute that with the opposite.

Diesel has more energy than gasoline, but you wouldn't fill your sedan with diesel, because it was built around gasoline, not diesel. And that analogy ignores that willing blood is literally the opposite, so by your logic, it would be like trying to shove activated plutonium down the hatch.
