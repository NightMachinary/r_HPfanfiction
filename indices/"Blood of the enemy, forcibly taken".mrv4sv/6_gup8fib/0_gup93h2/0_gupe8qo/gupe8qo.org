Yeah, that's one of my theories as well. I think you see it a bit in fantasy writing, the whole, if a unicorn gives you their tears or blood it's like the greatest most powerful substance ever, but if you take it it's cursed.

But I do think that if a ritual says that you need to take something the power is in the act of taking it, it instilled a certain level of dark power, but that shit always has a cost, and people get addicted to just taking power for themselves and get tangled in gross stuff

Like my theory is that some rituals call for rape of a virgin and stuff instead of consensual sex and that's the kind of thing the death eaters would be super into, but I feel like once you did even one of those rituals your magic and yourself will never be the same
