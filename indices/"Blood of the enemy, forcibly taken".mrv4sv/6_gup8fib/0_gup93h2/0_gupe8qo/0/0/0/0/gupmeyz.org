Hahaha it's more that they think they can just make a healthy version of cookies or something but instead of going and getting a recipe that uses coconut flour or whatever other ingredient they bought because it sounded cool, they use a recipe that calls for wheat flour. And then they're wondering how they ended up with a dry and horrible rock instead of a desirable outcome. Baking is science! so are rituals in my brain. It's just got to do with ingredients picked at a particular time of the lunar cycle or whether something was freely gifted or else wise
