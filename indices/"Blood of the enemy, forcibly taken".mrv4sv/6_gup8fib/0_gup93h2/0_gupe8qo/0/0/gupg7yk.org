Oh yeah totally, I totally agree with you. Sorry if that didn't come across in what I said. A gift given willingly might be stronger, but that doesn't mean it's what's needed for the ritual. You can't just change something like that and have nothing go wrong. As a baker I have friends coming to me all the time wondering why their recipe didn't work and I always find out they've done a similar thing lmao
