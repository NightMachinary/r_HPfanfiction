I disagree with a lot of these comments. I do think consent is a massive factor, as are the factors of ‘friend', ‘enemy', and yes, how roughly it was taken. Needles can be traumatic too though, so even if he used a syringe and all the proper gear it would still qualify.

I think if he'd like ‘here, take it' it would definitely change a factor. I don't know how much of it though. And like, one thing I've wondered and haven't gotten around to writing yet is like, does Fawkes have to give their blessing for their tears to transfer as well or will he just get basilisk venom and blood?

It all depends on how you write your rituals and potion making though. In mine consent is always a massive part of the type and strength of magic that's being performed
