For my take I had my oc make a ghoul double of Harry (ghouls in my story you give them a couple drops of blood and they take the shape of the donor) and Cedric. And ghoul blood corrupts Wizards to madness so over time Harry's few droplets mingled in with the ghoul blood breaks down and Riddle begins to become unhinged and unhealthily attached and obsessed with oc who is his second in command soon enough and can guide Voldy to more tolerable actions until they can carry out the final battle.
