I mean that's cute and all, but then it just completely throws out the hole framework of the ritual, it makes it meaningless. If random willing blood is so much better, why would he not just do that? Why do the three specific components of the ritual even matter then, that bone is unknowingly taken, that flesh is willingly given, or that blood is unwillingy taken then, if that can just be substituted at will? (Pun intended)
