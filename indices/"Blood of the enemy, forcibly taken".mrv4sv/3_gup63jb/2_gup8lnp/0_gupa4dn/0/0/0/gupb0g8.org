So the will or disposition of the subject doesn't matter, in your construct of this ritual it all hinges on the mechanical aspects of taking it? It's not enough that he's consenting, he needs to go through the motions to make it count?

I'm not sure if that's consistent with the other aspects, certainly the other parts of the ritual, like unknowing bone, hinge entirely on the consciousness of that person (or lack of thereof). Would bone of father work as well if a small part was harvested while he was alive and asleep, instead of dead?
