Harry left the room, his thoughts racing a mile a minute. Was becoming the next Dumbledore in his future? It seemed so distant, so unachievable. Or---he still remembered Hermione's time turner---perhaps Dumbeldore /was/ his future self? An overwhelming burden, one that he had to bear or be erased from time. Or was it just a lark, like a fun house mirror? It did sound like something the Twins would do.

The door behind Harry shut, and Dumbledore stepped through the empty frame, making his way to the exit as well. But the door opened again, and Dumbledore found himself face to face with another Dumbledore.

"Severus, while I do not object to this type of execrise for using Legilimency to anticipate your opponent's movements," the newcomer spoke, "I must object to your appropriating my face while doing it."
