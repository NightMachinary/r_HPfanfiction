Albus walks in the Gryffindor common room, a smile on his lips when he steps into his old dorm. Whistling a little tune he searches for Ms Granger and Mr Weasley. He knows Harry would spend his evening with them. It doesn't take him very long. Ms Granger and Mr Weasley are arguing about something. Very loudly. Nobody else seems concerned. Albus decides it is better to help them through their struggle and beginn to talk with them. They give him strange looks but he can't look in their thoughts - not only would that be very rude, he also is pretty sure that Harrys Magic isn't up for such tasks yet. After they are calm again he announces that he would go to sleep - it is a school night after all. He makes a few steps before he hears the shout of: "Stupefy!" Albus turns around, but it is to late. A stunner in the back isn't something he expects in the Gryffindor common room.

Albus wakes up in the hospital wing. When looking around he sees his own body in the bed next to him.

"I told you that you can't fool Ron and Hermione" says Harry.

"And who got you?" Albus asks calmly. "My bet is on Minerva."

"Snape" Harry growls.

"Professor Snape, Harry" Albus corrects amused.
