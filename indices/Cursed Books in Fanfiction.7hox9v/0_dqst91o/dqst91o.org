Cursed books can be used to kill somebody. Just put the withering curse from the Ring on it or the one from the necklace. Or soak an invisible poison into the pages.

As for "buffing" people, this would be difficult to explain because you can't simply say "read this and gain transfiguration +5". Magic in Harry Potter has no levels, you learn individual spells. Therefore a book that teaches you a spell is a simple spellbook. You could put a supersensory charm or similar on a book but wouldn't ot be more effective to simply charm the person? The only thing coming close to the concept of buffs is the luck potion.

That said if you really want a video game style system, there was an ASOIAF fanfic in which Jon Snow found a magical bracelet that allowed him to see a HUD and gave him an overview about his stats, quests and information on people. He found out about Cersei's incest that way. My main criticism for that concept is how the author handled combat, with fixed damage values and critical hits instead of a "internal Module" system similar to War Thunder. It has a terrible reading flow.
