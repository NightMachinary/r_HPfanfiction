  See, I liked the first three books, *but I actually preferred the later ones*

Burn the heretic.

But seriously, I think you may actually like the /idea/ of the later books, not their execution.

  DH was a war novel, but because the trio were removed from the action, it didn't read as such.

Then it wasn't, it was a travel log. It is sad that the most interesting parts of that book occur off screen, so to speak. Hogwarts resistance, pure-blood politics being enacted, international reactions, Tonks and Lupin, people dealing with the most powerful wizard in the country dying.

None of that happens to our characters, so a lot is left unexplored. Another reason fanfic is so popular with this series of books.
