I know you were kidding about my being a heretic, but seriously, my liking different books than you doesn't mean I've forced myself to ignore what you consider shoddy execution. I just have different tastes, and I prefer the more complex and less linear plots to a mystery-style book. Mystery isn't really my favorite genre. I initially read the books for the world-building and characters, not the plot. I think the first three books contain just as many plot holes as the later ones, but without the darker themes and wider cast of characters that I grew to adore. Maybe I'm unusual, but that doesn't mean my opinion is inherently wrong or that I just like the idea of the books.

I just classify it as a war novel because of what I know is occurring off-screen. I'm sure this is part of the reason that HP fanfiction is so popular (other reasons including that the HP books/characters themselves are extremely popular and that Rowling had a habit of not treating her characters kindly). Whatever the reasons are, I'm certainly grateful for them.
