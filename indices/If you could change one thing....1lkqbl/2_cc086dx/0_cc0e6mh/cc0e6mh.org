See, I liked the first three books, but I actually preferred the later ones. I agree that Voldemort was cartoon-ish (one of the reasons I love fanfiction: a lot of writers give Dark wizards more of a reasonable voice), but I disagree that he should have stayed dead. I would have loved to see more of a political war: the Order and Voldemort fighting to sway the Ministry. There was a little bit of this in books four through six, but it was always in the background. Harry was a teenager, so it's understandable that he wasn't /super/ interested and involved in politics. I would've loved to see more of a war, generally. This would've made the series even darker than it was, and inappropriate for children... so it definitely had no chance of occurring.

With more of a political battle and a war, we could get new antagonists: more prominent political rivals, like Umbridge or Lucius, and more battlefield opponents that weren't just handled by all the side characters as Harry saved the day. DH was a war novel, but because the trio were removed from the action, it didn't read as such. I wish we could've gotten more trio involvement in a war effort, or even another point of view (Neville? Percy? Lupin? Draco? Ginny?) to show what the war was like for those not privileged enough to escape.

*TL;DR Keep Voldemort alive, but have more of a mature and intricate political division and more focus on the wizarding war.*
