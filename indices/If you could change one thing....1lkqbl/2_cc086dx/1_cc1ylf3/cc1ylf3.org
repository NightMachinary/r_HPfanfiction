Actually, that's a cool idea-Voldemort really, truly dies at Godric's Hollow, but all the events in the books still happen. Why? Because his death ignited a struggle for control of the wizarding world, and having everyone believe that Voldemort had returned was key to someone's power play. Now /there/ is a mystery re-working for books five through seven, a more complex whodunnit than originally envisaged.
