Taure said this best in a recent DLP post, but I suppose that if I could change one thing, I would have left Voldemort dead and presented a different set of challenges to Harry and the others to face. Employing prophecy and "Chosen One" and the like is lazy storytelling and Voldemort was such a shallow literary character (a cut-out, mustache-twirling, underling-torturing bundle of villainous stereotypes) that the series would have benefited by just leaving him out. Lucius Malfoy and Dolores Umbridge made far more interesting antagonists and without a Voldemort in the mix, we could have avoided the last two books' quests for +plot coupons+ Horcruxes/Hallows, which was also rather lazy storytelling.

The first three books were classic mysteries, tightly written and clever. JKR strayed from that starting in book four, with the return of Voldemort, and the rest is history.
