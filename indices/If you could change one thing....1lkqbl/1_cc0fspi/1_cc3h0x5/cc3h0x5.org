There was lots of drama hinted at, but it was rarely important enough to affect the main plot. Kids were dating and fighting all the time, like everywhere, but if it wasn't relevant to Harry and co, we didn't really need to hear about it. That's the nature of books written from a fixed perspective. Side characters can be multidimensional, but the fact that the are side characters usually means you won't see the details that give them depth.
