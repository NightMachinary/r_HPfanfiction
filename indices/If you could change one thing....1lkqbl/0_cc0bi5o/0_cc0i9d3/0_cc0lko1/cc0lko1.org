That's true that not all the bullies come from Slytherin. Harry's point of view does skew that a bit (as a side note, I wouldn't consider what occurred in second year to Harry to be bullying. Avoiding another student because you /honestly fear for your life/ may be hurtful to that person, but is hardly an act of malicious bullying.) I guess the difference is that the bullies from Griffindor/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw were portrayed more as good people who acted nastily, as opposed to the Slytherin bullies being nasty people who acted nastily. I know I'm just nitpicking on a series that I consider very good, but I just wish there was a Draco figure in another house, or a friendly figure from Slytherin.

Thank God for fanfiction.
