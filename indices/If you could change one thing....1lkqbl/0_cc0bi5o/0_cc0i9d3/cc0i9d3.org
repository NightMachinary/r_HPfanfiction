  I would change the treatment that the Slytherin House received.

HP works on elemental tropes and large, sweeping generalizations and themes. So that sort of subtlety might not be possible, but the flaw is glaring in its obviousness. It turns the House system into something like an antagonist detector, not a working school system (and don't get me started on the psychological effects of that sort of built-in social divisiveness). I think it was in a Cracked.com video piece where someone questioned why, when you were sorted into Slytherin, you weren't just humanely put down. The books don't really suggest a counterpoint to that.

  I wouldn't have made all the major bullies come from a single house

In JKR's defense, that is sort of taken care of. They just aren't /Harry's/ bullies. We know there were bullies in Griffindor in the past, namely the Marauders. There are also the Twins now, but they are clearly cast in a super-positive light, even though a literal reading of their antics is...questionable. We also know Ravenclaws have at least a few people harassing Luna. During the CoS and Gof, students in Hufflepuff were just as bad at shunning Harry as the rest of the school, so that might count. So no House is really immune, and it would be sort of silly to have an endless stream of bullies pushing Harry around.

But of course none of that is ever dealt with, because the books are about large issues and themes, not the nitty-gritty of daily life with magic or how a magical school actually works. Because that wasn't what the books were about. Enter: fanfiction.
