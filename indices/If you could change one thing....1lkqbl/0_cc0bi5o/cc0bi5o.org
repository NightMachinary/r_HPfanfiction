I would change the treatment that the Slytherin House received. I do think they were unfairly portrayed in a negative light (/especially/ in the movies, but the books were guilty of this as well). Ambition is not an inherently evil trait, but I feel that Rowling implied that it is. So I would have Harry actually befriend a Slytherin or two, like how he befriended members from the other three houses. I wouldn't have made all the major bullies come from a single house--come on, a bully in Griffindor could have been much more interesting. This isn't really a single thing to change, though. It's actually kind of a lot of things to change. >.< Sorry, sorry.

If that doesn't count, then I would've changed the Wormtail fiasco in POA. Come on, a simple memory extraction from Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Lupin could have proved Sirius's innocence. The Ministry would have argued that Sirius could have modified their memories, but as we see in HBP, a modified memory is very easy to identify. And I firmly believe that Slughorn would be better at memory modification than Sirius. There's no reason that Sirius should have had to go on the run. I'm sure it was fun for him, but this always stood out to me as a plot hole when I read the series.
