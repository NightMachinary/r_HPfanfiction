I think if I could change one thing, and not have that one thing change the whole series, it would be the Tri Wizard tournament. That whole book had so many issues, and the tournament would have been more boring than golf to watch, since you can't see the people the whole time.

I didn't actually like the first three books for their plots, dragging mysteries on the whole year made the characters do nothing, and just wait for the next clue event to happen. These books were also the ones where the kids inexplicably had to do all the work.
