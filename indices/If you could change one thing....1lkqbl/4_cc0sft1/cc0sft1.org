I would have changed how harry acted after Umbridge treated him in detention and the 'I must not tell lies' written in the back of his hand. It would have been so interesting if Harry went straight up to Dumbledore and dobbed in Umbridge and then if Dumbledore though Harry was lying for some reason ( which i doubt he wouldnt because Dumbly loves Harry) and for harry to take Vectimserum and THEN dumbly realises that he made a mistake and SHOUTS AT AND FIRES UMBRIDGE IFRONT IF THE WHOLE SCHOOL

PS THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE AT NEAR THE END OF THE BOOK THOUGH SO WE STILL GET TO SEE UMBRIDGE BEING A BITCH
