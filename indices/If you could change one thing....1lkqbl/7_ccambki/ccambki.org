More POVs than Harry. It really restricts the story and minimizes the huge world created for it as everything we get is through the eyes of a socially awkward boy who doesn't know anything about the world he lives in. This is especially hammered home in Deathly Hallows...like...that /whole/ story took place off the page...it was so bizarre.

Should have been seven POVs, obviously.
