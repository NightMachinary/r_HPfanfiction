Fanfiction is all about taking from other people's work without permission, so that's not a moral issue, as long as all you post is actual new content (no copy-pasting the previous parts). However, you should still make serious attempts to contact them and give them a long time to reply. And when you start posting, make sure that you signal what you're doing very clearly. People will still be pissed, of course, but bear in mind that fanfic readers get pissed at authors at the drop of a hat, so you may as well ignore them.
