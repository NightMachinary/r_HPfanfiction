  For all of his life Harry has fought for his freedom and for vengeance, he has been an eternal beacon shining through the oncoming darkness. It was not enough however, the darkness has overwhelmed the world and Voldemort has seemingly won. There were two things Voldemort was not ready for though, Harry's sheer determination and will to win, and the brilliance of Albus Dumbledore.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
