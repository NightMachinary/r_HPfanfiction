I quite like linkao3(Whispers in Corners by esama). It's a very good crossover with BBC Sherlock, where Harry uses the resurrection stone to talk to the dead and gains the attention of Mycroft. It does have a slash pairing, though it's not explicit.

I second Child of the Storm, and here are some Avengers crossovers that haven't been linked yet: Linkffn(8148717; 10216252; 8643484). That last author, Whispering Darkness, has a lot of fun HP+MCU one-shots.

There's also the Harveste Addams series by kyaru-chan, starting with Harveste linkffn(6341291). It's the Addams Family, so you can expect it to be... twisted.

I also second Harry Potter and the Natural 20. I don't think you need to have played D&D to enjoy it, but for someone who has a passing familiarity with the game, it's awesome. Slow to update but not abandoned. linkffn(8096183)
