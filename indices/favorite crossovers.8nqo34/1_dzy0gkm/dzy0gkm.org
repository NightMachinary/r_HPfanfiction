There are more I know, but those other ones turn into harems and I don't know if you would like those

Linkffn(8897431) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm]] harry potter in the marvel universe(and more characters from different franchises) , it has great world building, character iterations (warning: it snape bashes so his dialog sticks out like a sore thump and kinda ruins then flow of the story when he pops up)

Linkffn(11567521) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567521/1/Is-Your-Great-Aunt-an-AI]] fun story, kinda cracky, author likes to make obscure references

Linkffn(11892023) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11892023/1/Harry-Brown]] nice wholesome one shot, don't have to watch Mrs. Brown's Boys to understand the story
