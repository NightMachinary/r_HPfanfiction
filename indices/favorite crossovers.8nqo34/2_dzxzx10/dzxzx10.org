Linkffn(Only A Boy) - Harry doesnt exist in this story but Merlin does and has been transported to the future (90's London) as a child.

Linkffn(Itatchi, Is That A Baby?) - Harry is raised by Itatchi and the Akatsuki and attends Hogwarts, its a crackfic but hillarious.

Edit: just started reading Black Sky- its really long, over 1m words and features a female Harry, who is Sirius's daughter and a crossover with hitman reborn. Personally I'm reading it for Black family politics.
