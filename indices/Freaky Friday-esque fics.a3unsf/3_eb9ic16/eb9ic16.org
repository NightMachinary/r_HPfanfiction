Yes, actually, I know of one! It's been quite a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, it's a Draco and Harry body swap. It was called “Switch,” I'm pretty sure. I don't remember much about it other than that---I honestly can't remember if it was Drarry or just a friendship. I can try and dig up the link, if you're interested?
