I recall a semi decent 'travel back in time' fic where Harry and Hermione go back in time but end up in each other's bodies. It wasn't finished (or close) though :(. They adopted star wars names for some reason...

I think I have seen a few romance body swaps (usually h/hr, or h/girl). Sadily, no Harry/ron swaps, even though they could have a good tale of two cities thing going

Edit: oooooh yeaaaa and that super creepy one where Hermione dies and Harry can't stand it so he uses a permeant potion to become Hermione, thus dooming the world due to a lack of a chosen one...
