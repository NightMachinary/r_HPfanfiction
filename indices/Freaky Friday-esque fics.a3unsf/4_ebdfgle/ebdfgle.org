Ha! I think I just found the absolutely most perfect place to recommend my fanfic! If you'd like, please check out: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

​

When a brazen attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

​

It's not quite body switching, but I have people switching! It's not a comedy, but it has some funny moments at any rate!
