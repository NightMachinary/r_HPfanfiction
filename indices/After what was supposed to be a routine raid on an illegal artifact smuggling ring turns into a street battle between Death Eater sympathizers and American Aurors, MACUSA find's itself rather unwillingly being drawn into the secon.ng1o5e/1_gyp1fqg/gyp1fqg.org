Oh boy, that sounds like an unfun time for everyone. Macusa is big and home to many different magical traditions. The fundamental problem is that MACUSA and the USA are very different entities to begin with, so any form of unilateral action taken by the country as a whole would require one hell of an incident.

Also, it pays to remember that no magical nation can actually call upon a trained professional army, so the martial tradition present in the muggle world simply isn't there. Whatever form an intervention takes would be vastly different in terms of scale and scope from similar incidents in the past on the nomaj side.

Actually, do we know what the political structure of the MACUSA is? Do they go by states, communities, city hubs? I can't remember what approach the film took to this problem.

But yeah, any intervention by MACUSA would not be the same as the 'dropping a thousand tons of democracy on the bad guys' approach we envision today. Maybe targeted infiltration/assassination, proxy warfare and 'soft' engagements (as in fights where extremely limited assets are deployed with the objective of highly targeted outcomes-elimination of support assets, switching loyalties, keeping specific players in the fight-meant to ensure long-term success) would be the norm here. They're wizards after all.
