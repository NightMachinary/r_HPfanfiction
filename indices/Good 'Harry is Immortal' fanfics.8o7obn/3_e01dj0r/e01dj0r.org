I want to tacitly recommend The Boy Who Could Not Die linkffn(The Boy Who Could Not Die).

Short explanation, Harry winds up discovering he is practically invincible and thus literally nothing phases him. Its implied that he is indestructible due to the Horcrux in his head. At one point he talks about diving to the bottom of the ocean and seeing leviathans and sights no other has ever looked at. The humor sort of reminds me of Seventh Horcrux, for obvious reasons.

Too bad it is unfinished, stopped at start of year 2.
