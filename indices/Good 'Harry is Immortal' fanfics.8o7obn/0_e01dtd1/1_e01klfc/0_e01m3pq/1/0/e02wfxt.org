We don't actually know much about Flamel. He very well could have created the Philosopher's Stone early on in his life then decided to avoid conflict and fighting. We do know though that he somehow kept the stone protected for many, many years, and even though Gringotts was open for about just a bit shorter than Flamel's lifespan, it was in the control of wizards for most of it, so it's possible that he wouldn't have entrusted the stone to them. If so, that means that he must have been at the least a clever and fairly powerful wizard if he managed to live so long and avoid having it stolen.
