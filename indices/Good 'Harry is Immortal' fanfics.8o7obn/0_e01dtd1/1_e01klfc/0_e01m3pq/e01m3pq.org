Its been a while since I read it so I could be missing some details, but imo Jasmine is nowhere near as powerful as she should be after living literally thousands of years. In the climax of the Merlin arc she gets overpowered by a middle aged witch in a fight that should've been a stomp. In that same fight she doesn't show any feats beyond, say, Dumbledore could've done.

I also wish the author showed the more active parts of her life beyond training other people. Yeah I know training Merlin laid the foundation of magical Britain but all she kinda does in that arc after training him is stay and sit at home and be the sub to Merlin's dom. But I guess the author can't contradict the fact that she isn't a prominent figure without rewriting history itself.

Again, these are just nitpicks and don't really take away from what is otherwise a fantastic story. I just hope it gets updated soon.
