I used to do that. But then I realised that I had eighty documents of ideas for stories I hadn't even started writing yet and that I couldn't ever find anything. Now, I just have a list of story names and then a few bulletpoints of description for each idea - until I actually get around to writing them, anyway. Then they get a separate file of their own. :)

And will do. Expect a random message in about three years that you'll have no recollection of asking for whatsoever. :D
