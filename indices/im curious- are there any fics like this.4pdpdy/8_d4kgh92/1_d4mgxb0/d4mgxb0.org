Assuming you did not edit the post, it's “Preferably over 100k”. With that, I'm really not sure what is there to get, since nobody wrote anything along the lines of “I have stories over 100k but I won't post them because they are too long for you” and your words can't be taken to mean that you do not want any lesser stories.

So you might not want to be rude, but you do kind of sound that way. And I'll leave it at that since I don't really care (and all the stuff I have has already been recommended anyway).
