  I hear you. Ron is treated badly in much of fanfiction. I think part of this is ragehate on the part of the H/Hr shippers, part of it is disappointment in Harry's systemic underachievement throughout canon, with Ron being a convenient scapegoat.

I ship H/Hr but I don't hate on Ron and in fact it's something that constantly gets on my nerves when I read it in practically any fic, regardless of who's shipped with who. It's all over the top bashing of his flaws that he displays early on, the things that he eventually gets over.

But yeah, it's literally at the point now that the only bashing of Ron I'll accept is when Harry is sorted into Slytherin. Because that is acceptable bashing. It's canon effectively, given that Ron has a natural bias against all Slytherins regardless of who they are and what they do. So it's natural that his target would respond in kind. Honestly that bias is probably just a problem with his upbringing, but it's something that's tolerable if not understandable if we put ourselves in his shoes.

Any other bashing of him or outside of that context will literally make me put down the fic and read something else. H/Hr fics are nice usually, but the level of Ron bashing in some of them is ridiculous. Not to mention it usually downgrades into "let's bash the whole Weasley family, the only people who treat Harry like true family and say Harry and Hermione's love lives were actually manipulated by Molly Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Albus Dumbledore for whatever reason we choose to invent by use of love potions." Honestly, that gets dull and repetitive real fast.

Tbh I agree in part with the user howtopleaseme on this. It would be easier if the trio didn't date each other, perhaps it would even be preferable. Which is why I guess in non BWL stories like Kwan Li's the Other Boy Who Lived, Harry is not even in the trio and is therefore "eligible" to date Hermione without competition or hatred from Ron.
