  I hear you. Ron is treated badly in much of fanfiction. I think part of this is ragehate on the part of the H/Hr shippers

You know, for me its just that I hate, hate hate hate hate hate, Ron/Hermione. I think it completely degraded both characters in HP. I like H/Hr fine, but I think the trio not dating each other probably would have been best. Add to this that Ron suddenly speaks parselmouth in DH and you have my two least favorite things about cannon, and they both feature Ron Weasley.

I think my views on this are pretty common, which is where a lot of the hate comes from I think.
