I hear you. Ron is treated badly in much of fanfiction. I think part of this is ragehate on the part of the H/Hr shippers, part of it is disappointment in Harry's systemic underachievement throughout canon, with Ron being a convenient scapegoat.

Some stories with sympathetic/heroic Ron:

linkffn(Number Games by jbern) is very good, one of my favorite fanfiction stories that Jim's written.

Everything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]] (Ella) refrains from Weasley bashing and Ron is one of her favorite characters.

My one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]] has him in a heroic role.
