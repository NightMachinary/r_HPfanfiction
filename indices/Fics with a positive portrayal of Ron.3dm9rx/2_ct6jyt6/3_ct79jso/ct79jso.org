  Everything written by Deadwoodpecker (Ella) refrains from Weasley bashing and Ron is one of her favorite characters.

Seconding this. Her [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4871753/1/Through-a-Dark-Mirror][Through a Dark Mirror]] is Ron Centric. Abandoned though. /Sigh/. If only I could pay Ella to finish her stories (This one, but specifically Yellow Submarine and Socks), I would do it in a heartbeat.

Also, Harry/Ginny stories in general rarely bash the rest of the Weasleys and Ron is generally an important character, though almost all of them pair Ron with Hermione, so YMMV. Try linkffn(After the End), which has the best Ron characterization ever, linkffn(The Black Library) and Linkffn(Phantom Limb) for other good Ron characterizations.

Also, Syn's [[http://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/?skip=100][Wake the Dead]] has a very heroic Ron. Plus, the whole story is basically an zombie invasion of Hogwarts, which is awesome.

Not very fond of Jbern's Number Games. Ron doesn't feel very Ron-ish (All of Jbern's protagonists are pretty much the same regardless of which story), and I don't have much reason to read a Ron story if Ron isn't characterized right.
