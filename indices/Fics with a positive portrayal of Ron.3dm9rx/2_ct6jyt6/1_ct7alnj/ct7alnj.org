Lots of H/Hr shippers /do/ seem to dislike him, but I think there's more to it:

[[http://www.tor.com/2014/01/15/erased-by-time-and-blockbusters-the-cautionary-tale-of-ron-weasley/]]

And then sure enough we have all these H/Hr stories that favor the movies over the books. It doesn't help that they're all more or less the /same/ story of Dumbledore's manipulation, secret vaults, Ron's bad influence, love potions, etc. etc.

Needless to say, a good portrayal of H and Hr without any of those things is something of a rare treat for me.

EDIT:

(realizes who I'm replying to) ...such as Yule Time. Favorited that one years ago.
