I get where you're coming from I really do, but I still feel that Ron is a whiny bitch, "Boo hoo my brothers get all the glory." gets pretty old, and don't forget what a bastard he was to Harry during GoF, some friend. Also during the Horcrux hunt. He's not really a friend, he thinks he is, but in reality he's just leeching off of Harry's popularity and Hermione's knowledge, without them I doubt he would have passed his OWL's. He's what I call a reluctant hero, he was just at the right place at the right time.
