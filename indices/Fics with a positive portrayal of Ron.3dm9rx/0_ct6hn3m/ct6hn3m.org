ChipmonkOnSpeed's, Gryffindors Never Die and the newer, in-progress, Boys 'Round Here both have a pretty awesome Ron. Both have a fairly similar vibe: adult Harry and Ron travel back in time and don't bother trying to act like teenagers.

Quite a lot of fun, in fact I may go ahead and re-read GND now that I mention it.
