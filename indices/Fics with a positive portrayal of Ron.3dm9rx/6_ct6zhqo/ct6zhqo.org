In linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow), there is amazing interplay in the trio. The premise is that Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets, and then beautifully portrays the butterflies this causes.

In addition to having great characterization, it also has fantastic worldbuilding. A good part of my headcanon is taken from it.
