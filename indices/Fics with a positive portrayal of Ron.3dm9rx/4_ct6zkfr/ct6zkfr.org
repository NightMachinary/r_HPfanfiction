linkffn(The Price of Love by RogueSugah)

I'll make this recommendation with a few caveats, which I'll get out of the way right quick.

Firstly, the simple AGE of this fanfic (2004-2006) means you're likely to encounter multiple tropes that have simply fallen out of fashion in the years since. This also means, of course, that the fic is post-OotP at the most.

Secondly, you have to be able to live with the author's form of dialogue, which can be a bit shouty even when it's just internal dialogue. For me, it works though, because it seems consistent with Ron's character and age to be a bit internally confused and constantly changing his mind/arguing with himself.

If you can get past that, plus other issues I'm sure I don't remember thanks to my rose tinted glasses of remembrance, this is one of the few longer stories I've read where Ron's good intentions are honored and recognized, despite his faults.
