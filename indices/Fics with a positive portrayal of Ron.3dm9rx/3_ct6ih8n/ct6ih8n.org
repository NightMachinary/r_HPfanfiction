For a competent, politically savvy and all around good guy Ron check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] by Solstice Muse. It is post-war Ron working as an Auror. Harry is a periphery character in this story and doesn't get much screen time. It's a surprisingly good story.
