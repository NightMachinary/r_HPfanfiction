Felix Felicis is like steroids of wizarding world. Except it is insta-win.

It is illegal in tournaments, competitions, but why ain't it illegal for everyday use? I mean you could feed it to a homeless muggle and let him fight Voldemort. He would win, cause of Bullshit Luck.

It *can* be abused, but it's hell to make.
