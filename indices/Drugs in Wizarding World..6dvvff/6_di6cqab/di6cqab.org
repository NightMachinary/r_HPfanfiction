I see Muggle Drugs working fine, but I would expect Magicals to be more on Hallucinogenics and Pain Killers, and not potions. I see them taking Raw Potions ingredients and using them in different ways, like Snorting Bicorn Horn, soaking and then drinking/eating Grindylow Livers, Stuffing Leafs of some plant in their cheeks like they would chewing tobacco.

I could also see a additional market for those who take weak poisons and then holding out as long as they can before taking a Bezoar. A mix of Thrillseekers and those who like the particular feeling of what ever side effects their poison (They would probably call them "Kickers") of choice is, and how the Bezoar ("The Grounder") interacts with The Kicker
