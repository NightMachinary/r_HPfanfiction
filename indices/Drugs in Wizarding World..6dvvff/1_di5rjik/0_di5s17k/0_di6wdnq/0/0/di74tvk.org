I don't think we know of any magic in the Wizarding World which is straight up illegal. The Unforgivables are only illegal when cast on another human being, i.e killing, torturing or mentally controlling a human being is illegal - doubly so when using those spells.

I would assume then that rape is still illegal in the Wizarding World. What magic, if any, you use to do so is irrelevant (well, unless it was an Unforgivable). The act itself is illegal, and you will be punished appropriately. And so Wizards see no need to restrict particular spells or potions as illegal - it's how you use them that matters.
