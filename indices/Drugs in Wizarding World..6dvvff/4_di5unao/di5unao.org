I think that muggle drugs would work on wizards and they could probably abuse them all the time considering that they have magic and can probably just reverse and side effects. Wizarding drugs I think are going to either be super well known, going to be unheard of, or its just going to be people abusing medical potions and the ones that you listed. That does raise a very good question on what happens when you take a love potion yourself instead of giving it to another person.
