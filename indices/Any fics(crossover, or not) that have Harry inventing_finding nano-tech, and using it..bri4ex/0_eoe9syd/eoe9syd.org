linkffn(Lady Archimedes) has Hermione using nanotech in the Battle of Hogwarts, but it's a fairly minor point. It's also a sequel to linkffn(The Arithmancer).

If you want a fic where the main character is a science genius who uses STEM to do superpowered magic, those two fics would likely fill that void, but if you want exactly what your question is asking for those two fics don't fulfill those criteria. That said, I would only recommend them if you like Super!Hermione, Sue!Hermione, and Stations of the Canon being met even though the main character is smart enough to predict them first.
