And I have some self-recommendations if you don't mind. Here he is in December of 1981. I plan to do a whole Employee of the Month series about his years of loneliness, poverty, and poor health between the wars, but for some reason there's not much call for stories like that, so I got a bit discouraged from posting.

Here he meets Tonks. We don't know when Dumbledore restarted the Order, so there are various dates that would fit into canon. Here I have him ramping it back up in 1993.
