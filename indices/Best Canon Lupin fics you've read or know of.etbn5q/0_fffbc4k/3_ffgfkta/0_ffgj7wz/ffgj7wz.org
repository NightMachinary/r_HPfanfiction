Aw shucks, you're embarrassing me.

If you don't mind an incomplete story, this one's sort of a prequel to Employee of the Month. I get creative with lycanthropy symptoms, which I justify by saying that Rowling didn't give us a lot to work with. I'm torn between just posting the ending and doing a massive overhaul first, since looking back, I see room for improvement.
