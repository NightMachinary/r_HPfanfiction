Ok I need to tell you! I just read the employee of the month all in one session. And Oh my God! I Love it! Wow! I really really can't wait for more in that series. I hope you still plan on writing it!! It's so original and just wow. Thank you. I love how you implement pottermore Canon into it and all the little details about the order, Kingsley and alastor! And the oc. Beautiful. Also I love the welsh details you have for Remus!.... Well the meantimeI'll just need to read humansplaining again!

Edit: you don't come across as fishing for compliments but you do deserve them. :D Keep on going you!
