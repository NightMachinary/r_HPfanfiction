This is one of my absolute favorite stories, it's technically in the perspective of Hermione but she's sent back to the marauders era by Remus and he's a main character in the story. (It focuses on all the marauders but mostly Hermione and Remus with Sirius). I really like his character development in this story from his younger years. It also has Tonks in the later chapters :)

The author does a good job of fitting the plot into cannon and explaining how Hermione was able to avoid being recognized in her original timeline at Hogwarts in 1991.
