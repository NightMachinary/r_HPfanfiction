Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is about Sirius breaking out early and raising Harry. While he and Harry chill out in Grimmauld, the entire wizarding world panics because a mass murderer just managed to break out of Azkaban and kidnap the Boy-Who-Lived. Remus and Tonks both play major roles in the effort to hunt Sirius down.
