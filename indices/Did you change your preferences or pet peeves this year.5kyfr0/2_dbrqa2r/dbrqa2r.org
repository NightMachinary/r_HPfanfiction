My number 1 pet peeve becomes slavish canon rehash, more so in time travels. That's my primary reason why I soured on my former favorite "Backward with Purpose: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650).

The "Innocent Series" by marauderlover7, linkffn(9469064), starts out fairly well, but the author still forces the plot back to the TWT canon rail. I mean why? Why couldn't they develop some original plots?

"Lady Archimedes", linkffn(11463030), is written by one of my favorite authors, White Squirrel. This story develops a super Hermione, and yet the author always forces the plot back to canon rail. It's very frustrating for me. [[/spoiler][For example, the DoM battle played out differently than in canon and Hermione really shined. Voldemort knew this, and for some unknown reasons, didn't target Hermione, and still tried to go after Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance as in canon. Why?]]

--------------

The CoS event is a major example why sticking to canon is a bad idea. In canon, only through shear luck wasn't anyone killed. Also, if either Ginny and Harry had slightly more common sense, they would tell another adult about the Diary. Furthermore, if Arthur Weasley didn't get the Muggle Protection Act passed and tried to nail Lucius Malfoy, Malfoy had no reason to give away his Lord's precious item. Suppose any of those conditions had changed, things would play out very differently. Nowadays, Year 2 is my litmus test for how much canon rehash an author wants. I highly value fics that try to develop original plots for that year, some of the examples are:

"Applied Cultural Anthropology, or", linkffn(9238861)

"Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance", linkffn(10991501)

"Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434)

"Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past", linkffn(9932798)

--------------

Then there is the famous 'mandatory' TWT, Moody-impersonation, graveyard resurrection plot. A few days ago, I asked for completed fics that begin in early Hogwarts years, but do not have that particular plot rail in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kb91z/rant_and_request_looking_for_fics_that_begin_in/][this thread]]. The result is quite disappointing.

I don't like the Book Moody impersonation plot at all. Only through an insane amount of luck did Barty Jr escape detection. Regardless how many questions Barty Jr could ask Moody, it would be very difficult for Barty Jr to cover all venues of potential security questions. The risk of being uncovered and the consequence of such a failure was unacceptably high. A far better solution would be to impersonate his dad, who could both get to the Goblet and have direct access to important Ministry officials. In addition, no other people knew his dad better than him, and he got to fool the Marauder's Map!

Unfortunately, VAST MAJORITY of fics that cover Year 4 still went along with the canon plot. Even more infuriating is the fact that many fics developed a super!powerful!smart!Harry in the first four years, only to have him still falling to Wormtail's stunner in the Graveyard.
