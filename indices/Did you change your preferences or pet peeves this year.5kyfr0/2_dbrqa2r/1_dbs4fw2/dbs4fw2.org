Yeah, I hate that in all the time-travel re-dos Harry is so scared of /changing the timeline/.

Knowledge of the timeline isn't really needed to get out safely. You have perfect knowledge of the state of things /right now/, so use it. Talk to Dumbledore, tell him you're 35, put in a litte bit of proof, or to Lupin if we have an evil!Dumbledore for some stupid reason.

Take a few smart people, get the Horcrux in the shack and then blast it away. Dumbledore never dies. Make sure Voldy never gets resurrected (or does so later) because a few more years of peace are nice. The diary: Either take it from Ginny in Diagon Alley, or in Hogwarts and then take the secret passage out and apparate over to Gringotts and put it in your vault. Take the Diadem with you when you're on it. Or better yet, hide it in the chamber, Ginny can't reach that while not possessed and if you're friendly to the basilik it'll help you destory the Horcrux, or else accio a rooster. Then you can destroy it easily.

But letting a Basilisk loose is a bad idea, generally.
