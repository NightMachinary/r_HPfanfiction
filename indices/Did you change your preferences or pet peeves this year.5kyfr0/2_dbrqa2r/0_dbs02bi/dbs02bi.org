I agree with your point that authors tend to stick to canon even though the plot should have definitely diverged through a plot altering event. E.g. Harry not being raised by the Dursleys. This would change the plot entirely as Harry's personality would be vastly different depending on who raised him. This would then lead to Harry being sorted into a different house and having different friends. If harry is sorted into a different house he doesn't become friends with Ron and Hermione. He also doesn't join the quidditch team in his first year because he doesn't have the confrontation with Malfoy. A lot more things would diverge because of these instances yet somehow authors still have him friends with Hermione, join the quidditch team etc etc. It's really infuriating because a lot of authors have good idea's that could completely change the plot yet they are so hell bent on keeping it canon compliant.
