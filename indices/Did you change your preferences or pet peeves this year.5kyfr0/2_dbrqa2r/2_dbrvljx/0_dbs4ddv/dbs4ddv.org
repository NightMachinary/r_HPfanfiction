  Yet despite those clear statements, when you are presented with a series of events within Hogwarts that indicates that its inhabitants are receiving less harm from situations than would normally be the case, your reaction is not "there is something magical causing it" but rather "Aha! Look how badly this has been written! Everything is just luck!"

I guess for me it's the difference between showing and telling. It's all fine and dandy to tell me that Hogwarts is safe. But I won't believe you if the next book involves a murder plot at your super safe school.

The world of Harry Potter is new (or at least was when I first read the books), and I need something to base what I consider "normal" on, and a few lines about how safe Hogwarts /should/ be aren't enough.

This happens also a lot of complaints I have about stories in general (not just canon). Characters in my mind are characterized about what I see him do. [[https://youtu.be/9rleGD8gGd4?t=2m30s][It's like the CinemaSins comment on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone]]:

  Hermione: Harry, you're a great wizard.\\
  Cinema Sins Guy: Listen, if Harry's such a great wizard he would have performed at least one spell this movie.

EDIT: Also, it doesn't matter if it's ancient spells or sheer dumb luck that save the protagonists, it feels like a cop out. Coming up with an explanation to a deus ex machina doesn't suddenly make it go away; that explanation needs to be integrated into the storyline. If it was ancient magic that saved the day, it would be cool to see this incorporated into other scenarios.

The whole plot point around Lily's blood protection went from Harry being saved by luck to a major part of the series that was incorporated into both Dumbledore and Voldemort's future plans. That in my opinion is an example of what would be a "cop-out" nicely integrated into the story and world.
