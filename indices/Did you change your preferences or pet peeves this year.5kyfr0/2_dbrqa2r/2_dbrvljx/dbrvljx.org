  The CoS event is a major example why sticking to canon is a bad idea. In canon, only through shear luck wasn't anyone killed.

I think this is the perfect example of our different approaches to the HP books. You seem to /want/ there to be problems with canon - you take joy in finding what you believe to be failings and errors and do not seek out any kind of way to explain those apparent failings, instead being satisfied with your cleverness in having found what you believe to be a problem.

Case in point: we are repeatedly told that Hogwarts is a very safe place. Snape, in OotP, explicitly tells us:

#+begin_quote
  the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them
#+end_quote

Yet despite those clear statements, when you are presented with a series of events within Hogwarts that indicates that its inhabitants are receiving less harm from situations than would normally be the case, your reaction is not "there is something magical causing it" but rather "Aha! Look how badly this has been written! Everything is just luck!"

It seems to me to be a rather sad approach, seeking to destroy and tear down rather than to find ways to elegantly tie everything together in a manner that is constructive and consistent.
