Hogwarts safe? Gimme a break!

Year 1: Headmaster used the school as a battleground to lure the worst Dark Lord in centuries amid hundreds of students/children.

Year 2: One extreme dark artifact escaped detection and was possessing a student, unleashing a super monster that could kill with one look. Can you imagine how many would have died if this thing got into the Great Hall during a feast? Current headmaster knew the monster already killed one student 50 years ago, knew that student's ghost was haunting a bathroom, and knew another student was being framed for the murder. But that headmaster didn't bother ask the ghost what killed her and where the monster came from, and he didn't bother to clear the other student's name. 50 years later, attacks began anew, and all teachers were running around baffled until one 13 years old solved the mystery in an entry level creature book. Safest school? LMFAO!

Year 3: Crazy Ministry posted soul sucking monsters around the school to catch one prison escapee. Nobody asked the question if that escapee was able to escape in the first place from those monsters undetected, what were the odds those monsters could detect him again? Animagi also severely comprised school safety this year.

Year 4: DADA teacher, one of Headmaster's best friends, was captured and impersonated by a Death Eater. The school apparently had no protocols against polyjuice, imperius, and dark artifacts. Safest school?

Year 5: Ministry minion Umbridge was torturing students, enough said.

Year 6: Headmaster willingly let a Death Eater carry out acts of murder and sabotage. He repeatedly rejected warnings from a concerned student. Two other students were almost killed. If that 'concerned student' didn't take precautions on that particular day, could you imagine what would happen if Fenrir Greyback got into student dorms?

Year 7: The entire school was turned into a torture camp.

Hogwarts was a safe school? Its record spoke a different story.
