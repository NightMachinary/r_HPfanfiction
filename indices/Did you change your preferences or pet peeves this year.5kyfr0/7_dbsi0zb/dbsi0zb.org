I used to not like "teenagers acting like adults." After some soul searching, and reading various fics with more realistic teenagers and children, I have concluded I give zero fucks.

Harry speaking formally (and archaic) while lecturing the Wizengamot is preferable to hearing teenage girls make constant genital jokes (thanks, Taure).

As for preferences, having been battered with politics all year, I am no longer able to tolerate biased authors coloring their writing. This year, I found in particular Lady Khali's "Well Groomed Mind", and Starfox's various works, especially distasteful. While I do not have anything against political fics, I think, unless you are writing a manifesto, it is the duty of the author to not let your own views color those of the characters.

I tried to read Well Groomed Mind a few weeks ago and I almost had a conniption when Harry started lecturing Dumbledore about quoting Jeremy Bentham and how utterly awful the ideology is and blah blah blah muggles see through this horrible thought and how dare you value the greater happiness over individual happiness you bigoted neo-nazi grindelwald wannabe - Sorry about that.

tl;dr: if you want to have political undertones in your fic, I don't want you siding with one of them. I think every Slytherin Malfoy friendly Harry story is written by a hobbyist Klan member frothing whenever he's forced to write down the cursed "mudblood" word... but the other side is just as bad. If you want to deal with a topic as vast, deep, and important, as ideologies and politics, you're going to have to do it properly. If one side is just a puppet for you to bask in your superiority over: [[/r/politics]] is that way -->

For a pet peeve: looking at the top fics published this year, there's a lot of Fleur. Lungs on DLP said this three years ago:

- Harry/Fleur: *THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.*

If you can't write romance, don't write shipping. If you are only decent at romance, don't pick the most unlikely pairing in the whole fandom. Blaise's mom is more likely! (thanks again, Lungs!)

Looking further on the list of new fics, I must ask this one thing: Fuck off with your idiotic "gamer" fics. This concept is possibly the worst one yet. Having the characters read the books while making crappy jokes? Preferable to this.

What else? I don't want to think about it. Maybe 2017 will be better. Sadly, J.K is seemingly trying to necro the franchise, which will infuse the fandom with new blood: more tropes and more shit. While the wealth of fics we have is kinda nice, I'd much prefer not having to wade through 98% of Robst quality shit to find readable ones.

Worm may not have a lot of fics, but at least the majority is readable. Thanks a lot, teenage girls.
