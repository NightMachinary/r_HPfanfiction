Eh, you know. JKR set Voldemort and his goons up as bad guys. There's not a single redeemable thing in their entire ideology. That's strange, because I can think of no other ideology like that.

Oh wait.

I remember now. JKR started writing children's books, and transferred into YA. Neither of these genres are known to have interesting and realistic villains.

I suppose if a fanfic writer sets out to do the same, having mockeries of bad guys could be acceptable. Even then, it feels cheap. No work of fiction was ever weakened because it had fleshed out villains. The same goes of fanfiction.
