You don't need to try and make racism and bigotry less revulsive and evil than they actually are to have a fleshed out villain - that's what other parts of a character are for. Love for their family, honour according to their ideals, wit and charm, understandable motivations (loyalty, fear, revenge), greed, and so on.

For example, "Divided and Entwined" has two POV characters joining the Death Eaters during the story, but not because they think all muggleborns must die. Both are driven by circumstances, and a few bad decisions - as well as understandable fears of being killed by the other side. In the same vein, the "good guys" are on a slippery slope, since no matter their ideals, the means they are using, and the mere fact that they are in a nasty civil war, will cause them to consider or even commit questionable actions.
