I came from not liking magical cores to really, /really/ not liking them and then to absolutely despising their use. I've never seen a fic that used them well as a core point of the fic, and if they used them well the cores could've been just not mentioned at all without anything changing in the story. So, yea, 2016 made me hate magical cores to previously unknown degrees.
