I believe Harry said no to Slytherin because of Malfoy, and Hagrid and Ron's subtle bias against the House.

Gryffindor is the only House for canon Harry, because he's not cunning or ambitious, he's not hard working(he is mostly loyal), and he doesn't care about learning. Harry went to Gryffindor because it was the only one left.
