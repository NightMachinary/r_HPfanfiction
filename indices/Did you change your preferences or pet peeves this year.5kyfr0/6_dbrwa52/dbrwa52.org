I've come to get a bit annoyed by Slytherin!Harry. I don't mind it, but seeing it over and over again is a bit tiring. It's starting to seem like a chance for people to bash the Weasleys and Dumbledore.

The hat said Harry would do well in Slytherin. That Slytherin would lead him to greatness or whatever. Why does everyone assume this means he was secretly meant to be in Slytherin? Slytherin is mostly the house of ambition and cunning, right? Well, maybe the hat was just saying that Harry would learn to be an ambitious person in Slytherin, which would lead him to the so-called-"greatness". Maybe it was just a test. What better way to gauge if someone is truly an ambitious person than to tease them with the chance for "greatness"? A huge theme in the books is that your choices make who you are. Harry /chose/ to be in Gryffindor for a reason. He never wanted "greatness". He always wanted to be an average dude who happily moseys along through life, even before Hogwarts.

I don't know. I'm all for changing the house he's in, and even his personality if it makes sense. I just wish there were less stories where he's all angsty and dark and completely out of character for seemingly no reason.

Wait a minute.

Didn't the hat ask Harry about Slytherin because he specifically said he didn't want to go there? Like, the hat said, "What house should I put you?" and Harry kept repeating, "Not Slytherin!" and then the hat tried to ask why? Because if that's the case maybe the hat wouldn't have even put him in Slytherin. Gah, whatever it doesn't matter. I'm just rambling at this point.
