The story did have a potential to became “Ocean's Eleven” of HP universe, but unfortunately it isn't. There's no intelligence in any heists. The approach is always the same: break through the wards, then just go through each room collecting infinite amount of valuables. If meet someone, kick his or her arse.

An of course Hermione “Everyone-licks-my-arse” Granger.
