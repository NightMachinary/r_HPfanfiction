Of course they have things to hide. But actually breaking into their hideouts is a straightforward affair once you found them. They don't tend to hold dances which you use to enter and then slip away, or have a very active social life. At least the two hard targets they hit during the conflict with Voldemort didn't.

In the story, Hermione had to learn everything - curse-breaking, disguise, playing a role, scouting - while Fletcher was the expert and her tutor. It's only in the most recent chapters that she's "graduating", so to speak, and finally has the skills to break into the old manors, for which more complex plans are needed.

In a similar way Harry and Ron have started to rise in the ranks of the Auror Corps, putting their training to use.
