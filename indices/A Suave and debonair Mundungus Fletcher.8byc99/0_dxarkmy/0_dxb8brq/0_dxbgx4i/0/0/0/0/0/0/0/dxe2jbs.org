I don't see any point in detailed reviewing of your story here. I just shared my opinion and it's up to others (including you) to agree or disagree with it.

Still I think I can point at one more, the biggest, plot hole in the story: absence of any competition. If a home schooled child with some support can break into well protected houses and steal literary everything, there's nothing that stops teams of experienced curse breakers from making /very easy and very big money/ with doing the same.
