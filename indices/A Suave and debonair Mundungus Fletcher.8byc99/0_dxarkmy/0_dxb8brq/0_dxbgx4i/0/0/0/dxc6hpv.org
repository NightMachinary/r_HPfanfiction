Yep, everything for your Heroine.

Reading your story at some point I wondered why she's bothering with some schemes? She can just go in the center of Diagon Alley and start throwing AKs at random people. Because she's your heroine it's guaranteed that *all* her targets will be Death Eaters, murderer, rapists, etc. and no one will have any concerns for her actions, may be someone will bring her a glass of juice in case if she's thirsty.
