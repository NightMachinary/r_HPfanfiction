You've just repeated my initial point: in the story everything is designed for Hermione's benefit: meaningless wards any good curse breaker can walk through undetected with just a wand, shrinking spell nothing can protect from for her to be able to carry literally everything, switching-through-the-walls spell only she uses to steal purses with money, undetectable animagi no one knows about, looking-through-the-walls artifacts no one bother to protect from, incompetent aurors with the main purpose of being puppets to Old Families and so on.

An example of that in your latest two chapters: [[/spoiler][she's just robbed the supposedly well protected Dark artifacts store the Old Families had dealings with. In the end it was so casual that you didn't bother to provide any details how your Heroes dealt with internal defenses, traps, secret rooms and containers]].

In the real world Fletcher wouldn't be the only criminal curse breaker, Hermione wouldn't be the only one who can form a team she can trust.

But your story has nothing to do with the real world and I fully understand that.

Edit: example has been added.
