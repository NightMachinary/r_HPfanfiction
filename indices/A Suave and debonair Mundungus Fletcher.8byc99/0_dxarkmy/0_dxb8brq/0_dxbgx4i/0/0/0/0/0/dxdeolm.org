My points have almost nothing to do with the plot, but the author's attitude. Hermione is her (or his?) big crush and it's clearly shown through the story: she's getting everything she wants too easy (the magical system is designed specially for her); everyone around her silently eats any shit she throws; she isn't questioned even once about justification of her actions, she is right by default; when it's clear she is in the wrong the story totally ignores it; etc.

The points you provided are just plot devices, they don't affect her character at all.
