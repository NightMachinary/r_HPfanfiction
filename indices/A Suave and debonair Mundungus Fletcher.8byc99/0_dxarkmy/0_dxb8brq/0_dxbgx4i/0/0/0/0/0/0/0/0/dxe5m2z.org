See, that's why I don't really take your criticism seriously: You make up shit. It wasn't Hermione, but Fletcher who did the heavy lifting so far. And he's an expert thief - not an average Curse-Breaker or "a home-schooled kid with some support". And even he hasn't hit the Old Manors easily. Not to mention that Curse-Breakers who are in that league might not be inclined to enter a career as a thief if they can make great money working for Gringotts, or good money with far less risks working for the Ministry. Not that there are that many good Curse-Breakers. And as I said: It takes more to break into an Old Manor than going through the wards. They have defences that some dark wizard or vampire simply can't afford or lacks the support to set up. A single criminal who doesn't or can't trust anyone else simply can't offer the same challenge as an Old Family like the Malfoys in good standing with the Ministry.

And as the story shows, neither Hermione nor Harry and Ron are average kids. All of them are very talented and have been trained for years by the very best in their fields. After completing their training, Harry and Ron outclass the vast majority of the Aurors and Hit-Wizards from the get-go. Hermione is a prodigy in Curse-Breaking. They're far above the average wizard and witch who has trouble casting a Shield Charm or duplicating items at will. Yes, there is a lack of competition for wizards and witches of their talent, but those who are in that league make very dangerous competition.
