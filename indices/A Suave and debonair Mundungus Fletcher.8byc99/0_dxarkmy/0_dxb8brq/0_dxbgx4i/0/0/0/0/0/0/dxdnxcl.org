Hermione wants to tell Harry her secret, but Sirius is blocking that - and she owes him too much to go against his wishes. The magic system isn't "designed for her", whatever that means; it works for everyone the same, but she and Fletcher are the thieves the story shows. Once Harry and the other Aurors assault a dark wizard hideout you'll see that they deal with the wards in the same way.

And as the story shows, her grades suffered compared to canon because there's a vast difference between studying at the best magical school in Europe and studying at home with a single tutor. Harry and Ron outclass her in defence easily. And no one really "eats her shit"; nor does anyone follow her wishes - often quite the contrary. She's had to wait for years to get her revenge, she's been slandered in public, and even her shot at being exonerated has been foiled by Malfoy pushing through a pardon for her, which still leaves her as a convicted criminal on record. She can't even start a relationship with Harry because of her secrets.

As far as "questioning her justification" goes: Yeah, neither her tutor, who's a thief with an axe to grind against the Death Eaters after the death of his family nor Sirius who spent a decade in Azkaban due to corruption and abuse of power and doesn't like the Ministry and the establishment at all really question her wish to take revenge upon those who wronged her. That's pretty much logical, given their characters and backstory. On the other hand, Harry does question her views, albeit unknowingly, each time in conversation when he reaffirms his belief in following the law to enact justice. But to question her plans to her face one would have to know them - and only those who agree with them are in the know. For now. (Not that such soul searching has much of a place in a story about Aurors and thieves matching wits anyway.)

As far as all her targets being dark wizards and Death Eaters - so far, she, Sirius and Fletcher acted on Dumbledore's orders and intelligence. It shouldn't be a surprise that he wouldn't send them against innocents. Not that there were that many break-ins anyway. But heck, some people even complain that she hasn't had a guilty conscience because the dark witch whose home they were breaking in was stunned when she attacked them. Call me biased, but that kind of drivel I can't take seriously.

So yeah, if your complaint boils down to "Dumbledore didn't send them to the wrong, innocent target" I'll ignore it. If you claim that she's getting things too easily - that's your opinion; I don't share it. She's taken a long time to reach the point where she can now start her revenge (years, and almost 40 chapters), and already there are more complications building up.
