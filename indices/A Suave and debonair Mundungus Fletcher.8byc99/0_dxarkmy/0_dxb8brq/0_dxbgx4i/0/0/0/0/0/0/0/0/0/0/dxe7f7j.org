See, once again you make up shit. Stuff is protected from the see-through-walls spell (which, incidentally, is used by Harry and Moody) - but not everything is. (It wouldn't be very useful, anyway, if everything were protected.)

Wards aren't meaningless, but if they couldn't be broken through, the Potters wouldn't have had to go into hiding, and the first blood war would have played out very differently. And if you couldn't break through wards without getting detected, then the entire "thief" theme would have been rendered impossible from the start.

The Shrinking Charm as well as extended pockets/bags are canon. That the average wizard can't cast a shield charm is canon as well; at least my Aurors can do that.

I didn't mention how Hermione and Co. went through the defences of Borgin because Borgin isn't in the same league as the Old Families. His shop isn't a fortress, doesn't have centuries-old wards, and special defences. Hell, in canon, Harry appeared there by accident, and overheard Malfoy undetected. It's a shady shop, and I didn't show how it was burglarised because it wasn't that challenging for the crew. "Well-protected" is relative.

Also, Wizarding Britain is rather small compared to the real world - in canon, it's so tiny, 3000 people, that Fletcher might as well be the only real thief. In my story, Fletcher isn't the only criminal Curse-Breaker - just the best, in Britain at least.

Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't average, they are exceptional. Just like Snape, Dumbledore, Sirius, Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jr and Moody aren't average wizards and witches either.

Because this isn't a story about a couple average kids winning against the worst Dark Lord in Britain's recent history thanks to luck/author fiat. This is a story about a number of extraordinary people fighting against other extraordinary people.
