You don't need a "casino grade" plan for the average wizarding home - or a lone vampire/dark wizard hideout - nor can you actually use such a plan for most of them. That'll be different when the crew starts taking on the old manors of Malfoy and co., where you need more than just time to break through the wards because they have far more resources than wards and traps - and the DMLE on call. Those are targets you need more complicated/sophisticated plans for, and that's what the crew's been working up to.
