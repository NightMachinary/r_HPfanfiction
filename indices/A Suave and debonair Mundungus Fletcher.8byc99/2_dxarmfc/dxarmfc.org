Actually there is one story where Harry, who was victimized by the ministry again, recruits Fletcher and his group of thieves to rob and cause general mayhem, difference is that Dumbledore actually supports this group, so much that ministry asks Dumbledore to stop his 'attack dogs'. Fletcher uses the term appropriation expert/consultant for thievery.
