Issue there is that all those jumping to conclusions moments were mostly understandable and that Hermione and Ron jumped right along with him.

Snape jinxing the broom? Hermione's idea.

Snape going for the stone? All 3 believed it.

Malfoy opening the Chamber? All 3 believed it, and Malfoy shouting "you'll be next mudbloods" gave them a fair reason

Hell, in GoF, Ron bitches out Harry for ages because he jumped to a stupid unevidenced conclusion about Harry entering himself.

All together, it becomes very very weird when suddenly everyone goes full skeptic about something much more plausible than either their past incorrect assumptions or the frankly insane reality of Hogwarts - the idea that now of-age son of the Dark Lord's right hand, who's been aiming for a Death Eater spot his whole life, and is now namedropping Fenrir Greyback inside a Dark Artifact store, might be a Death Eater/up to something - and decides Harry's paranoid.
