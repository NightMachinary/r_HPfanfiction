But Harry often jumped to conclusions throughout the books, blaming Draco and Snape for all types of stuff (hexing his broom, opening the chamber of secrets,...) and he was usually wrong. If he blames Draco for every bad thing that happens around school, I don't think it's that surprising that they doubt him.
