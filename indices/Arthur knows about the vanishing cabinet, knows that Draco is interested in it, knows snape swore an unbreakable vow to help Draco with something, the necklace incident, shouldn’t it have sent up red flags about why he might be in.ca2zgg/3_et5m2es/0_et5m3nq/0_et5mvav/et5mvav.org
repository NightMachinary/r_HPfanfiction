Looked it up, and Harry tells Mr. Weasley about the cabinet twice, but is brushed off both times.

  ‘Mr Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?'

  ‘I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,' said Mr Weasley slowly. ‘You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.'

  ‘I think you missed something,' said Harry stubbornly.

  ‘Well, maybe,' said Mr Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr Weasley was humouring him.

  ‘Mr Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?'

  ‘I checked, Harry,' said Mr Weasley at once. ‘I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.'

  ‘Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked... but this is something different... well, something more...'

  And he told Mr Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape.

  ‘Has it occurred to you, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, ‘that Snape was simply pretending---'

  ‘It isn't our business to know,' said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now, and faced Harry across Mr Weasley. ‘It's Dumbledore's business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.'

Gosh, everyone falls into the "Dumbledore knows best, we mustn't doubt him" camp so quickly that it really /does/ sound like he's feeding them Compulsion Potion laced lemon drops.
