He investigated Malfoy manor and found nothing. I think that's taking Harry seriously. And Harry often blamed Snape and Draco for everything bad going on around school (like opening the chamber of secrets for example) and they were usually innocent, Snape even sometimes the one to save him (broom), so I don't think it's too much of a stretch to not believe him in something like that. Also, Voldemort did not usually mark students (obviously very risky) and grown ups don't usually think of students when they think of murder. And Dumbledore did ask Snape to keep an eye on Draco, which he did, but unfortunately wasn't enough. Dumbledore also would not kick Draco out for being a Death Eater, as he wants to protect students and gives everyone a second chance. Getting kicked out of school would lead students to Voldemort, as they would not have many other options...
