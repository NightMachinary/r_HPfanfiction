Hmm I agree with you on Arthur though I do think the fact he found NOTHING in lucius house shouldve tipped him off that lucius knew a raid was happening. I'm off the opinion that except for Arthur, Snape, and Dumbledore, there shouldnt be a single person in wizarding Britain that wouldnt take Harry's concerns seriously. Arthur checked and found nothing so that's understandable, snape and Dumbledore needed draco for thier plot to work so that's understandable, but to every other person in Hogwarts harry has never made a wrong move in his entire life as dar as thier aware. Only Ronald and hermione knew about draco and they both know that the only reason draco wasnt the one behind the pertrifications is by sheer chance and that he admitted to their faces that he would've if he couldve. Hagrid and mcgonagall along with the trio know about his suspicion of snape but the trio suspected him as well and mcgonagall was wrong as well that year by not believing harry about the stone being stolen. Hargrid could maybe not believe harry but harry is the sole reason he got out of azkaban so I think hagrid owes him a little credit. To evryone else though harry, successfully stopped Voldemort as both a baby and a 11 year old, found the chamber of secrets, saved Ginny and killed the basilisk, didnt put his name in the goblet but was falsely blamed for that and Cedrics death both accusations proven false later, was a successful and well respected teacher when umbridge was ruling everything, was right about Voldemort being back when the ENTIRE WIZARDING WORLD was telling him he was full of it, and is also the chosen one destined to be voldemorts enemy. I'm pretty sure the only reason he wasnt easily believe is that harry was supposed to be a jesus metaphor so Rowling had to make sure there was a ton of doubt even if it's all bullcrap lol
