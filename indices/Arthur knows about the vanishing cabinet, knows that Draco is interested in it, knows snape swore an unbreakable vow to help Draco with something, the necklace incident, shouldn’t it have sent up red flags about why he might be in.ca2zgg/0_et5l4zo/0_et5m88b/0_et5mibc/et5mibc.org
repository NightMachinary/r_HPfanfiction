But Draco was namedropping marked Death Eaters, and they should have taken that seriously, even if they thought it was a stretch for him to be one himself. His father was a marked Death Eater, and so was his aunt Bellatrix, who murdered Sirius right in front them last year. There's a chance he was throwing around empty threats, but his family relationship to several known DE's is undeniable, and shouldn't be blown off because they don't like him.

Everyone jokes about Draco's "my father will hear of this", but he's actually effective in making stuff happen. Lucius got Dumbledore sacked in Y2 during the petrifications, and had Buckbeak put on the chopping block for biting him.

Given his track record, I don't know why they aren't taking him seriously.
