What a strange place to visit. Do they take credits?

Anyways, if you're looking for logic and consistency in HBP, you're doing it wrong. The whole story is built up around several mysteries that slowly unravel at the end of the year, so the characters have to act stupid (to the point of absurdity or OOC) to give Harry a chance to figure it out himself. Dumbledore takes months to explain Voldemort's backstory, the teachers brush Harry off when Katie and Ron almost die, no one does anything about Romilda's roofies when Voldemort's entire backstory centers around a thirsty witch with love potions. You'd think that the theme of "unwilling love" would be more than a non-sequitor, when it's such an apt parallel to Lily's willing sacrifice, but it's just a one-and-done moment.

Similar to Tonks' patronus, which foreshadows the possibility of a witch losing her power when her love is unreciprocated. This plot point completely trashes Tonks' original characterization as a happy-go-lucky chipper Cockney, successful young Auror who managed to pass the training with a famously strict dark wizard hunter, Alastor Moody. For plot reasons, HBP turns her into a crybaby because a man doesn't want her. Lovely.

This lack of consistency goes the same for Hermione, "cleverest witch of her age", not thinking much about Malfoy potentially being a Death Eater, because he's /too young/, when he was literally shouting "Mudbloods, you'll be next!" at her when he was 12.

  "Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!" said Hermione. "Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!"

  Harry gaped at her. "I forgot! But this proves Malfoy's a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?"

  "It is pretty suspicious," breathed Hermione. "Unless ..."

  "Oh, come on," said Harry in exasperation, "you can't get round this one!"

  "Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat."

  "You're unbelievable, you are," said Harry, shaking his head. "We'll see who's right ... you'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry."

Literally the whole of last year had Harry telling everyone that Voldemort was back, and being called a liar. The next year, everyone forgot he was right all along, and are back to calling him a liar. Lol.

Everyone should have seen it. It should have been obvious, to maybe everyone but Fudge and Umbridge. But the needs of the plot come first, and character consistency comes second.

*TL;DR:* What is obvious and logical to you, is only obvious to HP characters if the story needs them to add something to the plot.
