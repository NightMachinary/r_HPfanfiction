I love coven! Unfortunately it's unfinished and at the point it was left, the Hermione/Theo tag hadn't panned out yet. He's an ally at best. And there are Hermione/Pansy femslash scenes even if their relationship ends up being platonic. And considering there's the Luna/Pansy tag too, that does fulfil the femslash requirements.
