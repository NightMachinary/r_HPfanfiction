Harry as a Baby only knew one real spell. It was also the only words he tended to speak. Just as Voldemort incanted the deadly Avada Kedavra, Harry pointed at the ugly Snake man and said "No u" and the curse flew back at Voldemort.

Later, as he was being left on the Doorstep by what would seem to any Muggles watching a crazy old man, Harry pointed at Dumbledore, and said "No u".

People were confused why a Baby was now Headmaster of Hogwarts, but when they realised it was Harry Potter, they assumed he couldn't do a worse job at least.
