When Harry received his first detention in his first year from McGonagall telling him "You're going to join Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest", Harry responded with a simple "No u" an soon McGonagall found herself by shadows of people that looked like men but they instead had four horse feet.

Later on Harry also received detention from Snape to write down the records of all the wrongdoers in the last decade. "No u" Harry responded and soon Snape found himself helping Mr. Filch recording all the bad things his high school nemeses did.
