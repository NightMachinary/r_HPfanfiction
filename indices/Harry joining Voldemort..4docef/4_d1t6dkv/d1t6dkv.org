You really have to give us more details. Do you intend to keep the canon early years and have Harry join him later? because that's kind of hard to see. But if you make it an AU - where Harry was sorted into a different house, or where he has much more resentment of the way he was treated during childhood (which he can blame Dumbledore for) - it would be much easier and believable.

Sadly, I don't know any /good/ fic that has done this.
