linkffn(Hit the Ground Running) does this very realistically with only one small change, which is that the Dursleys are slightly more cruel than in canon. After Harry frees the snake at the zoo with his accidental magic, his aunt and uncle keep him in his cupboard for a few days longer than they do in canon, with no meals. Starvation causes Harry to retreat into his own head, where he encounters the Horcrux, which is then able to follow him back into consciousness and start talking to him.

They have a falling-out when it's revealed Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but since he's stuck in Harry's head there's pretty much no choice but to find a way to get along. Voldemort is also Harry's only source of comfort at the Dursleys', he'll at least talk to Harry and answer his questions. He explains the murder by saying they were on opposite sides of a war and people die in wartime. He explains his political ideology to Harry as "wizards should be separate from muggles" and when he points out how the Dursleys treat Harry because he's different, ten-year-old Harry agrees with him. When the birthday letter comes, Voldemort tells Harry to hide it quickly and then they sneak away to London, so there's never any Hagrid meeting or anyone explaining how things work except Voldemort. Things spiral from there.
