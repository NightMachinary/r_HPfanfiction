  Voldemort won't be the insane mass-murdering psychopath he tends to be portrayed as.

You want to stick as close to canon characterizations as possible, but that's a pretty big change. Fortunately, there is a canon way around it: instead of having Harry absorb his horcrux, get Voldemort to do it.

Premise: Riddle wanted to change the magical world (more equality? more advanced? better protections from muggles? some combination), but was smart enough to recognize that it would take a lot of time to shift long-entrenched interests and customs. So he needed more time to live and see the changes through. Sadly, he chose to use horcruxes, which drove him insane. He always knew that his agenda might have to turn revolutionary and somewhat violent, but as he went insane, the violence became the goal, not the reluctantly used tool.

Story:

1. Graveyard happens as normal, but Voldemort gets the horcrux back - plausible, if it was an accidental horcrux stuck to a vessel that wasn't properly prepared. The soul piece may have been just itching to get reattached. Doing it when the wands connect seems like a good time, and if it's distressing enough, Voldemort is put out of action long enough for Harry to escape.

2. Voldemort may not have been sane enough to notice getting worse as he made more horcruxes, but the sudden and even violent reattachment of the soul piece is noticed. Despite still being rather insane, he's still smart enough to realize that he's in a bad situation. He feels enough improvement to recognize that he really, really needs the rest of his soul. It will be painful and require remorse, but he's a Dark Lord, dammit, he can do it!

3. Lots of changes ensue, the most immediate of which is what to do with his minions. Most joined Insane Voldemort, but More Sane Voldemort doesn't actually want genocidal thugs representing his revolutionary movement. Getting rid of Malfoy is easy, but what about the rest?

Problem:

It's been noted that Harry is unlikely to just accept rational arguments to join Voldemort, even if he is more Riddle now. A slower progression makes more sense, but the above would make that harder. But you have a great shortcut: Hermione! After all, any good, rational arguments would appeal to /her/ even more than to Harry - and she might listen, too. Prepare the way by shifting her to being more questioning of authority generally and "The Light" specifically. During 4th year, she can discover that house elves have been cursed to be slaves, something that "The Light" accepts without question. They can't be easily freed, but perhaps the curse can be countered (you'll need to explain Dobby, though). It's also easy to depict her as angry that Harry was put through the tournament.

All of this can create a foundation where she'd at least consider the possibility that Riddle isn't a genocidal maniac, or at least not anymore. He might learn about her and her relationship to Harry from Draco. He could send her some anonymous books over the summer. During 5th year, Harry becomes even more estranged from the Ministry and Dumbledore. At some point, Hermione learns that the stuff she's been reading were Riddle's original manifestos for change, written before he went completely bonkers. She doesn't agree with all of it (heck, even Riddle might not anymore - some of it was written when he was still at Hogwarts), but she doesn't find it distasteful, either. At some point she learns the true origins of the material. She doesn't immediately join him or anything, but he points her to independent resources where she can research his claims and ideas. Maybe that happens during the summer after 5th year?

I could see the Ministry battle still happening - after all, wouldn't Riddle still want the prophecy? And it's a way of getting rid of some of his less savory thugs, too. How to do it without alienating Harry may be tricky.

During 6th year Dumbledore reveals information about Riddle/Voldemort, but what if Harry knows enough now to realize that Dumbledore is being very selective in what he's saying - half-truths, which is par for the course with him. Canon Dumbledore is manipulative, there's no two ways about it. He has to be - he's a politician and a general during wartime. But if you make him sincere in his belief that Voldemort can't be saved and that his agenda is simply horrible, then he's not an evilly manipulative Dumbledore.

Well, that's as far as I can get off the top of my head...
