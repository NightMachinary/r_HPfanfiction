Sorry, I should have specified this in the post. Voldemort won't be the insane mass-murdering psychopath he tends to be portrayed as. My original thought was more along the lines of what should be done to him, or what elements of him or other characters that would make Harry joining Voldemort make sense, and not be totally random.

Some examples might be, say, if Hermione, Ron, and Ginny abandoned him, or something like that, would he turn dark? Or would it require something more like a traumatic character-changing event (maybe something like the Dementor in The Lie I've Lived except bringing the Horcrux out to play and change harry instead of James.

Another example may be that in The Graveyard, Wormtail is punished by Voldemort for treating Harry cruelly and instead of torturing, and attempting to kill Harry, Voldemort attempts to win him over.
