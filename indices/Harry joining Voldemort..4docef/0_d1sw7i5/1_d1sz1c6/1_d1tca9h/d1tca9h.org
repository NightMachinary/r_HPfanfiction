I like the graveyard idea. You could also play up the Weasleys' casual racist/intolerant of muggleborns and halfbloods angle, especially when its just them and Harry. I can see them saying things casually that Harry would take as offensive towards Hermione and his mother, forgetting because Harry is a hero that he isn't a pureblood himself.

I'm fairly certain that all the 'muggleborn champions' in canon - the Weasleys, Dumbledore etc. are all actually purebloods themselves.

Canon Voldemort always seemed to me like someone who assimilated into a culture that he wasn't born into but which was still his by birthright - but also someone with a terrible youth in the muggle world. We don't see much of him portrayed neutrally, but we do know that he went back to the orphanage in his school holidays - you could make the argument that he was an extremely gifted wizard who nevertheless lived in both the magical and muggle worlds. Consider Hermione as a counterpoint to that - she seems to leave the muggle world behind in favour of the magical one entirely, and in the epilogue of DH, all the characters seem to be living in the magical world with magical jobs. Another weakness of canon is that we have no positive muggle characters at all. So you could argue that what seems to be Voldemort's ideology is in fact mis-represented to Harry by Dumbledore and perhaps by the Malfoys, who might be on the more extreme end of it, and to whom Harry and Ron take a personal dislike which will colour their perspective.
