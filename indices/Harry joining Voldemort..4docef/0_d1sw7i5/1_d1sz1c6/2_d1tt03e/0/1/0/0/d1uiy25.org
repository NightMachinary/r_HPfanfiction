I think having Ron as an antagonist makes the most sense because in canon he's so devoted to the light side. You could have Hermione as a neutral party out of loyalty to Harry as her first friend, maybe she could doubt Harry's decent until given reasonable evidence. That would create some tension between Ron/Hermione. Just don't make them antagonists by playing up their 'jealousy' and 'trusting authority', if they're going to be in your story make them deeper than that.
