I admit I didn't see your reply on the other branch of the thread, but the methods that you proposed still would qualify as bashing.

Anyway, maybe make the whole thing a tragedy that's nobody's fault but Voldemort's? The Manipulative!Dumbledore conspiracy theories don't have to be true to be highly persuasive, for example, so if Harry were to come to believe that Hermione and Ron were spying on him for Dumbledore, etc., he could shut them out, which would only make him feel more isolated and depressed in his journey to Darkness.
