I don't know if Harry has the temperament to be a cold, ruthless anything or evolve into that in this time frame. (Heck, /Voldemort/ may be ruthless, but he isn't cold. The closest characters to cold, calculated ruthlessness would probably be Snape and Hermione.)

Regarding the specific scenario, it could work, but I think that having things go downhill due to a coincidence and a simple misunderstanding would feel cheap, kind of like one of those romantic comedies where the plot could be resolved in 5 minutes if the two protagonists could sit still and have a 5-minute conversation to clear up the matter.
