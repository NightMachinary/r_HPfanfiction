That's an interesting idea, but I feel like if I did that I would have to turn Harry into a very bitter person. But I want to turn him into more of a cold ruthless general for Voldemort. The other problem is that it seems so overused, real or not to go down the whole "Hermione and Ron are spys for Dumbledore." Let alone the problem of getting Harry to believe that they would do that. If i do this though, i might be able to do it in a way whee its more like one of the final nails in the coffin. For example, maybe Ron and or Hermione catch Harry practicing dark/illegal/dangerous magic and report it to a teacher. The teacher asks them to stay after, Harry casts some sort of magic to allow him to eavesdrop and hears something like "keep up the good work we cant have Harry falling to the dark" which he interprets as them having been spying on him for a long time.
