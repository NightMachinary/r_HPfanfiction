I've seen examples where Harry is betrayed and sent to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. Personally, I'm not a big fan of that storyline, but it does work as Azkaban will change Harry's character. Your horcrux example could work too. Either Voldemort realizes Harry is his horcrux and seeks to protect and work with him, or the horcrux exerts an influence on Harry's personality.

My ideal storyline for this is to change Voldemort's character. To go into detail about the motives behind his war, to turn it into more of a political battle than killing muggleborn, etc. Then it is reasonable for Harry to support his politics naturally. This could come out in a graveyard scene if Harry realizes that Voldemort is not how he has been told by the light side. I can picture Voldemort explaining his politics and goals to Harry. And the Death Eaters in the Wizengamot being used to further his goals through legislation. Harry has always blindly accepted the light side's statements as fact, without knowing anything about the wizarding world beforehand to make his own opinions.

Anyways, hope that helps!
