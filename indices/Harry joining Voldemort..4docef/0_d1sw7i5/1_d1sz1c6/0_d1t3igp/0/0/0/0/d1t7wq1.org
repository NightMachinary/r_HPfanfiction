There's always the less is more route with it. Someone could say something about werewolves and Harry could inform them of his political opinion on Magical Creature Rights... except this opinion is Voldemort's and Harry is clueless as to why he has such strong ideas about things he has very little actual knowledge on. Which could lead to some interesting character development. Ultimately the answer could be as simple as "the Horcrux has different side effects on Harry than in canon".
