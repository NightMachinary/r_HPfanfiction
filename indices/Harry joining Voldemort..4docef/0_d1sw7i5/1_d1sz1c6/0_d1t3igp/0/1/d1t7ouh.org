I find the whole appeal to reason method to be pretty unconvincing, because Harry isn't exactly a rational kind of person, and appealing to reason is not going to change anybody's mind if you've killed their parents, no matter how good the arguments are. What I would like to see, though, would be Voldemort explaining his reasons to Harry many times as Harry slowly becomes convinced by experience rather than logic. That would be a big project, though.
