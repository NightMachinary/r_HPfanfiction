Voldemort tells Harry some huge (awful?) secret about the wizarding world in the graveyard. Harry doesn't believe him. Harry sees evidence for this secret back at Hogwarts or wherever. He is disillusioned, confused. Voldemort reveals more secrets. Harry becomes more and more disillusioned with his side and understands the 'truth' about the world he lives in and joins Voldemort. I think this method relies on making the wizarding world in your story corrupt and inherently wrong. But that gives you a tonne of possibilities.
