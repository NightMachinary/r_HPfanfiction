Are you planning to keep Harry and Voldemort the same as canon?

I ask this because I find it hard to believe Harry would join Voldemort without some sort of change from canon. That said, I've read some fics in which Voldemort is portrayed as sane and fighting a political battle to keep the wizarding world a secret from the muggles. Usual issues that cause Harry to support Voldemort center around protection of muggleborn children and removal from abusive homes. This is a topic important to Voldemort and Harry due to their pasts. Dumbledore is known to disagree and believe that family is important and to leave children in abusive homes. This could be the disagreement that separates Harry and Dumbledore, without Dumbledore being manipulative.
