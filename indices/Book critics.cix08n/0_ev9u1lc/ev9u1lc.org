Of first, not a book thing but rather a fanfiction thing : Why do you want to put the setting in the modern day? I mean, one of the best point of the book (and the reason why it aged so well) is that the story is not really set into time. Sure compared to today we know it's in the past, but the story would easily happen during the 60's or the 70's with just some minor adjustment. And I have yet to see a fanfic that put the story in modern day, but do it "well". Most of the time it's just an excuse so Harry could listen to whatever group, or cite whatever movie . . .

As for what I like with the books, it's the fact that the characters are complex and flawed (well outside of Voldemort I guess). It's something that is often changed in fic : I have some "Harmony" fics in mind with perfect Harry/ Hermione, and a Ron so bad it's a miracle he survived his childhood (both because he seems to stupid to breath, and even his parents should have seen he was evil and drown him).

Another thing that is really great with the book is that the universe really is magic. Sometimes when you are not really sure about what happen, you can say "magic" and it's work. You can't "explain" Harry Potter thanks to it and I think it's great.
