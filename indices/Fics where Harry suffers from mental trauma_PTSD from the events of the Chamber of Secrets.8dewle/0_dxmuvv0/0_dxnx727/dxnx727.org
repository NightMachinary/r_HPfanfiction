It's not what I call a ptsd fic, but I'm currently writing a variant of Furyvore's linkffn(The Goblet's Surprise) where everyone /else/ gets a firsthand view of all three end-of-year adventures and takes it very badly indeed.

Still in the revision phase, though.

Now that I think about it, though, I remember a oneshot where Harry developed a phobia of gloves because he knew he would have died if Quirrel had been wearing gloves that day.
