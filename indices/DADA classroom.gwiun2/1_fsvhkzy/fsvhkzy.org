"Welcome to 6th year Defence Against the Dark Arts. While you have all evidently passes your OWLs to with high marks to get into this class, grade inflation due to the low quality of teaching over the years means that tells me little about what you actually know. The only ones of your previous teachers to leave notes were Professor Lupin and Professor Moody. The former were burned by Professor Umbridge for being written by a 'filthy half-breed', and the latter were apparantly cursed, and are being held as evidence by the Auror office. Discussions with the other staff members suggest that you have a total of 2 years of competent teaching and some of you did self-study for the practicle portion of the OWL last year. While this may have been enough to scrape you through the exams, I can't begin to teach you the NEWT syllabus until you have the foundations."

"Unfortunately we don't have much class time, as I am somehow expected to teach 12 classes at once. This will mean that I will be setting pre class research for you to do, which we will then discuss together. I will be picking on individuals for answers to make sure you are all keeping up. This will be most of your homework, as while you should be able to be trusted to set your own study habits, the lower years still need to have their essays read, and feeback given, so I don't have time to mark many of yours."

"The course structure is roughly split into two areas: magical creatures and defensive magic. Unlike the OWL syllabus, magical creatures are the small part. Much like before we will be working down the list of creatures focussing on identification and basic handling stratergies. If the creature requries a specific spell to be used on it, I will try and obtain a specimine to practice on, but otherwise this will be purely theoretical. For defensive magic I will first ask you to reasearch the spell before the lesson. We will then discuss what effects it has, including indirect and in conjunction with other spells and tactics, and when, if ever, it is permissable to be used. We will then move to the room nextdoor, which has safety charms placed on it. Depending on the spell we may focus on casting it on yourself, an inanimate target, or a living target, normally a pig or monkey. If you just need to know the countercurse, then I will cast it on a living target, and you will attempt to remove it. Even if they are nominally safe, we will not be casting NEWT level defensive spells on eachother. Not with one teacher and over a dozen students."

"Yes Miss Granger?"

"You may not practice these spells in your own time. I would suggest reading up on the incatiation and wand movements in your own time. The only teachers qualified to oversee that are myself, and Professors Flitwick and Snape. We all have seven years of classes to plan, for me from scratch, teach and mark class and homework for. In addition we have school patrols in the evenings, detentions to oversee, and in their case theoretically head of house duties. I suspect it will be a toss up if I reach the end of the year without my heart giving out from caffine overdose."

"You may begin the test now. You have until the beginning of next class to hand it in. While this isn't strictly exam conditions, I am only using this as a guide for what to teach you. If you pretend to know what you don't, I will simply not cover it in class, and you will struggle later on."
