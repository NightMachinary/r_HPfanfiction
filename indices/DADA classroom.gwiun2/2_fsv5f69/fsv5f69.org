*Example:*

Jackie Coteau was nervous. She'd been nervous ever since the older years started talking the previous night. As someone who'd just started her first year at Hogwarts, she had the strictest curfew and could not stay up long, but someone in her year -- Michael? He sounded like a Michael. She'd need to ask him -- asked about teachers... That's when the horror stories started.

As a Ravenclaw, she was mostly safe in Potions, being neutral in the Slytherin-Gryffindor war as she was -- and wasn't that a surprise! Half the school in open conflict with each other! She could also suffer through the Nap class with professor Binns, and while the necessity of self study for History was a bit disappointing, it was nothing she could not handle. Astronmy, Charms and Herbology had, in general receieved glowing reviews, being praised as interesting and the teachers as experienced. Cheatng was discouraged, duh, but with some effort they would be enjoyable.

And then the nightmare started. Defense Against the Dark Arts. Whether it was spoken is quiet whispers or shouted exuberantly, the effect was the same -- there was never the same teacher for two years, and the quality varied a lot too. Not a single one had managed to avoid a grim fate either. Cursed to death, locked up in a permanent residence ward in St. Mungo's spell damage wing, serving life sentence in Azkaban prison, obliviated of his whole life, eaten, rendered into potion ingredients, exorcised, burned alive, Kissed by a Dementor... Apparently Remus Lupin had set the record for the swiftest end... and the least brutal.

He was ‘just' revealed to be a werewolf a day before the opening feast, vacating the position and sending the Ministry into a tizzy. Headmaster Dumbledore had barely said four words at the ceremony and left in a hurry right after to continue his search for a replacement. There were bets going on how long that would take. The position was rumored to be cursed, and the visible lack of applicants certainly led credence to the rumors. Jackie wondered who'd be this year's teacher. Or what. A Dementor? A Boggart? A talking animal mascot with wish-granting powers?

It turned out to be a retired Auror, which was a disappointment in some ways, and a relief in others. Professor Donald Dross was old, was the first thing she noticed when the teacher entered the classroom. it had been left open for them to file in, but also lacking a teacher until they'd all gotten small talk and seating arrangements out of the way. It was to a silent classroom that Professor Don walked into.

“You're small!” cried out one of the newest Hufflepuffs. He'd be mocked for this outburst for years.

“Makes for a smaller target, don't you think?” replied the professor, unbothered by the disrespect. “Being hard to hit is a good thing, you'll surely agree?”

And indeed, where her peers had been expecting another Mad Eye Moody, a veteran of thousand battles with scars to match... Professor Dross didn't have any. He was small, wrinkled, grey -- he almost looked like a dwarf, except too well groomed to possibly be mistaken for one -- but he lacked a single injury. No missing limbs. No gouged out eyes. it was as if the only one to attempt harming him was Time... And Time had given it up as a bad job after first attempt.

“Now, I see you have your books out. Please put them away, we will not be needing them today.” Jackie realized he had been speaking the whole time and frantically stuffed her book into her bag, instead retrieving her parchment supply and writing utensils.

“The books you have were chosen because they are considered a good reference guide to what you will need to learn to do well on your exams. We will review them towards the end of the year, and you will occasionally be asked to read and summarize, verbally and during class, a chapter in place of essays your other professors are so fond of. I'm not -- your parchment belongs to you, and I recommend you either use it to note things you think you might forget otherwise, or save it.

“This is not an essay writing class, this is Defense Against the Dark Arts. My job is to ensure you can keep yourselves safe once you leave this school, and this will be my main focus during those lessons. My secondary focus will be to tell you what you wish to avoid, and what to do to keep the bureaucrats from bothering you over self-defense.” professor kept pacing in front of the blackboard, and Jackie could only see a glimpse of him now and then before he was obscured behind a student or a piece of furniture again.

She had to admit, she'd not like her chances fighting him. In open space and yet hidden from most of the class, most of the time, he'd be able to hex them all before they even knew what was going on.

“And since this class is all about you defending yourselves... Miss Coteau, what would you do when confronted with a hostile adult wizard?” Drat, she'd been zoning out again. What was the question? Attack, right?

“Hex them, sir?”

“Any hex in particular?” he asked, sounding amused.

“I don't know, sir” Jackie answered.

“And that is a problem, isn't it?” continued the professor. “You do not know, so while you're busy trying remember the spell to use, your opponent is already casting, and that, as you might see is rather problematic. Not to mention, anything they cast will probably be stronger and nastier.

“Let's have ourselves an experiment here, shall we?” the professor spoke as he transfigured a few tables into a dais with stairs leading up to it and climbed it, becoming fully visible for the first time.

”A Stunning Spell is the standard means Aurors use to capture their opponents. it is cast like this...” a demonstration followed, and quite a bit of silly wand-waving, but by the end everyone succeeded in delivering a feeble red beam upon a wall.

“Now, cast on me. One, two, three!” the wands flashed, the spells streaked through the air... And did absolutely nothing. He smiled.

“As you see, even if you get spell right, if you put no power in it, it will have no effect. Additionally, it has become rather common to charm clothing with at least mild protective properties, it prevents wear and tear of everyday use. Most of you did absolutely nothing wrong... But my protective clothing and greater magical power reduced the effect rather well, don't you think? “ he chuckled ”Most wizards will shield or dodge, though. “ he added.

Looking at the class he clapped his hands and as if summoned by the sound a cup of hot chocolate appeared in front of winded students. Professor waited for a few minutes, then resumed the discussion.

“Any other ideas?” that started the avalanche and resulted in the students missing half of lunch, but they were all in agreement; worth it.
