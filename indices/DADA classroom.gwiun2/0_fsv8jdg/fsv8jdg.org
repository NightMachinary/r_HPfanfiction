First off I think your 2.5/6 is too high (i'm assuming your ratings are Lupin-1, fake moody-1, and Snape-0.5). Quirrell is either a zero or just barely above, Lockhart and especially Umbridge are not zeroes they are actually negative. As not only did the students learn nothing in class under Umbridge they were actually commanded to not use any defensive magic so they lost what skills they may have earned in previous years as they couldn't practice. And while Lockhart didn't restrict the students practice of magic he didn't provide them with actual defense books just his storybooks.

Fake-moody had to be a good defense teacher or his cover would have been blown. Now Snape may have known the subject matter he still is a lousy teacher so I wouldn't give him full marks. So I would rate the years as Lupin-1, fake-moody-1, Snape-0.75 for a rating of 2.75 but then you have to factor in Quirrell-0, Lockhart- -0.5, Umbridge- -1 which leaves you with a 1.25/6 rating.

Now the story Laughing all the way to London by JacobApples has a Time traveling Harry take over the Defense teacher position teaching in a fairly unique way in my opinion.

The crossover story Protecting Harry by Fairywm has Xander Harris in the HP world and has him take over the defense post.
