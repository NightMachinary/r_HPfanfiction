Its cute that you think anyone else other than jk rowling actually owns anything here.

On a more serious note. I think anything other than blatantly copying someone's fic and claiming it as your own is fair game. I mean fanfics, on it own is already “expanding” or “adopting” rowling's intellectual property and to be salty for someone doing the same for a fic is hypocrisy. I do believe a line has to be drawn somewhere but if it's something like me reading a timetravel fic, then thinking i could do better and writing it with my own twists, then there shouldn't be anyone other than rowling with moral highground to call me out on that.
