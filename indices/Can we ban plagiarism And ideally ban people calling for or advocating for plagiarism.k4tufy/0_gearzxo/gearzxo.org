Sure, plagiarism is bad. However...

  I'd personally say that "expanding" or "adopting" someone's fanfic without their permission is stealing their content.

That's not plagiarism. That's just writing fanfiction of a fanfiction, so the author of the first fic really has no moral high ground. Unless the expanded/adopted version contains text lifted straight out of the first fic, of course. But an "unapproved sequel" is perfectly fine.
