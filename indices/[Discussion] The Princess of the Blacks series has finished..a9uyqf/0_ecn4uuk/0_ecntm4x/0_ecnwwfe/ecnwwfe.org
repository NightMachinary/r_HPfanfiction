The third chapter has a bunch of characters laughing and joking around with a pedophile, literally immediately after they find out she's one. There's an initial shock and outrage and then a few paragraphs later they're mostly over it.

Sirius finds out Narcissa was fucking his child goddaughter and is remarkably calm about it. I don't view that kind of behavior as the story making it abnormal.
