When I hear the word "Headcanon" I think of my interpretation of the Canon as is. My Headcanon is the Verse as I think of it, not necessarily as it actually is. That can be as simple as assuming spells get easier as you use them, and as complex as assuming the DH are products of experimentation by the Peverells. And that the Merror of Erisid, the Original Pensive, and the Veil came first.

But, weather or not it's Canon in the end, it may or may not be my interpretation, and therefore my Headcanon.
