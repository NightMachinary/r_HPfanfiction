For me, headcanon means things that I think happened that weren't explained explicitly in the books or by JKR. Like, I have no evidence for it, but part of my headcanon is that James was Quidditch Captain his 7th year, concurrent with him being Head Boy (the latter of which is canon).

I would say that fanon is a widely accepted something but that's not confirmed in the books or by JKR. For example, I read mostly James/Lily fanfiction and I would say that it's fanon that the Head Boy and Girl have a separate dormitory and/or common room just for them. Most people in the community (at least in Jily fanfiction) accept that this is true, even though we have no solid evidence toward it. It doesn't conflict with Canon and it's more than one person's theory.
