I think what makes it fanon is that it is actually used in the fanfiction community despite not being canon. I don't think the compatibility with canon has much of a part in it.

For instance, the nobility in wizarding Britain is fanon, although we know there's none in canon. It's not compatible with canon and yet, it's fanon. Same goes for the benevolent goblins.
