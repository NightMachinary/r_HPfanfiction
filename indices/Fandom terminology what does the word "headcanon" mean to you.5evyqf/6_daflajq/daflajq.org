In fact, I don't really see the need fo that word. To me, it means "something that may or may not be supported by canon, that I consider canon". Generally, it seems to come from personal interpretation of some canon evidence. It has to be at least a bit controversial, otherwise we would call it canon. For instance, you could consider the fact that Luna's a seer to be your headcannon, based on the fact that she talks funny and yet she seems to be often spot on, or that phoenixes are sentient beings. I think the important thing is that there's a part of interpretation.
