Headcanons are typically held by a person or a smaller group; once they start becoming more pervasive they become fanon.

Relation to canon in both cases is completely irrelevant; things are not demoted from headcanon/fanon status because they contradict canon, whether they explicitly go against it or whether they get Jossed by new material.

(Interesting topic--I'd never realised that it could mean anything other than this!)
