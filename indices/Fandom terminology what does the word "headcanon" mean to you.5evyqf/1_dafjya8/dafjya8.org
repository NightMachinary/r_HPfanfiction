- fanon: something treated or put forward as if it is canon, but isn't. either because it isn't explicitly stated* or contradicts canon. e.g. lucius malfoy has long hair and a cane, draco has blue skin

- headcanon: something that isn't explicitly canon, doesn't technically contradict it/can fit seamlessly into the universe, and put forward as your elaboration/contextualisation of canon, as opposed to a claim that it /is/ canon. e.g. snape is an ABBA fan

- word of god: jkr's headcanon (more or less)

*- (i guess here you can substitute saying 'that's fanon' for 'that's your headcanon')
