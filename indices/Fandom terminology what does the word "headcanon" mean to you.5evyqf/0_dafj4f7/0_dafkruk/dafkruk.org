I think your definition of headcanon is a bit different to some other people's.

I think it is generally used just to say that they like an idea, maybe to the point of wishing it were part of canon. In this case something that is fanon could be someone's headcanon.

I would say that the difference between headcanon and fanon is that a headcanon belongs to one person, whereas fanon is everything that is not canon, so contains everyone's headcanons.
