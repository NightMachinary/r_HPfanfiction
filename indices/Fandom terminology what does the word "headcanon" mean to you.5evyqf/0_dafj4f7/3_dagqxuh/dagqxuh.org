I have to say that my definition is the same as yours, with the caveat that what is “implicit” is to me stuff that both makes sense and is not contradicted by explicit canon in any way but does not necessarily have to be “supported by explicit canon so strongly that it might as well have been stated”, and I'd held it to be the de facto definition of headcanon.

But I do not get the notion of using it to call anything regardless of it being contradicted by other stuff. Because really, using it for fanon that someone likes makes no sense to me as the presence of “-canon” as a part of the word would only serve to confuse people if that were the case.
