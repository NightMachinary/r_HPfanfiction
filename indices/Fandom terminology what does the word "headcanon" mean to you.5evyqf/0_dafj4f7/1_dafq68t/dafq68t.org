This may be where the confusion comes in. People can think up elaborate canon "clues" and endless justification, and one person's idea of what constitutes proper support of a theory can and will differ from the next person's.

To me, any theory is eligible to be someone's headcanon unless it is ruled out by actual canon. People can believe whatever they like about the series until they are proven wrong. Sometimes their headcanon can even overcome canon contradiction if they believe in, for instance, an unreliable narrator.

Something becomes fanon when it is featured in enough stories that it becomes a commonly known trope throughout the fanfiction community. Fanon can and does contradict canon at times.
