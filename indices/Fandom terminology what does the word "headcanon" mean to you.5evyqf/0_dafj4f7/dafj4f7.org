For me, "headcanon" has always meant "the canon in your head", that is to say, your opinion of what is canon. This would consist of two main things.

Firstly it would include explicit canon that we see in the books. An example of explicit canon would be "Sirius dies in the Department of Mysteries". This must be part of what you believe to be canon because it's explicitly stated. There's no ambiguity that it is the case within the canon HP world.

Secondly it would include implicit canon that you have deduced and so exists only in your head, but you treat as if it were canon because you believe it is supported by explicit canon so strongly that it might as well have been stated. An example of implicit canon could be "studying magic makes spells easier to cast".

Thus my confusion stated in the OP. For someone to declare an idea as part of their headcanon is to say that they believe that the idea is genuinely a part of canon, it's just that we were never told as such. But if it's just an idea that a fan has come up with, with no canon justification, then it's hard to see how that could be the case. Liking something doesn't make it a part of canon.

Ideas that are pure fan-creations which have no canon backing or justification would be what I call "fanon". Some of these ideas may be canon-compatible fanon, but that doesn't make them headcanon, because there's no reason to think they are actually a part of canon.
