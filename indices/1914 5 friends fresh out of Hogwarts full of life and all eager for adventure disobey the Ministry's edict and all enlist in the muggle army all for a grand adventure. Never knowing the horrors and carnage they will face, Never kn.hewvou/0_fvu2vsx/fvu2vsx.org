There's something a bit like this in Lust over Pendle. Augusta Longbottom's first husband was a muggle she ran away from her family to marry. In 1913. Come 1914, he does his patriotic duty and enlists in the Accrington Pals.

Augusta was sufficiently incensed by the consequences of the Pals Battalions that no member of the War Office who had any part in the decision got a decent night's sleep for the entire rest of their lives. Unexplained twitches, strange noises only they could hear, persistent rectal itching, that sort of thing.

She did, however, stay in the muggle world long enough to learn to drive an ambulance in the Blitz, marry and be widowed a second time, and only return to the wizarding world to marry Neville's granddad.
