I never had any issues writing these scenes in which Magic is conjured not only from their Wands but also from our minds.

To me, these scenes of fightings must be grand. There must be a fluidity in them and the writing too, and it must, essentially, feel like a few minutes stretched into hours, without the tedious fillers of thoughts, conversation or some-such! - Other people may certainly prefer writing the sort of battles that are over with quickly. But, and that's what keeps me in this HP-Universe, its the magic that attracts and the magic that keeps.

I can't rightly say I have any favorite when it comes to these scenes, though.
