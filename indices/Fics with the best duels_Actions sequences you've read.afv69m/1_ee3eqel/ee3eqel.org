There are some pretty good scenes in linkffn(Significant Digits by adeebus). /However/, it's rather a long story /and/ it's a sequel to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is far longer, rather divisive (many love it, many hate it), and doesn't contain much of what you're after.

If you're OK checking out just the action scenes in Significant Digits without knowing all the background, then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/36/Significant-Digits][chapter 36]] through 38, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/52/Significant-Digits][chapter 52]].
