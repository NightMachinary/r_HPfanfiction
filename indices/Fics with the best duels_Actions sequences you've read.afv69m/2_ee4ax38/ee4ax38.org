In linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall), there are a ton of fight scenes that are easy to follow, but yet not simply just 2 duelers player tennis with their spells. There's a scene where Harry and Dumbledore both fight Bellatrix and Voldemort and the fight is choreographed well and it is easy to imagine what is happening.
