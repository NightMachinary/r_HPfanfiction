Here are a few advices I have collated from my searches and little experiments on the subject:

​

* Where: Set the scene of the fight by pointing out RELEVANT information. We don't need to know every little variation of elevation or texture, nor a detailed description of every small obstacle on the battlefield, but we need to know what's there. Especially things that will be integral to the progress of the fight. Ex: The fountain in the Dumbledore/Voldemort fight of OotP is setup well in advance (chekhov's gun) and its nature and location is well described before the fight. We also have a general idea of the atrium's geography, Harry/Dumble arriving from the elevators, Bella/Voldy on the opposite side of the fountain, the floos on another side, etc. (it can be useful to draw a little map when creating a fight)

​

* Who/Why: Before your characters start beating at each other in a glorious ode to violence paid in blood, sweat and tears, you need to make sure that the reasons and stakes of the fight are clear and well understood by the reader. It doesn't mean that you have to explicit it bluntly by way of exposition dialogue ("Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."), but at minimum we need to understand who is fighting, why and what would happen if one won over the other (these can be fairly implicit and logical in the flow of the plot). Sometimes these can be fairly straightforward (Ron Weasley/ Drunken excess of testosterone/ Nothing really)

​

* Choreography: The sequence of events (again, in a complex environment, it's a good idea to use the drawings of your location to map the approximate positions of your characters through time). In describing actions, it is (perhaps counterintuitively) better to remain a bit vague. The principle is very simple: words are boring. The reader's imagination will make 100 words of directions into a more badass fight scene than you could make it in 1000 words of painstakingly detailed description. ex: (Jumping forward, Harry threw all his weight into his elbow, wincing at the sickening sound of the masked man's nose turning into paste.)/(Bracing himself, Harry folded his right arm to his chest and started forward. Pushing against the ground with all his strength, he jumped slightly to the left of the man and sprung his arm to the side, his elbow connecting squarely with the masked man's nose.). By the way, for obvious reasons, this principle also applies to smut. After all, how many times did you find yourself reading through an excruciating number of cringeworthy details during a sex scene written by a young amateur writer? It's the same thing really, the power of suggestion will always prevail... we should call it the love and war principle.

​

* Sensory information: It's generally a good writing advice to use all of your character's senses to ground the reader into the story, this also applies to fight scenes (and smut). Sight is the default sense to describe an action, sound (Whooshing spells, exploding impacts, breaking bones, raspy breath, people insulting each other, a dying man calling for his mum, etc.), smell and taste (Harry tasted blood, the air tasted electric as pulses of magic exploded everywhere, the smell of death permeated the battlefield, Harry could taste the dirt), touch and pain (he felt the sweat dripping down his brow, menacing to reach his eyes and blind him at any moment, every step he took sent a searing flood of pain from the base of his foot to the back of his neck, etc.), and why not a magical sense too? you can pretty much use whatever you want as long a it's vivid.

​

* Pacing and climax (also applies to... yeah, you get it): Have the dramatic tension ebb and flow, end with a bang. ex: (SETUP) Harry arrives near a cliff where the bad guy stands /BUILDUP/ they begin to fight /BUILDUP/ Harry is stuck against the edge of the cliff (RELEASE) Harry uses a badass spell \DOWN\ He manages to get away from the cliff /BUILDUP/ Harry's arm is broken by a spell /BUILDUP/ He looses his wand (RELEASE) He throws himself to the ground to catch his wand \DOWN\ He gets it and return to a defensive position [...........] /BUILDUP/ They exchange blow for blow, Harry is desperate (CLIMAX) Harry throws himself at his opponent, tanking the Crucio he sent at him and puts a knife through his heart.

​

That's getting pretty long now xD, I don't really have an exemplary fic in mind, but I hope this helps a bit. Just keep your eyes open when you read good fics , good books or even watch good movies and you will find these principles (and probably more) applied everywhere.
