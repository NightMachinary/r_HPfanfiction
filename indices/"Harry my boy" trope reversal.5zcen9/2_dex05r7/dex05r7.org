It's sort of reversed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/132/Odd-Ideas][Chapter 132 of "Odd Ideas"]]. Dumbledore talks to Harry/Xander and calls Tonks "Nymphadora". Harry says that she wants to be called Tonks. Dumbledore says that he wants to be called "Albus" and that he will call her Tonks once she stops calling him "Sir", "Headmaster" and "Professor".
