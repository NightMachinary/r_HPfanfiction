I've seen this happen in a few, but for the life of me I can't remember which stories they were, and I doubt I'll be able to find them again. Sorry about that.

All I can say for sure is that this has /definitely/ happened, and that I remember Dumbledore (or McGonagall - maybe she was in the room too, I'm not too sure), reacting to independent!Harry's petulance by telling him that's not the proper way to address a professor, and Harry responding something like: "Oh, well I thought we were on a first name basis, you see."

I'm really sorry that I can't be of more help.
