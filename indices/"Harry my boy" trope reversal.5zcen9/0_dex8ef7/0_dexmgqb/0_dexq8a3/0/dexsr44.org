HPMOR has many great parts and many bad parts. What I didn't like was the loud "pseudo-science fuck yeah" and that Harry often behaved like an overexcited puppy. Ender's Game in contrast is much, much calmer. Ender is more calculating than HPMOR's Harry, who rushed into things true HP style.

HPMOR can't all be bad, or it wouldn't have much followers. Just like robst isn't all bad - he also just has flaws.

In the end it comes down to a lot of things, and while social validation is nice (If you read something popular, it's a good investment of your time, after all a lot of people did that too!) and comforting, finding and liking your own stuff is great.
