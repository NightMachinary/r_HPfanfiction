It's a power fantasy fic with a bunch of tropes and cliches, and literally everyone but Harry and a small selection of people are stupid as fuck. (I think the author's aware of this, and decided just to not hold back.)

It's really, really bad, but at the same time, it's... satisfying to read about Harry showing up the Establishment constantly. If you need a feelgood fic with Harry getting everything handed to him, then this is the fic for you.
