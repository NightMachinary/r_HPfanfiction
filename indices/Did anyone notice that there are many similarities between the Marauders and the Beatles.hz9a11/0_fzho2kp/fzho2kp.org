Fair comparison but I'm not sure when it's stated that Pettigrew was accepted in the group out of pity or whether he was the butt of the jokes. The only thing that it's mentioned about his relationship with the young James and Sirius was that he always followed them around. Also Pettigrew would have been himself a fairly competent wizard, despite Voldemort's humiliations, since he became an animagus at 15, was able to track down Voldemort (a feat that not even the elite Aurors couldn't achieve) and revive him. Of course, when we see him, he is so broken down by spending years as a rat and another year tormented by Voldemort's verbal, mental and physical abuse, but, despite being an unlikable character, he does have his unique talents.
