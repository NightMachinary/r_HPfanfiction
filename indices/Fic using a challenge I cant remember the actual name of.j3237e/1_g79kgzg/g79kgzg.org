Definitely reptilia28's challenge: Don't Fear the Reaper.

LeQuin had one called "Last Chance" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]]

Sinyk combined it with another challenge that brought in Daphne Greengrass. He's a little wordy at times, though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep]]

"Reboot" by Kallanit. Very loosely based on the challenge and involves Snape (non-romantically), as well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot]]
