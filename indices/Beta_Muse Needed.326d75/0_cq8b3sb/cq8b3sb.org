  I promise that I do--despite some mishaps--have a working understanding of English and *it's* grammar therein.

My beta comments for this post:

Good tone, and you're clear when you want to be. Not sure how much I liked the joke up-front. Comes off as a little cute, but I think I buy it anyway. You might be expecting a little much from a beta/muse/cheerleader all-in-one package.

Also, props for inspiring laughter at your own expense, but if you're going to laud your own grasp of grammar, you probably don't want to make the #1 Grammar Mistake Of All Time in the sentence in which you do so.
