I'll admit, English isn't my mother language, and it's nearly two in the morning, so muscle memory is definitely overcoming brain. As I have a case of 'the dumb' (and at the worst possible moment), it may be best I don't try to write anything important tonight.

I didn't mean it to sound quite that way. I just genuinely find I get things done better whilst talking to someone about them, and think that having someone question 'where is this going' might be helpful.
