I just finished "The Daring Win".

Tbh, I almost tapped out around chapter 5 or 6. I just wasn't being drawn in, and it was tough reading a story where I actively disliked the MC.

But I held on, and I'm glad I did! The fic made a turn for the better when Sirius showed up. An enjoyable read, thanks for the rec!
