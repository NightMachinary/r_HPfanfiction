I'm trying to remember...there was one where the old Egyptian Gods were actually powerful magic users who used assassinating evildoers to create "soul-jars" or horcruxes and thus, became immortal. They took Harry in...think maybe it was by Dr T?

Another one with Flammel...wish I could remember the name right off, took Harry in, made him his apprentice and then revealed the story. "How would you like to be the next Nicolas Flammel?" a la Princess Bride.

Sorry I can't think of names...if I remember I'll post links.
