  Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks

This one is really strange - enjoyable story that includes Super!Harry, SuperAbusive!Dursleys, boring parade of moving machines in the first chapters, dumb Malfoys unable to do anything AND overdoing crossover. Usually one of this things is enough to ruin fic for me.
