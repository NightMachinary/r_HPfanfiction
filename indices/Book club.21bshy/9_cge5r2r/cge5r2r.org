A suggestion that may improve longevity of the project:

With whatever story you pick it may be best to try to find an active author and reach out to them. I know that if I received a message of 'hey we're discussing ______ on reddit around ______ I'd probably check it out.

As a whole we're mostly interested in what people say about our stuff. So something like that could help spur discussion and keep things around longer.
