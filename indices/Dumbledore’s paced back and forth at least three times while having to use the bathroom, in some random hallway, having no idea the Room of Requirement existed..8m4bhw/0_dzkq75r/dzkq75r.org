I never believed what he said to be the whole truth. Seems more like that Rowling just either amended the RoR to fit his story, while also pretending that Dumbledore was hinting something useful to Harry, when in reality he knew where the RoR was and how to get in. Just didn't know ALL of its uses, perhaps.
