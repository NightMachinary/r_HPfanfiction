Yes, I said as much. My point of Dumbledore not knowing all of it uses, its simply because he probably didn't know the "Room of Lost Things" else he could've deduced the possibility of Riddle hiding a horcrux in it, considering the time it took for Riddle to get to his office and back. Its just a speculation, we simply don't know what Rowling wanted for Albus to know.
