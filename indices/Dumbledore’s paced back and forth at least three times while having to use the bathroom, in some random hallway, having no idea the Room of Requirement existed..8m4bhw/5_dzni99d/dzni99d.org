There seems to be a number of conspiracy theorys about Dumbledore being aware of the RoR but my thoughts on it have always been to take what he says there at face value.

The RoR and the Headmaster's office are both on the 7th floor, Dumbledore spends a lot of time in his office so it's not strange to think that sometimes he needs to stretch his legs. Dumbledore is an old man, is he going to climb lots of staircases up and down just to take a break from his paperwork or to do some thinking? Or will he just wander around the corridor his office is already on?
