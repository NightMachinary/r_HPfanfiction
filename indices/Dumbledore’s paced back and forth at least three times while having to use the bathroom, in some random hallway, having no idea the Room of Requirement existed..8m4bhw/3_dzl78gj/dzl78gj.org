I can see doing this myself.

Need to go to the restroom, start heading that way while thinking. A stray thought catches my attention and I begin to pace back and forth while thinking it out. Meanwhile the need to use the restroom increases but I ignore it while working out my flash of inspiration.

Without consciously thinking about it: having a restroom just appear would be incredibly convenient. And so it does.
