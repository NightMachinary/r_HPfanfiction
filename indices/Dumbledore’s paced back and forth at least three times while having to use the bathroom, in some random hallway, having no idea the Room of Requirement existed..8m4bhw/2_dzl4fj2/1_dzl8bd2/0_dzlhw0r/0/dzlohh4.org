Canon door is Hufflepuff, only revealed when you actually need the help and display determination to get it.

Gryffindor's RoR was guarded by a modified boggart that transformed into something like a dragon or nundu or whatever and students would have to battle it to progress- later deemed "unsafe" despite the random monsters never killing anyone and this RoR was bricked over by the Ministry around the same time the Triwizard Tournaments were canceled.

Ravenclaw's RoR wasn't really hidden or guarded or anything, it's just a random broom closet that acts like a random broom closet to anyone that hasn't gone through the Founder's little scavenger-hunt in the library and read between the lines of each book to get the secret.

Slytherin's RoR is actually the Chamber of Secrets, it's true purpose was only told to scions of noble families with the other more sinister rumor being spread around to ensure nobody too gullible for the House of Cunning would go looking for it. Unfortunately, all the noble families in on the secret died in the various Crusades (Because like any good chivalrous wizards of Merlin's tradition, they were all super-royalists even if they weren't too big on the Pope) before they got a chance to tell their heirs. Much later, Tom stumbles on Salazar's personal entrance hoping to find a monster to kill muggleborns with, so the RoR helpfully makes a basilisk for him.
