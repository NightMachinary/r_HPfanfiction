Somehow I get the feeling they would put baby harry with a family that they felt was safe... But for stop would have been the long bottoms simply because I think it was like 3 hours or so Actor James and Lily died that they were tortured so under the context of that they would take Harry to the long bottoms thinking they had a perfect place to put him they may discover Alice and Frank being tortured when they arrive with the placement.... That would have made the story interesting.. Particularly Considering is Harry had technically been placed in the Custody of the long bottoms and then they were tortured To insanity would that Then Both Harry and Neville his grandmother wards... Or would They then place him somewhere else because the Malfoy always claimed the imperious curse At that time So they weren't above suspicion Harry might Placed with maybe the bones Or perhaps the patel family?... Maybe the Woods or Thomas's or the Finnegan's
