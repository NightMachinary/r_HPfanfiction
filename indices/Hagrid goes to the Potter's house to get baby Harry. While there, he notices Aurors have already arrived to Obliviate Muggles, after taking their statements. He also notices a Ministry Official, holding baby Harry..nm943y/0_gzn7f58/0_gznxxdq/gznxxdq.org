  Sure there's the obvious ones, like he gets raised by who ever manipulates the system better.

  Harry Malfoy - Harry Dumbledore - Harry McGonagall - Harry Fudge

Or maybe Harry Crouch?

Harry Crouch, in true /Harry-Potter-can't-leave-anything-well-enough-alone-style/ manages to accidentally free his brother Barty Crouch, Jr from their father's imperious curse years before it happens in canon. Barty, weak and wandless, flees the house and searches out his old master and (eventually) manages to resurrect him- all before Harry finishes primary school. Voldemort begins to gather his allies and strange happenings begin again in the Wizarding World.

Crouch Sr is caught in a web of his own lies so he can't /tell/ anyone why he knows for sure that Voldemort has been resurrected. But he's always been willing to do whatever he must to crush Dark Wizards, and if he has to join Dumbledore's little vigilante group then that's what he'll do.

(Essentially, there's a reason why Barty Crouch Jr/fake Moody was a feared fighter in Voldemort's forces- he was taught how to duel by a father who dedicated his life to destroying dark wizards)

Fun bonus scenes!

-Crouch Sr enjoys languages and Harry speaks Parseltongue. He teaches Harry a language he knows in exchange for Parseltongue lessons (which may or may not work lol). Mermish would be cute, especially with a little kid basically screaming on land. Goblin or French would be more practical.

-Crouch Sr is responsible for putting away Sirius Black without a trial and that should ABSOLUTELY come up at the most angst-ridden, teen-drama, orphan-issues moment possible

Edit:: omg I totally forgot that Mrs Crouch didn't die until 1982. Oh lil Harry could be /so/ attached to his new family, the potential for heartbreak is exponential there. His family gets murdered Halloween of 1981, he moves in with his new family and just when he starts to settle in and he's fallen in love with them, he loses another family to death and tragedy.
