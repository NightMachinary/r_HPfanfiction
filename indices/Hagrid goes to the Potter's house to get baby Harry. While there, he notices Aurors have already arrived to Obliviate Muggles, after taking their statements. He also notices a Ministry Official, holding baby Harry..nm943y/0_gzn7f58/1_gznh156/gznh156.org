Nice, but I don't think he would remain ignorant after 11 years of age after attending Hogwarts with his scar hurting and as a wizard raised kid he would know that there's a famous scar on harry Potter's forehead. And if his scar wasn't popular and known than as a normal kid he would visit hospital wing and ask for headache potion or write to his family and they would have to tell him even if he had to keep it secret. And if somehow horcrux was removed when he was a kid than this line is plausible but still unless they do full adoption , his magical name would've harry James Potter for him to be able to claim his inheritance I guess.
