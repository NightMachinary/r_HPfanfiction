Could you imagine what could have happened if they had Placed little Harry with a new family. Sure there's the obvious ones, like he gets raised by who ever manipulates the system better.

Harry Malfoy - Harry Dumbledore - Harry McGonagall - Harry Fudge

But imagine the more mundane. Like for Harry's protection he just ends up an unknown child of some some small family. His inheritance is protected un he comes of age, but as far as Harry knows he's just John Doe, second kid of the Doe family. Grows up a normal kid, gets to Hogwarts having heard of Potter but not knowing that it's him.
