It wasn't my favorite story, a silly take on the flaws from Snape's point of view. Well a Snape that wants to be DADA teacher, really badly. Instead of trying to get rid of himself with the curse.

The story has a few Meta moments where Dumbledore calls Snape out on only complaining when he applied for the position. I liked the concept, but the execution could have been more fluid.

I did really enjoy the idea that Dumbledore is neither extremely incompetent nor all that manipulative. But just having to deal with what comes, and refusing to let Severus leave, and just being kind of lazy.

A more mortal version of him in a fiction is always appreciated.

An interesting bit that wasn't really brought up, is the Snape could have been trying to save Remus' life by revealing he was a werewolf. But that kind of reasoning is less funny.

In the end I smiled enough times while reading to make it worth it. Thanks for sharing
