Honestly I think its OOC. Snape really only applied for the position as a cover story for Voldemort. I don't think he would be too upset if he was turned down. His true passion has always been potions and I don't see him wanting to leave his brewing. I also don't see Albus casually disregarding Snape like that, their canon relationship was far from disrespectful.
