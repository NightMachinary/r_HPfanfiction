I seem to recall that Snape really wanted the DADA position and didn't apply for it just to maintain his cover as a spy.

(But gah... I'd have to reread the original books to back this up... Reading fanfiction can make things confusing.)

Anyway, it's only in fanfiction where the Mastery in Potions idea was invented. My impression of Snape from the books was that Potions was something he was extremely good at but his true passion was the Dark Arts.
