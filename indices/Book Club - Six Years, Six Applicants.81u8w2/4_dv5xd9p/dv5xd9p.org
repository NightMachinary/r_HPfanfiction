It's not funny enough for me to take it as a crack fic, and thereby excusing the horrible way that the characters aren't coming off as themselves. It's not serious enough for me to read it as a straight up fic in itself. Instead, it seems to be a meditation on the plot holes that the author saw in the original series, and I can honestly say that slogging through chapter one was bad enough, but chapter two took the cake.

"Why haven't you gotten around to removing that curse yer?"

I was rolling my eyes so hard by that point and noped out of the rest of it.
