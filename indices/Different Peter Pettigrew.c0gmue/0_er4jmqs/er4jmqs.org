Oh man, there's a good one that has this...I just don't remember the title. Just in case somebody else knows which one i'm talking about: Peter confesses to the rest of the marauders that he's a spy; he actually had a better reason for joining the Death Eaters too, so they forgive them and he leaves the Death Eaters. Arabella Figg is a witch not a squib and heads the Aurors. Bill Weasley volunteers to get captured and placed in Death Eater controlled Azkaban in order to lead an escape.
