Harry and Ron noticed that he left a trail of slugs behind him, with a lot of them still attached to his body. "Oi Harry, maybe the red lady heard about you and Neville having the same birthday and decided to have a go at him now" said Ron, a disappointed look on his face. "He's had a better time with slugs than you then" replied Harry with a smirk. "You should ask him for snogging tips, seems like he's got more experience than you now, innit?" jabbed Ginny with a giggle and proceeding to run down the hall, making Ron's ears turn as bright red as his hair./
