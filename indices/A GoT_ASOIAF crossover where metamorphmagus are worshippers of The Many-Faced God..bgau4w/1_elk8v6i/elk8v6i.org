Melisandre and Trelawney have a similar amount of correct predictions. Them meeting or even swapping places would be hilarious - Trelawney telling every king that they're about to face a horrible fate, while Melisandre picks a new "Prince that was Promised" every class. She then burns Dobby in a pyre.
