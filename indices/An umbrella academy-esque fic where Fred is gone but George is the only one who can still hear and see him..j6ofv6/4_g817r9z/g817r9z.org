'Nonsense,' Fred told her. 'I was a mischiefous little fuck and I want to be /celebrated/ as such!'

Fleur glared at him -he must've spoken through George by accident- , and continued: 'He died nobly and for a good cause.'\\
'What cause? I was just bored,' he quipped, and George sighted long-suffering. 'Shut up, will you? ' he hissed. 'Alright, alright, easy there,' Fred said hastily. 'Hey, at least this nipped any competition about women in the bud, so you should use the opportunity to chase that one woman.' /You'll be dead for a while,/George thought at him. /Plenty of time.'/ Fred chuckled darkly. 'I'll kick you out of bed in the morning, if I have to,' he promised.\\

'Don't bother trying,' Fred told him. 'The joy of being twins, eh?'
