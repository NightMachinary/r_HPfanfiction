I've seen a fic with that part before. It's not a very big part, but Fred is still around and both Harry and George can see him.

The main thrust of the fic however, lies in how Harry learns to grow up (primarily by angsting and going around in philosophical circles if you ask me) and culminates in a very abrupt and unforeshadowed power boost that suddenly ends the fic.

On the bright side, it Is completed. Not sure if I can just paste a link here, but here you go.
