'Should've known you couldn't make a joke to save your life,' Fred remarked to Percy as he floated upwards.\\
Percy seemed to see him for a second, he thought, as he remained at his twins' side. 'Just once I should've listened to him,' he told George, hoping, almost /assuming/ his twin could hear him. 'Even a stuck clock is right twice a day and all that.'\\
George gave no reaction watsoever. Fred circled around him. 'C'on, we're alone now George,' he pleaded. 'It's just Perce. We can talk now.' Still no response. 'Are you mad that I died without you?'

'I mean, I know it was stupid to assume that Perc would /ever/ make a joke, but in my defence, miracles have happened before. Hell, not two seconds before he actually /admitted he was wrong/, for what must've been the first time in his life.'

'Remember how we always said we'd do even dying together? We didn't get to do that, but I'll haunt you forever. I'll be your very own poltergeist. It's not a house-elf but,' he shrugged. 'It's the best I can do.'

'You're gonna be alone now and you're very bad at that,' he continued. 'So please, for my sake, don't turn into a miserable wreck. I won't thank you for that. Be there for Mum, at least, will you?'

He looked up at the light. 'Okay, I am ready,' he said. The light looked like a school of fish circling around above his head. 'Wait, heaven is...fishy? Okay, that's lame, even for me. Hey, I was always more of a practical guy. Is it the ocean, back to the beginning and all that? Did some creator have a nostalgia-filled midlifecrisis?' The fishes were just as unresponsive as George was, but they gave of the sense of rejection. 'Were those Egyptians right? Am I going to be weighed with a feather?'\\
The fishes disappeared.

'I am... guessing...that's a no, then. Although it can also mean yes. Lot like Dumbledore's answers then. But seeing as there is also no fiery hole to absorb me -much as I wished for holes to absorb me in Hogwarts, I'm guessing that's a improvement...-' Suddenly he was in Percy's bedroom. Who was, apparently, staring a hole into a picture of some girl he probably teased or would have teased him about only a few years ago. 'Here's your local Poltergeist looking to entertain, the friendly neighbourhood ginger!' Fred announced, assuming Percy wouldn't hear him anyway. Percy gasped.

'Fred?'

'/Surprise!/' Fred said awkwardly. 'Wow, that came out wooden, did I lose my sense for dramatics in there?'

'Fred!'

'The one and only, thanks for noticing.'

He paused, then added; 'seriously, I spend /ages/ trying to get George to acknowledge me. I'm not late to my own funeral, am I?'

'No, not yet,' Percy said uncertainly.

'I was /kidding,/ Perce. Jeez.'

'Why are you here?'

'I dunno, why are you trying to stare holes into a picture? New training in nonverbal magic?'

'She died, Fred. Why can't I see her? Why did it have to be you?'
