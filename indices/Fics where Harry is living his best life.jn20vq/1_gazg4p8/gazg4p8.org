Seven Normal Years of Harry the Hufflepuff: linkffn(12085137)

AU story where Voldemort's Horcruxes didn't work because making more than one is a Bad Ideaâ„¢, and the Dursleys don't treat Harry like he's something they found at the bottom of their shoe. Harry's just kinda vibing all throughout his Hogwarts years. Harry/Tonks pairing.

Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Exactly what it says on the tin, really. Between Harry being a dragon (and that being okay) and adults being competent, most of the canon plot is a non-issue.
