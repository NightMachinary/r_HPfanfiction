- I like linkffn(12551744), as much that I have started to use it in my story as a prequel,

- linkffn(2531438) is probably the only well written Vernon-is-a-good-guy story I know about, and it is really not bad

- linkffn(4067744) this starts interesting, I was not exactly eager on how it continues

- linkffn(6611208) I am not big fan of this one, too much Dumbledore bashing

- linkffn(2196609) ... this one is an interesting Harry-gets-Muggle-psychotherapy story

- linkffn(13106883) a little Harry decides that Petunia would love him more if he was like his Mum, so by accidental magic he changes into a girl; Vernon dies soon after, and Petunia starts to deal with the new situation; one of the united-Muggleborns-stand-against-stupid-magical-world; too much of helpful goblins and crap like that

There are some others but I cannot find them ATM.
