First-person works better for a more joking tone, where it feels like the main character is talking to you. It's also better for unreliable narrator shenanigans, where the reader's viewpoint is confined to what the character can see /and it's clear that the character might be mislead/tricked/. Of course, you can do this in third person as well, but it's less effective imo. It's hard to put into words, but read the first chapter of linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by JBern) and you should see what I mean.

Third-person is easier to do well, as it's more common (canon is third person, but so are most other published stories). You don't constantly have to filter events through what the protagonist can see and what they'd pay attention to.

As long as the author sticks to one (or has /all/ the transitions make sense and be clearly marked, such as a chapter that's a diary page from a character - switching to first person - and then continuing the story in third person afterwards) I don't mind which they use.

In a very few cases, first person is a major part of the story's flow. For example, linkffn(Pedestal by DigitalSkitty) [a Pokemon fanfic] wouldn't be as good in third person. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] [an original superhero webfiction] would be a lot worse, as a lot of the impact comes from the first-person perspective on events (the fight against Lung, for example, has a lot more emotional impact when you're looking through the eyes of a frightened girl, way out of her depth, trying to use insects to fight a half-dragon creature than if you're watching from the sidelines, as it were, even if you're still rooting for the same side).

As you can see, for good examples of first-person stories that immediately spring to mind I've had to go outside the Harry Potter fandom - it's that rare to find one that's not only well done, but couldn't be done as well in third person.
