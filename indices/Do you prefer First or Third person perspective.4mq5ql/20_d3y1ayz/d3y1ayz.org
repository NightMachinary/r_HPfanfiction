I think the question of person is partially dependent on the question of tense. First-person is harder to do, IMO, but it can be much more "personal"-feeling, more intimate, perhaps. It tends to work better in the past tense because first-person present tense is often perceived as a bit gimmicky (think of all those edgy YA novels that try to be cool and do this), but of course, there are good stories in first-person present tense out there.

Third person, on the other hand, can work well with either tense. If it's present-tense, it can be wonderfully immediate and dynamic, just as first-person can be, but a bit more "removed" from the action on the whole, and it inherently tends to have less bias towards specific characters' perspectives. Third-person past tense is perhaps the most neutral, the most "classic", because it's the one that's used the most often, and it can feel much less intimate than any of the others can. But of course, thousands and thousands of great stories are written in third-person past tense.

Second-person writing, I think, usually only works well in very short fics or vignettes, and it's very hard to really write it effectively without being too gimmicky. But if it's well-written, the tense doesn't matter.
