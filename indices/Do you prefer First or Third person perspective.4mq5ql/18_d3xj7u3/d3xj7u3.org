Third person is my preferred option. I feel that Third Person can accomplish anything a First Person Perspective can while being far less intrusive to the established style of the cannon.

On a mechanical level Third Person also removes the over dependants on "I", I did this, I saw that, I thought this, I arrived at... It's lazy writing. You can structure all those events in more interesting a varied ways in Third Person .

I also dislike the tense that First Person is written in. Third Person is all in past tense; he opened the door, he ran down the hall, he flew on his broom. I find it a more elegant form of writing as the First Person I've seen in the Fic community all has this breathless present tense style.
