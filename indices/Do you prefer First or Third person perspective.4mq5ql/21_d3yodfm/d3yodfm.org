A good writer can have a lot of fun with first person. It can read with great rhythm and works best with fics that can drop one liners well. A bad first person fic will get cutesy and tends to reveal OOC traits.

Third person on the other hand can be bad because sometimes the writer (including myself) has a hard time figuring out how deep you can get into a person's thoughts. This is where you get writers using the single quote 'thought bubbles' and combined with the omniscient narrator getting into everyone's heads this can get messy.

Overall I tend to prefer third person. I think it's because it's easy for an inexperienced writer to lose control of their character and introduce their own opinions. Less danger of of that with third person.
