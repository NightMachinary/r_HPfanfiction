I'll take the average Third Person over the average First Person any day. Conversely, I'll take a well-written First Person over a well-written Third Person 100% of the time.

I understand why people prefer third person to first person, but I'm quite fond of the present tense and the informal manner of prose: it fosters a greater understanding of the character in question, or gives you greater insight into their psyche than you would had a faceless narrator told you how they feel a certain event, character, etc. When done right, first person feels like a conversation between protagonist and reader; like you're at a bar sharing drinks and exchanging stories. You get more of the character's voice than you ever would otherwise, and IMHO that's far more engaging than anything third person can throw at a reader. But, generally speaking, first person and third person have their own merits and don't need to fight against each other. First person is generally a much stronger POV for use in comedies or character-driven stories, while third person tends to be more effective in event/plot-driven stories, such as speculative fantasies and sci-fi.

The issue ultimately is that first person is far harder to master than third person, which is why most might seem a little lacking compared to their third person competitors.
