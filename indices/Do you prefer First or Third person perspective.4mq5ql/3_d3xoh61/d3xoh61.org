Let us make a distinction between first person *past* tense and first person *present*. Good fanfics written in first person present tense are vanishingly rare, because they are surely written as a creepy self-insert for the author. It takes an exceptional author to plan well enough for this style of writing.

First person past can be done well, because you don't actually have to insert yourself in the place of the character. It can feel more like someone relating a story to you: "I poked my head around the corner and there he was, wand already drawn and mirthful gaze challenging me." It also helps when the author isn't afraid to drop the pronoun "I" when it's implied by context, which English is totally cool with.

In general, first person is difficult for most writers because it puts explicit limits on how time can flow, and also it makes writing suspense hard, because the reader knows everything the narrator knows, and nothing else. You can't see the characters walking into a trap and scream "No!"

Character exposition is hard to do well using first person narration because it's just awkward as hell for the narrator to describe themselves, "Harry looks into my shining blue eyes, before trailing his gaze across my trim hourglass figure, while his free hand gently teases my luxurious honey-blonde curls." Fucking /no thanks/.

There's a reason the majority of fiction is written in third person. It's way easier to paint a vivid picture of a world without sounding slightly strange.
