/You go to bed, but decide to watch a show on your phone just before going to sleep. You start the app, but instead of the series you see A SPOOKY SKELETON. you scream, but no one can hear you, because you're under the covers. in panic, you turn the phone off. BUT THE SPOOKY SKELETON IS STILL THERE. You come out from under the covers (it was getting a bit stuffy there) and head to the kitchen for a panicky midnight-snack. Look at the fridge. Now behind you. now back at the fridge. THE SPOOKY SKELETON IS RIGHT THERE! You scream and run back upstairs BUT THE SPOOKY SKELETON IS CRAWLING OUT OF YOUR PHONE! You try to jump out of the window but it's jammed shut. They're all jammed shut. The front door is locked. You're stuck inside and there's two SPOOKY SKELETONS approaching you.../

/No one knows how you died. And they didn't know that the next owner of the house would be haunted by THREE SPOOKY SKELETONS when he moves in.............../
