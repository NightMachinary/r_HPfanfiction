I think that first person can work, and it can even engage the reader more than a third-person fic with a similar plot, but whereas a third-person story can have any set of protagonists, the first person' story /requires/ that the point-of-view character be someone inside whose head you are willing to spend the whole story. It doesn't have to be a sympathetic point of view (think Humbert Humbert from /Lolita/), but it has to be interesting. Now, different things are interesting to different people. Those who want to spend several novels inside Bella Swan's head might not want to spend the time inside Taylor Hebert's, and vice versa. They are also situational. Relatively few people would want to spend a slice-of-life story inside the head of a Bella Swan who /doesn't/ meet vampires or a Taylor Hebert who /doesn't/ trigger.

With all that in mind, I don't know whether there are any characters in HP canon that are well suited. Harry Potter --- our everyman hero --- doesn't strike me as someone with a rich inner world; his motivations and plans are simple, and there is little thoughtfulness or hesitancy to him. This is not a strike against his character at all: if he were a character in a Shakespearean play, he might get the part of a decent, solid type like Horatio (from /Hamlet/). But he would get no soliloquies.

Every other canon character with even a vaguely defined personality has the problem that, because /canon/ is from Harry's point of view, and because the Harry--Voldemort conflict is central to the series, unless it's a pretty heavy AU, time-travel, or some other way to break out of the canon setting and general plot, they and the insides of their head aren't going to be central to the A-Plot; but breaking out of the canon setting and general outline ups the difficulty level of writing the fic.
