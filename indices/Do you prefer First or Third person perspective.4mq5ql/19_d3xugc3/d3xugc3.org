I love writing in first person because I enjoy narrowing the perspective of my stories and allowing my readers' imaginations fill in the blanks (incorrectly or correctly though, is the game!). However, I much rather read fics in third person due to the opposite. In third person it is much easier to build expansive, detailed worlds because you are not limited to one person's sight/knowledge.
