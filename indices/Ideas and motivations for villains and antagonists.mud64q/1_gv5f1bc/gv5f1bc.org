I had a few ideas many years ago when I was toying with the thought of writing a next-gen series myself but I'm no longer interested in it so suit yourself. Some of the ideas have been used in other fics and were better implemented than ever could but you choose what you like:

- A Muggleborn/Squib group disenchanted with the little progress that Magical Britain has made in terms of their rights so they want to eliminate all purebloods and establish a magicfolk/muggle breeding program so that in a generation or two, everyone will have magical powers;

- An elusive gangster that is suspected to have made a huge fortune through the use of dark arts. He is involved in a lot of philanthropic activities and basically Hogwarts was rebuilt from his donations. He is well-liked in the community but has a lot of Ministry people in his pocket. Harry plays a game of cat and mouse with him but eventually he starts targeting the Potters. Harry agrees to surrender in exchange of an Unbreakable Vow that he or his gang won't harm his family. Later the guy hears a prophecy that (in my case) Albus would bring about the ruin of his empire so he tries to find a way of getting him killed by promising him he'll set Harry free in exchange for completing several dangerous tasks that are meant to get him killed;

- A dark wizard who tries to steal the magic source from underneath Hogwarts accidentally unleashes a demonic being called the Father of Dementors who wants to enslave all human kind and use them as feeding source for the Dementors. Turns out the real reason for the Chamber of Secrets was to serve as a prison for this Demonic being which is a manifestation of all the dark arts practiced in the early days of Hogwarts and the Basilisk was guarding it.

- An overly-zealous DMLE head with ambitions to become the Ministry for Magic becomes paranoid about the usage of dark arts and institutes a very intrusive program to monitor them. While at first a highly popular measure, people soon find themselves in an Orwellian dystopia where even the slightest transgression can lend you in Azkaban or even on the death row. The guy eventually becomes a Big Brother-like figure;

- Quite similar to the previous one but this time it's Harry and the DA who ran a very corrupt government, which under the guise of enforcing an equalitarian society, they ban the use of magic for everyone except themselves. Anyone in need of a spell or charm have to present themselves to the Ministry and deal with a lot of bureaucracy, the fees are absurd and anyone caught using magic without Ministry permission is sentenced to death;

- Similar to the above but after the original trio is killed, a cult forms around their ideology of an equalitarian society without dark arts. They eventually take over the magical world and only members of the cult are allowed to practice magic and only for the betterment of society. However it is very difficult to join the cult and the whole wizarding world falls into disarray because people can no longer do anything by themselves.

Hope any of these would be of use to you.
