The last is not nuanced at all, It would be nuanced if they were in the wrong but since they are just defending themselves there is hardly nuance there. It would be nuanced if they went after an ex-DE that truly changed his way and shorta redeemed himself or someone that did terrible things under the imperious. They are correct by looking for Justice but is it truly Justice?
