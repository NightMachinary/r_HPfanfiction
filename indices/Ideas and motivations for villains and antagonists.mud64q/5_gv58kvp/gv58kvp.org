Do you want your antogonist to be clearly the bad guys, or do you prefer it when the story is more nuanced?

If it's the former:

- Capitalism. The villain have a plan to get money (as an example, some thiefs trying to steal Gryffindor sword), but Lily Luna gets in the way.
- Alternatively, a magical corporation (or just a secret club of rich people) are angry because, unlike her predecessor (sorry Kingsley), Minister Granger cannot be bought. They create a plot in order to "remove" her from her position, but Lily somehows discover the whole conspiracy and tries to save her aunt.
- Revenge: Hello, my name is [Insert_Death_Eater_Name]. Your father put mine in jail, prepare to die.

If it's the latter:

- Muggleborn. After 2 blood wars in 40 years, and despite the Ministry best efforts, some Bigot still run free. Free to raise a new generation of monster to hunt them. These time, the Muggleborn will not stay still, and take their destiny in their own hand.\\
  (Basically a bunch of Muggleborn that decide to murder the surviving Death Eaters, and Harry is forced to try to stop them because it's technically murder).
