yes, I'm stuck with villains who want to take over the world or who are big evil threats. I don't have many ideas on how to deal with a smaller-scale evil. but all the great evils I do are clich√©s and have been seen before. maybe i like the comicbook-tier nonsense, but i will try to do the lesser evil, it suits better for this story.
