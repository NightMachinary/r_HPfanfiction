Sincerely, I didn't even consider this. I think I'm `` stuck ´´ on the necessity of a villain to make the story progress. Like, in most of stories I write I always put some type of great evil or dark lord. Maybe stories with different types of threats are the right way. Not every story must be about saving the world, I just need to understand this.
