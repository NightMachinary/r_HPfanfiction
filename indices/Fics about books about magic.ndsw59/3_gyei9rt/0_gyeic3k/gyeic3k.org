[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][*/Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/PurpleFluffyCat/pseuds/PurpleFluffyCat][/PurpleFluffyCat/]]

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Some have argued that the daily drudgery of being a Muggle is too much to bear.[10] This year I learned the opposite is true: they can and do entertain themselves in some interesting, if (delightfully) odd, ways.[10] See for example Chapter 3 of Cygnus Black's No Magic, No Meaning: Our Moral Obligation to Put Muggles Out of their Misery.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16467041][*/The Foundation of the Founding Four: The Place of Hogwarts' Founders in Wizarding Britain's National Myth-Making/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/seekeronthepath/pseuds/seekeronthepath][/seekeronthepath/]]

#+begin_quote
  The Founders Relics encountered by Harry Potter are NOT consistent with tenth century artefacts. Nor is the narrative of the Founders that he learns typical of how actual people behave. However, the STORY of the Founders is one that has obviously been put to political use, and is well-established by the time Harry encounters it. In this essay, I will argue that the Founders Relics were created to bolster personal and communal political objectives during periods of turmoil following the ultimate separation of Wizarding Britain from the Muggle world, as part of a wider cultural phenomenon which imagined the Hogwarts Four as the founders of a nation.(no seriously, I swear the argument makes sense)

  The preface and first chapter of a non-existent book by Bruce Nelson, a retired employee of the British Hidden Railway Company (which owns and operates the Hogwarts Express).Why does the Hogwarts Express exist? Why travel by train? How did it come to be?
