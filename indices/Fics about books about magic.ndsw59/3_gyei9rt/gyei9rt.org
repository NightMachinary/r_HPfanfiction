I like reading fanfic that dresses itself up as in-canon text.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]] is a history and an autobiography of Cuthbert Binns.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/52143][A Contemporary Survey of Muggle Habits, by Arthur Weasley]] is an Muggle Studies essay written from the POV of a young Arthur Weasley.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/131956][An extract from "The Witch's Guide to Pregnancy, Birth, and Baby Care", by Alarica Rosier. Chapter Nine: What if my Baby is a Squib?]] is an excerpt from a wizarding world babycare book.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16467041][The Foundation of the Founding Four: The Place of Hogwarts' Founders in Wizarding Britain's National Myth-Making]] is another in-universe history essay.

And [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23641126][The Hogwarts Express: A Century of Travel in 9 Â¾ Chapters]] sadly only contains 2 chapters but goes into the history and magic behind the Hogwarts Express.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/40838][Excerpt from Harry Potter: The Early School Years]] is written as an excerpt from a biography of Harry Potter himself.
