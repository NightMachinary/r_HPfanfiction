They exist, but they're new. Since someone already linked the virtual Hogwarts library and a list of fanfiction like what you asked for, I'll limit myself to explaining why it's a recent thing.

The answer is that it was against fanfiction(dot)net policy for someone to, for lack of a better term, "write a book that resembles a textbook." Even if it was fictional, that was (and I believe still is) against the rules. So nobody bothered. All instances of this that I know of were created after archiveofourown was founded. And, of course, the archive was created specifically because people felt the rules of ffnet were getting to be excessively strict.

So that's the reason why, up until fairly recently, there were no examples of what you are asking for.

But there are now. So that's good.
