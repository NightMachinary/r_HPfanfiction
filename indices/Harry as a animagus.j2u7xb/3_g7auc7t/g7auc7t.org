The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862).

Harry becomes a cat Animagus at the ripe old age of 5 and runs away from the Dursleys. He ends up getting adopted by the Granger family and gets an early introduction into the Wizarding World when Albus realizes he's better off not playing at manipulating people.

Basically everyone gets a power and competence boost, including the villains.

Fair warning for kid-politicians, but it's one of the few stories that's good even with that trope.

Taking Control: linkffn(2954601)

Harry becomes an Animagus under some post-mortem training from Sirius (via dreams) after Harry's 5th year. There's a completed sequel on SIYE somewhere if I remember it right, the sequel on FFN is incomplete.

The Refiner's Fire: linksiye(8104).

Harry gets a /massive/ power boost from surviving a magical disease. It's easier to say which form he /can't/ take in this one. Written pre-HBP, so keep that in mind.

Harry Mewter: linkffn(4826372)

Harry's Animagus form is a Legendary Pok√©mon. That is all.
