I'd reconsider, I just gave this one a go and it is surprisingly fresh. It's original enough to expand the fandom, and there is enough to it to get a feel and understand how the story would fully play out had there been more. It ends just after the reintroduction of Hogwarts, which prevents it from becoming dull by following the majority of other fanfictions and hopping onto the canon rails.
