Yeah, I understand. It annoyed me for a long while as well, but there are tons of good fics out there that aren't complete but have good ideas and interesting new perspectives. That combined with the fact that there are only so many different ways an HP like story can end, I found enjoying the journey becoming more important than the reaching the destination.
