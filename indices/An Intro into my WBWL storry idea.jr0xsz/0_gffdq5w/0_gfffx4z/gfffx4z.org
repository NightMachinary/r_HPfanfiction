That was the plan many "Wrong/Other boy who lived" stories get bogged down with the same introduction that everyone uses those events can be explained throughout the story.

plus I often find that the power scaling often progresses too fast thus I decided to start in one of the later years it gives the author more liberties when creating skillsets for the characters.

I think that no first year should be capable of using all of the 7th year spells at the beginning 1 or 2 ok but to enter Hogwarts as an Auror and the teachers not noticing is just completely unrealistic and boring because no one can challenge the MC
