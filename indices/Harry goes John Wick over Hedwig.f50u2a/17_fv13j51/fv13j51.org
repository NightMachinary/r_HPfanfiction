"Voldemort," he screamed out into the night. He could feel it, like he had realised something cold and slimy into the air. He knew they would come, and come they did. It was Rodolphus and Rabastian first, Harry had fun with them. The younger had done him no fowl, he got a simple entrail expelling spell. Rodolphus he took longer with, he'd have given a million pounds to see Bellatrix's face when they found what was left of her husband.

The Malfoy's were next; Harry thought it terribly poetic as he transfigured the blood they held so dear to mud. Next came Yaxley and Umbridge, turns out the dementers weren't too loyal.

Dolohov had a liking for a fire, he liked it less as he cooked and blackened. Snape was the most fun, Harry force fed him a rock and then transfigured into a toad in his stomach, it took a while but justice for Trevor next.

He also took great pleasure in killing the child murderer Greyback; Remus went first, then the Montgomery sisters, then so many others. His death lasted days, Harry had never heard a grown man beg for death before,

the others he didn't bother to remember, he had turned their fallen comrades into inferi and they fell from ripped out throats and bitten skulls.

Bellatrix fell last, he had gift wrapped her to Augusta Longbottom. he heard she died screaming.

Harry killed Voldemort, while Remus, and the others watched. Voldemort was less scary without his followers. He made his old foe watch his horcruxes be destroyed then he locked the man in a prison where he would die of old age.
