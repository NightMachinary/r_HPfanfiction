"Harry is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar... with a sugar quill, with a fucking sugar quill. Then suddenly one day he asked to leave. It's over a woman, of course. So I made a deal with him. I gave him an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies he buried that day laid the foundation of what we are now. And then my son, a few days after his wife died, you steal his broom and kill his fucking owl."
