I've never liked it when writers put actuals guns into wizards hands in HP stories. I always assume that bullets would be one of those things that WW1 and WW2 would have make the wizarding world develop very good shields or even magical items that block most bullets or smaller explosions. Besides, I would love to read a wand and magical item selection scene that was similar to that scene in John Wick 2 where he was choosing his weapons. Also, that line: "The stories you hear about Harry Potter, if anything, have been watered DOWN".
