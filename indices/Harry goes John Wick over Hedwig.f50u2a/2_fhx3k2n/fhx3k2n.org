Harry stood before the group of Death Eaters with a blank mask for a face. Ironically, this was the perfect counter to the pale monstrosity that the six of his opponents donned like Halloween costumes. Theirs inspired fear by way of knowledge - knowledge of who they were, - but his caused dread to spring forth in those who recognised the look alone; it was the look of a hunter stalking its prey, so focused and so determined upon the hunt that it had no time, no patience and no regard for the safety of those who dared to stand before it. It was the look of an animal poised to strike, not for sustenance and not for fun, but because they had dared to take its companion away. Yes, animals killed for revenge too. Harry was obeying the rules of nature now.

In comparison, the Death Eaters were pale beneath their paleness, trembling as they stood before the Green Ghost. It was said that the raw power of the killing curse flowed through his veins, that his blood-lust was so powerful he had absorbed the deadly magic even as an infant. It was whispered in circles high and low that those were Avada Kedavra beams that shone through his eyes, that he could kill with a single look if so desired.

/"I saw him, once upon a time,"/ said Lucius Malfoy, as the goblet of wine shook between his hands. /"I tried to curse him for stealing my servant. Ever since, I feel that I have been the one who was cursed. He frightens me more than I should admit. I follow our lord because I pray nightly that he is powerful enough to destroy the evil known as Harry Potter."/

The Death Eaters remembered this tale as they stood before Harry now, and all of them were afraid. One pissed his breeches then and there. The legend had grown in the short months since Potter had started to unleash his fury onto Voldemort's forces. Now, none of them knew what to believe.

In truth, it no longer mattered. The reality was worse than the legends could ever hope to be.

When Harry merely blinked, the Death Eaters scrambled to raise their wands and sent a plethora of rainbow-hued curses in his direction. It mattered not what they cast, for their only hope of survival now was to hit Potter with something, /anything,/ that might give him pause. They peppered him with their spells, screaming and swearing, shaking and shivering in a swivel-eyed stupor.

But Harry, the Green-Ghost-That-Hunted, had already unleashed his deadliest weapon: the fear. It took them and made them sloppy. Even then, he danced through the spells with a terrible beauty and snapped his arms to the sides, which allowed the magically-modified Glock-17 handguns to slide into both hands beneath his swirling cloak. Each bullet had been refined with dark magic, cursed to hold a sliver of the killing curse. Bullets were faster than spells, guns more accurate than wands. His was a ruthless, but efficient spree, and this way none could check his wand for residue.

Harry slid onto his knees and brought the pistols forward, almost in slow-motion. Now, his facial expression changed for the first time; a dangerous glint entered his eye, but that was it. In that moment, had it caught a glimpse of him, a boggart would have fled.

The pistols were brought to bear, even as his shielded clothing absorbed the spells that hit him. He fired six bullets in all, plenty for six more of Voldemort's minions. The entire action had taken less than ten seconds.

And once those ten seconds were up, the cobblestones of Diagon Alley ran red with the blood of the once-fearsome Inner Circle.

Without a backwards glance, the Green Ghost holstered his weapons and pulled the cloak tighter around his shoulders. With a /crack,/ he had vanished, off to find more prey.

But those who saw him whispered that he had returned to the nether...

Wandering...

...watching...

...waiting.
