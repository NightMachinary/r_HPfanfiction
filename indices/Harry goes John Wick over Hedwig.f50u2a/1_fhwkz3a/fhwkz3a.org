A disguised Harry Potter walked along Knockturn Alley, his eyes scanning the crowd for Bellatrix Lestrange and any other potential threats. He'd already seen one watcher in the Alley, a Healer on the streets near Gringotts. She wore Healer robes and her badge identified her as a Healer in training, but what tipped him off was the lack of eyebags and bloodshot eyes. Harry knew that Healers in training worked long, arduous hours.

At least the presence of one watcher meant he was on the right track. Since the death of Hedwig he'd began systematically assassinating any Death Eaters he could track. Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry was stalled with the sudden deaths of his followers. At one point in time, he wondered if he was able to take a life. After Hedwig, he realized killing wasn't difficult if you believe you have a valid reason. She was his first gift, his faithful companion since he learned of magic and the fucking Death Eaters killed her.

He noted the second watcher in Knockturn as he continued to walk, a beggar on the streets who's stench didn't match the ragged quality of his clothes. The Death Eaters were becoming more paranoid with over half of them being killed, and were taking necessary precautions when out in the open. Harry fired a Confundus Charm at the man after he saw Bellatrix and four men emerge from Borgin and Burkes. The man hadn't recognized him but it never hurt to be too careful. His wand in hand, he advanced towards the group, casting an Anti-Apparition Spell.

Harry began firing Killing Curses towards the group, hoping to catch them by surprise. Two of the men were struck by the curses, but Bellatrix was able to conjure a physical shield in time. The curse shattered the shield, the debris turning into knives with a wave of her wand and was sent hurtling towards Harry who parried them with his Shield Charm.

Harry flicked his wand, casting the smokescreen spell, preventing the Death Eaters from gaining line of sight. Another flick of his wand and the smoke began to reform as Harry defended himself from the onslaught of curses. Soon, seven bronze lions stood in front of him, and on his command charged towards the group.

The nearest Death Eater was mauled by the lion while Bellatrix blasted two of the lions into pieces. The fallen Death Eater screamed as the lion tore into him, before it was blasted away by the other Death Eater. A jet of white light was sent towards Bellatrix who attempted to shield herself, but as the spell struck her shield, a blinding flash of light followed by an ear-splitting explosion staggered the remaining Death Eaters. The remaining bronze lions rushed towards the disoriented duo while Harry unleashed a volley of spells to overwhelm them. His last lion tore into the Death Eater while Bellatrix was caught with a Cutting Curse which struck her on her torso. Sirius Black, Frank and Alice Longbottom and many others were avenged as Bellatrix met her end as Harry executed her with the Killing Curse

Bellatrix could've been taken in for questioning for information on the remaining Death Eaters but Harry knew from Karkaroff's trial that Voldemort split his Death Eaters into cells to avoid exposure. And while this was a complication, it wasn't one that troubled Harry too much. Eventually, the Dark Lord would be dealt with, in the same manner that Harry had dealt with so many of his Death Eaters after Hedwig's death.
