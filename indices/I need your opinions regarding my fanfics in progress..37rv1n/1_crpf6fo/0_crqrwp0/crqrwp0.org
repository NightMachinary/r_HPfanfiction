  For number one, why would a brothel buy a child that's around one years old?

Well...

  Then letting him join a thief group, or do they not know?
#+end_quote

They know, but don't care. But I should've probably posted the version where he's directly sold to the thieves gang. Now that I read the feedback I kinda got it that the whole prostitute thing is dumb. The brothel is known in Babylon for the variety of prostitutes. From normal women and men, to merpeople and satyr. I wanted him to grow up there and learn the languages and in general teach him to appreciate the other magicals, but then again, why not do that in a gang of thieves? Harry knows about magic but fears for a long time that he isn't gifted with it. He finds out after his first time going out to steal. House Elves in brothels mean clean rooms. Short and simple :D

I haven't posted them yet. Before I post I want to have at least about 20 chapters done (about half of the story). By then I know if I finish them or if I find myself facing a dead end at some point due to, maybe, a plothole I forgot.
