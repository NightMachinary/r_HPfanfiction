For number one, why would a brothel buy a child that's around one years old? Then letting him join a thief group, or do they not know? Also, would Harry know magic and why is there house elves in this brothel? I really like all the premises, and number two, three, and five seem the most interesting to me. Is there any place where I can read them?
