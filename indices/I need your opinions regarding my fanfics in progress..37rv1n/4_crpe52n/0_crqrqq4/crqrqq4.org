  That's really not an Argentinian name. If you want to write about Argentina, you might want to write about Argentinians.

He is, though. After and during WW2 a /lot/ of germans went to Argentina. His family comes from Germany on his fathers side and from Argentina /Paraguay from his mothers side.

  Ah, so the protagonist is a genius. That usually doesn't work out well. If you want the protagonist to stomp everyone in sight, or it's more about exploring magic, that's fine, but if there's a person versus person conflict, you'll have to be careful to make them a proper foil.

All who are recruited are geniuses. This fic would include a lot of the scientific and philosophical debate I have with my colleagues at the university (Note: I'm far from a genius ;P). Pride, conflicting knowledge, disputes about methodology and the like can become hilariously derailed and I hope to reproduce that in this fic.

  There are three ways to do this. Make Hermione much less intelligent than I think she is; make your OC nearly useless; or have them compete rather than working together.

They all are geniuses in their own subjects. Aurelius is great at Runes and Arithmancy, but failed miserably in Transfiguration, while Hermione is a outstanding generalist with no deep knowledge on anything.

This whole story is inspired by the stories I hear a lot around me. Of young people starting building their vision and nearly failing due to the shit life throws at them. At this point I'm not even sure if the story would be all that funny or entertaining for others. Especially people who never came in contact with the world of scientific research would probably have problems getting a laugh out of it.
