  He grows up among the prostitutes and finds his best friend among the houseleves of the brothel.
#+end_quote

It is difficult to write a story involving sex workers that is respectful and reasonably accurate. It shouldn't be -- don't treat them like victims, objects of contempt, or nymphomaniacs, and just treat them like normal people who work on commission in the service industry. But people have a lot of trouble doing that.

  Aurelius Lander, a argentinian
#+end_quote

That's really not an Argentinian name. If you want to write about Argentina, you might want to write about Argentinians.

  upstarting wizard doesn't know what to do with himself after he graduated from Machu Picchu.
#+end_quote

He went to school in Peru. At a well-traveled tourist site. Why did they put their school there? Why doesn't his own country have its own school of magic? Argentina has like 50% more people in it than Great Britain, so it's not a question of population.

Why is Argentina a political unit in this world?

#+begin_quote
  He gets recruited by the argentinian Ministry as well as many foreign ministries.
#+end_quote

Ah, so the protagonist is a genius. That usually doesn't work out well. If you want the protagonist to stomp everyone in sight, or it's more about exploring magic, that's fine, but if there's a person versus person conflict, you'll have to be careful to make them a proper foil.

  A project to fly to the moon.
#+end_quote

There are three ways to do this. Make Hermione much less intelligent than I think she is; make your OC nearly useless; or have them compete rather than working together.

  At first sceptical, the british witch accepts his project proposal after a while.
#+end_quote

You've gone for option #1, I see, and much more thoroughly than I even imagined. A woman who grew up hearing stories of humans going into space, watching videos of people walking on the moon, and she somehow thinks it's infeasible to get to the moon using magic. Pull the other one, it's got bells on it. Replace Hermione with any random pureblood, even an intelligent one, and I could believe it.

Unless the skepticism is regarding the proposed means, the budget, or the expected results rather than the project as such. If I wanted to convince Hermione to join me on the project and told her I'd just use a bubble-head charm and a souped up broom, she might not know whether to laugh or cry before lecturing me about radiation and temperature variation and the limitations of the bubble-head charm and space debris and the special complications involving lunar regolith.

  Just Hermione Granger believed in the girls chances, adopts her and vows to keep her on the right track.

I never saw Hermione as the maternal type.
