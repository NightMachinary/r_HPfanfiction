  Story1: "Bronze Galleon" Genre: Adventure

What the others said about sex workers, but also, it seems like shoehorning a Harry-in-name-only into the story, even though he has no particular reason to be there; and even if he would be, why would he play an important role, with the grown-ups from the Varangian Guards around?

  Story2: "Stumbled upon Death" Genre: Horror, Dark!Hermione, OotP

This is still my favorite. Since we've discussed it over PM before, I've PMed you more comments.

  Story3: "Born guilty" Genre: Adventure/Romance, Next-Gen

  Dumbledore always suspected it, but like so many other things, he never mentioned it to his comrades. The old wizard had always suspected that once he and Harry were gone, if Voldemort wins, the dark wizard would need heirs. No sons or daughters, of course. Seconds in command, they would be.

By definition, an /heir/ is someone who /inherits/ upon the death of the principal. If Voldemort doesn't plan to die, why would he bother with an heir? Other than that, is he really that desperate for lieutenants that he is willing to wait two decades and expend the effort involved in child-rearing and education to make some?

  However, when the bully she hated most took her teddy, the last thing she got from her original parents

OK, you've really lost me here. No way Voldemort and Bellatrix would give their child a teddy bear. Plush snake or acromantula --- maybe. :P

  Story4: "Helios and Luna" Genre: Adventure/Humor/Romance, Post-Canon / Pre-Epiloge (OC heavy)

  A project to fly to the moon.

Step 1: Reproduce whatever it was that the Muggles did. Step 2: Fly to the moon.

  Story5: "The Bloodmoon rises" Dark!Vampire!Hermione, Dark!Vampire!Harry Horror/Romance HBP

  But they get bitten on a dark night, when the moon reflected no light and the sun was weakest.

Seems like a very "special snowflake" element, and it's not clear what effect it actually has on their turning.

  Hermione in the meanwhile goes on the hunt and becomes stronger... becomes more. After she consumed 13 people, her call echoes over Europe and wakes the army of an old legend. Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula, had once commanded them. Battalions of the Undead, Packs of werewolves and the Clans of the Vampires. They all follow the call to the island of Britain, where they would once again serve for a new Count has arisen.

I like OP!Hermione as much as the next reader, but just dumping an undead army into her lap seems like too much of a good thing. If you want to give her an army, make her /earn/ it, rather than just hand it to her for doing what she needed to do anyway. Also, what, precisely, does she do with that army; what motivations does she have at this point?
