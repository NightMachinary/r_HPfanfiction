  No self-insert, don't worry ;)

Friend inserts are almost as bad. Then you're building up not merely an idea, but the idea of a friend. You'll add in all those details that /you/ care about and that resonate with you, but they will bore the daylights out of everyone else. And you'll be ticked off no one likes your obviously deep and interesting character you spent so much time on. Other people just won't be in on the jokes or the weirdly specific details, and they'll often be really put off by it.

This is a dangerous almost as great as Mary Sues.

Take inspiration from life, sure, but be careful. Even in original fiction this can lead you down a bad path. Most people seem to read fanfic primarily for the characters they know and love. Mixing any OCs and canon characters is tricky because of this. Even ones based on or inspired by people as iconic as Tesla.

Maybe just write a fic centered on your OC in the Harry Potter universe, and have it be mostly about them. That usually goes over better. People who like those sorts of stories will read them, and those who don't won't try to bare it for the sake of your interesting and original plots.
