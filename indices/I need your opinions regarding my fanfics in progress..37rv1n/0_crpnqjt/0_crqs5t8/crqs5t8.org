  Bad cliche. Do not want. Skip.
#+end_quote

I should've posted the version where he goes directly to the thieves. Damn.

#+begin_quote
  Different enough. Not too cliched sounding. Might read this one.
#+end_quote

Probably write that one.

#+begin_quote
  OCs are usually at least -1 point, but this is a relatively original use of one. But...why do we care about or need your OC? Why not just Hermione Granger and the Trip to the Moon? This line alone almost saves it, but I'd have to pass because the oddly specific and detailed OC smells like trouble.
#+end_quote

The OC's I use are inspired by aquaintances of mine (Aurelius) in combination with brilliant minds like Nikola Tesla, Marie Curie, Leonardo DaVinci or Alan Turing.

I'm working in science as well and in this story I would try and reflect on and tell about the ridiculousness and stupidity of everyday research, the struggles of pride and the feeling of defeat when your thesis is proven wrong. No self-insert, don't worry ;)

  I also suggest rethinking your use of commas. Some of those sentences were hard to read. Do without whenever possible. They aren't breath marks.
#+end_quote

I think during betaing my own stories, the comma-button is the most pressed on my keyboard. Those lil' fuckers are just the worst for me.
