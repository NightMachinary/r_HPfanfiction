Okay, here's my gut reactions.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  He grows up among the prostitutes
#+end_quote

Bad cliche. Do not want. Skip.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Hermione tries Summoning and gets tricked into summoning a living Grimoire. A demon that attaches itself to her soul.
#+end_quote

Different enough. Not too cliched sounding. Might read this one.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Just Hermione Granger believed in the girls chances, adopts her and vows to keep her on the right track.
#+end_quote

Possibly interesting. Second place so far. Might read, which is more than I can say for most of the usual next-gen, babies-ever-after fics.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  A project to fly to the moon.
#+end_quote

OCs are usually at least -1 point, but this is a relatively original use of one. But...why do we care about or need your OC? Why not just /Hermione Granger and the Trip to the Moon/? This line alone almost saves it, but I'd have to pass because the oddly specific and detailed OC smells like trouble.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  They all follow the call to the island of Britain, where they would once again serve for a new Count has arisen.
#+end_quote

Right, but what's the /conflict/ here? Is Harry not okay with Hermione leading an army of vampires? Are we just Anne Ricing it up, woe is my existence? Might need a second think. Vampires are so overused in general that you really need a strong pitch for why, other than them, one should read the story.

--------------

On review, I think the accidental demon corrupting Hermione is the strongest idea, though the moonshot would be a more original overall story. Maybe take a swing at one of those, then come back and do the Tom's daughter one later.

I also suggest rethinking your use of commas. Some of those sentences were hard to read. Do without whenever possible. They aren't breath marks.
