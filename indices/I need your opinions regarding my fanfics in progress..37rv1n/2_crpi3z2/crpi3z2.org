I honestly wouldn't read any of them based off of your descriptions but I encourage you to write them anyways. There have been many a fic I have skipped over because the summary sounded dumb or was something i didn't think would be interesting. After seeing the fics recommended on reddit I went back and read the stories and they were usually good. It's hard to determine how good a fic will be based off the summaries. Just ignore the people that give negative feedback and focus on the constructive feedback.
