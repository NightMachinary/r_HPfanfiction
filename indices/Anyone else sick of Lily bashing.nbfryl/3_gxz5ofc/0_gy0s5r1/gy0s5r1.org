Yeah... especially since... I don't know but it's such a gross misrepresentation of the situation.

Sure, Snape suffered from bullying. And if a friend of hers gets bullied leaving them, even breaking with them is a devastating step for that friend... +But if simultaneously, she's part of a discriminated group... nope, I take that back+ If she's part of the group that has about to have a genocide attempted against them, and the friend joins the other side and their rhetoric and also does nothing to better the situation...

Lily: Stayed friends with Snape far longer than anybody could've expected, and then quit their friendship when he called her a slur used by people who want people like her gone. Therefore left Snape to deal with his bullying alone.

Severus: spouted racist rhetoric long before that and then joined in on the genocide to treat his heartache.

How could she! All Snape did was sympathize with a group that wanted her dead! How could she not protect him from his bullies for that?
