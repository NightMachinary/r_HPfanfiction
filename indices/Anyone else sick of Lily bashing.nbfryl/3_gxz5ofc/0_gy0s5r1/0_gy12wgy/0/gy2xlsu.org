I don't know why some people feel the need to rationalize the intentions and moral good-ness of characters that are obviously meant to have many flaws and bad aspects-- and even be downright evil.

Not every character is supposed to be good or redeemable. That doesn't make them bad characters, and it seems like some fans of those characters don't realize that their flaws are what make them contribute to the story in positive ways rather than just being a boring story about everyone going around being a good person and doing the right thing.
