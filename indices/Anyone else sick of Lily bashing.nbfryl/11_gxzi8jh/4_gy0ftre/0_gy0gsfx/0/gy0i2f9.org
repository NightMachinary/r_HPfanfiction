I know what you're trying to say and you make it look better than what it actually was. Molly doesn't deserve to be bashed, yet she wasn't Harry's second Mom either.

As for Dumbledore, he wasn't the reason Harry was alive at the end. Harry was alive because Rowling wanted him to be alive. The whole wand business wasn't Dumbledore planning for example. Same thing for nearly every last chapter of DH.

On one side you have people who bash Dumbledore while he didn't really deserve it and on the other, you have people telling you he was a mastermind while he never did anything that smart during the whole series.
