Yeah... Dumbledore didn't plan on the wand... but that's more because - I believe - he didn't want Voldemort to get his hands on it and based on his statement along the lines that merely killing him (Voldemort) wouldn't satisfy him (Dumbledore), I believe Dumbledore just wanted to strip Voldemort of his powers, via Harry's sacrifice, while living him mortal. Dumbledore however did orchestrate that Harry would only walk to his death willingly and it would be Voldemort that gave him the killing strike, thus leading to his survival.

As for Molly, Harry actually considers her as a second mother and she treats him like her son when she gives him +Gideon+ Fabian's watch for his seventeenth birthday.
