Making a big deal of Harry going to his death willingly is bad writing (on Rowling's part) and like a lame orchestration (on Dumbledore's part). Of course, Harry would have gone willingly sacrificing himself. The boy is saving the days since he is 11.

Harry and his friends spent the whole year hiding in the woods trying to figure out how to do the adults' jobs without any clues and mostly luck and author fiats to get by. That was also part of Dumbledore's plan?

Like Dumbledore knew that the whole battle of Hogwart would happen at the exact moment Harry would choose to go to Hogwart to get Ravenclaw's diadem and kill Nagini and that Riddle would give Harry another occasion to sacrifice himself by giving him the choice between his life and the students, choice Harry had already made since the first book?

I think we have maybe different suspension of disbelief.
