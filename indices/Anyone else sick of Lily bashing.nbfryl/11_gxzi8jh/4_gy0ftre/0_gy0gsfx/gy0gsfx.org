  You're painting it in a very convenient way here. Molly doesn't deserve to be bashed, yet she didn't adopt Harry ever like you try to make it look like. And she cared so much about his well being that she didn't believe that the Dursley were actually abusive...

If you read the books you probably knew very well what I meant. Didn't need to elaborate my explanation in a one million word fic bashing people that bash Molly.

  And the reason why Harry was alive at the end has nothing to do with Dumbledore.

It totally did. Or you might have actually not read the books.
