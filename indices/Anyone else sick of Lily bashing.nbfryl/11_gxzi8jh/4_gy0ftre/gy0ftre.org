  Molly: loving mother of seven who accepted an orphan boy as her own son in her own house despite her family's financial struggles. How did she have the audacity to worry for his well-being?

You're painting it in a very convenient way here. Molly doesn't deserve to be bashed, yet she didn't adopt Harry ever like you try to make it look like. And she cared so much about his well being that she didn't believe that the Dursley were actually abusive...

Just like Riddle, he didn't do anything smart, nevermind genius level, in the whole series.

And the reason why Harry was alive at the end has nothing to do with Dumbledore.
