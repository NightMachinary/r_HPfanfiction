I think bashing happens when you write and project the helplessness and anger in your life. It's why teenagers love them the most.

Hating on a character can be very therapautic. Hate your mother? Molly bashing! Hate your teacher? Hogwarts bashing! Your best friend isnno longer your best friend? Ron and Hermione bashing!
