I feel like none of the bashings are well deserved. I think they have more of a shock value:

- Lily... we don't know what she was like in life and despite the fact that many say only good things of her to Harry, also most people don't speak ill of the dead... but when push came to shove she was willing to die for those she loved and she still had a whole life ahead of her.

- James: sure he was a bit of a dick in high school because he grew up spoiled but he really cared about his friends enough that he pushed the limits of magic, brought one in his house after he ran away from home and never demanded anything from the weakest one despite allowing him to hang out with 'the popular kids'. He also saved the life of his nemesis and was overall a well-liked guy so he couldn't have been that bad.

- Ron: he turned his back on Harry twice out of jealousy but also people forget that he basically gave Harry a family, was his first real friend, followed him in multiple adventures (sometimes even sacrificing or being willing to sacrifice himself) and overall I think anyone needs a friend like Ron (unless you're a celebrity who's always going to cast a shadow over him);

- Molly: loving mother of seven who accepted an orphan boy as her own son in her own house despite her family's financial struggles. How did she have the audacity to worry for his well-being?

- Ginny: she's the one character I don't get why she's bashed. I mean she was nasty to Zacharias Smith, yes. But she was also the only nice person to Luna. She seems like a cool and kind person. Her only fault was that she had a schoolgirl crush on Harry and later Harry developed a crush on her when she was unavailable.

- Dumbledore: yeah he was powerful, yeah he was smart but he was not a Deus Ex Machina. He couldn't solve all the world's problems and even in the story many expect him to do. At the end of the day he was still a human with flaws, but nevertheless a human that tried to leave a better world behind him. And for all his machinations, he managed to get Harry alive out of a situation that seemed like the only way it would be resolved was by Harry dying.
