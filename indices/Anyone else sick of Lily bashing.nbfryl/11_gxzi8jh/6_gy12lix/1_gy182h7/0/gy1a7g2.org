Also because she was cold to Hermione in GoF, because she believed Rita's story that Hermione was juggling Harry and Krum. I mean, yes, it's wrong of her, but it isn't like Molly is so blind that she never talked to Hermione again. Eventually, she understood the truth.

The whole thing with Sirius is ambiguous, because Molly is overprotective of Harry and Sirius sort of treats him like James (his young adult friend). And the love potion thing is even more ambiguous. Everyone acts as though every love potion is Amortentia. There is a recent post about this, but I don't remember if it's here or on the HP sub. I said the same thing there: assuming every love potion is like Amortentia is like assuming every alcoholic beverage is Spirytus (a vodka with about 96% of alcohol).
