I do have a special hatred for the Marauders because I don't think anything justifies what they did. What if someone turned you upside down and showed your underwear to everyone? And was amused and pleased with himself for it? It just doesn't sit right with me.

As for Dumbledore, he chose to put himself in this Deus Ex Machina situation. Of course you cannot expect him to be perfect, but he chose to play God by sharing only what was convenient for his plans and indulging people's next steps according to his plans. Also, the reason why he let go of his prejudice is ambiguous. Unlike Snape, who we know a lot about, we don't have much information regarding Dumbledore's young years, so we cannot tell for sure if he genuinely realised his mistakes and regretted them or if he just felt guilty for his sister's death. I'm not saying he's bad for it, but I do have mixed feelings and would have to take a better look into his character to build an opinion.

Ginny and Ron get more hate because of the movies, I think. They were very, very poorly portrayed. And Ron haters who read the book focus a lot on his mistakes and not enough in Harry's and Hermione's mistakes. To be honest, all three of them annoy the shit out of me sometimes, but they are great people.

Molly is the only bashing I don't understand at all. She isn't perfect, of course, but she's the mother many people would die to have. Molly's love is crucial in the books, it's crucial for Harry's upbringing and it has saved him too. I don't know if this is a thing in English, but in my language people like her are called "owl mothers", which fits HP world lol
