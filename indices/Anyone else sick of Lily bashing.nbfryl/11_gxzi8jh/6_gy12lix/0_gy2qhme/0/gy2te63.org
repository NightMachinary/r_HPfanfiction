  Nothing justifies it?

No. I personally don't believe it's okay to expose anyone's underwear to the whole school and 'humour' the crowd by asking if they wanted to see him taking it off. I don't believe it's right to vilify Snape for being a supremacist, then pretend it's okay that James sexually harassed him because he was a supremacist. They were both awful.

Also, I don't believe James and Sirius did that out of principles. Lily said James hexed students just because they annoyed him. The reason why they went after Snape after the O.W.L.s was because Sirius was bored. Not once had any of the Marauders mentioned supremacy to justify what they did. The reason James gave was "it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean," which doesn't say much. Every indication we have is that they did it for fun.

  What about inside the school. During 5th year Umbridge gave Malfoy and co. permission to bully and attack muggleborns, halfbloods and race traitors.

Umbridge literally was on their side. I'm not saying everything was perfect and safe back then, but the Headmaster was not indulging the supremacist students and oppressing the Muggle-borns. Yes, there was a war going on, just like in HBP. I'd argue Malfoy and co. got away with many more things in OotP regardless of that.

  James eventually grew out of his arrogance and became a better man

Barely. He stopped hexing everyone else but Snape. Granted, it's mentioned they did it to each other whenever they had the chance. Still, Lily thought James had stopped hexing everyone (one of the reasons why she accepted dating him eventually) and he didn't tell her about it.

James was brave and against prejudice since always, apparently. The fact that he became even braver and joined the Order doesn't mean he stopped being a dick. The only indication we have is that he grew less arrogant and stopped hexing most people, but still lied to the girl he liked about doing it to Snape. This is an improvement, for sure, but there is no indication he became a /good/ person. Just like the Malfoys love each other and are despicable to everyone else, James could still be a 'toerag' despite his bravery and love. People are multidimensional.
