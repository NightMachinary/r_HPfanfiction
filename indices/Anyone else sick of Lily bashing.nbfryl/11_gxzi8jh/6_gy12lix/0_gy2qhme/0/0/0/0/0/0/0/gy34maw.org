James hexed students, which is with ill intent. The twins pranked them, which is supposed to be just funny and overall harmless. It isn't harmless at all, but I'm not speaking on behalf of anyone else but myself. My opinion is that they're all awful, even though the twins didn't go as far as exposing people's underwears IIRC. To be honest, if I were a Slytherin student, I'd hate them with my might. But then again, most characters, if not all, are close and fond of them, and therefore biased.

James treated people well when he believed they were his equals. He didn't think any less of Muggle-borns or werewolves. You can tell who he is by the way he treats his 'inferiors'. His 'labelling' just is not based on blood.

Most people who talked good things about James were close and fond of him. When you have someone who knew James better and had a (very) low opinion of him, it helps you even out the perspectives. We get to see his best and worst, and each person builds their own opinion on it.
