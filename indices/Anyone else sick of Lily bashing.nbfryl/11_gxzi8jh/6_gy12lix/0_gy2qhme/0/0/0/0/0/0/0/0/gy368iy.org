How did Snape know James better? The only time Snape was involved with James, he was either being bullied by James, who hated him, or he was trying to get James in trouble, who he hated. James even saved the mans life, despite hating Snape, yet I doubt Snape would've done the same. The one scene we see Snape and James together, James attacked Snape “just cause he was alive..”, I don't doubt that there were times Snape did the same.

Snape was at his most bias when interacting with James, so his interpretation of the man was flawed. James teachers who saw him every day said he was arrogant but good at heart and became a better man as he got older, his fellow OotP members who fought with him against Voldemort, said he was a good and brave man. Lily who knew him at his worse changed her mind about him after he matured; enough to marry him. By every metric James was a better person than Snape.

Well you have a different opinion and your entitled to it, but I'm done. This is my last post on this topic because we're just going around in circles now.
