  And there isn't any proof that James didn't become a good man and a better person

Exactly. This is why I don't use him becoming a bad or a good person as an argument. You brought it up that he became a good person, so I disagreed because there is no proof of it.

  It seems like your dislike of James is based upon a couple snippets of Snape's memories of the guy; A man who absolutely hated James and blindly saw worst in James
#+end_quote

No, my judgement is not entirely based on Snape's opinion. I do recognise that he did stuff like saying James only saved his life pretty much to protect Sirius, even though we don't have proof of that, but we do have proof that he likely knew Remus was a werewolf, so he isn't so innocent. But it doesn't change the fact that Sirius was wrong too.

I do recognise that Snape mentioned James only attacked him when it was four (all the Marauders) against one, when we have proof that Peter just cheered and Remus turned a blind eye, so it was just two. But two against one still is wrong.

I do recognise that he projected his hatred on Harry, even though not only he isn't to blame, but he also is Lily's son (supposedly the love of his life). He also became a Death Eater, with has no excuse whatsoever. He only switched sides when he realised Lily was in imminent danger, even though the only reason she was is that she loved her son and wanted to protect him. Still, Snape didn't care if Harry died as long as she lived. He made many other mistakes and I never, not for one second, said Snape was a good guy.

All the memories that we see might belong to Snape, but they are narrated from Harry's perspective, who would always try to defend his parents and other father figures. That, along with things that Snape, Sirius and Remus had said and done about their past were what built my take on all of those memories.

Snape hated the Marauders, and James especifically, for a reason. It wasn't only because he got to marry Lily, this just made it worse. It was also because, long before that, there were years of bullying performed by James and Sirius, and supported by Remus and Peter. They were awful to him and James, along with Sirius, was the worst. Does it justify Snape's shit? No. Does Snape's shit justify James' shit? No.
