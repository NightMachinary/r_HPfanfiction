Well I'm giving James the benefit of doubt. As I said in my first post, a lot of James bashing and hate in fanfiction, only stems from people believing Snape's narrative and a memory he left for Harry to find.

Even the whole “hexing innocent students” IMO is taking out of context. The twins did similar stuff during their time at Hogwarts and yet they don't get called bullies in the official wiki and by the average potter fan. I believe James while mischievous, spoiled and somewhat arrogant was a good person at his core, as evident from how he treated muggleborn, Remus, as well as his friends and peers. As well as stated by several people who knew him as a child and adult. And I believe to understand why he act the way he did towards Snape and the other children of Voldemort's supporters, you have to also accept and understand what the wizarding world was experiencing at the time and how it could've shaped the people living through it.
