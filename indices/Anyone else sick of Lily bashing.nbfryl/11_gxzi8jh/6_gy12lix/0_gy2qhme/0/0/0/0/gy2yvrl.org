And there isn't any proof that James didn't become a good man and a better person, except that somehow Lily managed to fall for the guy despite having sworn off him, and having a large dislike of him at minimum 13 months before.

It seems like your dislike of James is based upon a couple snippets of Snape's memories of the guy; A man who absolutely hated James and blindly saw worst in James, so much so that he projected all his hate for James onto Harry. He wouldn't even accept that the reason for James saving his life could be more than protecting Remus and Sirius. While I won't ignore Snape's memories, at the same time I take it with a grain of salt, because you should never form an opinion of a person based solely on the word of that persons enemy.
