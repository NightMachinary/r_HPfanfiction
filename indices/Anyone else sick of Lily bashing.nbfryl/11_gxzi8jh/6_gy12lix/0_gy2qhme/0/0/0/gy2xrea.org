  Yah James, Sirius and Snape all started off on the wrong foot, but if some little prick continuously followed me around trying to get me in shit, you bet I'd hate him.
#+end_quote

Snape sure was wrong for that and was either really dumb or had ill intentions when he followed them to the Shrieking Shack, probably the latter. But it doesn't justify Sirius telling him to go there, knowing he could become a werewolf or die, especially if he wasn't sure whether Snape knew about Remus or not. Because he also exposed his own friend by doing it.

  However If he was willing to stop for Lily, why would he continue to start shit with Snape? With what we know of Snape's character, It is far more likely that Snape was the one who would hex James first, especially as he hated him for saving his life and for getting closer to Lily, and then James would retaliate.

I even said "granted, they hexed each other whenever they had the chance", so I'm aware of that. My point was that he didn't tell Lily. I don't get why Snape fighting back (and I don't blame him after years of bullying) justifies James hiding it from Lily.

  Also, who invented the Hex that James used to flip Snape up to show his underwear?
#+end_quote

The purpose is to turn people upside down, not expose them. James literally asked if the other students around them wanted to see him take his pants off. You can't even argue it was by mistake. So I don't blame Snape if he wanted to fight back the bullying after years of it and I wouldn't judge James and Sirius if they were getting back at Snape for bullying others, but sexual harassment is very different than bullying.

  Snape was also a bully too, half the reason Lily broke friendship with him after he called her a Mudblood was because she knew he was bullying and attacking other muggleborn with his friends in slytherin.
#+end_quote

I never said Snape was a saint or disagreed that Lily ended their friendship because of his other awful behaviours, but I don't have any proof that he went out and about exposing people's underwear. Those are two different things and both are horrible.

#+begin_quote
  I know James was a spoiled child, turn arrogant jock but he grew up to be a good man, while there wasn't a lot shown there had to have been more than a few reasons why Lily started to date him.
#+end_quote

I already made my point of why I we don't have proof James became a good person. Better isn't good. And "there had to have been" is just you guessing. There are things that are heavily implied, while others aren't that clear.
