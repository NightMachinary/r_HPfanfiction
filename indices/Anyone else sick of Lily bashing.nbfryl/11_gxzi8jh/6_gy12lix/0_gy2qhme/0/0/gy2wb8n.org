So I read that James told Lily that he would stop Hexing people. The quote I have from Harry Potter fandom-“He stopped hexing bystanders for fun, though he still secretly hexed Snape, and in turn, Snape never lost an opportunity to hex him back, although it's implied that James was willing to stop for Lily's sake.” This quote makes it seem like James was the first to start throwing spells at Snape. However If he was willing to stop for Lily, why would he continue to start shit with Snape? With what we know of Snape's character, It is far more likely that Snape was the one who would hex James first, especially as he hated him for saving his life and for getting closer to Lily, and then James would retaliate.

Snape was a spiteful pissant, he was known for following the Marauders around, trying to get them in trouble, and trying to find a way to get them expelled. The only reason Sirius told him to check it the shrieking shack in the first place was because he was again, trying find something on them, to get them in trouble and expelled. Hell, if I recall right, Snape even implied he knew what the Marauders were up to, implying that he may of known Remus was a werewolf before Sirius told him to check the shack out. Yah James, Sirius and Snape all started off on the wrong foot, but if some little prick continuously followed me around trying to get me in shit, you bet I'd hate him.

Also, who invented the Hex that James used to flip Snape up to show his underwear? If you didn't know, it was Snape, it was his spell. So I wonder how James found out about it? Who would Snape have used it on first. And he did escalate to trying to kill James after. Snape was also a bully too, half the reason Lily broke friendship with him after he called her a Mudblood was because she knew he was bullying and attacking other muggleborn with his friends in slytherin.

I know James was a spoiled child, turn arrogant jock but he grew up to be a good man, while there wasn't a lot shown there had to have been more than a few reasons why Lily started to date him.

And while J.K. Did a horrible job of building depth to the first wizard war, it's not hard to guess with accuracy, what life would have been like for the people experiencing that time period, just going off of what was said by those who lived it in the books
