Nothing justifies it? The first wizard war officially started 1970. And it's foundations began in the 1940s. From the time The marauders were born up to, during and after their time at Hogwarts, they experienced war. They would have seen, heard of and know about the disappearances and deaths of family members, and friends; People they knew from school not returning after holidays; Black letters delivered weekly if not daily; obituaries in the paper and Funerals to go to and that's just the war outside.

What about inside the school. During 5th year Umbridge gave Malfoy and co. permission to bully and attack muggleborns, halfbloods and race traitors. Imaging what the pureblood children of death eaters felt they could get away with at the height of the first war? I could easily see worse happening. Bully, attacks, taunting the deaths of family members. And Snape was friends with these people.

Sirius would have known who many of the children of Voldemort's supporter, just by being a Black. You might call it bullying but they probably felt like they were fighting a war to protect people they knew at school. And then you have Snape, a dark spiteful, and jealous kid who came to school knowing dark magic; he, as a halfblood was recruited by Malfoy sr, and made friends with other Death eater children. It was implied by Lily that he, at the very least insulted if not bullied and attacked the other muggleborn. And according to Sirius, he and his friends gave back to the Marauders as good as they got.

There was a war outside the school, and at the same time there was a war fought inside the school, and while James eventually grew out of his arrogance and became a better man, Snape arguably only got worse. Despite his actions causing Lily's death, he never became a better man, and that's why James will always be better than Snape.
