I think some of the criticism of Molly is very on point, but it is also because she is not shown as a paragon of virtue ans is also a real person. For example,

1. She knows Reeta Skeeter is a poisonous bug, but believed her lies about Hermione in Book 4 and gave her an obligation gift that made sure everyone knew she didn't think well of her. Hermione is 14 at the time.

2. She constantly judged Fleur and whether she was sincere about her love for Bill, but what is the basis for this? Why does she think so? She changes her mind about Fleur when she Fleur insists on staying with Bill, so she clearly thought she was with Bill for his looks, and also seemed to think Fleur, a Triwizard Champion, was some sort of an airhead... I wonder whether this was because of her looks or because she was not fully human?

3. This is on both Arthur and Molly. When Ron started school, Percy had just become a prefect, and he was given a new set of robes and an owl as a present. Ron was sent with an old wand with the unicorn tail poking out of it. A wand is the most important magical equipment, so how come one son gets 2 gifts (and one can argue that the school has lots of owls and an owl is therefore not a necessary "equipment" to have, but a wand is). I'm not surprised Ron feels neglected or like a left over item.

4. Again on both parents. Ron also did not seem to have any cooking skills while in the tent and got resentful towards hermione, if memory serves, about her cooking. Very gendered view of life and his parents did not teach him better. At 17 one van say that his attitude indicated that he did not see anything different at home.

5. She keeps feuding with Sirius and is nasty about reminding him that he was incarcerated, knowing perfectly well that he was falsely punished and never had a hearing to prove his guilt or innocence, just tossed into jail. Just because she could be. In the books he is nothing but generous to her family and to her, and she always tries to undermine him.

6. She often mixes up the twins, and forgets about them when Ron is made prefect ("that's everyone in the family!"). While the latter may be excitement, it is still really odd. As for the former, I have known two sets of identical twins and their families have always been able to tell them apart even when I cannot. Heck, even Harry can tell the twins apart in the books, but their own mother cannot?

7. Ah, just remembered that time Ron said someone was a "scarlet woman", and he said he learnt that term from his mum.

Many things about Molly are wonderful, and personally I think that these make her a much more "real" character, but there is a reason people dislike her too, it is not just mindless "bashing". Molly believes in gender roles and traditional or orthodox ways of behaving and is a judgemental woman.

There are lots of things about Dumbledore which are worth criticising too, and in general the fandom has dissected that. Personally I have seen very few people point these things out about Molly, though. Perhaps since i do not like to read negative fiction, but even in general discourse, I have not really come across these.
