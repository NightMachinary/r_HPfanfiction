I love Professor McGonagall, she's one of my favourite characters, but I can point out a mistake or two. What annoys me the most is how she (or any other professor for that matter) didn't help Neville, who is clearly has a learning impairment, not just a 'slow-learner' way.

We later find out why, but as his head of house, she should have given him some attention. Maybe she would have pinpointed the problem sooner and his education wouldn't be so compromised.

She also allowed Harry into the quidditch team and gave him his own broom, even though this is forbidden.

Not horrible things at all, but Professor McGonagall isn't perfect either. And I agree that compraing to other adults, she's amazing.

Also, despite Molly's mistakes, I still don't get the hate. It's one thing to be flawed (Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are all flawed, for example), but she isn't a bad person. She's the mother we would die to have.
