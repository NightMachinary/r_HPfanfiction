Oh yes, I agree with your points about Minerva, but I do think that it is likely that we don't always see her interactions with Neville. She told him about his grandmother failing charms, for example. I think the Quidditch thing is ultimately a very hogwarts or at least a very dumbledore thing, like how he thinks it is okay to tell kids that somwthing is forbidden in thr third floor corridor, or how the forbidden forest is okay for detentions (???), or how an underage magician who says he didn't put his name in the goblet can still be in the Triwizard tournament just because he wants to see what is happening. I don't think Minerva could have changed the underage rule. I think she asked Dumbledore and he allowed it.

I have actually never seen much Molly "hate", unless it is in fics i don't read, because why bring negativity into my life, but the reason a lot of people dislike her is that she is diefied by the fandom by being some sort of a perfect mother. She is really not. She is a prejudiced person, especially against girls and women, and she implements these prejudices into her and her kids life or Ron would not have judged someone to be a "scarlet woman". And many of us face these prejudices in our own life, so to see someone doing all this and then being held up as a paragon of virtue is damaging. She is also not a mother I would have died for ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have a lot of issues with my own mother, such as her sexism that is a somewhat like Molly's (perhaps why it was easy for me to recognise), but we were also not well off growing up and my parents made sure that my brother and I had all the necessary equipment we needed. Ron is obviously starved for attention, and then he is given a visibly defective wand. This is not something an ideal or even decent parent does, when they have the resources to buy a different kid an expensive gift. That is why this is not just a mistake.

Like Sirius said, the world is not divided into good people and death eaters. She is a good person in some ways and she is also a prejudiced person who chose to not learn better. Both happen in real life.
