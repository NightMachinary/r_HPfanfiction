Oh I don't recall anything about Molly stopping Ginny from playing quidditch ðŸ¤” what I remember that hermione said was that she has been seeing broomsticks from the Weasley broom shed since she was little (like 6?) and practicing. Given how annoying brothers are, it is possible that they were refusing to play with her too ðŸ™„

Oh yeah I forgot about the squib cousin, and yes Ron isn't sure but he did say that he thinks they are an accountant. I guess there could be an interpretation that maybe the cousin doesn't want to speak to them, but who knows.

Yeah Molly is quite sexist, and I think for me what really drove it home was how she behaved with Hermione in Book 4. Incredible.

I really like that no character in the book is sacrosanct. Aside from Professor McGonagall, who is the only adult who has never let us down, I think.
