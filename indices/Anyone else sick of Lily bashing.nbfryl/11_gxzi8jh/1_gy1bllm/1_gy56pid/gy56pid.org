I've always thought of Molly as being very xenophobic. Doesn't like Fleur because she's French (and a veela), willing to believe the worst of Hermione because she's raised by muggles, and generally contemptuous towards the non-magical.

Seriously, I doubt Arthur's the one responsible for Ron liking "Martin Miggs the Mad Muggle."
