1. Yes, that makes them open to criticism, especially when their kids are adults who are getting married.

2. They prioritised an owl for Percy over a wand for Ron, when the wand Ron was given had the unicorn tail poking out of it. What Ron got ad a reward for e coming a prefect is a moot point when they did not provide him with an essential magical equipment at the beginning of his magical education. They prioritised a two new things for one son, and sent the other off without an undamaged wand. Since it has not been mentioned, it is possible that Ginny got a new wand too, which would have also been a clear distinction. Also, you don't know that they considered Ollivander's statement a marketing ploy. There is no indication of the wand choosing the wizard and wands working better for people they chose than otherwise ever being anything but true in any of the stories, we are even shown that Hermione does not like using Bellatrix's wand. Wands are the most studied magical equipment there is since everyone requires one and there are several shops and different types of wood and wand cores all over the world. These two CHOSE to give one son two gifts and the other son a damaged wand. They had absolutely no idea how the wand would behave with Ron. There is wandlore that says that some wands become temperamental with age or damage, or because some unmatched user is using it. So yes, they should be judged for this.
