This isn't how you do math. You take in consideration all the students on Hogwarts, count how many have hand-me-down wands and divide by the total of students. This is how you know if hand-me-down wands are popular or not. Taking just 1,7% of all the students in Hogwarts is almost irrelevant. If you want to go even further, you can compare stats from the past years to know if hand-me-down wands became more or less popular. The more people you apply on your survey, the more precise it will be.

Neville improved a lot with closer help, yes, but it is mentioned especifically that after getting a new wand, he was able to perform spells much better. IIRC Neville said it himself.
