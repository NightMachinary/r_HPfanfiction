Wands are a necessity too. Come on, "minor spells"? It's his first year in Hogwarts. A bad wand can impair his education, which it did, and if you struggle to learn the basic, everything becomes more difficult by default. Also, Charlie gave Ron his wand when he got a new one. What does this say about the wand? Hand-me-down robes are one thing, hand-me-down wands are much worse because, as I said, it affects your learning. Even hand-me-down books are fine as long as it is able to read them.

Even if you argue that Percy won't be taken seriously as a Prefect with old robes, it still does not affect his education. There clearly needs to be a balance. If you can provide all your children with the basic and wants to reward the one who got a special achievement, fine. But you can't favour this child if the other lacks the basic.
