And you're responding to my comments as well. I posted a few reasons I thought bashing was unwarranted... you came up with a list of why Molly is being bashed (assumed as contribution to my post) and I said a few things about why she might had done some things (assumed as contribution to your post). Then we talked and then I saw you were actually trying to get into an argument with me which pissed me off. Fine... take things as you like. I enjoy this sub, I love debating the topics, but in no way will I go as far as to convince anyone that my interpretations are right so please don't act like I'm the one doing that when you're the one doing exactly that. I told you my point, I tried to cut off the conversation three posts ago, yet you keep coming back as if you're trying to prove a point about something.
