... you don't care whether I take you seriously, but... you are the one responding to me every time? You are the one who posted the initial comment about why you don't think there should be any Molly "bashing" for a story meant for kids, on a subreddit for that story that you say is only for kids but here you are posting on it?

You did not bring any additions to my points... you tried to refute them without actually managing to do that. And you did even that only for two of those points. I'm actually still waiting for anyone to actually provide evidence from the story about any of the points I made, where I have clearly said that these points don't make Molly a bad person, just a normal one, which is what the books portray.

You were the one who tried to falsely accuse me of poverty shaming the Weasleys, so the idea that you are not the one overly invested in this discussion is false too, like almost all the other things you have said ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
