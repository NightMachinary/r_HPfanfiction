No, JK made a point in PS that the wand chooses the wizard, and Ollivander is famous in Britain / Ireland for good quality. People all over Europe get their wands from Gregorovitch. Even though Ollivander is much closer, you'd do, as an average person, what everyone else does (pay a visit to Gregorovitch in another country) to get a good quality wand rather than stick with regular wands sold at Ollivander. Not only wizards with average income, but also rich wizards bought their wands at his shop, so I don't think people assumed what he said was a sales pitch.

Neville struggled a lot with magic precisely because he used his father's wand and performed magic better when he was bought a new one. Also where did you get the information that 40% of Gryffindor used hand-me-down wands?
