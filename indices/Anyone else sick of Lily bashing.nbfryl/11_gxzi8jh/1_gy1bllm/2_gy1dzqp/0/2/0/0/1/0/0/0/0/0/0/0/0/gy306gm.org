Of course I am responding. This story and these characters mean a lot to me, and I don't go about pretending otherwise here or anywhere else. I am part of this sub and in this discussion because I want to be. Unlike you, apparently ðŸ˜‚ , because this is a fictional story for children when you are unable to regute literal facts from the books.

As far not convincing anyone goes... yes, you're doing a great job of actually not convincing anyone who disagrees, so I suppose you are meeting your objective there ðŸ¤”

You are free to stop responding any time you want too ðŸ’• Go riiiight ahead.
