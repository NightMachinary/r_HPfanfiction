Any parent, who is a normal parent, not even a good one, will make sure all their kids have basics before they start getting rewards for any of the kids. This is so obvious and commonsense that that you arw saying is just laughable at best. Getting one kid an owl when there is no need for them to have it, and palming off a damaged wand on another kid is neglectful and clearly shows favouritism and bad parenting logic. It is not your kids fault that you cannot afford things. You chose to have those kids so you should make sure they have the basics. And they could have done, but chose not to. They chose to get one kid an owl right at that moment, when they could easily have waited and perhaps got hom the owl 1 or 2 months the later, if they wanted to do that. They showed they are bad parents when they did this. When we were little and didn't have much to go on, our parents always made sure we had our basics, even if we didn't get birthday gifts or didn't get them immediately, or it was just home made cake and nice home made food.

As for bashing, yes. All the things put together makes them open to a lot of criticism. They are not ideal parents and Molly is certainly not an ideal person as some people, clearly like you, want to push. She is a normal person who makes choices and has some very bad things about her as a parent and person, such as being controlling and sexist, and sometimes mean. It is funny to me that she is a mother of 7 kids, some of whom are adults, but you are comparing Fleur's level of maturity as a 19 or 20 year old to this woman, and saying, oh Fleur is not a Saint, but are defending Molly for being discriminatory and teaching her kids discriminatory things, such as judging some women to be "Scarlet Women", which is probably what she thinks of Fleur too. Fleur can grow out of her issues at 20. Molly has taught and implemented her thought processes on her children and her children's friends, and actively hurt them by her choices. Yea, lots of parents do this. This is what makes Molly a normal and real parent, rather than a paragon of motherhood or personhood, or being above all the criticism she should be getting, very deservedly.
