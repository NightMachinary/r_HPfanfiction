It is not crap if I am literally sighting instances from text that anyone can pick up and read, and you're telling me your interpretations about why i am wrong when it is literally in the books? What is that if not imagination and fallacy? If you want to do that, that is your choice, but if you want me to take you seriously then you need to prove it. I understand if you don't care to, but I won't really take anyone seriously when I am citing actual text and they are refuting that based on... ??? Nothing. No evidence. You provided evidence for Fleur and I accepted it, and in fact I had already thought about that before I answered the original response, but like I said, I disregarded it as Fleur being 19 or 20.

Yea you were and arw polite, but that is a basic. There is no obligation for someone to accept what someone says without evidence just because they say it, especially when they are providing evidence.
