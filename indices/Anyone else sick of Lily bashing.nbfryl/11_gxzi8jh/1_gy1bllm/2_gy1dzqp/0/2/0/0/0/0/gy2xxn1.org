It did not. The guy took out a troll with a hand me down wand. Realistically, JK only came up with the whole wand that chose the wizard thing being important only in DH. In PS she wanted to emphasize how poor the Weasleys were. In-universe explanation goes back to my initial comment... most wizards saw Ollivander's statement as a marketing ploy. Neville used his dad's wand too and since 40% of the Gryffindor boys were using hand me down wands, who's to say that that wasn't a statistically representative sample?
