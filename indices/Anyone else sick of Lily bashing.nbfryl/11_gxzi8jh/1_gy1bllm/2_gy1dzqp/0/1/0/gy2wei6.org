Yeah she is not a bad person in that, aa sirius said, the world is not divided into good people and death eaters.

She is however not a paragon or motherhood or personhood etc.

Making sure that your kids have all their basic needs met is the first and most important parameter for any parent. It is not a mistake to buy an expensive and somewhat unnecessary reward for one child and letting another go to school with a hand me down wand which was clearly damaged since it had the unicorn core poking out of it.

Wands are clearly studied a lot in the magical world since everyone uses one and there are lots of wand woods and cores and shops around the world. It has been well established throughout the books that it makes a difference, when the wand and the magician are not bonded, and in fact it is well established that some wands are dangerous when used by poor not bonded to them, or become useless with time. They gave this to an untrained wizard with no idea of how it would go. I am not even slightly surprised that Ron felt neglected in that family.

Also, if this was a one off incident, sure it could be chalked up to a mistake. However, I have mentioned lots of things over the books that made me take notice of Arthur and Molly in a negative way.

They are normal people and they are portrayed as such. However, the fandom has turned them into angels to be worshipped as perfect parents and people. They are not. They are just normal, everyday people who have Implemented their views and prejudices on their lives and the lives of their kids. Yea, Molly is a prejudiced person. From what we can read in the books, much more so than Arthur.

It is odd to me also that they know they do not have the resources, but have 7 kids. And then people in the fandom say that oh, how can you hold their poverty against them. While anyone can do whatever they want with their body, having 7 kids is a choice they make. They chose to have each of those kids. Then they decide to not even give those kids basic equipment because they want to give another one of those kids an expensive gift.
