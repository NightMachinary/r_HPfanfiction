I think you're fighting a couple of strawmen here.

1. No one in the fandom thinks Fleur is a Saint as far as I know. I certainly don't. And being protective of a child is very different to judging the child's fianc√©e so much that you make clear that you think they are only with them for their child's looks. How insulting for the child too, like wtf.

2. Where is anyone blaming anyone for being poor? I have clearly demonstrated that Percy got TWO gifts for being made a prefect, and that ONE of those two gifts could easily have been not given to Percy and that money used to but an ESSENTIAL magical equipment for Ron. Where have I said anything about hand me downs other than getting a used wand which it is already Canon that people should use wands that are matched to them, and that a new wand could have been purchased for Ron instead of giving Percy TWO gifts?

There is no confusion in my comment.
