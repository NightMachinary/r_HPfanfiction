I can tell you for 2 that Fleur was not a saint either. She was a bit of a bitch at Hogwarts, always complaining about stuff and, according to Ginny, she did the same at the Burrow. No one likes a visitor who keeps complaining about your house. Besides it's understandable that parents will be protective of their children when it comes to their partners especially if they're about to get into a life-long commitment with that person.

As for Ron getting hand-me-downs, can you really blame a family for being poor? They also got Ron a broom when he got made a Prefect.
