This is strongly linked to the belief that “the love of a good woman can save someone”. The idea is that if Lily had loved him back he wouldn't have gone Dark. And maybe he wouldn't have. But it's not our job to go around saving assholes by giving up what we want in life and spending our lives trying to save/cure/redeem selfish people. Especially not at the cost of our own well-being.
