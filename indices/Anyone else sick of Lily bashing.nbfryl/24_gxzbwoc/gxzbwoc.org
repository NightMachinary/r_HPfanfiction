I love Snape and some ways relate to him, but still i don't see how Lily had any choice but to cut him off. He was running with future death eaters and pureblood supremists, was showing some early signs of his own capacity for cruelty (even if it was a reaction to another's cruelty), and what's worse used a prejudicial slur against her when all she was trying to do was be supportive. This was a low moment for Snape and not the first disagreement they had if you follow her canon comments and I don't really see how you can blame a person for being "done". There is an actual limit to forgiveness, isn't there?
