Yes! Thank you.

Also, not that this is like a "guaranteed thing", but we know Snape came from a really abusive household.

We all know that he's not made any real effort to get therapy or heal himself until AFTER Lily was dead, and even then, he never worked on himself, he never healed, and he never moved on.

So my point is, how long would it have been for Snape to have abused Lily as a romantic partner? His whole death eatery thing doesn't look good as a friend, let alone, "soul mate."

I have plans to write a darker-what if about Severus and Lily, with the focus being how insidious domestic abuse starts. It's not all slaps.
