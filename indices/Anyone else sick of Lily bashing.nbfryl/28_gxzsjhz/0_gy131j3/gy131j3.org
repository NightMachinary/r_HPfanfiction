Have you read linkffn(Puzzle)? Probably the most realistic portrayal of post-Halloween Snily (it's a dark fic) IMO. One thing in particular that the fic does right is that it is a good example of not all abuse being physical. Snape never physically harms Lily, which I can totally believe -- he saw his father do that, and he doesn't want to become his father. But the relationship remains emotionally toxic, since for a person like Snape, with his upbringing, emotional abuse is more subtle and "harder" to recognize in oneself.
