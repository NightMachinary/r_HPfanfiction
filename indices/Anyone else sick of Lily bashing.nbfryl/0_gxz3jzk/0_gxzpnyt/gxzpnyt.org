Yeah even the apology Snape gave Lily was nothing more then empty words though, like Lily said he calls all people of her birth mudblood, the apology was worthy nothing. he wasn't sorry and Lily finally saw through that, Lily finally stopped being friends with the racist upcoming death eater. Lily's friends even wondered why she was friends with him. It makes me wonder sometimes about what some of the other muggleborn who got called mudblood and attacked by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.
