Possessing magic vs no magic at all is a physical trait.

In the minds of folks who care about pureblood wizards and crap, just being one generation out of "no magic" people isn't good enough to make you one of them. One of their greatest fears is producing non magical children, which is often blamed on muggles in the family tree. So, to them a halfblood or muggleborn is "tainted" and you wouldn't want to marry them because heaven forbid your kid might not have magic.

Filch was terrified of his squib status being discovered. Neville's family basically told him through their actions that they would rather have a dead child than a non magical one. Even the Weasleys have a squib relative they don't talk to, and those two families are supposed to be the GOOD guys. There is a lot of cultural fear of muggles and everything coming from them, even if it happens to be more magical folks.

EDIT: Also, lots and lots of Jews and Romani folks being very much white passing did not stop the Nazis from rounding them up and slaughtering them. It's not always appearance based.
