- Mudblood not having an equivalent

Mudblood is a classist slur. Personally I'd say the best comparison is old vs new money among the wealthy. Old money looks down upon new money, but not as much as the non-wealthy. This comparison also takes into account the in-between group of half-bloods and how their treated differently by how close to new/old money they are. But I don't think that racism is a terrible comparison, discrimination is discrimination, I don't think it's the best though.

- Lily and Snape's friendship (and it's cease)

Admittedly, I may be stricter than most. But we don't actually /see/ the degradation of this friendship, and I'm unsure that the implications would meet what I personally consider bare minimum standards for what I expect from my friends. However, I do agree that at some point you do have to cut your losses, that's why my issues aren't with /what/ Lily does, but /how/ she does it and her actions /after/.

If I can use an example from another book, this reminds me of why I hate Tang Hao from King's Avatar. King's Avatar for context is a webnovel about esports, and the game is MMO-like with classes. Tang Hao demonstrates he is the best at his class, he is also a younger player as well. At one point he makes the point that new players are coming in to replace the older players. That doesn't mean the method of challenging the previous best player of his class, someone who is part of the reason he even has a job, in an all-star event and publicly disrespecting him is an okay thing to do. I consider Lily's actions in this situation similar. Was she justified in cutting ties? Sure. That doesn't mean that doing it in the way she did makes her any less of an asshole though.

The other issue is that she almost immediately started to shack up with James. Admittedly, there is no set timeline, but I've always considered this scene to have happened in 6th year. This means that within a year she's now dating James Potter, the man who bullied her previous best friend and someone she considered a friend a year prior. Even if James stopped bullying Snape in front of Lily, it's odd to be in a romantic relationship with someone who spent the previous 6 years attempting to break up your oldest friendship. Unless of course she never valued Snape as a friend, which doesn't put her in any better of a light. Not to mention that the quickness of this u-turn also could be taken to imply that she was looking for a reason to abandon Snape.

- Snape's friends

Here's my issue. The phrase “Pureblood Supremacists” can also be swapped out with “the only people not named Lily that treated Snape like he was a person”. This very scene also heavily implies that James had practically the entire school on his side. Outside of Lily and the pureblood supremacists, Snape had no one in his corner. Can you really fault Snape for joining up with the only people that treated him like he mattered? The most people that didn't treat him with open animosity? Yes these people used and manipulated him, but isn't it better than the open hatred his was exposed to everywhere else?
