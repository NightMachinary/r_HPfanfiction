Caste systems though are irrelevant in a British society, in which the books are based.

Authorial intent, while not absolute, is in this case important as the position of "Mudbloods" and those what call them that is one of the overall theses (thesises?) of the novels, the other being the power of love over evil.

Is economic class even a thing in Britain? (genuine question, I am not British) I thought social class was much more important, what with the many impoverished aristocrats currently living in Britain. I can see where what I wrote was unclear though re the Weasleys: I don't think their poverty means they lack social class, but their lack of influence (at the Ministry etc) curtails their ability to gain economic class by acquiring funds. To be more concise, though it is possible to be posh and then become poor, you can't be poor and become posh unless you stop being poor first (even then it will take a generation or two for the "noveau riche" stigma to fade- far out we live in a terrible society in a lot of ways...)

You are correct in that Muggle is not a race, but the way in which Muggles as a group are viewed by wizards in these books is an allegory for how people of one race are viewed by people not of that race in the real world, therefore the OP here has simply translated fantasy racism into real world racism, their premise holds. You may not like the original allegory or JK Rowling's conclusions drawn from it, but the OP's allegory is sound.
