Classism can be based on social class, not just economic class. I'd argue that blood purity is closer to a social class than a race.

Furthermore, Racism is different behaviour based on race or ethic group. For something to be considered an ethnic group they need to share a common background, culture, or descent. Since a mudblood can be Japanese, Egyptian, Argentinian, or Swedish with any real difference, I disagree they are an ethic group.

Intent matters little in my opinion, there are many things JK Rowling did terribly. She used abuse as flavour for many characters, did she attempt to show actual consequences of it, likely no, but she did so anyway with Snape. As I said previously discrimination is discrimination. This also applies to your comments on historical severity between classism and racism. This is a work of fiction, historical precedent is irrelevant as far as I'm considered. Also, Caste systems are a fine example of people being killed because of class.
