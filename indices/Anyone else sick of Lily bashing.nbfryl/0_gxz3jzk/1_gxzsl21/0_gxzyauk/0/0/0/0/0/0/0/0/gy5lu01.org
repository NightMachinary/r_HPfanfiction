There is a lot to unpack there that ties back in with how you see the slur in the first place, but it is Saturday where I am now and I am about to take my kids out for the day, so am.leavingnit for now.

Genuinely enjoying this conversation by the way and the opportunity of sharpening my rhetoric skills, but only if it isn't actually upsetting you. For me this is low stakes compared to other arguments I could have, so just want to check it is the same for you? If not I'll back off.

Just wanted to give you a heads up for the future, the negative form of adjusted isn't unadjusted, it is maladjusted. I knew what you meant, but some people will jump down your throat for those sort of slip ups (particularly if you write then in a fanfiction piece!) and it is annoying and derailing, so thought you would like to know for future writing.
