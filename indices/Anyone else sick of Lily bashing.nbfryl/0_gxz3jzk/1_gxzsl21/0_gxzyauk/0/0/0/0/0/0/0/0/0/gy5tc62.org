Enjoy your weekend, mine starts tomorrow (EST).

I like the conversation. I have no major investment in it.

That's got to be a regional thing, I have literally never hear the term maladjusted in my life.

That said, fic wise despite me workshopping it, it's fairly unlikely to actually be posted. My loose papers of workshopped ideas (admitted folded to be pocket size) is probably about 30cm tall by now (1 foot for Imperial friends) and that doesn't include the notes I've written on my phone/ computers. One of my pet peeves as a reader is a large potential story that's unfinished, as such I've made a rule only to ever post a finished story. I've finished all of one of my stories, and I've yet to transfer it to a text file so it has yet to be posted lol.

That said, if I can gush about (one of) my current pet fics (the Mtg one). It's actually a mega crossover, MtG with its lore allows me to justify visiting many worlds with characters of a specific criteria. It also has its magic system be aligned with personality, as well. So it was fun to Workshop Snape into this world, where he's free from the reality of the Wizarding world. Admittedly, he changed more into the cunning, than ambitious type, as he now has the power to walk out of the reality of anything bothering him. James Potter trying to curse him? Now Snape is hanging out with Dragons on Tarkir. His father about to belt him? Well good luck trying while he's studying dinosaurs on Ixalan. I have Snape completely changing colour alignment. All this disregarding the extra fandoms I'm adding in too. Snape's first walk (a first walk happens at a traumatizing event, hence why I wanted to know timing for worst memory (admittedly, near death works too)) has him entering the Ichidian Universe (which is from a series that has all of 18 fics on AO3 and FFN combined), and he carved out a new house for himself on a mostly abandoned planet. I think the interactions between Magic and Sci-Fi tech could be cool. I'm also going to throw the most stereotypical Gryffindor like group of pirates at him too.

I need to hurry up and write down one of my other ones so I can move focus to this. Complete and vaguely related side note, I'm disappointed by the lack of Marauder Era fics that have Slytherin!Harry, also the ones that have teen parent Harry. Also, yes I have a weird obsession with Marauder era fics dispute my opinions on them. Honestly, it has more to do with the terrible backstories. The only character who benefited from backstories was Snape. Voldemort's backstory is something you literally cannot do with his archetype (as it breaks it), and Snape's backstory made me care about James/Lily's death even less than I already did (and I didn't care about it).

Alas, I've gone off topic and rambled enough. Thanks for entertaining me mate.
