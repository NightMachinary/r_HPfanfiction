You know, except for when they exploited the Indian Caste system to their benefit, but whatever.

While I acknowledge artistic intent is a factor. I disagree on it's importance. Art is meant to be interpreted, and despite intent, blood status is in appearance closer to social class.

Economic class is the basic class system everyone is accustomed to. Personally, I live in Canada so I can't say for certain, but I have no reason to believe economic class doesn't exist in Britain.

Social class however can be affected by things like blood purity. For example, the social class for a 3rd cousin of the king is lower than that of the prince. That would be purity of blood line, no?

I never said that racism is a bad analogy. In fact, it's probably better than classism, simply based on accessibility. More people are more familiar with racism than the methods of classism. I simply stated I feel that classism is more accurate as a 1 for 1.

JK Rowling is an idiot who fails to do basic research, I have no doubt she probably believes that blood purity is racism. Also, a dialogue doesn't have to be a 1 for 1 to draw meaningful conclusions. Whatever you want to call it, the muggleborn issue is as impactful to wizarding society as racism is to western society. It's natural connections be drawn. But these same connections can be drawn to any type of discrimination that is a major issue in a society.
