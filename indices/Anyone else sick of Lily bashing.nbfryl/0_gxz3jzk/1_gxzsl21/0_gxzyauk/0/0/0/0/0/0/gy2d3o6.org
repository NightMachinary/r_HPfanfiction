While the British exploited the Indian caste system, they did not import that system back to Britain and integrate it into their own society, which is why I stated it is irrelevant in a book based in Britain which follows British societal norms. I did not mean to imply that the Indian Caste System was unknown to Britain, or that the Britsh did not exploit it while in India, or to belittle the affects on Indian people when the British exploited it.

I don't think you are correct that economic class is "the basic" class structure for "everyone." Economic and Social class are interlinked, but the importance of them varies country to country and society to society.

I am struggling to find exactly what you are arguing here, is it that racism and classicm are interchangeable examples of prejudice when it comes to finding a real world analogy for blood purity prejudice? If so I can see that. I still disagree but I think my arguments come down to time and place (Britain, 90s) authorial intent (I think it more likely that a woman in JK Rowling's position in the 90s would tackle race that class) which you have already dismissed (fair, the importance of the author's intent is always going to be based on opinion and you are as entitled to yours as I am to mine) and on my own bias from reading the books in the 90s (the first three, anyway) and being much more aware of race as a contemporaneous topic of social concern than class. Hence here I am happy to agree to disagree.

(EDIT Having said that, I still feel blood purity is more likely to be a racial prejudice than a class prejudice because of it's consequences. At no time in British history was a person killed because they were lower class. The only class based deaths I can think of were the results of revolutions in which members of high class groups were targeted (French/Russian revolution, English civil war.) However, genocide, the killing of people based on race, has been a sadly constant atrocity throughout human history. The Death Eaters willingness to kill Muggles because they are muggles, and to hold the lives of Muggleborn people as less worthy because they are Muggleborn and for no other reason, is a strong argument for bloody purity being a racial prejudice, because the consequences align with racial prejudice, noit class prejudice.)

As an aside, while I have issues with JK Rowling (who doesn't?) I don't think she is an idiot. If she were I could forgive her own prejudices more easily. Her research and knowledge in some areas is phenomenal, but she has blind spots and biases and draws conclusions from incomplete knowledge, as do we all. I take issue when she is presented with new or different information or questioned on her bias and instead of examining her position she digs in.
