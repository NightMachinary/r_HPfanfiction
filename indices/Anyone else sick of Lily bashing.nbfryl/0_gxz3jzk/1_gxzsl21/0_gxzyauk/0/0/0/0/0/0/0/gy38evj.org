You pretty much got it. Muggleborn discrimination is an example of discrimination that people will tie to whatever the common discrimination is at the time. Personal context rules what it equates to. So while I'm of the opinion it's closer to Classism by definition, I do understand why people say racism and I'm not faulting them for it.

As for Rowling specifically, sure I was harsh. What I meant to say is that I don't consider her a good author by any stretch. There are many issues she glosses over without actually considering the effects. My biggest issue is mental health and effects of abuse. Harry shouldn't be able to function in society the way he does (also, he shouldn't be anywhere near average height, but I digress). Snape suffers from this too. While he is unadjusted, considering the context of his life, he is extremely well adjusted. Snape shouldn't be a functional human being and should probably be living with a keeper, yet he's just an asshole. Sure an asshole who become Neville's boggart, but just an asshole. As an author JK Rowling fails to recognize consequences. There is no reason Ron's betrayal in Goblet is any less of a transgression than Snape's snapping on Lily, yet it's completely forgiven with no explanation. Ron then proceeds to completely ignore Harry for a summer of PTSD and abuse, and again no repercussions. Ron betrays Harry's trust again in the Horcrux hunt, and yet again suffers no consequences. Ginny was possessed repeatedly over the course of a year, and suffers no mental damage. JK Rowling is amazing at surface world building, but that is where her authorial skills end. But I will admit, she is an amazing business woman, and certainly knows how to capitalize on what she has. She is the reason theme part clauses exist in contracts now.
