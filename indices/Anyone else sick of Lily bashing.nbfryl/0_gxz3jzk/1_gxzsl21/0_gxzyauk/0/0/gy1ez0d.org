I disagree with the slur being more classist than racist. If you look at class in the HP books it seems to have little to do with blood purity. The Weasley family are pureblood but lack the influence of other pureblood families. Justin Finch-Flecherly has hallmarks of a high class status (double barrelled surname, name down for Eton) yet is considered a potent target for the Heir of Slytherin when the Heir's motives are assumed to be based on blood. When the kids rock up to Malfoy Manor Hermione is chosen to torture due to her blood status, not Ron despite his comparable poverty and lack of influence. (If Bellatrix was not blinded by blood hate and had actually chosen a victim based on likelihood to crack she would have picked Ron, or she would have interrogated Ron WHILE torturing Hermione.)

Blood purity is a type of racism, because it is concerned with "purity." Purity is based on race, not class. Aristocratic people marry into the middle classes all the time without outcry (e.g. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) but marrying across race lines sadly and infuriatingly still provokes outrage from some sections of the community (e.g. The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex.) While I could see the Malfoy parents being concerned if Draco chose to marry a poor or lower class pureblood, I doubt that would get him kicked out, (or indeed blasted from the Black family tapestry) but marrying a muggleborn? That would be disowning territory.

Finally, in setting Muggle hating Voldemort up as a successor to Grindelwald and drawing clear parallels between Grindelwald and Hitler, JK Rowling is clearly using blood purity in the fictional world as an allegory for racial purity in the real one, which makes slurs based on blood status racial, not classist.

Voldemort and his Death Eaters do not believe Muggles are worthy of life, and they do not believe muggleborns are worthy of magic, and therefore believe there is no difference between the two, therefore they believe muggleborns, or "mudbloods" are not worthy of life. No one has ever killed someone solely based on their class, but plenty of people have been killed based solely on race.
