- Lily's actions

You make a good point. My opinion of Lily, well not completely fixed, would've been greatly benefitted by a scene where Lily attempted to integrate Snape into /her/ friend group. Do you honestly think that if Snape had an option to be around people that didn't entirely hate him and that Lily approved of (not to mention Lily at the same time), he wouldn't have taken it? Given Snape's devotion to her (which, yes is creepy), and her friends general opinion about him, I doubt that was attempted. Lily voiced concerns but never did anything about it. There is a massive difference between telling someone they have a problem and trying to help them. I think Lily could've and should've done more. Loyalty isn't about unwavering support, it's about making sure you're friends aren't fucking up terribly.

- The Scene

I figured you haven't, that's why I gave practically the entire scene lol. But let's run through the scene again shall we? It starts from the Marauders POV, they decide to pick on Snape /because they're bored/. Snape at the moment is minding his own business, reading a book. The Marauders then flip him and strip him waist down (or up I suppose), in front of the majority of the school. Lily, after laughing, tells off the Marauders and attempts to help Snape. Snape, understandably embarrassed after being sexually assaulted, lashes out. Lily then breaks off the friendship and practically denounces him in front of a large part of the school. The movies toned down this scene by quite a bit as I recall, but Lily doesn't come out of this looking good in my opinion.

- Timeline

If it was after OWLs I'll still say 6 years for brevities sake, but I don't recall seeing that when I was trying to find that timeline for that scene the other day. But yes, I'm referring to the mudblood scene. I'll trust you on this though.

- Relationship

Regardless, someone who bullied someone whom I claim to be a friend for 6yrs, nevermind who was meddling in my interpersonal relationships for that same amount of time, isn't worth the time of day. James was said to stop bullying Snape /in front of Lily/, he may have matured a little but I still don't look upon that in any good light. This relationship negatively impacts my opinion of Lily, and it's a major uphill climb to claim it shouldn't.

- Snape's revenge

There was in fact a character whom claimed that Snape “Gave as good as he got”. Unfortunately, that character was Sirius Black (who attempted to murder Snape might I add), who was defensive after Harry expressed extreme disappointment in his actions. Taking this statement at face value is equivalent to people finding out a company does shady business practices and trusting their damage control press release as 100% fact. I'm not buying it.

- Redemption

Okay, despite this conversation. This is the Hot Take, I promise.

I actually don't believe most people talked about in the redemption conversation, actually need it. First Draco is frequently in this conversation, but I take issue with saying he needs redemption for his beliefs when his primary influence (guardians) taught him for 11yrs before the series, he was better than everyone of a lower class. Not to mention that this belief was also likely shared among all secondary influences, and not challenged until his Hogwarts years, I disagree that he need be redeemed for that. I also don't think any of his actions are bad enough to justify a redemption either. Dudley is in a similar boat. Dudley was rewarded for beating in Harry and being a brat. I think his apology at the end of the series was more than enough to absolve him of his part, and I consider it more of a blight on Petunia and Vernon than Dudley.

Snape is again, mostly solved with context. Snape started in an abusive home, progressed into a school where he was targeted since before even arriving at Hogwarts (James and Sirius targeted Snape on the train), then after that was immediately thrust into a war. People don't tend to fair well coming from /one/ of these things, nevermind /all/ of them. People fault Snape for not being functional in society, but I ask when could've been learned to be a functioning member of society? Look up veteran mental health, Snape was a spy too, he likely experienced the worst of both sides. If you don't want to read papers, the music video to Wrong Side of Heaven by Five Finger Death Punch does decent at representing it, and gives some statistics on the topic.

Snape being ‘redeemed' would, in my opinion, be a disservice to anyone in these situations. It would imply that they should be actively try to make up for their situations, that they have no control over. It's victim blaming at best.

It important to note (though I'm probably down voted at this point). I'm not saying these characters are faultless, their actions are still theirs. Snape is still Neville's Boggart. Snape is still not a good person, and shouldn't be a teacher. But to blame Snape alone is BS.

- Bashing

Personally I feel like bashing is an overly broad term to the point of uselessness. However, if anything gets to the point I consider it bashing I agree it shouldn't be done.

But I don't to turn around and say Lily is blameless while Snape is completely in the wrong here, also doesn't make sense to me.
