Addendum, FYI the scene in which Snape calls Lily a Mudblood must happen in their fifth year, because it happens just after they leave an OWL examination. Then when Harry recounts the scene to Sirius, Sirius tells him Lily started dating James in seventh year, "after his head had deflated a bit" or words to that effect. So that is at the VERY least a 13 month gap between the dissolution of her friendship with Snape and her acceptance of James, and for a 15-17 year old 13 months is a very long time.

Edit: it bugged me enough (plus am procrastinating on what I am meant to be doing) to go grab the book, because I haven't read it in ages. I am mostly right, except it was Lupin who told Harry his parents got together in their seventh year, and then Sirius added in the bit about head deflation. It is in Order of the Phoenix, the chapter is "Careers Advice" and in my copy (1st Edition, Australia) it is page 591.
