I disagree with your premise. I don't think James interfered in Lily and Snape's friendship, and I don't think it is a given that James bullied Severus for six years.

Remember, canonically we have only the memories Snape chose to provide to view both his relationship with Lily and his relationship with James. While they add up to one conclusion, I think we are missing Lily's point of view, and the small glimpses of it we get are indicative of a deeply flawed friendship with cracks beginning to show much earlier.

As for James interfering in Lily's friendship with Snape, when does he do that? I can't think of a single example in cannon, though I may be forgetting something.

We see James on the Hogwarts Express as a brash 11 year old, a child of privlige who lacks the social awareness that not eveyone thinks like he and his family do and is therefore rude and blunt. Annoying, but not insurmountable or unforgivable and not bullying.

We then jump forward to Snape complaining that James likes Lily, and being far more interested in that than in ACTUALLY LISTENING TO WHAT LILY IS SAYING about how uncomfortable she, his best friend, feels around his other friends, and when she does address his concerns about James she doesn't say anything about him bullying Snape, just that he is arrogant. Again, arrogancy is annoying, but it is not bullying. Neither Snape nor Lily mention James actively interfering in theior friendship, he is the topic of a conversation between them, but he hasn't orchestrated that conversation in any way.

The incident outside the OWLS is definitely bullying, but that isn't six years' worth, or even five by that point, and it comes after Snape and his friends have been involved in targeting Muggleborn students, according to his own memory of his talk with Lily. This doesn't excuse the bullying, but it does frame the incident in a context Harry did not have the first time he saw it, but that Lily did. If Lily has been dealing with a growing dissonance between Snape's treatment of her and his attitude to muggleborns as a group, and his willingness to befriend people who outright hate her for her muggleborn status, couldn't being called "Mudblood" by him be the metaphorical slap in the face she needed to readjust her ideas on Snape? And if that has happened, what loyalty does she now owe this person who has proved that under pressure they will use a slur against her? Has James tried to break up any of her other friendships, or just this one? She can't even excuse Snape on the grounds of his upbringing- because James is a pureblood, and whatever else he is, he is not prejudiced against any muggleborn, whereas Snape is prejudiced against muggles and muggleborns with her as the only exception, and has now just shown that when angry, humiliated and stressed he WILL use her blood status against her.

Lily doesn't have the knowledge of what will happen, she doesn't know Snape will "come good" (though there I would argue he doesn't entirely, he stops attacking muggleborns, but he himself is a much worse bully than James ever was, he bullies pupils over whom he has authority, which is despicable.) She does know that Snape has failed her utterly, has disrespected her, has undercut any work she has done to rehabilitate his character with her friends and has prejudices incompatible with their friendship continuing.

James, on the other hand, apparently "deflates his head," over the next 13-23 months, which is not outside the realms of possibility given how quickly children and teenagers change. Lily's issues with James seem to fundamentally have boiled down to his arrogance. It makes sense that an open-minded person who believes in the ability of people to change (maybe even admires that ability after seeing her former best friend be unable to overcome his prejudice) would approve of this change and welcome it. Without the one character flaw to which she has ever objected (as far as we know from Snape's own memories) what is stopping her from befriending James? And having befriended him, it is not inevitable that she will date him, but it becomes a possibility. James changed, just as Severus did, but Severus changed too late for Lily to see it, and it took her death for it to happen. That, I think, reflects poorly on Snape.
