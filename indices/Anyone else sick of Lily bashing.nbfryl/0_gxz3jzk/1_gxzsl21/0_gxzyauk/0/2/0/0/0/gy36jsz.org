- interference

This is admittedly my personal interpretation. However, this is given with the context of house rivalries and Lily/Snape being in different houses. Especially after James' infatuation with Lily, I personally see this as a driving force. The other reason would be no reason, and that arguably makes James look worse.

- Train scene

I agree that this scene isn't bullying. However, this scene is clearly (in my opinion at least) when Snape was chosen as a target. James and Sirius never seem to bully anyone else, and considering their popularity I find it unlikely they did. I disagree the bullying didn't start soon after though, this scene would have no real purpose in my opinion otherwise.

- The conversation

I've said this previously. Telling someone they have a problem is not equivalent to doing something about it. If Lily truly didn't want Snape to be around the people he was (which it's worth noting, are psychopaths with free access to where he sleeps), she should've attempted to bring him into her friend group. As I said elsewhere, this scene would've improved (but overall, probably not fix) my opinion of Lily. If that had been an option, would Snape not have taken it? With his devotional Lily I find it difficult to believe he wouldn't have.

As for the bullying: a) James explicitly hides it from Lily during (at least) 7th year, no reason to believe she's seeing it, b) she's a child and teenage boys aren't likely to admit to being bullied, c) publicly making a fool out of Snape is the attempt (and it worked mind you).

- The incident

We'll have to agree to disagree on length of time I imagine. You're never going to convince me that it started that year. With the levels of animosity from both sides and severity of actions, I cannot agree to that.

Also, I said in my initial comment. My issue isn't that Lily stopped being friends with Snape. It's how she did it, and of course the relationship negatively impacts my opinion as well. Just because you don't owe someone loyalty doesn't mean you should be an asshole.

I disagree that Snape proves himself worse than James with context.

Look, you're not going to convince me this relationship doesn't reflect poorly on Lily. I'm sorry. If Lily's issue is arrogance and not James being an active bully, fine your point stands. That still doesn't improve my opinion, nor does it change the fact that she overlooked that.

- My opinions on Snape

I feel like this gets lost with how often I defend Snape from victim blaming. But I agree Snape isn't a good person. Snape is beyond damaged goods, he shouldn't be working with children in any capacity. He went from abuse to bullied to a war with little/no downtime between them. Any one of these issues is enough to make someone dysfunctional in society, nevermind all of them. Snape isn't a good person, and yes he does need to be held accountable for his actions, he undeniably fucked up here. I'm not trying to absolve Snape of his actions, but to say Lily is blame free, or James should get off his actions, is something I disagree with.
