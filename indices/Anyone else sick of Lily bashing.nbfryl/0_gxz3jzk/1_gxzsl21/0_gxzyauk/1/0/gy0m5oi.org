I think that "mudblood" and "pureblood" are definitely analogous to racial slurs/language, simply because those are things that someone has no control over and they are directly linked to their parentage. The whole blood quotient method of determining if someone is muggleborn, halfblood, or pureblood was modeled /directly/ off the Nazi Nuremburg Laws to determine whether or not someone was legally Jewish or if their most recent Jewish ancestor was far enough back that they were "pure".

A better comparison might be to the KKK. Snape was like a mixed race kid that passed for white, whose non-white parent brutalized him and his mom. Then he gets put in a dorm for 7 years with basically kids of KKK families, and grew into their company trying to fit in and it consumed him. To the point that he insulted his best childhood friend with a slur and lost her friendship forever (rightfully so).

Agreed that aspect of their friendship wasn't healthy. Snape is one of my favorite characters, but Lily was absolutely within her rights to enforce that boundary when he crossed it with her.

He really seems like someone who would have become very codependent in a relationship without a lot of self awareness and support from a counselor. He was\\
a codependent friend for sure. Definitely Lily wasn't in the position to provide that for him and she shouldn't have been expected to when she wasn't comfortable with it any more. I don't understand why people bash her for it.
