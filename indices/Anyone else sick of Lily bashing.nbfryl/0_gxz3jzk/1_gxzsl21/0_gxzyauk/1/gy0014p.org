“Since there is no prejudice against ones blood in real world, there so no special word for it, but I'm not sure why you would say it's closer to a lord-peasant thing that racist thing. Pure blood supremacists thought that Muggleborns were inherently inferior to Pure bloods. The talk about 'keeping the blood pure' can be analogous to 'keeping the genetics pure'. During the Voldemort's short reign muggleborns were forced themselves in to the government (or hide, in which case there were pursued) and after sham trials stripped of their wands, jobs, possibly sent to prison, some of them were implied to end up homeless and beggars on Diagon. It's not racism per se, because our definition of race doesn't include that, but it seems like a decent analogy.”

I said it was closer because of status and, well, nobility. As you say later, a lot of that is similar to what happened to peasants. It ties closer to that rather than race. As I said, I do not /hate/ the analogy, I just do not believe it fits and makes people think the situation is worse than what it is. Yes, it was still an awful thing that he did, but it is not as awful as calling her a racist term to her face. The issue is that it is all unique and ties into factors that have not existed. For example, royalty often marries other royalty. Is that racist? See, because after like four or five generations, I think Rowling said, you can go from a half-blood to a pure-blood. As long as your great-great-great grandparents are magical, you are fine. Then again, I do not think Rowling made that canon.

“Oh I definitely didn't mean in this way. I don't believe that Snape was abusive in their relationship or forced Lily to anything. But I don't believe it was a healthy friendship either. He was certainly poisoned and manipulated, but it sounds like Lily offered him what she could for how long she could. At some point she had to say stop for her own sanity.”

Never meant to imply that you did. I do not think it was healthy either way. For him and for her. Moving apart was for the best. Lily offered him far more than any normal human would. Makes it seem so much nicer of he seeing as she was a teenager and she was an ‘enemy' of the House he was in.

“That he did, but the point is it's not that one word that really ended this friendship, but his whole behaviour: making friends with and defending pureblood supremacists, aiming to be Death Eater - that Lily asks him about in their final conversation and he doesn't deny it. He seems to regret calling her a Mudblood, because it's her, not because the whole ideology is awful. He later asks to save Lily but not her family, even to Dumbledore.”

I am not here to defend Snape, to be honest. I think he is the best written character, next to Dumbledore. So flawed. So human. As such, he was so obsessed with her that he did not see her as a Mudblood, I dare say. I honestly think that without an intervention, if she remained friends with him, he would have became toxic. He would have become so overprotective, jealous, and afraid it would be suffocating.

I love discussing Snape as he is such a great character with so much depth. A delightful dark shade of grey. There is light there, yes, but also a lot of darkness.
