On one hand, I agree with you in the sense that yes, Lily is not in the wrong for ditching Snape at that point. On the other, I'm curious what kind of fics you read that has invoked this reaction, because I've hardly ever seen this. Lily is one of the characters bashed the least in the fandom IME, to the point where people usually do the opposite and pull a Snape -- put her on a pedestal.

FWIW, I think both Severus and Lily could have been better friends to each other at various points -- Severus needs to get his shit together in terms of how he treat Muggleborns other than Lily, and Lily could stand to take Snape more seriously when he comments on the trouble the Marauders cause him (Werewolf prank aftermath in particular comes to mind). But I would never fault Lily for cutting Severus off after the O.W.L. incident. She has probably heard Mudblood a lot from Slytherins in her year, but at least Severus is an exception -- until he isn't. It must have felt like an utter betrayal.
