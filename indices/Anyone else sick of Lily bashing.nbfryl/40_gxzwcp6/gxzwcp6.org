I will be honest, I'm not fan of Lily and I don't think she was a flawless character. I find her annoying honestly.

But this doesn't justify Snape's wrong doings and her reaction towards him was deserved. James was a jock and very flawed, but Snape in his younger years was a racist and terrorist, I don't get why Lily would get so criticism for rejecting and moving on from an abusive relationship, in this case a very toxic and even dangerous friendship. No one deserves to be with someone that call you slurs and hangs out with people that hate people like you.
