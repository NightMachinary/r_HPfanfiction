Your analogy is not complement accurate. Snape wasn't Lily's “white” childhood friend. If you remember, his father was a muggle who was a horrible person that most likely abused his mother and Snape himself. If we use your analogy, then Snape was a biracial kid who had several issues due to abusive father, powerless mother, and, perhaps, internalized racism who absolutely despised his own family. So, while his behavior is still inexcusable, it is at least understandable (compared to Draco, who was rich and powerful and still chose to be a racist ass).

Regarding Lily, I only have one issue with her. She smiled, when she saw Snape was being bullied. It doesn't matter whether you like the person or not, but you should never laugh at someone who is suffering from abuse.

Nevertheless, she was in her own right when she decided to end her friendship with Snape. She didn't owe anyone anything.
