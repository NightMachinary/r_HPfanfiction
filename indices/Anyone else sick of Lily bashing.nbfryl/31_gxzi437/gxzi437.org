Hard agree, tbh i never understood why so many pple defend snape after everything he did... trying to come up with execuses when he's clearly a bad person and a bully, and saying lily should forgive him when he's obviously convinsed in blood purity (calling other muggleborn mudblood, becoming a death eater even after everything, not caring if a year old child dies if his lily survives and then bulling the said child whose only crime is looking like his father...)
