Tbh Lilly could have done better than James or Snape. The thing that gets me is the Marauders never told Lilly that they nearly fed Snape to Remus. Like, yeah James may have changed but....I don't think I could be with someone who tried to feed my former best friend to a werewolf. I mean, yeah James saved Snape, but I couldn't really be friends or date someone who remained friends with an attempted murderer. Especially if their potential victim was/used to be my best friend.
