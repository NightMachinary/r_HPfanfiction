Yeah, I have a crush on Alan Rickman (his voice ahhhh) and if you read enough fanfics, the negative canon characterises fade as multiple authors play up and rewrite whatever positive additional traits they want to create. It all gets jumbled up after a while.

If someone reads canon only and romanticises from that, i wonder if they've had a concussion

Alan looked absolutely magnificent in his robes. Really nailed the billowing bat of the dungeons reputation
