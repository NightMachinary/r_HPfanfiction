False. Snape has been my favorite character for almost 20 years and I despise the movies, particularly their take on Snape (all due respect to Alan Rickman, though). It does a real disservice to the complexity of his character --- love him or hate him, he's always been one of the most interesting characters --- to dismiss his popularity to being based on the movies.

Also, it's canon that a patronus can't be generated by “corrupted” emotions, which is why no genuine Death Eater can produce one. It's sad that people can't imagine staying loyal to the memory of possibly the only friend he ever had, so they have to twist it into him just wanting to fuck her... but it's not canon.
