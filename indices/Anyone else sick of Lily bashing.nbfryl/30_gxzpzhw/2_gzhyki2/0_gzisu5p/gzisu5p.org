I honestly think you're in the minority then, as the Snape fans I've talked to conflate Rickman with Snape, and I've been a fan since I first read the Prisoner of Azkaban back when I was a kid (so long ago -- I used to call Hermione "Her-me-own" until one of my friends, annoyed, corrected me, lol).

Snape's "love" for Lily was driven by selfish desires and obsession. In a twisted way it was love, I guess, but not the love seen in healthy people.
