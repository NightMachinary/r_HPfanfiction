No, I don't think I am. He's been a very popular character since the very first book. I'm not denying that Rickman's portrayal isn't a factor, but he's very popular regardless and always has been. Just because a certain narrative has popped up within a certain part of fandom doesn't negate that.

While I have complicated feelings on Lily and Severus, the whole “heh heh incel” thing is so lazy and cheap.
