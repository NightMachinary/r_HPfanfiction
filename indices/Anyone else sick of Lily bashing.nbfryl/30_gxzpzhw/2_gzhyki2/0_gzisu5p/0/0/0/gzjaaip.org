“ Just because he felt "love" for her doesn't mean that love wasn't fueled by selfless, and by extension due to how fucked up of a person he is, desires. That'd be enough to form a patronus, IMHO.”

What does this even mean? No, really... what form of love is completely selfless? I can't think of one, not even the love between a mother and child. So “fucked up” people can't love truly? This is what I don't like about fandom these days, no nuance or understanding of how actual human beings behave.

Perfect example is the demonizing of him for not asking about James and Harry. First off, he doesn't owe James ANYTHING, not for Lily's sake or anything else. Secondly, Harry was literally a potential subject of the prophecy, so how was Severus supposed to ask Voldemort to, uh, basically ignore the prophecy without getting AK'd instantly? Where would that have put everyone, with no one to spy on the DE's in either war?

As for him initially turning to Dumbledore and watching out for Harry for Lily's sake, so what? Do you think Sirius would have been as devoted to Harry if he weren't James' son as well as his godson? Everyone's got their own reasons why they do what they do, and you could argue about all of them being “selfish” if you cared to. Human nature. Also, it's pretty clear by the end of the series that Lily isn't his only motivation. If she were, there's no way would go through with Dumbledore's plan to let Harry die. He wouldn't have been affected by watching people die without being able to save them, nor would he have cared about Phineas Nigellus calling Hermione, someone he doesn't even like, a mudblood. He goes to his death thinking he's sending his best friend's son to his own death, something he's spent literally half his life trying to prevent, because it's for a greater cause. But he was ugly and unpleasant while doing it, so fuck him, I guess.

Anywho, that's just my two cents and you're entitled to your own. I'm not big on drawn out back and forths. I won't be responding again. Take care.
