We'll have to agree to disagree then.

It's a shame, as it was quite fascinating to see and respond to another person's perspective of Snape, which could be used to give him more dimension and depth in a fan-fic (which is always a good thing), but then your last line...

I'm a bit disappointed by your response, to be honest. But I'll respect it.

Have a good day.
