No, I don't think Snape can be defined by just calling him an "incel" (and that is a definition used by broadly and incorrectly by people anyway), but I do think he's, frankly, fucked up as a person.

I think you're one of only a few people I've talked to in all my years in the fandom that have such a view of Snape -- it's actually a bit refreshing, really, even if I disagree with you.

He may have loved Lily in his own way, but it was not normal, healthy love -- it was fueled by hell-bent obsession.

Just because he felt "love" for her doesn't mean that love wasn't fueled by selfless, and by extension due to how fucked up of a person he is, desires. That'd be enough to form a patronus, IMHO.

He also didn't care that her husband and child were targeted. He only wanted /her/ spared. James I can sort-of understand from his perspective, but Harry, her child, was an innocent. He also only decided to look out for Harry because he was part of Lily, and because Dumbledore basically guilted him into it.

He also only decided to turn a "new leaf" after he found out Voldemort was targeting her.

Snape was a horrible person, period. He may have been shaped that way in his childhood and adolescence, but he was truly a repugnant and messed up person.
