Alan Rickman was a prize human. Snape was nasty.

What I love about these books is that every single character we get to know even a little has such a rich and complex inner life, that they could be real people. Snape is awful but in his selfish, almost incel way, he is also in love with this one person who was kind to him. He does care for her, but he doesn't care for her enough to not work with the terrorist who wants to kill everyone like her, her family, and her. He doesn't live her enough to not want to see her in pain. He just loves her enough to want to possess her, perhaps like a clever pet.
