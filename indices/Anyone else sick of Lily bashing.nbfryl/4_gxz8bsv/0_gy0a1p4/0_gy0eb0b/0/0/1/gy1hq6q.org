He's also only what 17 when he joins and 21 when he decides to change sides. I agree he is a rich character and I think a lot of youth don't realize the seriousness of horrible groups and gangs when they are young until something happens and they do. Him being roped into a hater group by people that probably made him feel accepted isn't unrealistic. He regretted his actions after. I just wish we would've seen a little more depth in him towards Harry. His redemption fell a little short for me to forgive him. But maybe that's the point good guys aren't always nice and likeable.
