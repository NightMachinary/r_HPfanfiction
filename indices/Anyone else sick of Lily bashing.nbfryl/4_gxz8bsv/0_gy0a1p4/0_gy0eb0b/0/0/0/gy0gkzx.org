What you said reminded me of what a friend once told me. when you date online you want to meet the person asap so you fall in love with who they are and dont fall in love with the ideal of them.

Snape loved the idea of lily, some where lily ceased to be an actual person in his mind and he fell in love with the idea of lily

I think Snape at the time cared more for the power he felt with dark magic then he did for lily.

it makes sense, he is powerless at home so he seeks that power.

People are weird, I remember on twitter, Felton said something they disagreed with and they where like we stan draco not felton and its like Draco was in the magic hitler youth there is this weird part of the human brain where if the person is attractive you let them get away with more shit
