Nathan Beard (Gandalf's Beard) has made a lot of good points on Quora about Snape. If someone's a Lily-basher on this issue, it's a guarantee they are also a major James-basher (and Sirius basher goes without saying). In addition to pointing out that "/Sectumsempra/ was Snape's favorite spell" in Hogwarts (!!!) and that Lily was already criticising him for going along with his Slytherin friends cursing First years (!!!), canon never, ever deals with what Snape said to those Death Eater and future Death Eater friends about LILY. Does anyone believe it was good things? Or that he ever defended her? I do not. If she was lucky he said she would be a good mistress. It probably goes downhill from there. Following up on that, what if James or Sirius eavesdropped on Snape talking about Lily? Or saw him do nothing when his Death Eater friends were cursing first years? Or even join in? Because he helped get James killed, Snape has the advantage when it comes to brainwashing Harry with selective memories. We don't see James do anything that could be called bullying to anyone but Snape in canon. And if there were other Slytherins involved, if they were, say, first years, why wouldn't Lily have mentioned that? She did, explicitly, talking about her "friend" Snape. What we do see him do, years before Lily agreed to date him, is bust his ass to help save Remus Lupin. We see him take in Sirius Black despite his family's evil reputation. And so on. We don't see Snape - ever - do even one nice thing in Hogwarts. Clever things, absolutely. And even his pre-Hogwarts friendship with Lily seems to have exacerbated the rift between Petunia and her. In emphasising how Harry finds out his father is only human, the emphasis is ONLY on Snape's feelings, Snape's perspective. We're told James fell in love with Lily basically in First Year. That the enmity between him and Snape grew year after year. Well, it must have been frustrating seeing Snape fitting in to the Death Eater den that Slughorn let Slytherin house become. If Lily was too naiive to believe James, Sirius and Remus, that probably made their blood boil - especially with Snape espousing the philosophy that reduced Lily to an animal, the same philosophy Sirius' family espoused when they tortured him. The same philosophy he was losing his little brother to.

Also, to quote the late Phil Ochs: "Some of our best Negroes are friends."
