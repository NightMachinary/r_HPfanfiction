I think you read my post wrong. I did not say anything about Lily marrying James to get back at Snape.

Lily married James despite witnessing the bulling that was inflicted toward her old friend.

James might have grown and matured, but It would be kind of strange if Lily did not take his past actions into account.

I just wish we saw more of them in canon and understand Lily's thought process.
