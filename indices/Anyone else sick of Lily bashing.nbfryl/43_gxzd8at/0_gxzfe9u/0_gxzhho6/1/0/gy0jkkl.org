  Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr Malfoy. Then your father did something Snape could never forgive. " "What?" ”He saved his life." ”What??" ”Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?

  “Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly-all turned out to be Death Eaters.”

Note: this was noted to include Rosier, Mulciber, Avery, Rodolphus Lestrange and Bellatrix Black at various points. It was quoted by Lily in Snape's memory of an incident that they bullied Mary Macdonald (a Gryffindor Muggleborn, see The Prince's Tale in DH).

  “Well,” said Lupin slowly, “Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?

On Pottermore, JKR refers to Snape as as James' nemesis or arch-rival on multiple occasions (see the entry on the Marauder's map for multiple usages).

Basically, we are given a handful of Snape's memories (the incident by the lake is literally described as his worst memory, and both Lily's reaction and his subsequent backlash at Lily implies that that wasn't a regular occurrence the way is often made out, but a far worse incident), and a few short statements from those on the other side (although Lupin is sympathetic to Snape on multiple occasions, so his quotes are likely reliable). Not a huge amount to go on either way on the exact nature of their relationship.

But Dumbledore himself compares it to Harry and Malfoy, and whilst he wouldn't have witnessed every incident he is probably the most reliable statement.

So yeah, it reads to me very much as a rivalry, and that Snape had his gang too, and they all tried to get each other. We only ever see things from Snape's perspective, but there are plenty of hints that it was much more equal than four picking on one all the time (and even in the worst memory, it's predominately James with help from Sirius, with Remus looking uncomfortable and Peter looking on laughing - not four casting at one).

They read like they were all a bunch of pathetic teenage boys behaving like dicks, but James grew out of it (there's a scene I can't find but I'm sure was real where Harry finds James' old detention slips, and none date after 5th year), whereas Snape and his gang became death eaters.
