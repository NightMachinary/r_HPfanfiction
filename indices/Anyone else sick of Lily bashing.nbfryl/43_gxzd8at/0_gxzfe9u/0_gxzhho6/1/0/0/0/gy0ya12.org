You don't have to agree about Dumbledore, but I don't think he would have lied. He just wouldn't have omitted it, like he did with a lot else.

His conversation with Lily certainly suggests he was there:

  ”We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"

  Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.

  ”That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's all--"

  ”It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny--"

This heavily implies to me he was at least as involved in that incident as you claim Lupin to be - and at least Lupin seemed uncomfortable where Snape is outright defending it.

The way I see it, if you cherry picked incidents from Harry's perspective of his and Malfoy's relationship, like when he stamps on Harry's face, calls him names, or flashes the Potter Stinks badges at him, you could make him look as much of a bully to Harry as James to Snape.

The reason we see theirs as a rivalry is because we see a lot more than just a few of their ‘worst memories'. We see that each ‘gave as good as they got', and they were very much equals despite Malfoy being a spoiled pureblood and Harry a neglected half blood. To me, Dumbledore's comparison is very fitting alongside the only comments we get from the other side implies a very different sort of relationship.
