I don't consider Dumbledore's statement to be reliable. He wouldn't say to Harry that his dad was a bully. Albus knew that this will have a huge negative impact on Harry. When Harry saw the lake incident, it had a huge toll on him, and he was 15 at that time

  Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly-all turned out to be Death Eaters.‚Äù

Snape didn't take part in whatever the gang did to other students. We never see Lily accusing Snape of attacking, harassing anyone else. When Lily asks James why he hates Snape so much, he could have just said that he was a bigot, supremacist or anything like that, but instead he says he hates him because he exists.

All the other statements are made by Lupin, who is a spineless coward, who just stands there doing nothing, even after his friends are assaulting a classmate. He is obviously biased.

The only objective view of their feud we see is that James and Sirius gang up on Snape, because they are bored. Also James bullied others too, hexing people in the hallways. Between James and Snape, only James has been known to hex and bully other students, so I consider James and Snape to have a bully- victim relationship.

  but James grew out of it (there's a scene I can't find but I'm sure was real where Harry finds James' old detention slips, and none date after 5th year), whereas Snape and his gang became death eaters.

Sure, I never said that Snape is not an asshole. I don't care about either of them, but James was indeed a bully to Snape imo
