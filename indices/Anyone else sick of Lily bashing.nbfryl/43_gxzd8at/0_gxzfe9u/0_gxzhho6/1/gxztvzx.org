  there are plenty of references to Snape and the Slytherins being as quick to have magical standoffs with the Gryffindors as the other way round.

Can u give any evidence of that from canon? Because the only thing I remember is that Remus saying Snape gave as good as he got, meaning Snape retaliated against what the marauders did.

Remus and Sirius also never mentioned Snape instigating fights against them when Harry confronts them about the lake incident.
