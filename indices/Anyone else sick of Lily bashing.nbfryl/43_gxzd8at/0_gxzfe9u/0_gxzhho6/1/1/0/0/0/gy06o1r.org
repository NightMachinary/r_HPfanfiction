Nah, I don't think the other marauders would have outed Remus. They would also get outed as illegal animagi, which is an Azkaban worthy punishment.

If the marauders had retaliated in some other way, Remus should face it, have a re-think about his friendship with them, especially after the werewolf prank Sirius played, iirc in the same year. Just as Snape should have done when Lily questions him if he would drop his fascination with the Dark Arts and Death eaters
