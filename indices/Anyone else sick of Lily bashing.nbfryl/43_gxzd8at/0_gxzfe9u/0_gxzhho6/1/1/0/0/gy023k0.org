  Besides there is a difference between Lupin and Snape. Lupin, during the lake incident, was a prefect. He could have given them detentions, taken out points.

Lupin in this case is in a very difficult position. If his secret got out, he'd be expelled. It is in his best interest to appease the other Marauders and letting them get away with stuff, because if he were to stand up against them, they might retaliate in a bad way.
