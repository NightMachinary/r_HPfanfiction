Well, if we're comparing the downplaying then Remus Lupin is master of it.

He dismissed Snape's bullying as "schoolboy grudge" and Snape's Worst Memory as "James got a bit carried away" and he was an adult when he said this. He also refers to their moonlight sneaking out as "best of times" when they risked many lives doing so. Remus was no helpless bystander, he often took part in their mischief. He was also a Prefect.

  he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.

Anyway, OP said there were magical standoffs between Snape's group vs James Potter's, that's not mentioned anywhere in the books.
