Huh? Where are those plenty of references? There's only one incident mentioned about something Snape's group of friends "tried" to do, in which Snape was not even involved. I mean, the Marauders refuse to call him by his given name for heaven's sake (emotional harrassment). If that isn't bullying then I don't know what is. They ridiculed his appearance & text clearly used predator vs prey metaphor to Sirius vs Snape. It's not rivalry, at least not in the books.
