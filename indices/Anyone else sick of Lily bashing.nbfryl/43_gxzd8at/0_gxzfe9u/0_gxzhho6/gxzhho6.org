Exactly this. And to be honest, whilst James definitely read as a bully in general, I'm not convinced you can call his relationship with Snape that of bully and victim - there are plenty of references to Snape and the Slytherins being as quick to have magical standoffs with the Gryffindors as the other way round. It reads much more like gang warfare - with the moment at the lake being one where Snape was caught without backup. We also only ever see Snape's side of the story - there are only references to the Marauders' side.

I say this as someone who was bullied badly growing up, so I'm not in any way tolerant of bullying or making excuses, it just doesn't read that way for me.
