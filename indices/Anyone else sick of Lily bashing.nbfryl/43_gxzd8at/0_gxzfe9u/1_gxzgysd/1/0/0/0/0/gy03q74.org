That's why I said she played "hard to get". She liked "bully James" besides his flaws and at some point gave up and succumbed to the popular guy flirting with her. There's the other possibility that James reformed to try to go out with her. Though its implied he was simply hiding his bully tendencies from Lily since Sirius said that he didn't fight with Snape in front of her but did behind her back.

Also I think the conjucture of the war with James being on the side of half-bloods like Lily; both being head of their houses, put them closer. In a life and death situation like the wizard war, some minor flaws can be overlooked.

That's why Lily (and James) get so much criticism. Considering the canon information provided by the author, the relationship is questionable and need a lot of mental stretch to make it make sense in a way that they are likeable together.

At least James was better than Snape as he fought in the "right side" and didn't call her slurs.
