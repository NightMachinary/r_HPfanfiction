She didn't have a proper relationship but JK said that Lily already had feeling for James, so when she was "defending" Snape, she was actually flirting with James while playing "hard to get".

Lily did very right in ending the relationship with Snape, I can't see why would anyone defend Snape's racism. I think the whole marauders generation was very messy.
