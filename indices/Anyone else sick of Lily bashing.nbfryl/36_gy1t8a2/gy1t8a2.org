I'm sick of Lily Bashing when it comes to her not fucking loving Snape

I want to see Lily bashed as a bad mother (while not bashing James), I want to see Lily Bashed as a someone who didn't seek out a career worth her supposed once in a generation mind, I want see Lily bashed as someone who didn't want to run when her husband feared for his sons life, I want to see Lily Bashed as someone who wanted to run while her husband wanted to stand and fight against the genocide of her people.

But I literally hate Snape in all forms and am Happy she chose a silly, funny, kind man who looked beyond blood purity, beyond fear of dark creatures, beyond power and sought to be a good man with good friends for a good cause
