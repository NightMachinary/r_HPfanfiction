That's the one where hermione is friends with regulus? Of I remember, I think lily being a bitch is actually girly good character building, and their relationship does end up healing and lily growing into a better person. It used it's version of lily;s desire to be unique and special to somewhat justify her rift with petunia, and the presence of hermione to redeem petunia and heal that rift some. So a bit of a lily bash, but not a blind hatred and not without an interesting reason.
