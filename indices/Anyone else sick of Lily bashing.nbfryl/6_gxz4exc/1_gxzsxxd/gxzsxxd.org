Was it the James/Hermione one, with Hermione being a 40+ years old time traveller reborn as Lily's younger sister?

This story gets(?)/got recommended so often on here, and I just got around to reading it a few weeks ago - Lily started normal enough and then got weirder and worse with every chapter.

I didn't finish it, but it's also the only example I ever ran across.
