  Not to mention confounding McLaggen during quidditch tryouts which seems like it could be dangerous (yes, let's reduce someone's mental faculties while they're flying quite a ways up in the air) on top of obviously being ethically questionable.

This most likely may only be a movie thing, but Hermione's Confounding Charm here seemed very controlled and short during the tryout. She basically 'told' him to go one side instead of the other so he wouldn't block all of the Quaffles and so Ron could keep being the Keeper (pun intended). This of course doesn't excuse it, but it does appear to be less dangerous than simply weakening the mental faculties of someone for a long time while in the air.
