I mean, in canon she's actually kinda terrifying? Like, she keeps Rita Skeeter in a jar. And the whole thing with Umbridge in the woods at least starts as her idea. In sixth year she actually attacks Ron in a fit of jealous anger (the birds, anyone?). Not to mention confounding McLaggen during quidditch tryouts which seems like it could be dangerous (yes, let's reduce someone's mental faculties while they're flying quite a ways up in the air) on top of obviously being ethically questionable. The thing is that Hermione never really faces consequences for any of this in canon, so why should she in fanon?
