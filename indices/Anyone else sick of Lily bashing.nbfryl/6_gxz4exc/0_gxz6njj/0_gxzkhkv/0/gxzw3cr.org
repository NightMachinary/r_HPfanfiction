Hey now, it's not my fault authors can't write a Hermione who doesn't turn into a Mary Sue. It's like because she's so smart, she can't make mistakes. Headmaster Dumbledore actually addressed the issue best, when he said that because he's so smart, his mistakes tend to be far worse than other peoples.

So where's the righteous Hermione fic where she goes back in time to prevent the war, and somehow is the cause of it (because we know Time is linear, and it it already happened you can't make it unhappen) and she thought she knew "better". There are so many unexplored areas, but ultimately every single Hermione fic I've read has been some form of Hermione saves everyone because she is so smartÂ®, or Hermione/her parents notice signs of abuse and save Harry. Or Hermione has a perfect plan and executes it flawlessly and everything is perfect. Ugh!
