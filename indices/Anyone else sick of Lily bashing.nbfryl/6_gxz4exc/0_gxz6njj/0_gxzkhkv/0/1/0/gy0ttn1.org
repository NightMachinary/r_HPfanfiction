While I think there are some great Hermione fics I think that she's the most likely to be "Mary-Sued". In so many fics she can just do everything.

In some of them, despite the character's flawlessness, I actually like it a lot. Sometimes she's basically perfect, but not quit Mary Sue too...

Overall, I think there's a lot of Hermione fics that ignore a lot of her flaws. While that's the case for most fics - most other characters have almost as many bad or realistic portrayals as they have (almost) perfect portrayals. Hermione is the one where I have the most hard time, to find a not perfect version. It makes writing her kind of difficult for me. Cause every time I write her a bit ruder or overly nosy I feel a bit nervous about reader reaction.
