  Hey now, it's not my fault authors can't write a Hermione who doesn't turn into a Mary Sue.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of stories with Hermione featured in them, and tens of thousands where she's the main character. She is not a Mary Sue in all of them. You're negatively generalizing a character you don't like because you don't like them.

Just another reminder that it's not bashing that this sub hates, it's bashing of the characters they like.
