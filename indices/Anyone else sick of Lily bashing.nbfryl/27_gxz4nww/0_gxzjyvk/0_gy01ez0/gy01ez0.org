I actually read a lot of Snape-centric fics. It's not nearly as common as you make it out to be. I've seen it a couple of times, but basically never. I think every single fic I did see it in was SSHG, so it might be a thing mostly tied to that ship (I avoid most fics with that ship as a side effect of avoiding teacher/student fics).
