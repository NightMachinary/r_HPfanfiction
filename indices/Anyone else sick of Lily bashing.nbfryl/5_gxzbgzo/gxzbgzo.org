part of me wonders if it's a movies only fan's fanfic issue but also the analogy is perfect. I've been on the receiving end of being called the n-word by a close friends sister who i also, up until that point, thought i was close with as well and there's just no....coming back from that. Until you've been the person on the receiving end of a slur especially from someone you're close with.....that's a different kind of pain and hurt.
