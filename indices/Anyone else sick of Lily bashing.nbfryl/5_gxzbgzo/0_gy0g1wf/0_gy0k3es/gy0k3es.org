this! i don't care how angry a person gets calling someone a slur should never be a result of "how angry" they were. Exactly! his true colors were shown and everything he did in the series because of that should have never been turned into "because he TRULY loved her" but because "he spent the rest of his life making up for the horrible thing he said to his friend whether she was alive or not" like....ugh ok lemme stop lolol
