The best... THE BEST(!!) argument I ever heard was that Snape only used the slur ONCE (not once against Lily, but once overall) in a spur of the moment because she didn't protect him against James and seems to be on his side.

Of course, Lily says that he uses it against every muggleborn apart from her all the time. BUT EVIL LILY WAS LYING!

That was legit the argument. Because we never see Snape use the word again during the flashback (not before or after) he clearly didn't use it. And if Lily says she did, she was a stupid manipulative bad friend who had the hots for James from the start and was simply lying. Or others were lying to her. Maybe James lied to her, and she believed it to impress him!
