Yes, you just take a deep look in the mirror and admit to yourself that if it crossed your mind to call someone a slur when you're angry, then you think of that slur in your life. You believe it to some extent. I think some people also have trouble recognising this trait in themselves, so for them it makes sense that it "slipped". It's like the people who say racist stuff but don't like to get called out because how can they be racist? They even have black friends!

As for Snape, I thought it was crystal clear that his love was selfish. He didn't try to fix everything for her, he did it to ease his guilt. Even before that, all his actions showed that his love for Lily was always in the shadow of some sort of hatred. That "always" scene that makes everyone fall in love with him actually makes me deapise him even more. After all, Snape never grew to like Harry, he still projected his hatred for James on him, and it still was all about Lily and the guilt he felt.
