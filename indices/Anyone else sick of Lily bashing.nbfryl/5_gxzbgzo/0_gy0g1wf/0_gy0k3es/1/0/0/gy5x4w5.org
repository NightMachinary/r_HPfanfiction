I think many people sympathise with his sad background life. Many don't believe it justifies his actions, but understand where he comes from and believe he redeemed himself later in life, that Snape became a better person and made a huge sacrifice.

I personally don't see his huge sacrifice as a noble thing. Brave and well performed, yes, but what did he have to lose? His life was miserable. In that sense, Ron had a lot more to lose when he ran away with Harry to hunt horcruxes, for example. Having Harry around both disgusted Snape because of James and gave him a sense of purpose because he longed to ease his guilt. Snape didn't go out of his way to do all that. He helped it happen, he had nothing else to live for, which was his fault alone, and most if not all of his good deeds were under Dumbledore's command, not out of the goodness of his heart.

I don't see him switching sides for anything other than a selfish reason. Some people believe it was more than that, but I honestly only see a self-centered man. Even when he's sacrificing for others, there is a selfish reason behind it.
