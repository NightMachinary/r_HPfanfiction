Partially disagree -- I highly doubt Snape ever thought of her as a Mudblood. But yeah, the fact that it was even in his vocabulary in the first place is a huge problem and I don't fault Lily at all for cutting him off. Even if he never thought of Lily specifically that way, he has no right to count her as a weird exception.
