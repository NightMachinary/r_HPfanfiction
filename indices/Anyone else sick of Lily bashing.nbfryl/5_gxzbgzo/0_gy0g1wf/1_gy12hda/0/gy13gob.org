That's the problem. He does have prejudice, but chooses to ignore Lily is a Muggle-born because of a personal preference. It doesn't matter if he thinks she's "one of the good ones" or if he's in denial. You can't make an exception. This is why I believe the word would cross his mind even if he disassociated her from being a "mudblood". At the end of the day she is a Muggle-born and he knows it. From Lily's perspective, it's disrespectful to herself to keep him around. I think she just wasn't ready to admit their friendship was over.
