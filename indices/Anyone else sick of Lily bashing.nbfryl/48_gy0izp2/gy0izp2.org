I've rarely seen Lily properly bashed like that. I have seen pro-Snape stories that characterize her as overreacting to the "mudblood" incident because they missed the whole context around it, or else try to balance it out by pointing out how she was (apparently) holding herself back from laughing at Snape. Neither of which are really fair to Lily.

I would allow a bit of wiggle room, though, to say she should have given him an ultimatum: "Ditch your racist friends, or I'm through with you." Especially since she doesn't seem to have done so up to that point. Snape of course would not do it (by that point, it wouldn't surprise me if it would be hazardous to his health), and things proceed the same from there.

Even so, there's a reason why I don't buy any Lily/Snape relationship (even a Platonic one) unless it diverges before that point.
