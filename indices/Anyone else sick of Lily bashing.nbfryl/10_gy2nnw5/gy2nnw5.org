I'm tired of James and the Marauders bashing. It's always ‘Bully' James and ‘Bully' Marauders who treat poor Snape like shit, and they're so horrible. Meanwhile Snape fans ignore what was happening during that time period.

According to the Harry Potter Fandom wiki, the first wizarding war officially started 1970, though it had foundations in the 1940s. Meaning James would have been 10yrs old at that time as he was born in 1960. While they might have been children, by the time they started Hogwarts in 1971, They would have seen, heard of and probably understood some of the growing anti-muggleborn and muggle hate that was happening at the time. Especially Sirius.

in the years before, and during hogwarts, they would have experienced loss as people and friends they knew did not return to school after holidays. They would see black letters arriving daily, attended funerals of family members and cousins and friends who died at the hands of the Death Eaters. And with Sirius being a Black and living with a family that supported everything that was happening during the war, they would have had a very good idea of who in the school might support Voldemort and cheer on each death.

And here's Snape, a dark, brooding and spiteful kid, jealous of James and Sirius. They see this dark halfbood making cozy and friendly with several of the children of Voldemort's supporters; and who was learning and creating dark magic, of course they would've hated Snape. And while James might have been interested in Lily, I have no doubt he also wanted to protect her from the people who wanted her dead.

A lot of the James and Sirius haters ignore everything that was happening during their school years. They were experiencing a war outside of the school and they could see the enemies that were in the school. They fought a war while in school, against the children of death eaters, and even Sirius says that their enemies gave as good as they got.

James may have started arrogant, but he became a better man by the end, while Snape was always a POS and only got worse, and even after Lily dies due to his actions, he remains a horrible, spiteful man.

Sorry for the soapbox, but I've been seeing too many James bashing ficus lately.
