Currently reading a fic where Lily was a dark ritualist, with the reason Voldemord went crazy that she made a ritual backfire on him. Bellatrix Lestrange begged to reverse that but she laughed in her face.

That is to say, Lily Potter n√©e Evans is pretty much a blank canvas for fanfic writers because she is mostly talked about and has only a few scenes where she actually is directly involved in the books (and even then... As a ghost/apparition?).

So wherever Lily forgives Snape, if he never joints the Death Eaters, or if she is they go and start an even darker counter revolution because he's a vampire and she's discusted by a society that hates him for it... That is something for the author to work out. As long as it's believable, it can and will be a very fun AU.

Because we don't get a well defined character for Lily, we don't know what would be OOC.
