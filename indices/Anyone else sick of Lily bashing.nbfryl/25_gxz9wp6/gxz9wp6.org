You're absolutely right, people need to stop with this horseshit. Snape's sad backstory scene shouldn't be an excuse to elevate him to hero status because he was friends with Harry's mum and then ruined that by becoming a wizard nazi. That scene showed that James was a bullying cunt when he was young and Snape was a racist cunt when he was young, it was /not/ showing that Lily was a cunt for being furious with both of them.

We know both boys were supposed to have gotten better with age but I'm not impressed with either of them. James needed to be forced to stop bullying by Lily and he only did it because he fancied her, suggesting that if he didn't fancy her he might not have improved as a person at all. Snape needed to have his crush murdered before he noticed that Voldemort was unspeakably cruel??? He should have known better without Lily needing to die and James should have known better without Lily needing to represent a reward for good behaviour.

We don't know much about Lily at all- much due to author's absolute obsession with making male characters more fleshed out than female ones- but from what we have seen, she extended friendship to both boys when they were good people and not when they were bad. She was friends with Snape when he was a harmless kid and she was friends with James after he stopped causing harm. That is not a bad trait. In fact, I do this and so does everyone else. If someone is a dickhead you don't stay or become friends with them, you should exercise your right to surround yourself with good people. James without bullying leaves you with a guy fighting for equality, snape without his dark mark was a goth kid she spent her childhood with. Both her choices to move on from snape and with james were fine and not character flaws.

I can dislike her husband and ex-friend without blaming her for their flaws, and I think everyone else should be able to do this too.

Some of you think blaming women for men's actions is fine and have never been disgusted by a loved one's discrimination and it shows. James' and Snape's bad behaviour were their own faults. Let your opinion of Lily be based on her characterisation and choices, not these idiot men.
