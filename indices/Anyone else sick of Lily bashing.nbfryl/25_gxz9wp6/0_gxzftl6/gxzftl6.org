I don't remember reading anywhere that James only grew up because of Lily.

Unless I'm mistaken, his parents died around the time he is said to have grown up. Maybe there is a connection?

Even if it was because of Lily, there's nothing really wrong with that as long as he isn't pretending. Which we're led to believe he wasn't.
