The only thing that made me sympathise with Snape in this scene was knowing that Lily had to stop herself from smiling when James and Sirius were pulling him upside down (also, that's sexual harassment, he was literally in his pants), which probably made him angry at her, especifically.

Let's say that it didn't "slip", because that's prejudiced no questions asked. Instead, he went for the word that would hurt her the most on purpose. Now, that's a matter o principles. I personally don't think you can use that on someone, even though they think it's funny that you're being sexually harassed. I honestly have said all sorts of mean things in similar situations in my life, but I never threw words like the N word, faggot, whale or anything like this. I think that when you attack someone for who they are, you are just as rotten of a person as the ones who harassed you, but that's my take on it.

However, even if you think it justifies as a revenge, you still have to admit she had the right to cut ties. Lily had been the bigger person and kept him around when he was becoming a supremacist. She could have gotten revenge for that, but chose to have faith in their friendship. She made a huge mistake by thinking that was amusing, and for that I do think she's a bitch, but you have two options: 1) you are the bigger person and talk about it / forgive, or 2) you get revenge.

At the heat of the moment, he chose revenge, using something he knew would hurt her a lot. I have to stop my train of thoughts here to point out that they were at war - Muggle-borns were probably being murdered left and right and some of the other students in allegedly one of the safest places in the world literally wanted her dead. Snape calling her a mudblood back then has way more impact than Draco calling Hermione a mudblood in CoS. This is something fans often miss and I think it's because most of us have never experienced war or persecution.

Back to my thinking, if you chose revenge, don't expect things will be fine - you chose to make them worse. Am I here saying I would never do the same? Well, I wouldn't use this type of slur, but I'm vengeful as fuck, so I don't judge the idea of wanting revenge. However, Snape really went there when he already was halfway through and his other friends had been there for a while. Of course she had every right to end their friendship. Lily did something horrible, but he wasn't any better.
