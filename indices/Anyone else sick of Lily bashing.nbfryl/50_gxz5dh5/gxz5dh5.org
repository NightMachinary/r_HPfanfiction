The way I interpret it is that the slur was meant to drive her away, since Snape realized he couldn't have Lily. And while I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant experience for her, I think them drifting apart was a mutual effort. Also teenagers do stupid things. I don't see that repeated pattern of abuse that gets so often theorized about in the fandom, and we know next to nothing about the Marauder era.

For example

#+begin_quote
  Your childhood bestie is white guy who starts hanging out with the skinhead racist dudes. You hear that he's been calling the other POC racial slurs.

This is just fanfiction, and the comparison doesn't work well because Snape is a half-blood.

People are all to ready to throw around the nazi comparison when the information is almost nonexistant. History is never black and white, especially in children's books that leave the subject wide open to speculation. We only know a single viewpoint in the second war, and we have to imagine the rest from there.
