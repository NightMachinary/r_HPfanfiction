Quoting Rowling:

  Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, 'I want to recreate Nazi Germany', in the---in the wizarding world. Because---although there are---quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out.

That's why the nazi comparison falls apart. Because it's just one influence among many. But really I don't want to waste more words on this, it's also the least interesting aspect of HP politics.
