I agree that people shouldn't answer forever for their childhood and teen years mistakes. A lot of teenagers act like idots because they are learning about the world around growing out about what the parents taught while still making mistakes. James particularly was extremely spoiled but he somewhat grew out of it when he lost his parents and in the war.

James-Lily gets so bashing though, because he bullied her ex best friend and probably other people. James is not just a random jock that was randomly mean but Lily saw him acting this way. I noticed that he fact that they were so popular and wanted is also not relatable to a lot of people despite having nothing inherently wrong with it.

Also there's the info that Lily was attracted to James even in Snape worst memories and didn't really hate him, added to the fact that she dated him while still in Hogwarts - so it's not like there was a reencounter or great timeskip, plus Sirius said that James and Snape still hexed each other behind Lily's back, pointing that James wasn't completely honest with her or that Lily closed her eyes for his bully and show off tendencies. By conjecture it's a very complicated scenario that rubs a lot of people in the wrong way.

Also the fact that they were surrounded by worst people - Dusdleys and young Snape- makes them coming out as the better people.
