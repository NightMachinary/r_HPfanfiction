When I was 17 my best friend started dating my ex, whom I had broken up with for being an idiot. She saw how much of an idiot he was to me, but he was also very different with her. They actually got married and he is an awesome husband to her, it was something about the two of us together that didn't work. Sometimes, how a relationship works (friends or romantic) does not imply much about each character. I sure as hell hated the dude after we broke up, he called me fat (I was an athlete and certainly not fat) , unattractive, stupid and several other things that would define him as a toxic a-hole. But now he is different, specially to my friend, and both her an I saw that. They have the best marriage out of all my friends and I would certainly never could get in between them because of who he was to me. He changed, he deserves happiness too.

But I certainly agree with you disagreeing if you find it weird.. I think is part of how forgiving we are and how much we are willing to deal with stuff. If lily marrying James is icky to you, that is OK. We all have different histories and personalities and it's OK.
