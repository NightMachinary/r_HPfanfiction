You pretty much summed it up perfectly.

All people are different.

Someone else in your position could have never forget that friend, considering him a huge asshole and thinking the worst of your ex for getting with him. You didnt and managed to see he changed and become deserving of her love. But other people would probably only see and remember the bad stuff.
