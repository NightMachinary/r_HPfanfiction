I don't think you marry someone because of who they have been, but for who they are now. Past mistakes are not relevant as long as the spouse has moved on and will probably not repeat those mistakes. By the time James and Lily were 17/18 (when they started dating) James had calmed down and grown up. This was also the time Lily became friendly with him and got to know him. The arrogant and privileged kid that he was probably made him a bully to Snape (I don't remember any Canon instances right now that show him bullying anyone else like he did Snape) and it was wrong. Bulling is always wrong. But he changed. He grew up and decided to fight for the order, against blood prejudice. By they time they got married, James was (by all accounts, at least to my understanding) a good guy. He made mistakes, but humans always do, and he moved on and matured.

Snape, on the other hand didn't grow up. By the time he was in his thirties, he was a bully that used his position of authority to go unpanished. He called Harry names and insulted him, an 11-year-old kid who was just starting school (*fame isn't everything" implies he is coasting on his fame and "did not open a book" implies he is lazy) and attacked Hermione for being an insufferable know-it-all and says he "sees no difference" when her frontal teeth grow, implying she has very large frontal teeth. As a girl, specially a teenage girl (even a nerdy one, which I was) it hurts. That is not a man who changed, grew up or moved pass his bitterness. His choices are very different than James, even when he has a lot more time. Yes, he probably had an awful childhood, but that cannot excuse him forever. He dedicated his life to save Harry because he feels guilty of leading Voldemort towards Lily, but he didn't change himself. That is on adult Snape. I'm not saying he was evil or all bad, because humans are nuanced. But what he showed the world, was very deeply flawed.

My point is, friendships and people evolve. I think Lily stuck it out for as long as she could, but what happened after OWLs was her breaking point. That was her choice and what was right for her. Snape had a difficult beggining and was in between a rock and a hard place most of his life, but he also chose his bitter persona. Some excuse it because he had to keep his position as a spy, but he could have said the only way for Dumbledore to allow him to stay at hogwarts was to clean up his act. He simply didn't want to. He might have been a great head of house to his slytherins though, but we do not know that.

As for James, we all have regrets about our childhood and adolescence, we simply have to move on and no repeat them. I certainly wouldn't want to be single forever because no possible spouse would want me because I was a brat as a child. If I'm not a brat anymore, don't I deserve love anyways?
