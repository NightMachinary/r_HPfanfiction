The beauty of fanfiction is that you can cherry pick certainly parts of canon, emphasize others, and completely disregard the rest.

I'm guessing bashers look at it something like this:

Snape's mother 'white' comes from a powerful, rich family. His 'black' father is poor and abusive. He grows up in a predominantly black neighborhood where he is othered and bullied by the other kids.

In Hogwarts he gets sorted in the white supremacist house. He's likely bullied for his 'black' father by the students in his house. He is also bullied by the rich, white kids outside of his house. Ie. James and Sirius.

Somewhere along the way he starts hiding his 'black heritage and starts internalizing the racism. Sometimes conforming is the only safe thing to do.

He calls his first friend a racial slur. She abandons him and then very quickly marries the rich, white kid that bullied him for years.

... So if you reinterpret and look at the book in that way then I can see where the bashing comes from.

Is there more nuance to it? Yes. But there's also more nuance then Snape being obsessed with Lily. OP is simplifing and ignoring certain parts too.

Personally, I find the Lily/Severus/Maurauders dynamic fascinating.

Lily was completely right and justified in cutting out a toxic person from her life. Especially one who had fallen in with violent extremists. On the other hand, the fact that she then fell for James Potter - the rich, 'white' kid who spent most of his years bullying her biracial friend and constantly harassing her. Well...
