Completely agree! We also rarely hear anything about the Marauders-Lily-Snape dynamic from anyone not involved, and then obviously nothing from James and Lily at all, so a lot is conjecture and supposition and one-sided. It makes it really fascinating, and that's probably why it's my favourite area of fanfiction because there is so much room to explore and you can change almost everything whilst still interpreting canon.
