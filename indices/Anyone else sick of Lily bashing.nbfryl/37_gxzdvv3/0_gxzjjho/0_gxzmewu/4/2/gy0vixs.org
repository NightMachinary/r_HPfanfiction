That's a real stretch. I get why people are rubbed the wrong way by Lily marrying James, especially since we don't get to see the progression from James being a grade-A asshole and Lily being disgusted by him to them falling in love.

But what about that says Lily chose what was easy? However it happened, she ended up falling for James and they were clearly very happy together until they died. By saying Lily "chose what was easy", are you implying that she should have chosen Snape instead? What was the other choice?
