I do understand where you're coming from. I think it's a flaw in the books how we're basically told James is a good guy but we're /shown/ the complete opposite. I don't like his character, but I don't for a moment believe that Lily went for him as a safe option. From the little we know about Lily, she seems to be the quintessential Gryffindor who acts based on what feels right to her, and she certainly wouldn't enter into a marriage for convenience. However it happened, I firmly believe she grew to love James for who he was, not for what he could provide.
