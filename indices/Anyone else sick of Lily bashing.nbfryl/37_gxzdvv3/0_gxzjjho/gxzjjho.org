Fair analogy, but I still can't see any sort of logical reason for Lily bashing in this scenario. Just because Snape himself was a halfblood and came from an abusive household doesn't excuse his actions, especially considering that halfbloods are not discriminated against to nearly the same degree as muggleborns. She gave him every chance and stuck by him for years, and most would have cut him off sooner. What exactly do Lily bashers want from her?
