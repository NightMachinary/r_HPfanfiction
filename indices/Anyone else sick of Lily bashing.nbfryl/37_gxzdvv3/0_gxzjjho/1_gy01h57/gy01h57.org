I think people that dislike Lily are rubbed in the wrong way that she married the bully of her ex best friend. Which I particularly find weird but it seems everyone from the marauders era were complicated people. So, considering the fact that she married James among all people, then there's a lot of different interpretations: Some people treat her as a saint that can do no wrong and saved James (which is not much different than what Snape fans wanted Lily's role to be for Snape instead) while other people may treat her as a star chaser or an opportunistic woman. I'm not a great fan of Lily and James together themselves, but people tend to see those characters in black and white lenses: Harry parents they can do no wrong and can't get any criticism; or they were extremely obnoxious people with few rendeeming qualities.

Now, about Snape. Regardless of James flaws, Potter was undoubtedly the best option for romance, and Lily was completely right with moving on from a toxic relationship and not entertering in an abusive relationship with Snape, since by being with Snape she would put her mental and physical health at risk, not to mention that she would say "stfu" to all other half-blood people.
