Sometimes things are so ridiculous they make you laugh. I remember a dramione fanfic that he says something like "hi, dar-" and stops talking, then Hermione gets all offended, like "what were you going to call me!? Darlene? Who is Darlene!?" The fic was bad, but that was when I gave up reading it. Too much uncalled drama.
