tbh I have not seen any Lily bashing, so I'm not sure what you're talking about here? It's far, far less prevalent than say, James bashing. The only stories I can think of that have Lily bashing are WBWL stories which have Harry left with the Dursleys despite James and Lily being alive, which inherently have her do something pretty awful as part of the premise, and even then she is generally the Potter portrayed the most sympathetically and the most likely to have been mentally altered somehow.
