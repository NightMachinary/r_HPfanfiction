Turns out Fleur also really enjoys chess.

so she and ron had an amazing night where they played chess and talked and ron opened up about his inner insecurities and fleur opens up about her own which are quite similar to harry's. and then for the next week everyone keeps talking about him and fleur and how he scored with her.

and ron completely hates it.
