Want to really open a box of trouble?

After the ball Fleur takes Ron back to her carriage to give him a private good night. All of Ron's underlying envy concerning Harry's perceived wealth and fame is flipped on its head when people start talking about how Ron is the first guy in their year to score and he did it with the hottest girl in the castle no less. What actually happened in the carriage was probably /far/ less than what the other students have imagined (and probably very embarrassing for Ron) but that's not going to get in the way of him basking in his new reputation. Or 'Ron becomes an insufferable prick'.
