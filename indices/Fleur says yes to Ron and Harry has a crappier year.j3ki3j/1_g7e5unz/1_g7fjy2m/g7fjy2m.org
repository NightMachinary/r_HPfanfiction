  Or 'Ron becomes an insufferable prick'.

Methinks fanon is bleeding in.

Ron did have elements for bragging (after the second task for instance that lasted until early March or so; see chapter 27 of book 4 for proof) but I don't think it'd go /that/ far. I don't think Fleur would tolerate rumours like that going around and that would put an end to any future relationship between the two, platonic /or/ romantic.
