Perhaps. But then, I find it questionable what sort of harm Grindelwald would be prepared to accept in order to achieve this "Greater Good" and also what his conception of the "Greater Good" is to begin with. Those are some of the difficulties with consequentialism - when you weigh the alternatives and try to determine what produces the greatest net good, it is a) highly dependent on your value judgements and characterizations and b) can justify the most abhorrent conduct based on extremely small net good. In other words, there is no attempt at objectivity and no conduct that is off limits. Personally, I'm not a fan of such moral theories.
