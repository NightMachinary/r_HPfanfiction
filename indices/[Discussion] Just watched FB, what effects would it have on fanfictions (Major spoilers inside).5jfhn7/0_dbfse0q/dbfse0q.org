The trunk issue is one that people seem to have been massively unobservant about when they were watching. It's not that the trunk itself is that big. Rather the trunk contains a number of enclosures (each one maybe 10m x 10m maximum) separated by some kind of magical canvas. That magical canvas is 2 dimensional when you interact with it, acting like any other material, except when you close it up around you then it immerses you into a magical environment that you can move around in. So the size of the trunk is a combination of the large trunk space and the absolutely massive but potentially illusory canvas space.

Regarding obscurials, I'm not sure that there's much place to take them that's interesting. They essentially have one power and that's destruction. They also die before the age of 10, with Credence being the notable exception. And for all their supposed power, note that Grindelwald never seemed to be afraid of Credence.

I think the reparo charms only appear overpowered to people who have had a small-minded approach to HP magic - people who have sought to limit it rather than embrace it. In truth within the 7 original books we have had very little interaction with what qualified adult wizards are capable of, but there are certainly allusions to magic of much greater scale than you see everyday at Hogwarts and in the home.

And no, no mention of magical cores. Credence was said to be powerful, which plenty of wizards have been described as over the series - Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, Barty Crouch Sr, Bellatrix, Harry himself. The fact that some wizards are more powerful than others has never been in dispute. What the fandom has discussed in depth rather is a) what does it mean to say a wizard is powerful and b) what factors determine a wizard's power. Specifically with respect to (b), the discussion has been oriented around the nature vs nurture debate and the extent to which it can change over time.

I don't think Credence really adds much to the debate, except that perhaps he is a further indication that enduring adversity is a factor which can lead to one becoming magically powerful.
