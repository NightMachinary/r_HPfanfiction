Yeah, but to be fair, it wasn't hugely clear how the trunk worked when I saw it the first time around as you only see the canvas structure properly in a few very quick shots of the erumpet and in the obscurious scene, otherwise they seemed to be able to morph between the 'spaces' of the trunk with just a camera pan... The idea seems to be based on that of using painted backdrops to dioramas to make them seem bigger, which is a great source to draw from, but as it's based on an illusion and there were a whole load of camera tricks added, it's unsurprising there is confusion.

Magical canvas like you say and like the one in the old Discworld game where with the right magical paint you can enter the painted scenery or recursive enlargement charms would be my guess. Not certain how it works with Frank though, as his enclosure didn't look to have a ceiling, so he's still disappearing off somewhere
