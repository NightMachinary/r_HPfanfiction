It's largely the same as the other movies - I liked the sense of speed to the spells, I like the heavy use of non-verbal magic and blocking techniques, I like the use of apparition to manoeuvre as standard, but I dislike the lack of variety in terms of spell choice and tactics. On balance I am happy.
