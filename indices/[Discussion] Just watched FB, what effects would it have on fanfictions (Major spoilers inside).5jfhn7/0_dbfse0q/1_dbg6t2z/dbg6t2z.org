  Regarding obscurials, I'm not sure that there's much place to take them that's interesting. They essentially have one power and that's destruction. They also die before the age of 10, with Credence being the notable exception. And for all their supposed power, note that Grindelwald never seemed to be afraid of Credence.

Given how many abused!Harry fics are out there, it's only logical for authors to assign Obscurial powers to Harry next.
