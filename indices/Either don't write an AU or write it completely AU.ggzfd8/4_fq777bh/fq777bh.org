I've read fics where Harry became a god before Hogwarts, then went to the school and literally destroyed the academic records for everything he did, flawlessly plowed through the TWT, then failed to use his superpower of sensing magic to prevent cedric's death and was "somehow" stunned from behind. And used for the ritual. By this point he'd perfected wandless magic and even did a token effort, but the ropes were "somehow" immune to fire and physical force. And instead of annihilating Voldemort in the duel he so graciously grants, he is groggy from the stunning charm, which was a super special version?

I've read fics where Harry routinely tortures people to practise dark magic, and then does the troll scene to save Hermione, conveniently forgetting all the evil magic he just learned to defend himself and using the levitation charm.

Never underestimate writers' ability to walk the rails of canon to the bitter end.
