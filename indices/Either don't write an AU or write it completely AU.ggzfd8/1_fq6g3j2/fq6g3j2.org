After whatever change makes things AU in the first place, any further changes should follow naturally. If Harry and Hermione are friends from day one, that doesn't guarantee that something won't put her in the troll's path, but it's certainly possible that Ron's comments wouldn't have hit her as hard if she /did/ have a friend. On the other hand, maybe he'd say something else hurtful instead (like claiming that Harry's just putting up with her for homework help, or that she's just after his fame). As long as the series of events makes sense for the characters and circumstances shown without needing any contrivances or deus-ex-machina, it's fine.
