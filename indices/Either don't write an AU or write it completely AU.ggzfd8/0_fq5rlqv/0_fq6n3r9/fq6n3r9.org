After suffering through thousands of awful canon rehashes, I've come to an opinion that it's /always/ better to be 'too AU' rather than 'not AU enough'. Excessive canon purism and such only lead to boredom and disappointment; excessive AUs might weird you out and you can /maybe/ accuse them of false advertisement if you squint your eyes, but it takes only a moment of your time to change your state of mind from 'enjoying fanfiction' to 'enjoying original fiction' and just continue reading without relying on assumptions.
