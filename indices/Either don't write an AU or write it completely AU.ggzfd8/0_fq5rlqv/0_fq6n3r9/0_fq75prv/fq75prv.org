I think there's a space for fics that are just a little AU but have decent enough writing that they summarise similar scenes well, while developing interactions and events that differ. The consequence being a butterfly effect where you started out with characters fitting with canon, but at some point (not forced, just general musing) that the reader realises that the characters have diverged from canon by an amount justified by events and their interaction with them.

I absolutely love this style of fic, though it is difficult to find it done well.
