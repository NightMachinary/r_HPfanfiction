Here's a random post from a random reader that likes to read trash stuff for that one good paragraph.

Sometimes reusing events in an AU can be quite good as long as it has a point, or the author is trying to use it to point to something, even if they kinda fail, like a Slytherin Harry going to his dorm in the dungeons with some friends on Y1 Halloween and finding the troll and some slytherin children die, the author probably wanted to say that Voldemort would sacrifice his followers heirs as long as he could remove Harry. Sure if you think enough about it then things stop making sense, but it's not used just to add "The Troll Event".

On the other hand, a complete AU can sometimes feel like you cannot really recognize the world and the characters and it would better fit as an AU. Like a Harry that is red haired and lives in York and he has been accepted to a prestigious Ice skating boarding school and he prefers that people refer to him as Jonathan, while his arch nemesis is Danny Mallory(he's name is actually Draco but Jonathan and everyone else calls him Danny) who goes to the Seymour Snake Academy where the headmaster is Mort "The Lord" Vol (named the lord because he's a bit of a diva and he produced 70% of all the plays in the last decade). In this case I would prefer an OC fic instead of trying to shoe-in something.
