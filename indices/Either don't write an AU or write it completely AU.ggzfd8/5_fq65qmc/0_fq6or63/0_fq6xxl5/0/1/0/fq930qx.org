I guess we did read the same books, but you seem to think that if something is normal for the wizarding world it is okay, which is something I completely disagree with.

We are talking about a society that shits on human rights here, so yeah, in that context the Weasleys might seem like good parents, but no, they are not at all.

It is bad to send your children to a boarding school, when they are only 11 and only see them once or twice a year. It is bad to buy your kid shit clothing that it is embarrassed about and not change a thing about it. I am talking about what Ron had to wear for the Yule ball. His parents didn't even care enough to get the ridiculous frillies off. Not knowing whether or not Ron's wand was broken is even more neglectful than thinking of it as punishment. You have to make sure that your child has the supplies it needs while in school and of course check up on it.

" He never even told any teachers"

The teachers are neglecting their duties as well, that is basically what all of the books are about. There are enough thought experiments like "Imagine what it would be like if there was one responsible adult in the wizarding world".

I am referring to the last battle, Molly made a huge deal about Ginny joining, her other kids? Ahh, nope.

Too poor to seek out help? We are talking about Britain, not the US. And maybe, mayyybe if you're too poor to get your traumatized children (I am not only talking about Ginny, Ron as well) into therapy you should not go on vacation for a few weeks, because maybe the wellbeing of your children is actually more important than having fun.

"Have you ever met someone who openly discussed some very personal therapy with virtual strangers?"

Harry is a virtual stranger to Ron?
