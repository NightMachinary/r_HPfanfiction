Molly had a lot to say about Ron leaving on the hunt in the first place and consistently doesn't want any of her children involved (as far back as the order of the phoenix). Her greatest fear is any one of her family dying. She just doesn't have control over them once they're adults and, most likely, becomes resigned to this and so tries to prevent the only child she has who is underage from joining the war effort. This is the same rule that the Hogwarts professors set out for under 17s.

We don't really know what support they seek out for their children, I doubt they'd tell Harry about it. Potentially, they are too poor to access support which is different to bad parenting.

Also, my understanding is that Ron didn't tell his parents about his wand and so suffers through the year. The howler makes no mention of his broken wand.
