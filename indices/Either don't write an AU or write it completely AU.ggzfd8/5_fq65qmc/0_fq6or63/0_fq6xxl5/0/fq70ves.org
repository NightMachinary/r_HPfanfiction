Just what I said. The Weasleys are not good parents. They give their children food and a roof over their head and do not abuse them, but apart from that? They don't care. They don't ever seek out therapy for their massively traumatized children. They do nothing to reassure their children if they get insecure. They use public humiliation as a method of disciplining their children. They let Ron suffer through almost an entire school year without the most essential learning device for a wizard. They do not it care if one of their children is really embarrassed, even if they could change what he is embarrassed about with no effort at all. They only cared about their only girl not being in a battle, not even a word to her one year older brother.
