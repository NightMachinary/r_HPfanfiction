The thing is though is that plans have momentum and unless AU Harry has drastically changed the entire wizarding worlds landscape the first 2 years Canon events are going to happen. Dumbledore is still gonna set up the forbidden corridor. Voldemort is still gonna use a troll or some other distraction that lets him investigate the corridor. Whether Harry goes to the corridor at the end of the year is really the only major event you can really change. And unless Harry somehow shakes up the political scene the law will still be passed that allows Arthur to raid Malfoy Manor. This will lead him to try to get revenge by planting the diary on Ginny. By third year butterfly wings have probably shifted the world enough to do just about anything but yeah the first two years are kinda set.
