True. Sometimes fanfic is so 'Groundhog Day', when you're essentially reading multiple renditions of Harry's first year, each only microscopically different from the other. Sticking to basically the same script is something that many writers do, but an AU well told has creativity, imagination and a logical approach to the changes that might happen and their consequences. It's more hard work, but something different and new is good for the reader.
