My favorite right now is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team][The Hogwarts Strike Team]]

An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]

Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in First Year. NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The Cupboard Under the Stairs]]

A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic. This is a series and is up to Harry's fourth year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]]

In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10901705/1/Out-of-the-Dark-and-into-the-Green][Out of the Dark and into the Green]]

Shortly before his 11th birthday, Harry Potter disappears from Privet Drive. Accidental Magic takes him halfway through the country, and while Harry tries to find his place in his new life of magic and mystery, the Wizarding World is left to deal with the consequences of his disappearance.
