Are the best ones that have updated in the past month. Honorary mentions are Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian (updated, but not fully/off DLP), The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb (too early to really count), Hogwarts Battle School by KwanLi (been losing my interest a tad lately, so I haven't read the past few) and My Dark Passenger by Malevolent Mind (which started, but only posted a prologue on DLP).
