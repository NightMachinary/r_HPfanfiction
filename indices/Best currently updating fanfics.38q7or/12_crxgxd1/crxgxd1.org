Bellatrix's torture of Hermione uncovers a long-kept secret. The young witch learns her true origins in a story that shows the beginning and end of the Wizarding wars as Hermione learns about her biological father and the blood magic he dabbled in that will control her future (Slight AU OotP---DH) Dramione - Pureblood!Hermione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

Shealone has 2 other WIP stories that are also both promising, but this is my favourite. She updates on a regular schedule that's described on her profile.

If you check her favs, you'll find other WIP stories that are updated regularly, I like a lot of Colubrina's stories in particular (One of which just got another chapter while I was writing this comment).
