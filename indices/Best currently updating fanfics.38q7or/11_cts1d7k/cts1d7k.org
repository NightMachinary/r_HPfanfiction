[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7218826/1/Sands-of-Destiny][Sands of Destiny]] just started getting updated regularly. It's a time turner fic with Sirius/Hermione as the ship. It's really well done ^{^} it's also on AO3 if you prefer that site.

Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4314892/Colubrina][Colubrina]] is updated regularly. All of her stories are great. Right now she has a few WIP stories: Draco/Hermione, TRJ/Hermione, Theo/Luna, Blaise/Ginny, TRJ/Ginny, Draco/Astoria, Draco/Theo/Hermione. I recommend The Muddy Princess and Like Brothers.
