It is enjoyable but the writing is cold, and the errors are offputing. Compare it to the writing in Salvation in Shadow, Wizard Runemaster, An Unfound Door, and the Travel Secrets series. Those stories get into the mind of the characters and not merely reporting what the character is doing in a particular scene.

Blood Runes could be a novel take on a somewhat rare line of thinking. However, to be truly great, it should be polished.

edit: I already left my thoughts on the fic too via a review. I lasted until chapter 6 because of the style and errors.
