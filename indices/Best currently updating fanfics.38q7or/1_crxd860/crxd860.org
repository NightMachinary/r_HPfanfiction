[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]]: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]]".

Innocent: Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
