These are the stories I'm currently following, as of 12 June, that have been updating with decent regularity:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10947156/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]] : Last updated 4 June. Part 3 in the Stygian Trilogy, which follows Albus, Rose, Scorpius, and a handful of EXCELLENT OC friends as they battle their way through the rise of a powerful network of dark wizards. Starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] I recommend you read all three!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]] : Last updated 1 June. Like Oblivion, is the third part of a series - starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]. Premise is that Sirius escapes early and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. A nice sort of AU take on Harry's upbringing and, in Identity, first year at Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10982480/1/A-Simple-Case-of-Death][A Simple Case of Death]]: Last updated 30 May. Crossover with House MD - sounds dumb but somehow it works. House is basically abducted and taken to Hogwarts to cure a mysterious illness that the best magical minds can't figure out. A decent amount of years Post-Hogwarts. Has a Hermione/Snape pairing, which I usually find horribly off-putting, but it's actually pretty good.

These next two haven't updated for a while, but have been decently regular, if a bit slow.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] : Last updated 18 March. Harry goes blind as a baby when Voldemort curses him, but has the ability to essentially "see" some shapes and so forth. He and Hermione take on the world with their wits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][The Reign of the Serpent]] : Last updated 20 March. Author's description: "AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze." Really cool and well-developed AU with a neat take on JKR's characters.
