There are four stories that I am following that receive updates regularly:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] by White Squirrel. Posts every saturday like clockwork. I believe she has another story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] that is also regularly updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]] by Darth Marrs. Also posts regularly every Saturday.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal with a Devil]] by Silently Watches. Post regularly every Thursday, alternating between stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11139302/1/The-Fourth-School][The Fourth School]] by Stargon1. Author seems to be losing a bit of steam on this, the 4th book, in the series. When I first started following, he seemed to post several times a week, but now is slower. (Edit: The first book in the series is "The Cupboard Under the Stairs, also posted elsewhere on this thread.)
