Worse, it's a shitty Dark! Indie! Harry story. Which means Harry gets to act like a complete asshole and we're supposed to love him for it.

Got as far as chapter 3 before I had to quit. I mean yeah not allowing people to push you around is applaudable but behaving like Draco and Dudley's obnoxious love child is where I draw the line.
