I gotta admit, I am a bit of a sucker for when Harry actually rejects and friend-zones a girl.

I've seen elements in a few, scattered stories where Susan, Hannah ,or another character tries to flirt with him and ask him out in his Fifth, Sixth, or even late Fourth years. However, although he had forgiven them, he hadn't forgotten what they did thus turning them down flat, much to their surprise.
