I honestly can't remember where they are on FFn, but I think they may be under the Harry Potter/Susan Bones character filters somewhere?

Someone else might be able to identify these stories and give titles for them:

- Susan gets injured during apparition lessons: Harry takes her to the Hospital Wing for splinching. She tries to flirt with him, he's uncomfortable. Eventually, she goes for the direct approach after being in his arms, and he turns her down flat\\
  She's stunned, hurt and confused as to why, and he just gives a vague answer about Fourth Year.\\
  IIRC Hannah goes overprotective mode, actually attacks Harry, gets hurt in some awful Harry Potter Indie Cliches, and it eventually causes Susan to side with Harry over Hannah's bitchery and causes Hannah's parents to tell Susan to keep away from their daughter.
- Harry starts dating a normal, non-Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass in his Fifth or Sixth year. She's a likable person, and despite Ron's misgivings, he actually warms up to her (albeit is still suspicious). She's broadly accepted by them.\\
  Hermione, in the meantime, has developed feelings for Harry is actively jealous: Harry is completely unaware but it's obvious from the narrative it's completely unrequited love on her end.\\
  There was a meeting in the Library where Hermione gets crushed when Harry reveals he wants to ask out Daphne (hence his hanging around there), not for wanting to study with her, and another where they all meet in the Three Broomsticks: Ron is dragged off by Lavender, Cho tries to capture Harry's eye again and fails, and Hermione stews in bitter jealousy as Daphne is welcomed in.
