Lessee...

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot][/Barefoot/]] by Zaxaramas, in which Harry has the magical ability of psychometry(touching something to gain knowledge of it), but some people avoid it because "Honks"

There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][/Blindness/]] in which Harry was struck blind when he was hit by the killing curse, and thus his magic became a sense much like DareDevil's ability to see through sound, though far more colorful.

There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][/Lightning Dragon's Roar/]] in which Harry learns to eat lightning for magic, inspired by anime/manga /Fairy Tail/. It's also a massively AU crossover(I mean, /Superman/ and /Stargate/ both show up), and starts at the beginning of 5th year.

There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596404/1/Fairy-Tail][/Fairy Tail/]] which, ironically enough, /also/ features Harry learning to eat lightning for magic, inspired by the anime/manga /Fairy Tail/, but goes in a much more sedate direction than /Lightning Dragon's Roar/, and starts before Harry's first year. The other fanfic has great action, IMO, but I think this one is the better story, but unfortunately it's dead. The author seems to be still active on Ao3, but doesn't work on this story at all(it's not even on Ao3). Also, for all that it's categorized as a crossover, it's more about characters reading fiction and attempting to imitate it than actually crossing the two worlds..
