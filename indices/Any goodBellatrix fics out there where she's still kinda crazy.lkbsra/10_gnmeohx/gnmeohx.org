I remember reading a story where Bellatrix was saved by Remus at some point in Hogwarts (possibly from a group of junior DE's) and later got married to Remus. She was kind of a mad scientist type character: she was good, but she was definitely not all there.

I don't remember the name of the story, or really anything else about it, but maybe someone here will.
