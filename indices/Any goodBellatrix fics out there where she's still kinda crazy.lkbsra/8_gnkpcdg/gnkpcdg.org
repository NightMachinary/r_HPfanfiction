I read a fantastic fic that I wish I could still find where Harry was raised in Azkaban. The Death Eaters were strangely very in character but formed different levels of bonds with Harry as the years passed and Harry's accidental magic having positive effects of Azkaban life. I have a vague memory of there being a peach tree in the courtyard. Bellatrix was crazy but...an odd mix between nurturing and possessive if Harry as far as I remember.
