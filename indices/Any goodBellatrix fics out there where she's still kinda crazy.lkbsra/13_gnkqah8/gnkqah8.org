I'd rep my own fic here because that's sort of where it's heading, but I'm still in the early phases of writing it and haven't posted much yet.

But for reference, my fic is going to be more of a forced relationship between crazy Bellatrix and Ginny Weasley that turns into a slightly mentor-mentee style relationship. Nothing romantic between them in the slightest, and Bellatrix will have some awesome freak-outs at inconvenient times that put Ginny in a bind. It's fun to write so far.
