I've seen a few that call it (some variation of) "The Black Insanity". Unfortunately, I can't remember the titles of any of them. I know there is at least one out there that discusses all three sisters and Sirius carefully warning Harry about putting himself in their cross-hairs due to the risks involved with mentioning their Insanity. I think there is an ongoing one that has Harry being named Lord Black at Sirius' will reading and getting a letter that forwards 2 letters written to Sirius by Narcissa and Bella before their weddings and asking him to annul their marriages... Sirius couldn't due to never formally getting the Lordship, so Harry does at his first opportunity and Bella shows that she is still crazy, but not so much evil.
