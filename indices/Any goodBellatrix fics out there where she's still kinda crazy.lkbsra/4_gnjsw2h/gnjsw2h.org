Ok, so if you're into Bellatrix fics you've probably already read Delenda Est, but I'm throwing it out there anyway because it does fit the question - she's definitely on Harry's side and her insanity is less "murder murder crucio" and more quiet sociopathic/psychopathic, but I definitely think it still counts.

Next, I'm going to recommend one that I /think/ is going to go that way but I'm not sure because it's relatively near the beginning. Don't read this if you need your WIPs to update at any kind of steady pace, because this author is one of those that has like 15 WIPs at once and has no issues putting one they're not feeling on hiatus for a long while, so while this one is updating right now, it may randomly pause for 8 months while the author feverishly updates his Anakin Skywalker time travel or whatever (I follow because I like every single story this author has written so I'm happy with whatever is currently updating, but if you're not into Star Wars you'll be a sad potato). Anyway, Deadly Belladonna by AppoApples is a story where 49 year old Harry, who's quite happy with his life and has made peace with it, is non-consensually sent back in time by Andromeda because tldr Black Madness. She sends him with a potion that will supposedly help Bellatrix not be gibbering and Harry uses it, and we're still in the stages of Bellatrix not understanding what's going on, but it looks like while she'll be sane-er, she's definitely not all there and I'm not sure she ever will be.
