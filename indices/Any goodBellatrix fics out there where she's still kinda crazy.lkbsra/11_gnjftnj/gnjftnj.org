Try The Plan series ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1466644]]) - an AU Bellatrix, age 13 and already very chaotic and slightly crazy, accidentally teleports herself into third year of canon and decides to revive the house of black, kill the dark lord for making canon Bella a raving lunatic, and generally just have fun.

Very good world building, wonderful characters, frequently updated and absolutely worth a look.
