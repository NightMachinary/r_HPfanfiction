I have two problems with these ones :

1. way too much internal monologues. For 1 second IRL, we have like 20 seconds of internal rambling, for every character.
2. Bella is always right, even when she's wrong. At one time, she cheated on Hermione but apparently she's not wrong to do that, because she thinks social norms are stupid and it's almost if the writer said Hermione was wrong to make a fuss of it. And so she never really reflects on herself because she always has the moral high ground. She never care therefore she is right to do everything she wants.

and also. All the intelligent character have the exact same opinion on the same matters. It really sends a "intelligent-good-guys/dumb-bad-guys" vibe
