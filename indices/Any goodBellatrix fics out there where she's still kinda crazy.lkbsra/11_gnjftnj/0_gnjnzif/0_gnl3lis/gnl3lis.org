The internal monologue just kills me. I love the worldbuilding but please put it at appropriate times and don't give me the character's life story and the history of socialism in between two sentences of a conversation...

I feel like this has gotten significantly worse over time. The first book had lots of internal monologue but things kinda happened and the plot (as much as it has one) moved on. Now we have the Tournament arc and so far it's been like 30k words on the day of the First Task before the Task even started and none of it was really relevant for anything... And did we really need an entire chapter each to introduce the characters who participate in the First Task?

Sorry for the rant.
