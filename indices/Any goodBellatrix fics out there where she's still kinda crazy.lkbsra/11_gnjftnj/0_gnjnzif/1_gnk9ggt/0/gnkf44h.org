Agreed, but in this case it is more "We come from extremely varied backgrounds but we all have the exact same conclusion on one particular and precise topic. And we treat anyone who dare to disagree like fricking idiots because, surprise, they happen to be fricking idiots" except Dumbledore who is more a backward-looking stubborn old man than a fool.

In canon, the good guys agree on the same principles, but not necessarily on the same things, like Molly and Sirius.
