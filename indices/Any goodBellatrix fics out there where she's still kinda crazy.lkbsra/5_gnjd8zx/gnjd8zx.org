Wish I could remember the name of it, but I read one once that had Bellatrix becoming good after she was sorted into hufflepuff. Andromeda ended up taking her place in the death eaters and Bellatrix became best friends with Molly and on the good side. I wouldn't say she was totally crazy, but she still had some of it in her.

Sorry if this fox was already mentioned, I can't remember the name of it
