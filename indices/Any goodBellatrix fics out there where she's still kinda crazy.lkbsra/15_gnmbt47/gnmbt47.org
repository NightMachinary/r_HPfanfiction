The night Harry summons the Knight Bus to escape the Dursleys, he ends up bringing a new companion---a poor black cat that he decides to take as a second familiar. But this cat isn't any ordinary cat, and it has big plans for its new master. Sirius really should've kept his plans a bit more secret...especially with his cousin so close...
