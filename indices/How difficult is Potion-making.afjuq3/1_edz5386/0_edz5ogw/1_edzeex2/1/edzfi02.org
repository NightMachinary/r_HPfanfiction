You are putting in oil, so it will be odd either way. That being said, you can take the basic recipe for a cake and add anything from chopped apples or nuts to chocolate.

Same goes for pasta. You buy the noodles but can freestyle anything you like. Ham, cream and tomatoes? Pesto and dried tomatoes? Mozzarella, carrots and minced meat? You get the picture, right?

Basically, you can spin the argument both ways.
