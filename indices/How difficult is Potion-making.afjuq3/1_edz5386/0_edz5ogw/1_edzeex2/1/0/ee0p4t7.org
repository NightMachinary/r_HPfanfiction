  You are putting in oil, so it will be odd either way.

Cooking must be an odd thing, then, because some recipes for cakes specifically say to add oil. And it's not really the point, the point is that while getting /some kind of effect/ may be considered a success by some, to people who want a specific result it may not be, just like starting out with a plan for a chocolate cake and ending up with a fudge sludge may not be considered a success by anyone with culinary ambitions.

Yes, to a certain degree you are free to add whatever. But a lot of it is only because even if you don't cook you have a lot of knowledge about what stuff is edible and what isn't and how it tastes from just eating it and from seeing how it's used in various recipes. I guess one could claim that you could get the same from imbibing potions ingredients, The-Elder-Scrolls--style, and it could make for a fun AU thing, but if we are talking about stuff that's canon to Harry Potter then there's an implication that you won't and that instead it's a long list of stuff to memorise, possibly with some help from some rules like the one talked about by Slughorn.
