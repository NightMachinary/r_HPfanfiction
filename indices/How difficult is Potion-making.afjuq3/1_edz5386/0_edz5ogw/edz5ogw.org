But cooking is fairly easy because your objective is to create a meal. You can throw together most vegetables in a pan with bacon and onions and the result will be edible as long as you don't burn it. The exact ratios do not matter much because it will taste decent in most cases. Throw in some herbs and spices and you are done. But potion making aims to accomplish a way more complicated goal. You don't want to brew a potion, you want a potion which does X. Chemistry or Pharmacy would be way better comparisons.
