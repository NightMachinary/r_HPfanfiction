Cooking basic and simple things is easy, very much like first year potions is also easy. But creating more complex dishes that require a well developed palette, advanced cooking techniques, time management, knowledge of your ingredients, etc. is not simple at all. And for complex potions where the smallest of mistakes or imperfections can cause your potion to fail (or worse explode) the consequences are also more dire.

Look at cooking where most people are able to make dishes well enough, some are good amateur cooks, some can get by with a career in food, but only a select few are star chefs. For potions most people can make basic potions, some have a little more talent, but only a few are true potions masters.
