I think you are reading a bit too much into potion making that is not expressly stated in canon. I also think you are equating the possible bad consequences with the difficulty of the task. Boiling pasta for too long will make the pasta dish not as good as it could have been, but will not make it inedible. While cooking a potion for too long can have potentially disastrous effects. That doesn't make the brewing of the potion more difficult though.
