Pasta is literally just cooking noodles, slapping on some sauce from the jar and some cheese on top. Even the basic potions are way more complicated.

I mean, the principle is the same, chop up stuff and throw in the right amount at the right time, but even you have to admit that basic pasta has way fewer potential alleys for critical failure than a basic potion.
