Objection, Your Honor, this is pure conjecture.

Who's to say there aren't simple potions that involve boiling one ingredient for 10 to 12 minutes in a bunch of water with a teaspoon or so of a second ingredient added in.

If I was Snape, you can bet your ass I would tell those first-years it has to be exactly 11.5 minutes, exactly a teaspoon of eye-of-newt, and don't forget to stir clockwise three times so your noodles don't clump together. If only so they'd get used to following directions before getting to the more complicated potions where that stuff really is important. And it's canon that you can sometimes get a passing grade even if your portion is a little off-color from the ideal, which implies that it would still work even if you were less than exact in some of the steps.

We never actually got that much information about what exactly is involved in most of the potions in the book, so I don't think we can say that /most potions can fail at any steps where you add ingredients/.

I do agree that cooking is probably not a very good metaphor, though. I would say it's more like baking, specifically the kind that comes with a panel of judges, and you fail if your bread is too much like a country French loaf and not enough like ciabatta, or the custard layer in your cake is too runny.
