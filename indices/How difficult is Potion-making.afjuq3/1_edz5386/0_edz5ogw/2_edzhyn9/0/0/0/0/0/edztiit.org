But when cooking pasta you can only fail in so many ways. You can add the wrong amount of salt and cook it the wrong amount of time. Most potions can fail at any steps where you add ingredients, of which there are significantly more of. Each of these steps is a potential failure. And the more ways something can fail, the more you have to get right, the more complex it is.
