You might as well ask, indeed, "how hard is cooking?". The facts of the matter is that it's incredibly difficult to become a Potionneer --- to understand Potions on a deep enough level to create new Potions and to intuitively known when to stir, when to add the ingredients, etc., rather than strictly follow a detailed list of instructions without understanding them. Most people can do fried eggs or boil water using the latter approach; if they're good at memorizing long lists of instructions and carrying them out with precision, they might even be very good at making souffl√©s or roast beef or other more "advanced" dishes. But you need a special gift, and lots of experience, to do /without/ the cookbook and invent a new dish, or a new way to prepare a dish.
