I would also argue that Harry is good at potions in sixth year because he's following improved directions exactly. I recently read a fic that had the issue described pretty well. It said they follow directions but Harry doesn't know why he can crush the beans instead of cutting them or if you can do this for all potions or just living death. How it works for cooking is most people don't care why certain ingredients/times are what they are because if they follow directions exactly they'll get it right. I live in North Carolina and have had jobs in restaurants and the number of times I've been making stuff and the experienced cooks don't know how much stuff they put in but estimate what they need, taste it and keep doing it like that is astounding. One place there was no set recipe so everyone did it slightly their own way with a bit of different tastes. In potions experienced brewers would add it stuff based off knowledge/instinct to make the potion more effective, last longer, taste better or whatever.
