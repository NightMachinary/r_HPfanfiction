Recently I thought about it, but from another angle. In order to improve potion instructions Snape obviously made some research. Returning to the books timeline does Hogwarts potions educational standards give enough basement for students to make similar researches?

In other words could, for example, Hermione reverse engineer the better instructions in order to understand why they are better?

Also it's worth to note that even Slughorn tested students ability to follow instructions, not their knowledge about how ingredients work together and why.
