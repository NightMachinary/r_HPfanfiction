  Also it's worth to note that even Slughorn tested students ability to follow instructions, not their knowledge about how ingredients work together and why.

Well, you teach a train driver how to drive a train and not how to build one. Or a racecar driver. Or the crew of a warship. And while builders know how to build buildings, they are not the ones producing the base material.

You are generally taught what you need and the Potions course does just that. I mean, giving teenagers the motivation to experiment with volatile ingredients is not the smartest thing to do because for every scientific breakthrough you will get ten or even a hundred counts of vandalism or bodily harm.
