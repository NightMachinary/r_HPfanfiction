  Cooking cannot do that - turn toxic ingredients into edible food (normally).
#+end_quote

On the contrary, it's extremely common for cooking to turn an indigestible ingredient into a nutritious one.

For example, raw potatoes are primarily composed of a type of starch that the human digestive tract cannot fully process. Cooking changes the starch to a different form that can be broken down in the digestive system and used for energy by the body.

Raw beans contain a toxic compound called lectin. If you consumed a meal of raw beans you would poison yourself. Raw kidney beans are especially toxic. Soaking & cooking breaks the lectin down into a different compound that is not harmful.

  Potions is just as difficult as Snape says it is - first years have a big book of 1000 ingredients (which they use throughout the seven years) they need to know everything about. Just having so much to memorise alone makes it a lot more difficult than chemistry.

There are just as many (in reality probably more) compounds and precise chemical reactions that could be memorized in chemistry. The only difference is that chemists use tools, such as computers, to keep track of all of that information for them.
