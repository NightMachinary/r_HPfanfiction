  Harry does not become the best brewer in his year - he becomes the best at following instructions. When Slughorn tests his students on something that involves knowledge of theory, Harry fails miserably.

That's basically Harry in a nutshell. As a character, and a wizard, he's basically impossible to respect or take seriously. Rowling can TELL us over and over how good a wizard Harry is, how much he's grown, but she sure fucking sucks ass at showing it.

I mean, Harry is supposed to be some sort of Defense prodigy. But do we ever see him show an ounce of independent study (Minus the patronus of course)? I mean...just imagine, instead of sitting through stupid fucking boring dumbass retarded Wizard soccer (Seriously...fuck Quidditch till the end of time) we actually saw Harry inventing his own defense spells or something. Something he is working on in say, book 3, and then it pays off in book 5.

But no...because Rowling just doesn't think it's important.
