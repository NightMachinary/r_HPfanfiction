  The "just like cooking" explanation
#+end_quote

This is BS and is used by imbeciles. Potions has you adding seemingly toxic ingredients to get radically different products - from a muggle perspective, that clearly denotes that chemical reactions take place. Cooking cannot do that - turn toxic ingredients into edible food (normally).

Potions is just as difficult as Snape says it is - first years have a big book of 1000 ingredients (which they use throughout the seven years) they need to know everything about. Just having so much to memorise alone makes it a lot more difficult than chemistry. It's also a very exact process - adding one extra teaspoonful of hellebore causes Harry's Draught of Peace to be ruined completely. Each step involved in the brewing is more or less timed, and there's theory behind even the direction of stirring.

In short, it is nothing like cooking.

  just using Snape's notes Harry becomes the best brewer of his year.

Harry does not become the best brewer in his year - he becomes the best at following instructions. When Slughorn tests his students on something that involves knowledge of theory, Harry fails miserably.

Harry gets those potions right following Snape's modifications, but he doesn't understand the reason behind those modifications and why they make the potion superior to the text book. Why inserting one counterclockwise stir every 3-4 clockwise stirs, or why crushing the ingredients instead of chopping them yields superior results - he doesn't know any of that.

Since he doesn't understand the differences, his successes in the Potions classroom during his sixth year is more or less equivalent to labour - it's like the difference between a student who knows not to throw sodium into water because of the explosion it will cause, and a student who doesn't throw sodium into water because someone wrote it in their textbook. The one lesson where Potions concepts are tested, the lesson with Gopalott's law or whatever it's called, Harry fails miserably.
