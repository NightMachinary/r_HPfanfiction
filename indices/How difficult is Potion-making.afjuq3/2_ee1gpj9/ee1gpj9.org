A neat headcanon can be found in linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), which has the following scene:

  As Ron and Harry prepared their workstation, Hermione started asking Neville a few questions about the Blister Reduction Potion. She wanted to make sure he had done the reading before starting his brewing--Neville was usually pretty good about that sort of thing now, but she felt it was better to be safe than sorry. She had also recently started using this question and answer session to focus Neville on potential trouble spots in the brewing potion. Doing the reading wasn't enough if you didn't understand what the book was trying to tell you.

  She smiled when Neville correctly identified the signs of too much heat being applied during the reduction stage of the potion, and then blinked in surprise when she glanced over at the other two. They were both staring at Neville, jaws agape. Harry recovered his voice first.

  "Where'd you learn all that, Nev?" Harry asked.

  "It's in the book," Neville mumbled, blushing.

  "What? Where?" Harry asked.

  "What do you mean, where?" Hermione asked. "It's right after the brewing instructions."

  "We're supposed to read that?" Harry asked, then recoiled at the glare Hermione turned on him. "I mean, I know we're supposed to read that stuff when Snape gives us essays to write, but otherwise I didn't think we needed to."

  "Yeah," Ron said, jumping in. "We follow the directions, so we ought to get the right potion. We wanted you to tell us why it's not working."

  "I don't believe this," Hermione said, pinching the bridge of her nose. "You've been treating your potions text like a cookbook."

  "Well," Harry said, sounding genuinely puzzled, "it has a list of recipes describing how to combine ingredients to get the proper result, so yeah."

  "Ok," Hermione said, "the last step of the Boil Cure Potion is to stir five times clockwise. How fast do you stir it?"

  "Kind of a normal stirring speed?" Harry said.

  "How do you know if you're going too fast or too slow? How do you fix it if you do?" Hermione asked. "You're not scrambling eggs here. You're creating a precise combination of magical ingredients to produce a result that violates the laws of nature! There are any number of tiny variations in how people will interpret the same directions, you have to know how to account for those things."
