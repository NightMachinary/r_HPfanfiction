you may as well ask why any magic is difficult at all. why don't people discover powerful and new magic by trying random latin words? harry doesn't understand the law slughorn explains in hbp- but it's a pretty simple law, and jkr has slug say it in over the top language to make it seem difficult. so either harry is stupid, or it was meant to seem like a scientific law of relative difficulty to understand

that being said, potions actually does sound like it will be difficult in the real world. things have to be measured, timed, stirred exactly. very easy to fuck up. memorizing a long list of ingredients, what they do, how to harvest them, how they react under different circumstances etc. is a lot to know. not to mention knowing what's going on with a potion by looking at/smelling it
