Being mute would almost be as bad as being a squib, considering that a lot of magic other than potions and accidental and the occasional wandless magic requires speaking. Perhaps magic can still be done by mouthing the spell, if one practices enough? Communication could probably be done using a slate that is able to read your thoughts and turn them into words. Being deaf would also affect one's ability to cast magic as well, since it would screw with the ability to properly say spells. However, if being deaf isn't a problem with the brain, magic can probably fix that, or if it is, a spell or item could be made that transmits the words straight to the mind. Being blind could be dealt with using a spell or item that reads words and facial expressions, and creates sounds in such a way that the landscape can be mapped in sound and be easily understandable.

However, you have to realise that magic is able to cure or prevent in the first place almost all Muggle maladies. You're pretty much guaranteed to have no such problems if you have magic. Which is why the biggest disability is being a squib. Basically there would be no such services because no one else has such problems, unless they were caused by magic.
