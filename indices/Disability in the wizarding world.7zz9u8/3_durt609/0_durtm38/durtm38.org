Someone mentioned learning nonverbal magic, which is advanced but not impossible, so at least for those who can't speak, I don't think their disability would shame them to the level of a squib. Also, I feel like blindness and deafness shouldn't be limited to Muggles, because wizards and witches are still human, if not amplified versions. I remember in an interview, Rowling was actually going to include a blind person in the first book, but took him out for characterization reasons. I definitely think that broken bones and other physical problems could be better solved via magic though. As for the communicative slate/transmitting words from the mind, it makes me think of Legilimency almost.
