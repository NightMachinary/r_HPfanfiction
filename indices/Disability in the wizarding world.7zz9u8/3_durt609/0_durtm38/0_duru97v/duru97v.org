Wizards and witches are not really human, but rather superhuman. There's a lot of evidence that whether unconsciously or just because of the nature of magic, they are able to withstand many things that normal humans can't. They regularly fly on brooms going hundreds of miles an hour, at many more Gs than a normal human can withstand. Harry has his arm bones vanished. Human transfiguration of any kind involves some level of distorting the body. All these show that magicals are well beyond humans.

All injuries in HP can be healed, be they Muggle or magical, unless they are inflicted by dark magic. Moody's injuries are permanent. George's ear cannot be reattached because it was cut off by Sectumsempra.
