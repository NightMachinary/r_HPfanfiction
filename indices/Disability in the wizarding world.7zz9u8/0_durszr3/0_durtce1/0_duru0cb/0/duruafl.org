It's confusing to me that characters like Harry wear glasses, indicating a deterioration of eyesight + that being in his genetics, most likely. I'm not sure if that kind of disability, which is present in both muggle and wizarding kind (just like being born blind/deaf), can be cured/repaired magically. Harry surely would've had the option to do so but still has glasses into adulthood.
