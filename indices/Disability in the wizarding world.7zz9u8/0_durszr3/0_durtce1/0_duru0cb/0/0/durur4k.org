My best explanation is that while fixing myopia with magic is possible, it's very precise and advanced work, as myopia is a genetic, advancing illness rather than just a static malformation to fix. So it would take a /very/ skilled Healer to heal near-sightedness. That sort of service doesn't come cheap, and since there are much chaper charms for making glasses comfortable, nigh-unbreakable, and prevent them from falling accidentally, all but the vainest people just don't bother. (Bagman or Lockhart, for instance, strike me as people who just might have coughed up a full demyopisation, though that's just speculation.)
