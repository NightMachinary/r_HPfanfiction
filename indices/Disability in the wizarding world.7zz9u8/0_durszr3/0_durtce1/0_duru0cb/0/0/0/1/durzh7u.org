Even the least scientifically advanced societies knew about heredity empirically. Sons resembling grandfathers will do that. The entire idea of racism/"blood-purism" is rooted in the idea that people are inherently better than others and others are worse, and they pass down these characteristics to descendants.

Now, do they know the word "genetics", or the science behind it? I don't know. Probably not as such.
