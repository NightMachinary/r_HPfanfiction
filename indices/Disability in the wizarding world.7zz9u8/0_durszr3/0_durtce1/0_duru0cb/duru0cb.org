All of Mad-Eye's non-healed scars and injuries come from Dark Curses. All mundane damage is easily repaired.

I don't know whether non-magical mental patients would also be sent to St.Mungo's. I mean, /probably/, but all those we see were there from mind-magic-related damage, not normal disabilities/illnesses.
