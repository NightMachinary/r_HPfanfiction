I would think a mute or deaf person would learn nonverbal magic way earlier than the usual (Hogwarts sixth year, age sixteen). Or else you could use signing to cast spells, since the words and the wands are just focuses for the mages themselves, so it would be just the same thing. :) Blind people could cast verbal and nonverbal magic just fine, but I think combat stuff would be totally out of the question.

In my story I have a paralyzed witch who gets around in a wheelchair that can be used normally, but also can hover, so she can get up stairs and tough terrain no problem. :)
