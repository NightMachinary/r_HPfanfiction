As a special education teacher, your post had me thinking about learning disabilities. Does the wizarding world acknowledge learning disabilities? Does Hogwarts have special education teachers? We know there are squibs and courses they can take. So what about students who struggle with reading and writing? Or other disabilities that affect school performance?
