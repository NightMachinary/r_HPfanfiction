The fic "Blindness" deals with this question in the early chapters. I think the assumption in that fic that the Magical Society is absolutely unprepared to deal with something like this makes most sense. They usually can heal most of these problems. In the Muggle world it took a long long time of societal progress to try to accommodate such a tiny percentage of the population and Magical Britain already doesn't seem very accommodating to much larger minorities.
