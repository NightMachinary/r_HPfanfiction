Dumbledore- Master manipulator. I believe that he set everything up from the prophecy to the Forbidden Forest. He must have blamed himself for Voldemort's deed because he brought him to the magical world. So with divination he found how to win with 100% certainty. He admits that he has a tendency to become powerhungry and seek control,that he tries to temper. Still after Harry has a breakdown in his office he realizes what he has done and tries to change the future that he set in place, only to doom himself. Final thoughts: I respect him for trying to put down Voldemort no matter the cost, but I fully despise his methods.

Snape- The most interesting character. He came from a broken home straight into the snake den. He brought his greatest nightmare to life by pushing the love of his life to his greatest enemy's embrace, because he needed the acceptance of his new house/family. Final thoughts: He's an angsty arsehole, a most interesting angsty arsehole.

Draco- Not much to be said. Shity father and rolemodel. Ultimately just a kid way out of his depth.

Sirius- A grown-up rebellious teenager. A true Black, arrogant, spiteful, mean and murderous. It's not often that you see the rebellious phase affecting someone in a good way. Sirius is the embodiment of "Is it better to be born good, or to overcome your evil?". A remarkable character you can't help but love.
