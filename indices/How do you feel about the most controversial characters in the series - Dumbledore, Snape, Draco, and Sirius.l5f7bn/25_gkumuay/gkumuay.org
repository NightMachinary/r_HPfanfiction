Dumbledore -- one of the most interesting characters in the series; not good but not evil either. Sadly gets simplified by fandom a lot

Snape -- not good, not evil, just terribly horribly unpleasant. Really don't understand why so many people romanticize him, DE or not, bully or not, he's a nasty, overgrown manchild with self-esteem problems that ruined his life. Also don't' think he's really that complicated and complex as people make him out to be

Draco -- pathetic coward, not good and not evil because he's too spineless to make his own choices and to commit to anything

Sirius -- reckless fool with a hero complex, pretty thoughtless at times, seems to be stuck at mental age of 15.
