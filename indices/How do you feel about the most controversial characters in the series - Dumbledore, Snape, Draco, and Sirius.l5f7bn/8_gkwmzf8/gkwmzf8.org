Dumbledore - Doesn't really live up to the hype of him being able to do anything that is built around him. Is someone who wants a better world but doesn't actually know how it would be done , and is also too secretive for his own good . But in the end I think he's a good person ( if too manipulative ) who at this point is both too old to really deal with most of what is happening in the series ( he is 110 in harrys first year , my 87 year old grand father spends most of his time sleeping or sitting , not running around dealing with resurrected dark lords)

Snape - the movie snape is actually a person I actually like considering most of his interactions with Harry seem more professional and like if he was actually his teacher , not to mention how many times he helps Harry just because, not to mention his always calm and cool demeanor . He also doesn't really do very many bad things in the movies mostly just being snarky or annoying towards the trio . Book snape however is just a straight asshole. He goes out of his way to antagonise the trio , straight out bullies them , sabotaged their studies , is alway raving about his hate for harry and only helps harry because of his obsession with lily and his debt towards James.

Sirius - Essentially he was as a child the jock bully although he did apparently grow up considering he became friends with lily who hates that kind of person . He had a unpleasant childhood being the black sheep of the family and that combined with his long stay in azkaban has caused him to be very mentally ill ( although he doesn't show it as much ) , even so he still tries to be there for harry .

Draco - the guy is a coward . The thing about draco is that he was never good , he never regretted being bigoted or elitist in fact he was perfectly happy being these things the only thing he seemed to regret was siding with voldemort and that was only when he saw the punishments for failing him , heck at the battle of hogwarts he still went to Voldemorts side because he was too cowardly to make a stand against him . He only sabotaged Voldemorts search efforts because of hesitation on whether or not he wanted to support Voldemort after everything he'd seen him do.
