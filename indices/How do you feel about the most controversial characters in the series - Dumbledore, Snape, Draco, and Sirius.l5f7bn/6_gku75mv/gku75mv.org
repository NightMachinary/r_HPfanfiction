Biased btw

Dumbledore- Excellent person, could've done a better job helping Harry

Snape- Jerk for most of his life but redeemed himself in the end and is a good person

Sirius - Was a jerk as a child,grew up to be a good person,even if he's reckless.

Draco- I don't understand why people like him so much ? What did he even do ffs ???
