Dumbledore, in my mind, will always be a powerful wizard with a badass reputation who very much uses his positions and said reputation to his advantage to use and manipulate those around him. He keeps information from people he supposedly trusts (don't get me started on how much he kept from McGonagall and Harry throughout the OG series) to the point of causing problems, getting them involved in dangerous situations, and harming them. It makes for great plot and adventure, but the man and everyone would have benefitted from him actually TEACHING them things. A lot of it boils down to JK creating this all powerful wizard but also needing the other characters to figure things out on their own to drive the plot, so Dumbledore became a secretive/absent man instead who lacks empathy and believes he is SO moral that nothing he does can possibly harm others (it does. it does a lot).

My feelings for Snape have totally shifted around over the years. When I was younger, I saw him as an asshole for the way he treated students. I was a little older when Deathly Hollows came out and I started to feel sorry for him, and I can buy the whole, ok, he decided being a Death Eater was not for him. But now? Nothing about his relationship with Lily or the way he treated her or her son was healthy. I think Lily would punch Snape out for how he treated her son, and see him for the "nice guy" creep he was. That said, I love Alan Rickman and his portrayal of Snape will always make me still love his movie character for being the guy you love to hate and sometimes feel sorry for. That's just Snape. He is a classic "nice guy" who made a few mistakes.
