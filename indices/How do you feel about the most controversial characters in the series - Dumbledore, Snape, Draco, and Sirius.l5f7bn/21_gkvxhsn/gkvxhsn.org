Dumbledore: I love the guy, and I certainly don't think of him as a "manipulative bastard" that a lot of fics set him as. He does make some pretty odd choices, but he's been a legendary wizard for most of his life, that kind of thing has to get you a little mixed up after a while. Tldr: generally a good guy, if a bit funny

Draco: basically the worst. Hitler youth, if you will. That said, I've read a few fics where I like him, but they're either have him completely ooc or rewrite his life from day 1.

Snape: I don't even know what I think about Snape. He's an irredeemable ass who's "contributions" to the team do little to make up for his poor attitude. But I want to like him.

Sirius: I've forgotten what canon sirius is like at this point, but I know I didn't shed any years when he died. I don't usually hate him in fics, but he often comes off as childish and annoying at best.
