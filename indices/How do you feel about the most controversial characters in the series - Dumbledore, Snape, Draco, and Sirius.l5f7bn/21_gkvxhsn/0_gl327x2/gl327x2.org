I can't understand how Snape's contributions are not enough. He was the most useful part of the good guys team, only people above him were Harry, the literal Chosen One, and Dumbledore, who was in control of everything. He was a spy, which means he gave good guys useful information and misinformed bad guys. Not to mention he was the only reason half of students and school staff weren't dead before Harry got to school in book 7
