Dumbledore - a man who was overcome with grief in his past and was ultimately very lonely. Wanted to believe that people like Snape and Draco could chang because he needed to believe that he had truly changed from who he was. Obviously very powerful, and like Harry, believes the world is on his shoulders. Willing to do things that make him unpopular for what he believes is "right." I look at him with fondness.

Snape - A man who spent his teenage years being bullied, but also wasn't an innocent victim. He clearly had feelings for Lily, but I don't believe him to be a good person. I think his treatment of the students proved that he wasn't caring, he was a bitter person, who did one really risky thing in spying for the order. But it was selfish, he did it because his love was killed. I honestly think it Neville had been the Chosen One, and Lily and James went into hiding and weren't being attacked, Serverus would've stayed a loyal Death Eater. Ultimately, I respect the risk he took, but he's a POS in my eyes.

Sirius - it was clear that he was a bully to Snape, but he also did not have a happy childhood and upbringing. Despite being a bully, whatever bad karma he accured from that was paid 10 times over by going to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. I think despite his past, he clearly wanted to be better than he was, and some of the things he said prove that, for instance: "We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are." Unlike Snape, I think Sirius ultimately was a good person, who struggled with moments of darkness, particularly when he was young and had a more black/white view of the world.

Draco - The one I'm least sure of, for starters, he is a total spoiled rich kid. Anybody who says "my father will hear about this" is not somebody I'd personally want to hang out with. Clearly, he did believe in the pureblood ideology, and we can argue about the impact his parents would've had on that. But when it came down to actually doing bad things, he didn't have the stomach for it, but he still did terrible things, knowing they would cause actual physical harm. Once confronted with the ideology he "supported" he saw the effects of it, and he didn't like what he saw. However, he definitely deserved to be punished for the actions that he undertook in getting to that stage. Overally, he's an unpleasant person in my eyes, but not evil, just a rich twat.
