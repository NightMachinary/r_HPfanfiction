There is nothing in Snape's memories to indicate he had any problems being a Death Eater until Lily was threatened. He would likely have gladly killed James on the spot if he had the chance with his mask on.

In his memories even Lily knew that he was already planning on joining Voldemort even before his worst memory.

When he betrayed Voldemort because he targeted Lily Dumbledore looked on him with disgust. He only agreed to swear to protect Harry because Dumbledore "coldly" twisted him into it.
