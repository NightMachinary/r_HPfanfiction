Dumbledore - I like him as the old wise mentor figure who is there to help the main character grow. Not really into the whole manipulative characterization (regardless whether with good or malicious intentions) because that's not his purpose. Sure he had a convoluted plan but its ultimate purpose was to help Harry grow, accept death as a natural part of life, learn about the importance of friendship and love and keep him alive.

Snape - he is one of my favorite characters. That's not to be confused with the fact that I like him as a character but in contrast to Harry who is all good and Voldemort who is all evil, his grey nature adds a realistic dimension to the story. Also since we mostly him for Harry's POV we get a biased opinion of him. He is a dick to Harry, but objectively, other than the first book, he only punishes Harry when he steps out of line and generally seems to be quite respected by most of the Hogwarts staff, his House, the Order and the Death Eaters alike.

Draco - considering how much fans were expecting a redemption arc, DH was quite disappointing. He is a spoiled bully who happens to love his family (like most people that come from functional families). Sure he ends up in over his head but it is because of choices he made so at least a few months in Azkaban would have helped me view him less critically. Would have loved to also see Draco's lost chapter that JK was talking about where she showed him how he was like when he was around people that he considered his equals.

Sirius - he is similar to Snape and also one of my favorite characters. He is a grey character. He is a good guy who cares for his friends, but even in his later years he still seems reckless and cruel (he treats Kreacher horribly). We don't get to see much of his growth in between his graduation and his arrest but the two memories of him in Hogwarts as well as his plot to kill Snape would indicate he was not a good person in his youth. We see him in a favorable light because Harry likes him but, even if he didn't go to prison, I think it would have been very bad for Harry to be raised by him.
