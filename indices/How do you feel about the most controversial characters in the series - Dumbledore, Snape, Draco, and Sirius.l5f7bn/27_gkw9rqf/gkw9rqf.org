Dumbledore: a man willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve his goals in accordance with his skewed sense of morality.. I find his decisions questionable for the most part considering they tend to involve children and I refuse to accept "it's for the greater good" as a valid reason. Kinda biased on this one, I have feelings about utilitarianism... Snape: a beaten down man who decided to make it everyone else's problem. His treatment of his students was inexcusable but the fact that he was kept in his position is just another example of Dumbledore looking past any and all suffering that he thinks justify the end. Snape "being in love" with Lily does nothing to redeem him in my eyes and I have to wonder at what his definition of love is when it motivated him to be such a miserable sack. Draco: a spoiled rich kid raised into bigotry. I can feel sympathy for a child raised to believe bullshit but there comes a point in everyone's life where they must forge their own path and think for themselves. Draco is a self motivated and self absorbed child that was motivated by what would put him on top and when things got to real he left others to help him out of his mess. He's just lucky not everyone is motivated in the same way. Sirius: another spoiled rich kid but this one had the luxury of having an older brother to bear the brunt of his families expectations. He was a bully in school and only got slightly better as he grew older. Probably mostly due to the fact that he had no one to torment sealed away in Azkaban. An imprisonment that could've been avoided by him taking responsibility for his godchild rather than hightailing it into a trap for the sake of revenge.

For me the draw of the Harry Potter series will always be the world, not the characters and that's not explored nearly enough for my liking. Maybe that's a good thing though because I'm sure jk would've managed to fuck that up too. The characters are 2 dimeional, uninteresting, black and white blah. The series serves as groundwork for better writers to expand on in more interesting ways or even just rewrite entirely. Fanfiction is a blessing I give thanks for every day.
