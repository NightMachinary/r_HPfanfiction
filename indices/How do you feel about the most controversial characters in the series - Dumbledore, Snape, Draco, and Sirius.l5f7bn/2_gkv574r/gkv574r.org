They're all often less adroitly used in fandom than they could be.

Dumbledore heavily interests me and is probably the only character besides Luna that I'd actually like to meet and get to know. The juxtaposition of power/self-confidence and guilt is fascinating and exploring the contradictions of being the only one who can do things and being utterly terrified of having power is definitely something I'm musing on while plotting out my initial HP fics. Like, dude probably has the /worst/ imposter syndrome, but he can't ever show it and break the reputation.

Snape bores me - as much as I sympathise, abused kid gets a light in his life then struggles when that light is extinguished and gets angry at the person who tamped it down isn't really all that interesting to me.

Draco is a shithead rich-kid racist who got in way over his head and could've been explored far more interestingly in the period of the books after he got some reality crucio-ed into him. Anyone who's seen those videos that pop up where ex-KKK or ex-Westboro types talking about how they changed their views knows how interesting that journey can be - changing your entire worldview is tough and hard work and it's thoroughly fascinating.

Giving an opinion on Sirius is complicated. He spent years in a prison surrounded by creatures that suck all your good memories out - frankly, his personality and general confusion about life are completely understandable, I'm astonished he wasn't completely broken by the time he got out - so I'm not entirely sure that who he was when Harry met him was even close to how he was pre-Azkaban and thus judging him by that might just be judging an empty shell going through the motions he only vaguely recalls. That interests me, but it makes it difficult to establish a conclusive opinion.
