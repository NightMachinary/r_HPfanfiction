Dumbledore: 'good' but utterly without ordinary empathy that would let him put himself in another's shoes. It's all about the Grand Plan, no thought to simple things like food, clothes, any happiness at all. He reads like a sociopath with a moral code.

Snape: an abuser and oily self-serving creep, but, like, a /really interesting/ oily self-serving creep because he really does read as though the right intervention might have made him less awful, and even if he can't be redeemed, he serves interesting and useful roles within so many potential plots. Also, I am pretty sure Lily liked Petunia better than she liked Snape, she just thought James was utterly rotten.

Draco: rich kid bullyboy from a landed estate, boring and easy to write because he's so predictable. Writing things happening /to/ him is fun though. Yes, he got scared but he was casting cruciatus curses and doing well at it, before he got blackmailed into the hopeless task he was crying about. Post-war, he might have learned a thing or two and be less banally evil. His role within the plot is to be a nasty person and he's good at it.

Sirius: hypocritical drunken self-pitying loser with no real empathy and a moral code he doesn't follow through on. Fun enough to be workable in a number of roles within potential plots, but when I reread the original, I always want to kick him up the arse. His primary motivation seems to be to hurt 'the enemy' which is whoever he has decided upon at the time, it's just easy to get allies when 'the enemy' is Death Eaters.
