Dumbledore: As a character in universe is a once respected old man that is set in his ways of thinking. Despite a personal reluctance to exert authority and wield personal power, he has reached the point where the weight of responsibility hangs heavily on him and has for decades. Having so much responsibility laid on him has resulted in him accepting that responsibility, as well as responsibility that isn't his to claim. While his personal code prevents some actions, there are others that he feels he has no choice but to take. He's the only one that /can/ do certain things, so he is the one that /must/ do them. Having been the one that everyone looks to for advice for so long, and having taught or been headmaster to such a large portion of the population, he doesn't know how or when to take advice, trusting instead to his own counsels. He enforces his will and morality on others to their own detriment from the belief that it is for the best. While his motives are good, as well as many of his actions and their outcomes, many things he did were incredibly harmful in both the short and long term.

Overall: A conflicted and overall good man. Deserves to have some sense knocked into him to understand how his actions affect other's and how he has reached a point where he is making unilateral decisions with other peoples lives. If he was brought to face that, as well as his unresolved issues from Ariana and Gellert, he would have become an even greater man than he was.

​

Snape: Young Severus is a tragic figure with a troubled childhood and a bad situation in school. His bullying at the hands of the Marauder's combined with the internal pressure from other Slytherins truly put him in an awful situation. He reacted to being saved by James with anger rather than thanks though, and he reacted to being defended by his best friend the same way. I don't think he ever grew in maturity beyond that point, only in resentment and bitterness. Severus Snape is self centered obsession personified. He is the perpetual victim of his self narrative and is unwilling to let anything go. He holds onto his "love" of Lily long after he drove her away with his actions, he holds onto his hatred of James long after James matures and then dies. He projects his anger onto Harry and Neville and all his students. He acts only to soothe his obsession's, whether that's ignoring the truth about Pettigrew in order to try to get Sirius and Remus killed, or swearing to follow Dumbledore in return for protection for Lily. Canon Severus Snape was not redeemed by his actions, he did nothing for anyone else but himself. He did things because of oaths he swore, and out of personal vengeance.

Overall: Snape is a bad person. He did important work for the war, but he did it for himself, not for anyone else. No one should be named after him. He deserved a better childhood.

Draco: Draco is a spoiled brat born and raised in privilege and prejudice. His actions were those of a child who didn't know better, until everything became real in sixth year. Then it was his life and his parents lives on the line. Even then he couldn't bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Draco is a product of war, a child soldier as much as Harry was. He didn't deserve this. Draco had the chance of redemption in a way that Snape did not. His personality, life, and choices were ripe for change and redemption after sixth year. Rowling dropped the ball entirely by not taking that option. As written though the rest of the series, Draco is a coward. He lacks conviction regardless of what he is doing. He can't kill Dumbledore, he doesn't expose Harry in the manor, he doesn't turn away from Voldemort, he still tries to stop Harry in the Room of Requirement, he doesn't try to kill Harry, he doesn't fight in the battle. Draco takes the path of least resistance as written.

Overall: Draco deserved better than Rowling gave him.

​

Sirius: Snape's literary Foil. Shitty childhood, dark impulses, and more. A childhood bully picking on other's to hide his own insecurity from his family issues. I won't blame him for letting Hagrid take Harry to the Dursley's. He almost certainly didn't expect to lose to Peter and thought he would be back soon. By the time he got out of Azkaban though he is as obsessive and stuck in the past as Snape. He sees Harry as his father the same way Snape does, he obsesses over Peter to the point of neglecting Harry. Unwilling to let go of past grievances with Snape.

Overall: A broken man that really needed serious psychological help rather than to be locked in the childhood home he had run away from.
