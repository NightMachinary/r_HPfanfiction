Dumbledore- probably doing the best he can. He doesn't really know who he could trust after Death Eaters got out of trouble. My thought was Harry went to the Dursely family because of potential political football Harry could have went through.

Snape- I don't think he was a man who never believed any side he joined. He's a person for most out to protect himself. I think while he loved Lilly I think he saw it as a betrayal of their friendship. I think his friendship with Lilly is the only reason why he warned Dumbledore. He's basically a person who lost everything in the war. Sirius- a person who had the tendency to do things before he thought things through. (The whole Lupin thing plus Petagrew) probably mentally scared from Azkban but "gained" his freedom and some sort of normalcy with Harry and Lupin.

Draco- probably someone trying to live in what he thought was his father's legacy. Head cannon he probably tried but failed to live up to his father's expatiation. He probably was protected growing up. Probably near the end of the war shown how his father's name and persona destroyed for him.
