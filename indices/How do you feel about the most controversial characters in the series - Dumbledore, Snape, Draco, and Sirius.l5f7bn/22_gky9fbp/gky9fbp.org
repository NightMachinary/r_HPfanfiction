Sirius: I honestly believe Sirius is a good person, and had the best of thoughts for harry, and not just because he sees James in him but also because he loves harry. His younger days portraits him as a bully, but mind it he came from a family that was a big supporter of a magical terrorist, and he was treated as a nuisance and traitor by his own parents. I can forgive his younger days as he repented by joining the order and Auror (don't know if it's canon). You also have to remember one thing he spent more than 10 years in a prison that is infamous for being the worst prison. He was supposed to act like a insane guy.

Draco: a stereotypical egoistic rich daddy's boy and a proud bully. Draco was taught from his childhood that pure blood is best, and anyone else is either mudblood, or blood traitor, and he didn't have anyone to teach him anything else, he was his father's child arrogant and typical rich bitch, I can forgive his younger days for the same reason as Sirius but not when he became a death eater, and running away is not repenting for murder, aid in murder, torture and other crimes he did.

Snape and Dumbledore: depends on how you take their acts, I personally don't like either of them,
