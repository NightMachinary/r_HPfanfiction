I'm not claiming Dumbledore is a saint. In fact, I outright state I would have loved to see more conflict around his character, with Dumbledore being on the wrong end of it, before he died - the books never really do that. The books treat him as nigh-infallible until he dies, and /only then/ does all this stuff about him come to light - too late for maximum story-juice.

Snape, meanwhile, /started out as a hate-sink/ (which was deliberate on J.K. Rowling's part) and then got an explanation post-mortem - which is treated as a redemption in-story, but to me it doesn't really /work/ as one. Nothing he does before then even hints at the redemption potential, and the moment itself still shows him in a pretty bad light.

Frankly, I think they have the exact same problem, /as characters in a story/ - too little character exploration, too late for it to really matter. It just... Kinda goes in different directions.

EDIT: I have never worked this hard in my life to get one-and-a-half paragraph of writing to sound right with what's in my head, and I still feel like I haven't done that good a job of it.
