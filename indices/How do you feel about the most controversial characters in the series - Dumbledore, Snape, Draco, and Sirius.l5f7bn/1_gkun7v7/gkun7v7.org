- Dumbledore: I /hate/ that all of his character-exploration is post mortem. I think that a "Harry's Wise Old Wizard gets his pedestal slowly broken and then rebuilt just in time for said Wise Old Wizard to pass on the mantle" storyline would have been great - he makes mistakes, he's had a shady past, but ultimately he's still working towards the same thing Harry is.

- Snape: Didn't deserve to have Harry name his kid after him - he was just too unlikeable as a person. The man bullied, belittled and antagonized Harry&Co at literally every turn out of a petty grudge with Harry's /dead/ father, a last minute "oh, by the way, I totally wanted your mum" does not redeem that.

- Draco: Deserves a stint in Azkaban, frankly. No, running away at the last minute does not excuse the repeat attempts at murder, being an accessory to multiple kidnappings, helping an unrepentant bitch torture children, et cetera. Doesn't help that literally everything Draco did before that was "be a bully and a wannabe Death Eater".

- Sirius Black: Fundamentally a good person (at least, as an adult - he was a little shit in his Hogwarts years), but frankly the man needs therapy - which he's not going to get due to being a wanted criminal up until his death. I think if Harry wasn't a teen, his response to Sirius's offer to take him in should have been "Okay, but the moment we get your name cleared you're going to St. Mungo's first."
