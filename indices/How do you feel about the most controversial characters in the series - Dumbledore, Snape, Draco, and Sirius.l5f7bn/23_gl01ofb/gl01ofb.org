Dumbledore - a man who was overcome by grief after the death of his sister - which also led him to reconsider his opinions of muggles. He was so willing to give people second chances as he still saw his friend Grindelwald, and knew that if he changed, so could have grindelwald, therefore making it possible for anyone to be redeemed. He beleives in the good of many over the good of one, leading him to make questionable choices.

Snape - a man whom, although he was bullied as a teenager, was a bigot from a young age, and dabbled in the dark arts from a young age. he truly believed that muggleborns and muggles were lesser most of his life - only excluding Lily. he only betrayed voldemort for Lily, and I think that he only actually gave his unconditional support against voldemort had risen again.

Sirius - a boy whom never outgrew what he was thought as a child, and although he knew better, carried a grudge against slytherins. He treated slytherins like he was fighting death eaters, and did not hesitate to attack slytherins like he was attacking death eaters. he never fully grew up due to being trapped in azkaban for 11 yrs

Draco - a boy who grew up indocrinated into his families beliefs, never learned better, but was not willing to commit acts of violence. never grew out of his beliefs, but became willing to work with muggleborns.
