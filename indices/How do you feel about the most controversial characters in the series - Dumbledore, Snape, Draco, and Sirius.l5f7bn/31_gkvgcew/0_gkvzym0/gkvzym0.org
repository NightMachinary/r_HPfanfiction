  He did not redeem himself in the end, IMO, and just sucked.

Yeah, it's weird to say that his death somehow redeemed him. He didn't even really die so another could live in his place.

I don't think dying in a war redeems someone, especially given tonnes of other actual innocents got killed too trying to do the same thing.
