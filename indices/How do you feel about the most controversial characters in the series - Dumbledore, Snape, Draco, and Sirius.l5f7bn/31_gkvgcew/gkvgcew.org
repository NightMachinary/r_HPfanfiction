Dumbledore--- Love him and hate him. He's quite the case study on the pitfalls of a utilitarian perspective and how that can lead people to do terrible, terrible things, for “the greater good.” At the same time, he's not some evil cartoon villain we should endlessly demonize or anything. Living as long as he did, and having to do the things he did (defeat and imprison his lover-turned-Dark-Lord, live with the uncertainty of /maybe/ having killed his sister---- while also knowing that either answer wouldn't absolve him of responsibility----, hold some of the greatest power in the world and not be tempted to become the next Dark Lord, etc.) ... it's not an excuse, but I don't think anyone could go through that mentally unscathed. He's flawed and imperfect, but he's not just /evil/ either. He did a lot of good things.

Snape--- there's not really any excuse for his behavior. Everything good that he ever did for Harry was something any teacher or member of the Order would have been obligated to do anyhow--- and he did many of those things pretty poorly anyhow. His endless bullying of a child for the sins of his father (who was also a bully, straight up) and terrible treatment of children in the HPverse all around is inexcusable. Not to mention his entire motivation for turning good was seriously messed up. We all know that if there was a way he could have just whisked off Lily and left her son and husband to get murdered, he would've done so. His being selfishly in (unrequited and infatuative/obsessive) love with Lily doesn't make him a good person. Neither does doing the bare minimum to fulfill a life-debt to Harry (through James) and then mind-raping him (without mercy) and making his school life hell, and going with Dumbledore's plan to sacrifice him, a 17 year old kid, to do the job they couldn't. I don't have a problem with fics that reimagine him as a character entirely, but the ones which just try to excuse his past canon behavior (or explain them away) always just make me uncomfortable. He did /not/ redeem himself in the end, IMO, and just sucked.

Draco--- also a bully and a bigot. But there's potential for change. Under a shit ton of pressure from his parents, brought up in a life that he couldn't comprehend walking away from until it was too late, etc. That said, there's something I think a lot of people don't give enough recognition: even a 12 year old who's grown up learning pureblood bigotry, should not be looking at a situation with multiple Petrified students (one initially presumed dead) and say “I wish I knew who it was, I'd help” or “You'll be next, Mudbloods.” Even a 13 year old Draco Malfoy should not be goading Harry Potter to go after Sirius Black, who was (at that point in canon), Draco's insane and murderous cousin. Even Draco should have felt at least a bit /guilty/ about Katie, even in the midst of his worries about his family, Voldemort, and Dumbledore. And even when he didn't identify Harry in Malfoy Manor, he certainly had no qualms about trying to capture him in the Room of Hidden Things.

Draco Malfoy is a terrible person with little-to-no empathy, period. That's not to say he can't (and didn't) change. But the problem with a lot of fics that put him on a redemption arc with a canon backstory is that they don't always make sense when accounting for these facts. The only thing that ever prompted him to think about changing was an appeal to his selfishness, when shit directly threatened him and his family. And even in the end, if the final battle of Hogwarts had ended with Voldemort winning, he probably would've done the same thing he did in canon--- quietly faded into the background, only caring about himself and his family. Although it's fair to say that he never had anything else to tempt him into being a decent (or even subpar) person by the time he “came to his senses) in the final 2 books, and if he did, we might have gotten to see a /real/, developed redemption arc, as opposed to an incomplete suggestion that he just slinked off out of sight, and went with the flow, going with each side once they had won.

Sirius--- Eh. I'll be honest, I just don't like him. Good friend, but /terrible/ bully. Tbh I think in a world where Sirius had been cleared of his alleged crimes in 3rd year, and become the DADA professor the following year, he probably would have treated any children of Snape's the exact same way Snape treated Harry, if not worse. As for his previous behavior (like trying to get Snape killed by Remus in his 5th year)---There's not really any excuse for the type of hateful spite that can inspire a 15 year old to not only have a classmate (whom he bullied) /murdered/, but have his alleged /friend/ do it, when said friend (Remus) would have spent the rest of his life blaming himself for it, likely driving himself insane, and almost /certainly/ being forced to leave Hogwarts. It's not like he ever felt or showed regret for it either--- calling him /Snivellus/ at every opportunity, and provoking him time and again, and even stating outright in PoA that he “had it coming to him.” He was as much a bigot towards Slytherins as Snape was to Gryffindors. I wouldn't trust him to treat his own child properly if he/she/they were in Slytherin.

Finally, there's the way he treats Harry. I get that he's a bit insane from Azkaban, and never quite got over James and Lily dying, but he still owes it to Harry to not just use him as an extension of James. He's the boy's /godfather/.

When Harry tells him it's too dangerous to visit in Hogsmeade, he insults and guilt-trips Harry by saying he's nothing like James, who would have relished the risk--- that is completely unacceptable, especially given the person Harry is and what he's been through (and his desperate yearning for a connection to his dead parents, since the living family he does have treats him like shit). Harry was being the mature one in this situation, but Sirius provoked his /worst/ impulses. Not to mention, it's ridiculous that Harry /needs/ to be the adult in their relationship--- the kid has quite enough on his shoulders (with no real support system of his own) without this adding to the weight of it all.

I would have preferred to see Harry get close to Remus rather than Sirius. He seems much more deserving of the relationship.
