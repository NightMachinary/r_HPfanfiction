Dumbledore: ineffectual, self-righteous fuckwad who punished the good and rewarded the evil via the actions he took attempting to keep the status quo "for the greater good".

Snape: slimy, petty little creep who took deep pleasure in bullying the absolute shit out of anyone who couldn't fight back. Joined the wizard KKK and acted like the (absolutely correct) social ostracizing and violence against him were anyone's fault but his. Deserved a much worse death.

Draco: bigoted little coward that demanded to be allowed in to daddy's hate group until he realized the cost. So rampantly incompetent he almost gets 2 random people killed bc he didn't understand his actual target. No redeeming qualities. His entire inbred family should have been wiped off the planet.

Sirius: Reckless, half-mad like most of his family, with skewed priorities he never got a chance to grow out of because he was unjustly tossed into a hell prison and left to rot by the society he fought to preserve. Fucked over by his family, fucked over by his friends, fucked over by the justice system, and fucked over by Dumbledore.
