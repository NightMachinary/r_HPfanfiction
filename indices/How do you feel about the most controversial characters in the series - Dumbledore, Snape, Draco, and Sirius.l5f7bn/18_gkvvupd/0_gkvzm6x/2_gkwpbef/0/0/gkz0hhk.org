Regularly!

If Dumbledore allowed lethal spells, more Death Eaters would be dead. No one tried to kill the Death Eaters at the ministry. They're tied up and given to the exact government body that gave them free reign for the last 15 years.

As for worse deaths: Voldemort was absolutely full of vile dark spells. Flay the man alive, use something like petrificus totalus after, and then have him get eaten by the snake. Unable to move and completely aware the entire time.
