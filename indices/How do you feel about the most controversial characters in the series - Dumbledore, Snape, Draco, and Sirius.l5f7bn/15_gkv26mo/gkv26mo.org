Unpopular opinions over here.

Dumbledore: He did what he had to do. That's it.

Draco:

The character of Draco Malfoy has the /potential/ for a redemption arc. I'm talking about- if we were to expand the series and include certain circumstances that could aid the possibility of enough character development to be able to say he /deserves/ the redemption arc.

My thoughts:

Draco had a unsettling upbringing. Raised differently given his blood status, his family, father, imposed beliefs from friends and family, etc.

Even as ambitious and smart as I believe he was, he wasn't one to defy or question what he knew or he thought was right. He admired his father and I think he wanted to BE him. To make him proud and to make the cause proud, out of fear and rejection. He was a bully from the moment he failed at his attempt to befriend Harry; which I'm sure hurt his pride beyond repair.

I don't condone his mistakes or his hatred towards muggleborns. But I do recognized that in his eyes it all was justified.

Pressure came from everywhere, including his house. We all know that there was a big favoritism towards Gryffindor and big stereotypical ideals when it came to Slytherin which was understandable but- they were just kids. We know things would've been different for him if he had had Dumbledore's guidance. But he didn't.

He had Voldemort in his house. He saw things that probably traumatized him in ways that we didn't exactly see--- he lived in fear. Gut wrenching fear that overpowered any intentions of doing the right thing specially bravery.

But remorse was there. Not an arc of redemption but remorse. From the moment he “failed” to recognize Harry at the manor. I think that that's when we saw the first glint of internal conflict.

And then with his task, he might have been a bully for the wrong reasons but he wasn't a killer. And I think that by HBP a lot of his mentality had already changed. (Could've maybe even been thanks to Snape because in his own way he tried to protect him too.) At least, when it came to right and wrong.

I like reading fics where Draco is the main character or the love interest. Mostly because It's so interesting to see how the authors create certain circumstances under which character development would be impossible to avoid.

I like to see how easy it would've been if little things and tiny actions from other people could've changed him for the better in the long run. It's a long shot but theres a lot of complexity to draw from and I haven't witnessed an author that has failed in the attempt to make you see Draco a little tiny bit different.

He made bad decisions but I think that he genuinely believed he never had a choice, after all he wasn't a hero.

Snape:

We all know he is a very complex character. We don't get any insight on what he's thinking, how he feels or why did he do the things he did. We make assumptions, we connect the dots and we all see things differently. Which is why I think when it comes to Snape, a lot of us are divided.

He had a rough childhood. From the start he wasn't “normal”. He met a girl who saw through him. Who understood him. Who liked him. They get into different houses, befriend different people and turn into very different persons something that never phased Snape on his feelings for Lily. I think back then, Slytherin was still very deep into their stereotypes and that is obviously what made him who is and what twisted his opinion on Muggleborns. Even more when Lily chose a guy who had bullied him for fun. James wasn't a bad person but as a kid he definitely influenced Snape just like bullies makes us insecure, unwanted and freaks.

A lot of people say the only reason why he joined Dumbledore was because of guilt. That it was all for Lily. That the remorse he felt was only for choosing to become a death eater for the wrong reasons hence the danger Lily was put in.

We know he always meant to protect her and we know he was torn between the two sides. We know he joined the order and stood by everyone through the way becoming in my opinion: the most successful in his tasks than all of them together. He played a roll that only him, with the best intentions could've fulfilled.

From the moment he saw Harry I do think he felt resentment towards him due to James and the betrayal he had felt from their relationship. But I do think that that feeling was overpowered by the Lily that he saw in him and the protective instincts that came with it.

Snape CHOSE to protect Harry, to risk his life for him and the cause, he chose to follow every order Dumbledore gave him and everything he could do to protect him. I am not by any means condoning the way he treated the trio and everyone in Gryffindor house. I am not condoning the way he most likely scarred Neville. I am not condoning his favoritism for Slytherin.

But I do believe both things were justified in his eyes. He had hated Gryffindor for the way they had treated him and the way the world saw them. Heroes. We know that even though Snape had always cared about Harry, he still saw James traits in him and that resentment led him to treat him the way he did. Slytherin was closer to his believes to his cunning personality and the ones that he was raised with.

But he wasn't a bad person. I don't believe that. He made wrong decisions. He did. But I will always think that deep down he loved Harry and that Lily wasn't the only reason why he did good things and why he protected him.

After everything Harry had gone through with Snape after the image he Snape had created of him in his mind, after all the hatred Harry felt for him at times in a matter of seconds the truth hit him when he saw everything he had done. I can't imagine how WITH TIME Harry truly felt, and how, at the moment, surprised he was or how fast or why his feelings changed and took a giant turn towards Snape ENOUGH that he even named his son after him.

I think that he saw things in Snape that he would want his son to channel. Snape was indeed incredibly brilliant in every sense of the word. And I think that Harry understood everything I said and that led him to forgiveness and admiration above all. I live by this.
