I completely understand. It's just my opinion. Never met anyone who agreed with me, unsurprisingly ofc. Through the years, after reading the books and watching the movies multiple times I started to see it from another perspective based on my own perception. I've given Snape so much thought. I will never agree with Snape slander. But yeah I get it.
