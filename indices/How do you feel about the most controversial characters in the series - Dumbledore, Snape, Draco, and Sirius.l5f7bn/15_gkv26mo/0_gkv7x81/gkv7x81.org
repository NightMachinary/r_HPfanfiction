  We all know that there was a big favoritism towards Gryffindor
#+end_quote

Yeah, like the time the Gryffindor team got state of the art brooms from the Seeker's daddy .....

Or the time an exclusively Gryffindor group got speical privileges and rights to punish other students .....

Or how the Gryffindors repeatedly face no punishment for constant bullying and hexing...

That was all Gryffindor right ?
