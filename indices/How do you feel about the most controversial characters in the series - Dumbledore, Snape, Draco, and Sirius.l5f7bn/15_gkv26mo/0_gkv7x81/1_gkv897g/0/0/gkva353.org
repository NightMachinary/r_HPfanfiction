I would like to think some of them did. But i don't think anybody ever gave them the opportunity to do so without expecting disappointment. I too think it's not as easy as we might think it would be. Their upbringings and ideals was all they knew to be right. And from personal experience I kind of get that. You're right. Maybe they should've made more effort, but I understand why we never got to see that. Slytherins have very different traits and so making that effort would have been a very big big challenge.
