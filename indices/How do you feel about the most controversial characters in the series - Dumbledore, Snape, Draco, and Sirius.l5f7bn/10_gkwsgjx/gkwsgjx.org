I hate snape since he really is a horrible human being. He takes out his frustration on Harry when he was 11 years old because he didn't like his dad. He openly favors and protects the bullies in his house letting them get away with anything. He was obsessed with Lily and was happy to let Voldemort kill the woman he claims to love's husband and child as long as she was alive.

Sirius is flawed greatly. He is the epitome of “if you don't agree with me then your my enemy.” Ultimately I feel like he isn't a bad person, he just never truly had a chance to grow as a person nor did he ever have a chance as a kid to learn morals. It's hard to say about Sirius further than that though because he was in Azkaban for so long and while he said that his knowledge of his innocence let him remain sane, I think it only let him remain partially sane.

Draco was a kid following in his fathers footsteps who idolized his dad. When I was younger, my whole family supported one political party. I agreed with them on a lot of stuff that I don't now simply because back then, it was what I heard from my family and what I grew up around. It's hard to say how willing draco was to take the mark but I think he was well aware of the consequences he'd face for failure. I can't say he's a good person and I hate the fics that make him out to be a good person with no good redemption arc where he realizes he's wrong and tries to change simply because regardless of whether or not he was a kid listening to his dad and was raised like that, he is still ultimately responsible for himself.

Dumbledore is a character that I really do like. He was full of himself as a kid like many geniuses are and constantly hearing his praises being sung didn't help that. Then he met someone as talented as him who agreed with a lot of his beliefs. Over time he began to realize the consequences of what his plans were and distanced himself from them. When he became the chief warlock/supreme mugwump it get like he took up those positions because he didn't want a worse person to be chosen. I've always felt that it's hard to judge him for not being more proactive in the fight against Voldemort and his death eaters because he never wanted power (didn't trust himself with it) and he loved teaching but still tried to do the right thing. He put Harry with the Dursley's and knowing Harry would suffer “many dark years” because of it but at least he would be safe. With so many death eaters managing to bribe their way out of prison how could Dumbledore guarantee Harry's safety otherwise. Not only that but imagine being a kid raised with most people making him a hero with another portion of the population trying to kill him or at least wishing him harm. I don't think Dumbledore knew Harry was a horcrux that long (CoS at the earliest I think). Even if he did plan for Harry to sacrifice his life there's a similar type of thing in another book series. “Yes the knowledge he showed Harry would effect Harry's decision greatly. But is the truth really manipulation. If something is true and a big deal, shouldn't it effect a persons decision?” Because let's face it. As long as Harry was alive, Voldemort would be able to rise again and this time his followers would know it was possible and would spend more effort looking for him.
