Dumbledore fought against his own inner demons, a corrupt and delusional government and "redeemed" death eaters. He did pretty well considering.

Snape is a talented wizard who could have been great but circumstances, bullying and his own bad choices led him down a bad path. If Lily never existed would Snape have been an unrepentant DE? Not sure tbh.

Sirius could have been much better than he was but he got even fewer chances than Snape. Awful family and upbringing, barely had any life as a free adult. I pity him.

Draco is spoiled and indoctrinated, barely able to form a thought that didn't come from his father. He commited several crimes that should have ended with prison time. Not giving Harry up at Malfoy manor is the only decent thing he did. He let DEs into Hogwarts which is worse than anything Snape or Sirius ever did.
