For canon, and please don't blow up me. If you want to debate, I'll debate. Just calmly, yeah?

Dumbledore: I don't like how manipulative of Harry he is, and I will never forgive him for putting Harry with the Dursleys. I think he genuinely wants to defeat Voldemort and win the war. But I also think he believes strongly in the 'for the greater good'. He put Harry in an abusive household 'for the greater good'.

Snape: I trust him not to be evil. That's about it. He bullied teenagers, his students.

Draco: He was 16 when Voldemort told him to kill Dumbledore or else he's kill Draco and his parents. Then Harry used Sectumsempra(which translates to 'to cut forever' or something to that tune) on him that same year, which basically ripped him apart. 17 when he almost died in the Fiendfyre, his friend Crabbe died in the Fiendfyre. I think he's just as much a victim of the war as anyone else. I also think he didn't have any choices; take the mark or die; kill Dumbledore or die.

Sirius: He grew up. Mostly. He genuinely cares for Harry, which I think is probably the most important. I also can't help but pity him.
