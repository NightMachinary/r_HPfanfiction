Dumbledore - overworked by all the posts he hold, means well but can be patronizing (understandable when he's Dumbledore). Too soft to be a war leader as an old man but took up the mantle because he was the most capable.

Snape - unpleasant, awkward child from a bad home with bigoted beliefs grow up to be a spiteful, jealous, bullying, bigoted teenager grow up to join a genocidal group grow up to be a spiteful, jealous, bullying adult that hate and work against the leader of said genocidal group because the woman he wanted to fuck as a teenager died.

He absolutely deserved what happened to him in SWM. Not condoning any hypothetical bullying the Marauders did to him before that scene but by then Snape was hanging out with future death eaters and throwing around slurs. It's ok to take Nazis down a peg or two. I personally wouldn't do what James did but I'd be in the crowd of laughing people.

He actively chose to become a death eater. I refuse to believe the whole he was pressured by his house shit that Snape fans like to peddle. Lily singled out Mulciber and Avery and didn't say "you are always hanging with Slytherins". Even if Slytherin house was full of bigots there are degrees to bigotry. There is your aunt who believes affirmative action is stupid and clutches her purse tighter when she sees a black person. There are the fuckers that post "Well actually, if you look at the crime statistics" on the internet. Then, there are crazy people who believe black people are lower than animals (This is what Death Eaters are).

Sirius - Reckless, hot-headed, arrogant, slightly cruel teenager that tried very hard to distance himself from the bigoted beliefs he grew up with as a child. Very broken adult.

Draco - spoilt, bigoted, cowardly, arrogant child that never grew up. Has delusions of grandeur.
