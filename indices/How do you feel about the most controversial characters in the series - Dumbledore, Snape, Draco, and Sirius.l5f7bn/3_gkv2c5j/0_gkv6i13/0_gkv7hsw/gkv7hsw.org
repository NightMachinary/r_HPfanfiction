All of them are interesting characters (Draco less so). I think Rowling gave snape and Draco a forced redemption that was completely undeserved.

Probably wouldn't be friends with any of them except maybe Dumbledore. Would not fight for any side he's leading in a war though. Don't want to be sacrificed to save snape's status as a spy.
