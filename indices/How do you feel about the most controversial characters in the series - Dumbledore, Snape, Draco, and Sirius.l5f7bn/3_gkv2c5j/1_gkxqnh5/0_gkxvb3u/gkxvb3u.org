Going to ignore your spiel about affirmative action because it's completely irrelevant.

And no you don't become like the nazis by treating nazis as monsters. That's such a load of "both sides" bullshit. We need to treat the nazis like the monsters they are or else they will take every opportunity to spread their ideology and further their agenda. You can't be tolerant of an intolerant group. Imagine blaming opposition to nazis as the reason for people becoming nazis.

And there's no proof that the Marauders' bullying led Snape to be bigoted or Marauders' bullying of Mulciber and Avery led Snape to group up with them. Snape already held bigoted beliefs before he even started Hogwarts and actively sought out people who shared his ideology. I've already said even in Slytherin (where he apparently didn't have the opportunity to socialize with decent people) he could have befriended the milder bigots instead of the most violent ones. It's about taking personal responsibility for his actions. Not all bullied children joined genocidal cults. *Don't join genocidal cults just because you had a shitty childhood - it's not a high bar to clear.*

And sure, Lily was the light of Snape's life but his love for her was more sexual than pure. If his love was pure as you claim, he would have abandoned the ideology and people that considered her unworthy of existence. If as you said treating nazis with kindess worked then why the hell didn't Snape turn away from death eater ideology even though Lily remained his friend and was kind to Snape even when Snape hadn't deserve it for a while.

I don't care to argue about what happened between Snape and James Potter before fifth year because it's all headcanon. The only two scenes we saw them interact were 11 year old James trash talking Slytherin and Snape insulting James and his dad. And SWM. Surely, you can't claim that trash talk is enough to make a person join up with the death eaters. If that's true all the Russell Westbrook fans I talk shit to online would be lining up to join the KKK.

(Don't make this about me being biased against Slytherin just because I tolerate trash talk against Slytherins either. It's trash talk not purity motivated hatred. Just grow thicker skin. I took the Pottermore quiz way back and got Slytherin. Not my fault, Rowling couldn't write good Slytherins for shit and a bunch of Slytherins ended up identifying with fucking Snape of all people).

By the time of SWM, Snape was already a monster. He held bigoted beliefs and was not afraid of voicing them. And a few years later, he willingly joined a group whose goal was to eliminate/oppress a subset of people. He presented himself as an unpleasant bigoted hateful individual and therefore shouldn't be surprised when people treat him as the unpleasant bigoted hateful individual that he is.
