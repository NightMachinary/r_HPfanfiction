I feel bad for being a Hufflepuff stereotype but I have a hard time actively disliking any of them--- Sirius is my favorite character, actually. Snape is definitely a horrible person, I'm well aware, but reading fanfiction where he isn't as much (and isn't that what fanfiction is for? Changing the original series?) is something I like to do on occasion. My opinion of Draco is, of course, terribly biased by fandom perceptions of the character (he's alright, but wowheiwgwiw do drarry writers write good fanfiction). And Dumbledore has, of course, made many many many mistakes but I have a hard time reading fanfiction where he is outright just a bad person. Like, misinformed and an idiot and willing to acknowledge his mistakes I can read easily, but otherwise... I don't know.

TLDR; I'm a sucker and I can't bring myself to truly hate any character (except a certain fifth year DADA teacher...), even though I know their flaws
