- Dumbledore is badly misunderstood by large swathes of the fandom.
- Snape is functionally irredeemable, didn't become a Death Eater on a whim and is ultimately redeemed entirely because he died but, for some reason, the fandom fixates on how bad a teacher he is (that's like the least wrong thing with him)
- Draco was a racist tosspot but he never really wanted to be a murderer and his characterisation in HBP is a redemption arc, it's just that redemption for Draco means "we feel sorry for/can understand him". There is no way that a canon esque Draco could be friends with canon esque Harry or Hermione (or Ron, but that doesn't seem to be a Thing people want).
- Sirius and James would be called "evil" if they were real people, the werewolf stunt is unforgivable and I don't understand where the playboy Sirius trope comes from. Like, I don't think Wolfstar makes any kind of sense at all (see: the werewolf stunt) but I know where it comes from. That being said, I really don't think Rowling was fully conscious of exactly how much worse Sirius and James were than Fred and George. OTOH, he does do 12 years in Azkaban and the Sirius we actually meet is somewhat tortured and sympathetic... tragic, even.
