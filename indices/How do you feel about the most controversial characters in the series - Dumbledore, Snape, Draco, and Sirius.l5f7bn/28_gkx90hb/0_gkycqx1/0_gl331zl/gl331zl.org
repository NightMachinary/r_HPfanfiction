I agree with that, and also I really don't like how the fact that if the "prank" would be successful and Snape ended up dead, Remus would also be probably killed or imptisoned is downplayed. Like, he not only tried to kill his school rival, but also used his friend as a murder weapon. There are no amounts of stupidity that would excuse this for me
