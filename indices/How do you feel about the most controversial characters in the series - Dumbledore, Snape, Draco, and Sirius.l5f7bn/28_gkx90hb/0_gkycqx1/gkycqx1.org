Yeah. JKR underestimate how badly James and Sirius pranks were.

The first one, we have to remember the book was written in the 90s. At the time "showing other people underwear" was considered mean but not overly cruel and far from sexual assault. It was The prank use in media to show an assolish character that we could love.

It aged like milk.

As for the werewolves stunt. I do believe that JKR wanted us to think both Sirius and Snape are equally to blame. Sirius for giving the info to Snape out of frustration and annoyance, and Snape for trying to spy on the marauders, Lupin especially, and trying to get them in trouble.

Without Sirius lack of forethought and Snape desire to get Remus into trouble, nothing would have happen here.

However, i think she didn't do a good enough job showing how Snape wasn't a defenseless victim and it wasn't one-sided. And also that Sirius was stupid reckless that didn't think of the consequences instead of the wanabee murderer Snape thought he was.
