I think when you look at some of the lines he said to Harry, you can see that Sirius always /wanted/ to be better, and sometimes struggled when he was confronted with somebody like Snape.

Just a few:

"We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are."

"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."

"The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters."

"Well, bad times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others."

Sometimes he didn't live up to the ideal, but I think he was a good person who struggled with his own demons and didn't always win.
