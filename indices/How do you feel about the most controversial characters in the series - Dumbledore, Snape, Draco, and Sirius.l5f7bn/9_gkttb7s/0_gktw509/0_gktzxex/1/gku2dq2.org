Kind of a big jump to make about Sirius' character, isn't it? To assume that he wasn't as bad towards children like Snape was only because he didn't get the chance to be around many children?

It's not hard to be nice towards children. Sirius was able to show kindness and praise to Harry Ron and Hermione and appreciate and recognize their efforts after being locked up in Azkaban for 12 years - away from all kids AND adults. Snape couldn't even be civil towards kids despite being around hundreds of them for 12 years.
