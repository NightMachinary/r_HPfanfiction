"Criticizing" doesn't mean "bullying" though. Oh, don't get me wrong, he was very much cruel to Harry, his friends, and Longbottom especially. But the quote you mentioned doesn't really imply that he was being cruel to anyone at that moment. Is there any concrete evidence that he targeted Slytherins with his more cruel acts? I don't really have the books handy here, so I can't really check myself. Sorry.
