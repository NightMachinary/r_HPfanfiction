This edit didn't make it better.

The actual line is "you're less like your father than I thought." Which, while mean, tells us he saw a difference between the two.

And narration tells us Snape criticized everyone except Draco the 1st potions class. Irrelevant, but I was always under the impression that while he let Slytherins get away with everything he wasn't particularly fond of anyone except Draco.
