I don't disagree with you on it being inexcusable behaviour from a teacher, I'd have fired him in a heartbeat if I was the one responsible for his job. I'm just saying that I don't really think Sirius was any better. I think the only reason we don't see Sirius be as bad as Snape at his worst is because he was surrounded by like-minded individuals. I think Snape would have behaved similarly if stuck in a situation with a group of Slytherins. Both Sirius and Snape is still taking potshots at each other constantly while in the same room with each other, which is a major sign of a lack of maturity on both parts. I don't think either of them had the moral high ground at those moments.
