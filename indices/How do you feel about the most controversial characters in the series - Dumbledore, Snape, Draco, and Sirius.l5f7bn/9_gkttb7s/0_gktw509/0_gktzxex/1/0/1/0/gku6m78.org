My point was this: you used Sirius' behaviour towards Harry and his friends as a counterpoint to my remark on how I doubt Sirius would treat Slytherin children any better than how Snape treats non-Slytherins. Basically, what I'm saying is; of course he was nice to Harry and his friends, since Harry is his godson, and the others are friends of Harry. I compared this to how Snape wasn't cruel to Slytherins, which I see as the same thing really, just opposing sides.

(I edited the post because the first point I mentioned detracted from the main point I was trying to make, which made the post needlessly vague as a response. Sorry about that)
