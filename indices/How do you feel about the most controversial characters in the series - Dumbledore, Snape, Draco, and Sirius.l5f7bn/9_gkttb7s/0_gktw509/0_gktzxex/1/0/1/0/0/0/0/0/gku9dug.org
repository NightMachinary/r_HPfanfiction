3 things:

1. His past as a tormentor to Snape. This is a minor point, but not a good start.
2. His utter lack of remorse for the incidents he caused Snape in the past (in particular, the werewolf prank). I don't remember the exact lines in the PoA scene in the shack, but IIRC he basically says something along the lines of "Snape was always sticking his nose where it didn't belong".
3. The fact that he's still harassing Snape whenever they're in the same room together. Why would he behave any better towards Slytherin children if he can't even behave in a civil manner towards someone working together with him on the same side in a war?
