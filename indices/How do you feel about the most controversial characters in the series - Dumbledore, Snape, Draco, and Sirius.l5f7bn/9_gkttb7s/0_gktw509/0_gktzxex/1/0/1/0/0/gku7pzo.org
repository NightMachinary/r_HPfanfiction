Okay I get what you mean now, but I still don't agree. Sirius may not have liked the Slytherins, sure. We know he has resentment towards that house because of his own family and the abuse he dealed with for not seeing eye to eye with them.

Even then, he would not be as bad as Snape because Snape hated everyone who wasn't a Slytherin for no reason. He favoured the Slytherins, yes, because it was his own house, I'm sure other Heads favoured their own houses too. The difference is, Snape treated his favoured house with some civility. Everyone else he treated like trash and bullied and humiliated for no reason except that he didn't like them. No matter what you say, this type of behaviour from a teacher is inexcusable.
