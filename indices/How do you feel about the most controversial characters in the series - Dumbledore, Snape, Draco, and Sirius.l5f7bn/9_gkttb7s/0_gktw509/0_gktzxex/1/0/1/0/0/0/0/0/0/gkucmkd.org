  The fact that he's still harassing Snape
#+end_quote

In OotP, while Sirius aggressively asks Snape why Dumbledore can't teach Harry, it's Snape who takes the first jab : "I'm rather in a hurry Black...unlike you I don't have unlimited leisure time."

Sirius threatens him with "if you give Harry a hard time, you'll have to answer to me"

Then Snape takes the 2nd with a shot at both James and Harry's "arrogance."
