Okay since you changed your reply, I'll reply to this too. Sirius is nice to everyone who isn't an asshole to him. He's nice to Hermione and Ron too, he's nice to all the Weasleys as well because he knows how to act as a human despite being locked away for so long. We only see him being nice to the people he knows because they're the only ones we saw him interact with (he wasn't allowed to be seen). If he interacted with more people, he would have treated them better than Snape still.

Not sure what point you're trying to make by making the second comment about Sirius. Yes he lived in isolation and was trying to live vicariously through Harry as a coping mechanism, Hermione already said this in the books. What does this have to do with Snape?
