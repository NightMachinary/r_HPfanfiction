All I'm getting from this is he hates Snape, not that he hates children. Also we don't know that he wasn't remorseful of the werewolf prank because that line from PoA “Snape was always sticking his nose where it didn't belong” isn't exclusively about that. Snape was constantly trying to nose into their business with hopes of getting them expelled.
