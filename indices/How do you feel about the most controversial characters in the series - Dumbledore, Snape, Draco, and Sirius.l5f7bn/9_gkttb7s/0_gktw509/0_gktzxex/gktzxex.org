His constant sniping at Snape implies that he didn't really mature though, and I get the impression that the biggest reason he wasn't as bad as Snape towards children was mostly a result of not really being close to them. How would he have treated Slytherins as a teacher?

That being said, I think canon events was harsh enough on him as-is though, he deserved way better than being thrown into Hell on Earth for over a decade. He never really got to become his own person in the end. I don't like him, probably because I read a lot of Snape fics and like ones where he becomes a better person during Marauder-era, a time where Sirius was very much a jack-ass and bully. But he deserved better.
