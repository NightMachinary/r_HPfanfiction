Dumbledore- not infallible but not stupid, also kind of annoying

Snape- nice goth aesthetic, bullied children and wasn't sexy

Draco- gay and funny and Complex uwu in terms of fictional character, but if he was real I'd send him flying because he's a little tori

Sirius- nice rebel aesthetic, bullied children but was sexy :(
