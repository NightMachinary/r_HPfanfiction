Dumbledore: I've said before and will say again and again 'til the day I die: most of the reasons people hate and bash him are a result of people applying Watsonion logic to questions whose Doyalist answers are all either "because otherwise there wouldn't be a story," "it makes for better pacing," or "Rowling just kinda wanted it that way."

Why couldn't he figure out that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk? Because CoS is firmly a children's adventure story, so the children have to be the ones doing the bulk of the work. Why doesn't he tell Harry everything he knows about Voldemort all at once in HBP? Because it's a mystery that's meant to be gradually unraveled, and most people don't enjoy having a story stop dead so the author can exposit the entire backstory all at once. Why does he dump Harry on his abusive relatives? Because the story was about an abused boy, so /somebody/ had to leave the kid with abusers.

The first three books were mostly just whimsical fairy tales, and things like the Dursleys' abuse weren't /meant/ to be taken seriously, which is fine in that context, and decidedly /not/ fine when it becomes an increasingly grim and gritty war drama, where actions have consequences and child abuse matters. People judge the actions that Dumbledore took to facilitate the fairy tale that Harry Potter initially was by the standards of the surprisingly dark coming of age story it became, and while I understand why, I can't pretend I don't find it /very/ tiresome.

Snape: I'm pretty sure this is a controversial take, but I honestly think that Snape is irredeemable trash /not/ because of his history as a Death Eater, but because of how he spent his life after defecting: he was a lonely child who was radicalised and subsequently joined a hate group/murder cult. Obviously, /nothing/ excuses joining up with a terrorist group that hunts people for sport, and he is entirely responsible for his doing so, but I can genuinely sympathise with the suffering that led to his doing so. Relaying the prophecy to Voldemort, not caring in the slightest that he's endangered a literal infant in doing so, attempting to barter for the life of a woman he claims to love with the lives of her husband and son, wallowing in self pity after her death, and abusing her son while acting as though he's worse off for her death than said son utterly destroys that sympathy, though.

Malfoy: I don't remotely understand why the fandom finds him compelling, or at least sympathetic: he's a bigoted and cruel bully who bandies about his inherited power with impunity until Voldemort comes along to inform him that there are people who are outside the scope of that power and unwilling to put up with his shit. The only thing that keeps him from being a completely one note wannabe villain is the fact that he's not willing to personally and directly inflict violence on others. I honestly think his breakdown in HBP is more cathartic than tragic.

Sirius: he's a much better exploration of a "dubious good guy" than Snape, /do not @ me./ Like Snape, he's an abuser with a checkered past, but unlike Snape, I can call him a decent human being without willfully ignoring 95% of his screentime, and the retroactive exploration of just how awful he was to Kreacher in OotP and DH, for my money, is way more effective, simply because Sirius' hatred of Kreacher stems from the latter's words and actions (not that it excuses Sirius abusing his slave), not from an unrelated grudge (against a man who bullied him in high school but who also saved his life) which you'd think would've been satisfied by indirect murder.
