Here we go.

These descriptions are all for canon, and I do like other versions of them.

Dumbledore: One of the world's most powerful wizards. He isn't infallible and drops the ball sometimes. I do like a good manipulative!Dumbledore though.

Snape: An unrepentant bully.

Draco: A spoiled brat. He ended up in Slytherin due to process of elimination: he's not brave enough for Gryffindor, not hardworking enough for Hufflepuff, too stupid for Ravenclaw. He's not that cunning, either, but he is ambitious.

Sirius: He was a bully who eventually grew out of it. Mostly.
