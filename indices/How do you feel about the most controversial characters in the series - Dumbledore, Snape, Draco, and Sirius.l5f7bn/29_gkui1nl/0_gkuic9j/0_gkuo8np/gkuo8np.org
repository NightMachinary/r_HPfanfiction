Because book Dumbledore was a quiet mentor that was calm above all else, while movie Dumbledore spent half the time screaming about things and generally looking frazzled.

Snape was clearly the bad guy the entire freaking time, but he never actually had any useful info for anyone on either side. He was just a waste of his potential all around.

Draco deserved to be killed due to his stupidity as of book one, I'm shocked he didn't get himself killed in any number of ways, and the fact he survived was a cop out.

And Sirius played the role of an innocent man that just survived a torturous hell hole quite well. He was haunted and then killed before he really recovered, and played a key role in showing Harry what war was like. I wish more people had died, on both sides. I wish one of the older muggleborn had brought a gun to school so we'd get to see a basic shield stop bullets. I wish the light people had stopped holding back and started actually killing people, but no.

It wasn't a war we got to watch; it was an unrealistic loss for the people that were killing their enemies while being knocked out. The good guys won only because the bad guys were stupid and WoG and the plot said they were going to.
