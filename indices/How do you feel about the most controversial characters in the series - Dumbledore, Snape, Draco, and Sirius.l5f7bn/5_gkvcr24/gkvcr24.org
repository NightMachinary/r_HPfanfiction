Dumbledore - not evil. He's an imperfect man in a shit situation trying to save as many lives as possible. He was manipulative, but for a very good reason, and you know what? In the end, it all worked out.

Draco - repulsive neo-nazi asshole. Irl this kid would be a school shooter, or otherwise a far-right goon.

Snape - same as Draco but with the added incel touch. He helped save the world, true, but his motivations and personality--all wrong.

Sirius - a rebel at heart, very impulsive & brash, kinda dug his own grave. A tragic character through and through that if HP were targeted to adults instead of kids, would have been the main character.
