In some way, I detest Dumbledore. I'm so used to Dumbledore-bashing that it's uncomfortable for me when he's a good person.

I like Snape's sarcasm. He's clever. Of course, he's also a git and I don't like how canon Snape treats Harry. I like fics where they're both in good terms and are friends (or family).

Same thing with Draco... He's obviously a spoiled brat in canon, but I understand his character. He was basically alone and was forced to do something he wasn't comfortable with. I love fics where he's Harry's best friend and they're both Slytherins.

Now... My favorite character in the whole HP world (after Harry of course) is Sirius. I don't know why, but I love him. I'm in particular attracted to fics where he manages to be Harry's father and he doesn't die. His death is what I hate the most in the whole saga... It's just soooo sad! Also, I'm not particularly fond of how JK described him in the story. I kinda wish he had been treated better... But no, he was locked up in Azkaban for 12 years for something he didn't do, subjected to his worst memories and if that wasn't enough, he was forced to stay in a house where he was abused as a kid and later on, was treated as garbage by strangers of the Order of Fried Chicken ðŸ™ŠðŸ˜‚
