[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble]] Heroes Assemble - Stargon1 This fic is still a WIP and being updated every other week I believe, BUT it already has 128 decently long chapters and follows the MCU storyline very well. 10/10 recommended

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10867705/1/Starborn-Caf%C3%A9][https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10867705/1/Starborn-Caf√©]] Starborn Cafe - Missyuki1990 This is complete with a complete sequel as well. It's a slow at first, but definitely worth the read, especially once you get to the second half and the sequel.

Both fics are also posted in AO3 if you prefer that platform
