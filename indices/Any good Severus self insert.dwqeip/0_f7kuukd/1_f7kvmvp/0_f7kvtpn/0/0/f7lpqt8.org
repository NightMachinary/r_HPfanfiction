I'm not saying that you have to stick to his life because fate or such silliness.

It depends on /when/ you end up SS-wise. Before first year? Sure, you can do basically everything you said (but you still have to contend with Tobias...). But if you end up in, say, fourth year? The Marauders aren't just going to... stop. Seventh year or beyond and you're pretty much ingrained with the Death Eaters -- it's not like you can easily back out of it given that at this point, /nobody/ cares about you, and trying to get out will just make people suspicious ("are you trying to spy?").
