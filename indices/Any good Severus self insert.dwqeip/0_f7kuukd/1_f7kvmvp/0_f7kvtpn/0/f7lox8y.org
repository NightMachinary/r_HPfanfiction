Well the wish fulfillment could come from the SI getting themselves out of snape's abusive home life by telling cops and stuff, and then when they go to hogwarts they can try to stay friendly with james and stuff to stop the bullying from even happening, and then later the SI can just ignore joining voldemort because they probably got put into a different house anyways, and no sane normal person put into the harry potter world would choose to join him.

A totally different real world soul and mind put into snape's body wouldnt' HAVE TO stick to snape's canon life. I don't get why anyone WOULD. I'd change a million things instantly because it's my life now. Unless you want to go with that fanon concept of fate being immutable and stuff will happen anyway. But that's dumb and I hate that. I love free will and choices. It always seems like an excuse for canon railroading anyway because they can't think of anything good on their own.

There is lots of stuff a person could do to change things for themselves.
