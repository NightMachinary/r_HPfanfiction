I've only seen a single Snape SI. Its endgame seems to be harem, and it's also very much dead. Yeah, I realize this isn't what you wanted, but I think there simply isn't any other Snape SIs. linkffn(The Halfblood Emperor)

And who would blame writers? Who would /want/ to inherit his life? I mean, the only bright point of it seems to be a friendship with Lily... Poor halfblood in an abusive home in an ostracized house targeted by bullying from the most popular kids in school, then a membership in Wizarding Nazis followed by being a teacher who everyone hates. He's playing life on hardmode.

Allthough now I kinda want to see a fic starting off like typical SIs do -- "man I wish Hogwarts was real". Only to be inserted into the bundle of sunshine that is Snape's life. Be careful what you wish for and all that.
