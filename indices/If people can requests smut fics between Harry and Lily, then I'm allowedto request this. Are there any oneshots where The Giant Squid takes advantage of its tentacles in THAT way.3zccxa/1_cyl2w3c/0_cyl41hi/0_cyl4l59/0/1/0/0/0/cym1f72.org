... Yeah I know Feb. is shorter and of course Jan. is for this year. I may be pretty, but I'm smart too.

It's shorter by a whopping 10%, which for page views is still almost 10% lower than what would account for the discrepancy between it and the next lowest month, another 5% lower than the average of the next four months, and /another/ 15% lower than the average of the other 10 whole months. It's just curious that's all.

Obviously the break bump is the main contributing factor as far as uniques go, but even that doesn't really account for the massive increase. I dunno, I blame the mods. I wonder if the bot is adding to those numbers... the pageview/unique went from ~7.2 from March to June up to ~9.2 from July to December.
