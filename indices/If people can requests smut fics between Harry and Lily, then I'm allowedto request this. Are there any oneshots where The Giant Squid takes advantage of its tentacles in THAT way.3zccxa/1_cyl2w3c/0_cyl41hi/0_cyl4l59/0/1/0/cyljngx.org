Thanks!

That looks about how I thought it would, though the first half of the year is oddly low. It's too bad that it doesn't break that down into people without accounts, how accounts participated (vote only, comment only, submit only), and live subs. Those are the stats I'm really interested in. I say we should have The Blackout 2: Electric Boogaloo until we get it.
