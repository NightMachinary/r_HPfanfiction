February is obviously a shorter month and January is only counted for this year, not last year. That being said, it seems to spike a bit in July and August, which is when most students (high school and college) would have a break. December is usually about half break, half school, giving a bit of a boost. (That's pulled out of my ass, but it makes some sense, I think)
