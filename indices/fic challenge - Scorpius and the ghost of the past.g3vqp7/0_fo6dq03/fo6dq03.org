Part 1 chapter 1

January of 2024.

The sun beats down on all that it can. On the hot dirt roads, on the many stalls and vender stands, on the musicians that are trying to hide under the shade of a palm tree, it's hot, hot, hot.

The smell of spices and incense fill the air and the sounds of the musicians, many people and the occasional camel grunts and moped growls form a mix of noise that assaults the ears.

Two men walk down a dirt road as the wind blows the sand and dirt around them.

“crappy place this is.” A middle-aged American man says wiping some sand from his forehead with the back of his hand.

“Well this is where she said to meet the man who has them, isn't it?” says a British man about his mid 40's or so. “Yes yes.” Says the American man sounding annoyed, “I just don't know why we had to come to the middle of the god damn desert of all places.”

“If the UK or American ministry catches us then we're sunk.” The British man says exasperatedly, “as it is we're lucky she was able to get me out of Azkaban in the first place.”

“yes now where's Ahmad?” the American man says sounding annoyed again.

“Over there!” the British man says pointing to a small stall under a palm tree on the North side of the square.

The two head over to the stall, meandering through the many people crouded about around the various stalls.

They come across an old Arab man under the palm tree playing with what looks like a round piece for a necklace with a clock face.

“Theodore and Benjamin!” the man says with a heavy Syrian accent, “Glad you make it!”

“Hello Ahmad.” Theodore, the British man says kindly, “sorry about the delay.”

“It no problem” Ahmad says, “you come here at just the right time.” The old man then grabs Theodore's hand and presses the round object into it. “Happy to see you again, but I'm afraid this is the last one. I have for now.”

“Thanks.” Theodore says, “will you have more soon?”

“My friend.” Ahmad says, “You know I will, it is my invention after all. I've been doing this for 136 year and I never fail.”

“So I see.” Benjamin says, “So why is this your last one?”

“They take a while to make.” Ahmad says, “time turners are precise magic, and must always be used with great care. For when you have the power to change time, you have power to change the world, and that not always a good thing my friend.”

“We'll remember that, thanks Ahmad.” Theodore says.

“Come again my friend.” Ahmad says.Ben walks off as Theodore makes like he is following him.

Suddenly, Theodore pulls out his wand, “Obli...”

“Expelliarmus!”

The wand flies out of Theodore's hand and lands in Ahmad's left hand.

He laughs, “ha ha ha ha, you try that trick on me? “ he then throws Theodore's want back at him and then gets up and walks off, before he is out of site however, he says, “You should have learned last time Nott, I have 175 years on you. I know all tricks your kind do as well.” With that, Ahmad then apparates away with a loud crack.

“Why did you try to do that again?” Benjamin asks angrily, “That's what got you cought last time!”

“Just a precaution, benny, I do wish you'd stop being such a worrying weasel.”

“Do you want that Potter to catch us again?” Ben asks angrily.

“We're not even in the UK, so he has...”

“We weren't in the UK when he cought us last time, we were here, in this hell whole!” Ben says angrily as they continue walking.

Suddenly a large golden wasp like creature appears in front of them, it appears to be fluid but shiny.

“Return to England and meet me you know where, there's a port key near where the band plays, you'll recognize it!” the creature says in a British female's voice, “I'm counting on you.” With that, the large wasp disintegrates leaving a bunch of mist behind it, which looks yellowish as the blowing sand mingls with the tiny droplets.

“that's her.” Theodore says, “Let's go.”

The two walk off towards the small group of musicians who's instruments magically play themselves.

A man on a moped drives by, and a wizard runs up and uses his wand to lift the man off his small motorized bike, then lets him back on.

“Are they mad?” Theodore asks.

“Bathsheba doesn't recognize the statute of secrecy.” Ben replies, “filthy muggle dunghole.”

“oh never mind them let's find our portkey before I end up with the whole god damn desert in my hair.” Theodore says,
