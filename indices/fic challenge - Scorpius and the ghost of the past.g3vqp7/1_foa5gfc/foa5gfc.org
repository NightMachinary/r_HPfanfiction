Chapter 2:

June 2024

In the great hall of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall and the teachers are at the head of the hall while the 4 house tables have many students sitting eager to await the speech. At the Slytherin table, two boys sit next to each other, with one fiddling with his hands as he looks around the hall. A couple seats down is a tall thin girl with odd looking hands tapping her fingers nervously as she awaits the announcements too, though she is glairing at a teacher sitting on the far left hand side of the staff table.

“Can I have your attention?” Mcgonagall says. The students fall silent quickly due to eagerness. “Alright. So, here we are! Another year has come to pass, and I hope you've all learned so much! For some of you, this is your last, and for others, you have still more to come. Regardless, I know that you have all made great friends, and hopefully have learned valuable lessons during your term here at Hogwarts! “ Mcgonagall then looks stern, “it has come to my attention that some people have been spreading rumors about a student at our school, and I would like to encourage you not to act on this rumor. I will not name the student to whom the rumor concerns, but I will warn you all against blind belief, especially in regards to sensitive topics such as loss. I hope that Hogwarts students are above such immoral acts as to judge other students based on rumors and gossip, especially those graduating this year.” Mcgonagall then relaxes her face into a happier expression. “Now, with that out of the way, I think some final house points are in order. With 220 points, we have hufflepuff house. Remember, last place does not mean loss, but rather it just means a chance to learn more and do better next time. However, 220 points is an impressive number, especially for 4th place. In 3rd, we have Gryffindor house with 250 points. These students have shown their bravery and their skill with relative ease and willingngness to help others in times of need. In second, we have Ravenclaw house with 285 points. Their wisdom, thirst for knowledge and their ability to strategize and improvise is admirable, to say the least. I also want to acknowledge a phraise that a student said to me at the beginning of the year. It's not just the knowledge that counts, but rather it's how you use your knowledge that also counts. Wise words indeed. Finally, with 310 points, we have a house that has undergone a great evolution. A house that for ages has been seen as a place for only those who had a certain lineage, and those not of that lineage were lesser than. The students of this house have shown that cunning, ambition and strength do not come from one's lineage, but rather one's own person, and that negative beliefs and sentiments tought for generations can be broken. I'm proud to award the house cup to... Slytherin house!”

The hall erupts in a big cheer as Mcgonagall waves her wand and a flurry of green and silver decorates the hall with a painted snake slithering around the banners.

“WE DID IT AL!” Scorpius shouts as everyone stands up and high-fives, hugs or shakes each other's hands.

The girl a couple seats down has tears flowing down her face and a huge smile as she screams with pure joy.

“Well Father, we did it.” she whispers to herself.

A few minutes later, the graduating students all walk out on to the sweeping lawns next to the lake and sit downin chairs that had suddenly appeared there. Scorpius and Albus sit together, and the tall girl with the odd-looking hands sits next to them.

“Hello!” she says with a heavy Manchester accent.

“Hey Heather!” Scorpius says.

“Quite the year wasn't it?” Albus says high-fiving Heather.

“yeah it was!” Scorpius says, “I thought I'd get chewed out for not handing in that assignment for Longbottom but I didn't!”

Mcgonagall then comes out on to the lawn and all the 7th years fall silent.

Mcgonnagal then waves her wand and another rrow of chairs revealed to show all the family members of the graduating students sitting and beaming, laughing and in general elated for their sons, daughters, siblings and friends.

“When I call out your name, please come up to the front, and you'll see what happens. Rowen Anthony, of Gryffindor!”

A tall young man walks up from a back row to the podium and he is suddenly enveloped in golden light that forms into a broomstick shape with Rowen sitting on it as if flying. The light broom then becomes an actual fancy new broomstick with the words “ultra firebolt” in firey red and yellow letters.

Various students are called up, and when they are, the golden light becomes a gift that is related to the skill they best developed over the course of their time at the school. Some get fancy caldrons with hieroglyph-style writing on them, others get ultra firebolt broomsticks, others get random objects, and others still get golden telescopes or charmed objects.

“Heather Gaunt, from Slytherin.” McGonagall says.

The tall girl next to Scorpius gets up nervously, and walks to the podium and is enveloped in light. The light then becomes a gigantic snake in the shape of a g, then the gigantic snake becomes a green and silver translucent pendant with a small heart at the tale of the G.

“ms. Gaunt, this shows how you constantly strived to show the world that while your family has a past, that you are not that past. The heart is the kindness you have shown people and the willingness to love even those who have made fun of you in the past. I can safely say that you will be a great witch and an even better Gaunt.”

Several other students go up and receive their symbolic gifts, some objects they can use and others objects that best represent them.

“Scorpius Malfoy, of Slytherin!” mcgonagall says.

Scorpius walks up to the podium and feels a sensation of warmpth as the golden light envelopes him, and he steps out with a green and silver clock-shaped pendant with an S and a scorpion with a heart on its chest with the letter A inside the heart.

“This represents how you have been able to show not just Slytherin house but also all of Hogwarts that the greatest gift one can have is love, even when they are faced with judgement and loneliness from others. It also represents how you helped to ensure that time would always remain on the side of good, even if that meant sacrifice and loss.“

After several other students.

“Albus Potter, of Slytherin.”

Albus walks up and after being enveloped in the golden light, a bracelet appears on his right arm with a lightning bolt shape, the Slytherin snake in silver and green, and various shapes on the band.

“this shows your quick whit, your kindness and your refusal to cave even when judge by peers. I know that all of us are proud of all you have done. I also want to thank you for showing us that while we may not always be fond of past memories, that we can learn from them and that time will always lead us to the right path.”

After the rest of the students are given their gifts, they all gather at the lake where the boats they once arrived in, now somewhat larger are lined up.

“I'm proud of you Al!” Harry says as he helps Albus on to the boat.

Scorpius sees his father coming up to him.

“I know it's ockword.” Draco says, then he hugs his son, then shakes his hand and high-fives him, “Your mother would be so proud! And I'm proud too!”

“She said that Slytherin is evolving!” Scorpius says.

“Of course it is.” Draco says helping Scorpius into the boat. “They couldn't hate muggle borns for ever could they?”

The two high-five as the boats begin to move.

Heather looks towards Scorpius and joins them on their side.

“Where's your parents?” Scorpius asks.

“My father's dead but my mother, well, better she not be here, especially after what she did.”

“Sorry to hear about that.” Scorpius says.

“It's fine.”

The boats take off from the shore back towards the platform just as they did 7 years ago when all the students started at Hogwarts.
