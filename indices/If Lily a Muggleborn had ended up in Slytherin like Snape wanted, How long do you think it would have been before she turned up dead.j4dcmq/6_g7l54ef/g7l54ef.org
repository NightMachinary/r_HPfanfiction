I'm actually writing a self-insert where Ted Tonk's little sister is sorted into Slytherin. It was fun to think about what it would have been like and how it affected her character.

I had Lucius (via Voldy) attempting to kill her by October so she moved out of the dorms and into an abandoned room instead. She became a lot more cold hearted and brutal than she would have been otherwise because she had to be feared in order to survive. I think Lily might have some the same thing.
