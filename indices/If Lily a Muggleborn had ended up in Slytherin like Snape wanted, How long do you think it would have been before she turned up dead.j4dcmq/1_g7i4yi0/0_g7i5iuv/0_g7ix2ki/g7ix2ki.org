The whole "Blood Purist" ideology lie on a base of hypocrisy. Looking back far enough, absolutely every witch or wizard has some Muggle blood (according to Pottermore, one Malfoy even tried to court the queen Victoria), they just choose to ignore it. I mean, Voldemort talked about his own Muggle father in fron of the Death Eaters in GoF, and nobody even reacted to the news, not to mention the Half Blood Death Eaters (Snape, Pettigrew and maybe others).

The point is, if Lily had accepted Voldemort offert, and played her role well (kept knowing her place and never showing any Pro-Muggle sentiment), the other Blood Purist would probably have cooked up some "Squibb line" to justify her talent and make her "acceptable" in polite society.

Slytherin Lily would either had been crushed by others, or managed to strive in the "Snake Den" until she became powerful enough for others to ignore her inferior origins.
