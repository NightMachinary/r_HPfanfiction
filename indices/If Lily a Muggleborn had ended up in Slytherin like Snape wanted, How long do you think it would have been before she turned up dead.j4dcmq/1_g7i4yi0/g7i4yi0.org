Hagrid in canon is puzzled why Voldemort never tried to recruit Lily (and I think JKR in an interview said in fact he did try). So maybe the Death Eaters weren't uniformly prejudiced against Muggleborns in the First War. They did recruit Snape - a half-blood who mixed with Muggles during his childhood.
