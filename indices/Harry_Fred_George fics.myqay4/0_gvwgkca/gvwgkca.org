The proper flair for this is Request. Recommendation means you're telling us about a fic you liked.

That said, I don't have any recs that are strictly H/F/G.

I've got one where an older Harry travels back in time and adopts his younger self, starting with the trial for underage magic before 5th year. Older Harry with Snape, younger/canon (sort of) Harry with the twins. Dumbledore/Hermione/Molly bashing, some Sirius bashing.

There's also one where Harry and Snape are attracted to each other, but refraining because Harry is still underage (that's crazy talk!). So they both have encounters with the twins in the meantime. So there's H/F/G, S/F/G, and eventual H/S (lots of pining), and ultimately H/S/F/G. A Question of Etiquette by SwtAlmnd.
