Hmm... Well, I think one set of constraints that would be interesting would be to try to make it as high security as possible. So, hourly patrols by pairs of guards, daily checks within the cells that include anti-polyjuice, anti-disillusionment, and anti-transfiguration protocols. For visitors, they'd have to go through security checks that again check for transfiguration and polyjuice, like Gringotts does with the Thief's downfall, and be searched for their wand/other artifacts. Visitors would also not be allowed to physically enter the cells, and would be watched at all times. Otherwise, spells/enchantments restricting entrance to only the accepted ones that are watched are probably key as well.

I think those restrictions would make it a lot harder for someone to find a way out of it - and it'd be interesting when someone does figure it out!
