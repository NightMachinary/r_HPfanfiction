I think getting out of Azkaban would require some outside help, once the animagus loophole is plugged. Frankly, security doesn't seem all that tight - the dementors are the major problem, but outside of that the guards probably don't like to patrol too much or look too deeply (I wouldn't either, if I were in their shoes, near dementors all the time).

In terms of escape, it would also depend on how blatant you want to do it. Trying to sneak out and not be discovered in the process would be much more difficult than to do the same thing with being able to use a patronus and run around letting the guards know in the process.

The avenue I'd be drawn to for sneaking out would be inspired by how Barty Crouch was smuggled out - the easiest would be to have someone important enough come in to visit you with a guest, then have that guest used to somehow replace you and you stroll out with polyjuice. Alternately, smuggling in a wand for you to use, and managing to get the drop on a guard (provided a strong enough grasp of memory spells) could be enough there.

Aspects that make it difficult to plan, from the outside like this, is that I don't think we know all too many aspects of security at Azkaban. Do they have a testing scheme for bodies, to make sure that deceased prisoners are actually who they're supposed to be? Are there methods of catching people leaving/entering who are disilusioned or polyjuiced? What kind of things are confiscated from visitors - and how are they searched in the process?

With one set of restrictions, it might be very easy to smuggle a wand in, transfigure a rock into a copy of yourself, and have it act out very basic movements (just eating and not responding to anything), while you waltz out under a disilusionment spell in the footsteps of a guard who's been freshly memory charmed. With another, maybe you are more forced to overpower a guard and replace him, with the guard replacing your dead body, slain in 'self defense' to make it so that no one would look for you when you move away. Pick a guard with no family, resign under cover of feeling terrible at having had to kill a deranged prisoner, and you're off free afterwards with no one thinking to look for you.

In another, if you don't care about being found out rather quickly, it might be easier to have a metamorphogus or polyjuiced accomplice pretend to be a high ranking auror who needs to take you back to the headquarters for interrogation - and then getting away that way.

I think to get the most exciting and interesting heist details, putting some restrictions/descriptions of how Azkaban is defended/operates would help :)
