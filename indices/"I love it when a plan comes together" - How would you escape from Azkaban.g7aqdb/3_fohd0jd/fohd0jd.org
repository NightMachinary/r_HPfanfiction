I had fun making these. It's free real estate, a bit trippy, a bit crackish but still works - just dramatized and with,a s I said, a crackish tone and some humour.

​

*Escape One : Hard Mode : no friends and only a wand.*

​

If magic is what it's all cracked up to be, I'd have a hidden third secret wand made in another Engand hating country, always inside my left arm - a cut away. It would hurt like hell to get it out and may take several days and a possible loss of my arm, but - details, people. I'll just be fast about it, and silent. Gotta love me a good chewing stick.

After that, it's quite simple - blasting walls, and chewing dementors. Or, more realistically, not being bothered by dementors because my entire life in the wizarding world would be a mess if I were to be stuck in Azkaban.

Let's say that dementors does affect me tho - I need to work fast, so that despair doesn't invade my soul. I probably don't know the patronus charm, because why would I have ever needed it ? It's not like I would want to steal a dragon from fucking Gringotts - wait.\\
Anyway, I'll need to be fast. So, this entire fleeing part of my story will be a shitstorm of massive proportion : "lone fucker decides to flee from Azkaban, blasts walls and guards everywhere with massive prejudice".

The problem : I'm not good enough to defeat both Dementors and tens of guards. The solution : Metal Gear. So, let's say I don't have the magical ability needed to destroy Azkaban. I'll need to be smarter, faster - I'll need to be a snake, and I'll need to be quite solid. But I'm not a snake, and I'm not an animagus. Plus, they're banned from Azkaban (because they're apparently too op and P2W- casuals, the whole of 'em) so that's that.

So I'll need to be discreet, and faster. I assume they regularly make rounds to see if there's everyone. I'll need to make a magical construct that looks like me. An illusion would be enough. After that, it's nothing but smoke and mirror - or better, a spell to make me invisible, and to delete my scent.

So, there. I am out of my cell, the guards believe I'm not, and as I'm walking out to finally feel the cold, salty wind - fuck, Dementors don't see or breathe, they feel the people by their souls. I'm not hidden from them. Back to square one.

Blasting out is not possible, and sneaking away is not possible. I need to be fast, but efficient. Dementors are op, and I'm only level 50. Or maybe 40. What do I do ? Why, it's simple : Let's go back to the "blast this shit off" plan, but with a twist : I now am able to fly. Or I'm not really, but there's a spell to make the floor not kill me when I drop off. Sure, I'm gonna make nightmares about falling to my doom, but I'm not in Azkaban anymore !

Finally, out of the tower. Checkpoint, and I can continue planning. I didn't put a broom in my arse just for the sake of it, because shrinking charms probably affect them. Dementors are already getting to me (they work fast, damn), and the guards have heard several noises - mainly an idiot screaming "BAKURETSU" and an explosion. Yeah, I'd go see what it is to, if I was a guard - can't blame them.

Plan 1 : Ice. Just freeze the water surrounding the island - just little puddles that I would walk on. The problem here is - hehe, boi, ice sinks when you walk on it ! Back to the checkpoint - what do I do ?

Why, I abuse my perk (wand holder) and transfigure some wings, enough to get on one of the rocks surrounding the island, and use several charms to protect my precious life.

Checkpoint. Nobody saw me, dementors weren't in my way - everything is good, and I've escapen the island. Now is something terrible : I'm on a tiny rocks, and just behind me is the most terrible prison of the wizarding world. Dementors would be able to know where I am, so I'm not safe. I need to flee, and fast - but I've got a bit more time, more energy, more sanity.

So I turn a big chunk of rock into a tiny boat, and everything is spelled invisible. And there I go ! I've escaped from Azkaban, nobody can see me, and WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE PEOPLE SHOOTING AT ME ?

So, turns out that the humand guards have this thing called a broom. And Dementors, being the OP little things they are, can straight up fly. If they see little waves, they're going to know I'm here. So what to do ?

The same, but more OUTRAGEOUS of course ! So I make a boat. That can fly. It can't really fly, of course, I'm just pushing it in the air with magic - but here's the idea. Thing is, now my magic is yelling at me, because my reserve isn't infinite.

Anyway, another rock, another stop. I can't see the island now, only the tower that is Azkaban. That's a pretty good win. What to do now ? I'm out of juice, stuck in a bubble, and they could find me with ease.

Well, I'll just have to plan things for now. I am far from the coast, but close to Azkaban. The dementors are forbidden from leaving, so my only enemies are now guards accompanied by dementors. Because guards alone can't see me. That's kinda good, because nobody wants to stick close to a dementor. Except Colonel Jack McShitFace, because he hates me. It's not his real name, but he's dumb, and deserves it.

Speaking of, here's Colonel Jack McShitFace approaching, searching around with his pet dementor that ca feel me. I'm pretty tired, but I've got some energy back, so I do what I can - Self transfiguration is out, because I don't know how to turn myself back. Plus drowning is a real problem.

So, here's an idea. Colonel Jack McShitFace has a broom. He's far, and his only backup is a disgusting freak of nature - the dementor. I just need to hit him with a spell, make him fall into the water, accio the broom, and zoom - I'm free ! Except Jonh McShitFace is really Ron Fucking Weasley, one of the three heroes of the wizarding world and all around pretty good with a wand. So option "make him probably die" is out, because when I'm free, I don't want everyone to look for me - I only angered some goblins, not enough for the people in charge to want me dead or something.

So, let's just summon the guy himself, punch him in the face because let's face it, summoning your opponent is dumb so he won't react, and voila, a stunned Jonh McShitFace ! Now, he's only out cold and not dead, and alone on a rock on the water. But he still has a wand, so he can make magic.\\
Well, only little sparks because I broke it, but he can still be seen !

I have the broom, and nobody to try to bring me back. So, as I fly into the sunset (not really because it's dumb, I'm easily seen if I'm directly in front of the sun. No, I'm going where it's darker), I begin to think - what do I do now ? Sure, I'm free, but - hey, is that an Azkaban guard ?

So that's it, huh. The final showdown. Random Guard number something is behind me, no dementors in sight. Probably a rookie, sure he can be a hero. Well tough luck, because I have the yoink! spell (accio broom) and that allows me to make him fall into the water. I throw his broom into the ocean with him, so that he doesn't die, but he won't follow me. Probably.

This is it. I'm alone, away from Azkaban. So the final step is : I need to make random movements so I'm not seen. And after several hours, there's land ! And I'm in Spain, because why not.

*Success : Wand Only challenge defeated !*
