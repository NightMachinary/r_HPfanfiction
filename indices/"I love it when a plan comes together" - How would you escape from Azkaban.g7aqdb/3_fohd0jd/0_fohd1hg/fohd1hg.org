*Escape Two : Really Hard Mode : no friends, no wand, only a goblin knife*

What a good dream that was, escaping with a wand ! Except I'm dumb and I only hid this here knife within my body. This time it's not inside my arm, but hidden behind fake skin.

It's enchanted, because why not, and in real life (or was the dream another possibility, another life ? I don't know) I'm not dumb and I'm friend-ish with goblins. By that I mean I bought one of their magical weapons and I promised on my entire fortune they'd be the first to get it when I die.

It's magical through, so it can cut bars ! So here I am, inside Azkaban's icy corridors. Freeing prisoners left and right, to cause mayhem and secure a better chance at escaping. Ah, and here is Malfoy the old one, now dead because frankly, I don't like him. Did I mention my reason from being here ? I challenged Malfoy Junior to a duel after Malfoy Junior Junior decided to bully a kid I liked. Liked as in "as a family friend" you fuckers.\\
And he may or may not now be dead, and purebloods may or may not want me dead too. Junior is dead, I mean. No, I wouldn't kill Junior Junior.

So, mayhem. Violence. Blood. Yay ! Here's Jack McFucker, more commonly known as Ron Weasley - aaaand he didn't see me. Figures he'd want to follow Malfoy Junior Junior.

Did I mention he got arrested for assault ? Didn't surprise me.

So, everyone is fighting everyone, and I steal a wand that was just there, held by a now dead guard. Those fuckin' kill stealers, man, they're everywhere !

This wand allows me to accio a broom, and since everyone is to busy trying to hold back the other prisoners, nobody notices me using the wand to make the guards uniform fits me. Voila ! I'm undetected. Excepth this here dementors look at me, but I try not to look at him.

I'm going outside, screaming "this one is getting out !" and they leave the guy to me. Except there was nobody. So I'm free to use the broom to get out.

And in fact, I'm just free. Yay me, I guess ?

/(Body count : 12 prisoners, 7 guards)/

*Success : Knife only challenge defeated !*

​

*Escape 3 : Impossible Mode : No nothing, just myself and this here body*

I'll cut this timeline here short : I'm driven to insanity by the dementors, and I die from being fuckin' hungry.

/(Body count : 1 prisoner, 0 guard)/

*Failure : Nothing challenge failed !*

*Escape 4 : No items Friends only Azkaban Destination*

Hi. I won't say who I am, in case this communication got hijacked. Somehow.

Here's how I escaped from Azkaban.

I was detained because I posted several unkind things about minister Granger and her friend, National Hero Harry Potter. So what if it was actually illegal ? Rita Skeeter did it,and way worse ! And she never got imprisoned ! Why couldn't I do it ?

Anyway, here's the problem : I'm not strong magically. Because I don't have a wand. Logic, ain't it ?

So, the days goes by, and I'm becoming more and more insane. Dementors do that to you. I almost lost hope in my chances of survival, when finally, I heard a voice from the heaven. Except I'm to bad for heaven, so it was probably from below. Purgatory ? Meh.

"Here, grab this, shitface". The voice said. I think. And then, this someone throws me my wand. I can't do many things with it, because, you know, I'm not this magical hero - but whatever. The voice (one of my friends from Hogwarts, a fellow Slytherin who really liked muggle culture so we bonded over that) says that he'll wait for me in the "third rock north from Azkaban". And at this point, the building trembles. The reason ? One of my friend from Hufflepuff doesn't know the word "subtility".

So the "escape like a grown boy" mission becomes a "protect the VIP" mission. Slytherin friend breaks into the cell, and we destroy the door (subtility is also lost on us). Meanwhile, the guards' attention is away, because of our Hufflepuff friend.

We sneak out of the building with no problems, except for dementors. They are everywhere. But there is a problem : as soon as we're outside, dementors surround us from every sides.

As the end draws near (because I can't do a patronus, of course), a voice makes itself clear behind the dementors "Expecto Pztronum !". It's like a crappy fanfiction, where all the friends I made along the way decides "fuck the lax" just to save me. It's one of my friends from Ravenclaw, who learnt the Patronus because it looked cool. (His words)

The Hufflepuff friend comes to us, with four brooms. We escape, with a tight formation to protect every sides - the patronus scaring the dementors until we're far from the island. Until finally, we lay our foot on the land. We are back home !

And then comes Josh, a friend from Gryffindor. Who doesn't cant to fight the law. So he fights us. Did I say a friend from Gryffindor ? No no no, I meant a Wormtail. So the hufflepuff sacrifices himself (read : takes the stunner heads-on) and we in turn defeat the Pettigrew (read : Stun him, strip him, steal all his belongings and throw him in the water after reviving him). We transplane together several times, and finally - I am free !

And then my slytherin friend slaps me, punches me, and proceeds to berate me for the whole day because "I'm a dumbass" and they "warned me not to publish the article". But truth must always be known to the public !

And what if Granger and Potter didn't have an affair ? It was not slander, I was only following my boss' warnings : "make sure we sell more papers for tomorrow's edition, or else !"

/Body count : 0 prisoner, 4 guards)/

*Success : Friends only challenge defeated !*

*Bonus : "Defeat the Pettigrew of the group" completed !*

That's it, I could combine them for more whacky fun but that's good enough, and I'm tired. There's several good ideas in the first escape but I just lost everything suddenly and decided "fuck it, let's make it a story" and then I added some crack. Hope you enjoyed anyway ?
