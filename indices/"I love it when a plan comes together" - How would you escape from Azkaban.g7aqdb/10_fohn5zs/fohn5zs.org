I actually have a head-cannon that most of the half-bloods and purebloods that are sent to Azkaban don't actually stick around enough to serve their sentences. Basically everybody would make something like what Barty Crouch did. Not necessarily with a wife or someone about to die, but like, a muggle under the imperious curse, they could be transfigured/desilusioned/hidden under an invisibility cloak and taken with the family member to Azkaban, them when the family member is with the prisoner they would use polyjuice to make the switch and make sure the person would die (some poison maybe), and them just get out with the ex-prisoner hidden by the same means as the muggle.

The escaped convicted would probably have to stay away of the magical world (for example go to a muggle house in someplace isolated, ward tge hell out, kill or obliviate the owners to forget the place exist), maybe even go to another country and change permanently their appearance, but they would be free and reasonably not insane.
