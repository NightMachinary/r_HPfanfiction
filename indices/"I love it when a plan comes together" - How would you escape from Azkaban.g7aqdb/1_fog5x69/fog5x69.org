Depending on the spell range allowed (on-screen only; on-screen and hinted at; reasonable fanon; fanon unbound), it could be accomplished via enchanting.

*On Azkaban - The revolving door policy*

Because there are both human guards and Dementors on the island, the place has to allow spellcasting - to get a fire going, to cast a Patronus... While most of the staffing is political, the guards are still allowed comforts that the prisoners are denied. This is a weakness, because no one would be pedantic enough to make the anti-magic spells whitelist-only, and that is if one thought to block anything more than known transportation spells. There is always a piece of magic that can slip through. Once, twice, or hundreds of times - I'd made a tidy profit on extractions after vacating that estabilishment. The wardens never noticed, no matter how many times sweeps and cursebreaker visits were organized. The prisoners would still disappear into the night, and their gold would jump right into my pockets.

What that meant for me? I would spend time prior to my incarceration learning enchanting and animation charms. What I'd need is an amphibious trinket capable of stealtily delivering me, and only me, my wand, some chocolate bars or hot chocolate, and warding off dementors while I recover. Since the risk of 'losing my mind exists', I infer I'd be placed in high security area, and that means less than frequent inspections by humans, but a lot of dementors.

I can spell my wand against detection quite easily, and after I'd given it to my Crawler (name pending) it would hide for a few days. If interrogated, I'd say I'd gotten drunk and lost my wand - I don't know where it is. I'd do it too! Best lies contain a bit of truth... Bah! They are constructed almost entirely out of facts! It's how they are arranged that matters. It takes some devious thinking, but I can make people believe most outrageous things - without ever uttering a single falsehood. They actually still remember me for that - I never lie. The part "because I never need to" is usually left out of the reports - all the better for me.

On to the Crawler. It would be for the most part a crab, capable of tracking me (I could give it a drop of blood as an anchor), sticky charms to allow it to climb walls (levitation and the like might be shared by brooms, so adding those was too risky), an expanded storage space (Undetectable Expansion Charm, thank you!), swim quickly (not too hard to do) and avoid detection (notice-me-not, disillusionment, silencing, scent-killing) and some durability, as well as Impervious Charm. Obviously, the legs would be sharp, blades that could destroy by brute force the doors to my cell or the walls if they proved resistant to spells - have to plan ahead.

It would seem as if animating the whole thing was the most difficult thing - nothing more wrong. Animation charms are a part of basic Hogwarts curriculum, and I still possesed my books. Some review never hurt anyone. I'd also seen ole' Minnie McG animate the suits of armor in Hogwarts with a simple Pierotum Locomotor, even granting them a semblance of personality, each. Transfiguration Mstress she might be, but in charms she's just above average - and I am plenty motivated.

In case the Crawler got intercepted somehow - fat chance, but better prepare for any eventuality - a whole lot of cursed trinkets loaded with compulsions would provide me with alternative means of rescue as well as some pretty neat distractions for my inadvertent rescures. A horde of muggles storming King's Cross, Leaky Cauldron, and singing state secrets on national television would throughly take eyes off the North Sea - cold, yes, but so was sending me to that hell.

Finally, the best way of avoiding prison is to never get locked up - if I could't use a Fidelius charm to hide my identity, I certainly could hide my residence - and buy myself much more time. War of attrition is on my side - Ministry doesn't have enough troops to stake out the general area of my residence, and I feel confident against their paper-pushing lackeys. Living in the middle of a busy muggle area was a calculated move.

And that's it! My master plan! I could go into decoys, delaying tactics and more misdirection - but if you're reading this, I am long gone. Both from the country, and possibly from the world of living. My desire to brag, to crow about my triumph over the mightiest minds of my time and their unending hordes of pawns, as well as illustrious Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore, is not so great as to allow anyone see this while they could still act to my detriment.
