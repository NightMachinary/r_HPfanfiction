We don't know enough about how the prison works to give a detailed answer, all we know is that it's in the middle of the sea, has walls, cell doors and dementors, along with a warden or maybe a small group of guards.

If I had a wand, I would probably transfigure a hole in the walls, get out, conjure a small boat and that's it.

Without it, could do the old "Call guard into cell door, incapacitate them and get out". Use wand to cast Patronous to cover the escape and use/conjure a boat.

Getting out without a wand or assistance is much harder unless you can get to boat or ferry, cold water is a serious obstacle.
