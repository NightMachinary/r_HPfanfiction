Since we never actually see Azkaban in detail, its hard to know what it would take. However, we know there are three methods that have canonically worked:

Be an animagus, starve yourself enough to slip through the bars, then swim for it.

Have an accomplice trade places with you (sucks to be them).

Have a powerful wizard outside with influence over the guards break you out.

Magic is unlikely to work, as the Dementors create depression which dampens magical ability, and will sense if you leave the cell. They'd also be fools not to have anti-apparition spells on the place.

If I was going to try to smuggle something in, it wouldn't be a wand- it would be a portkey. Once created, they don't seem to require great magic to activate (can be set to leave at a certain time), and can seemingly work through anti-disapparition spells. But the prison might have ways of detecting one.

I would suggest that a contortionist or escape artist with great mental/emotional discipline /might/ be able to replicate Sirius's feat without being an animagus. But it would be a long shot.

Otherwise, you pretty much need a guy on the outside.
