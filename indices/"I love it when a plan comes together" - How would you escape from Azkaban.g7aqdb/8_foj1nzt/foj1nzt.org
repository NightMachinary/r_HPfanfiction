If you are slightly above average in terms of power, and find a way to get hold of a wand... kill your way out. The Dementors are easy to keep at bay if you can conjure a Patronus, and human security isn't that tight.

Of course, if you go a bit fanon into Azkaban, the place could have magic-binding chains, all sort of wards on the cells made to weaken and disorient you, ways to administer various potions as gas, and who knows what other joyful features. In which case, being broken out by someone outside is your only hope.
