Why do you need Harry be pressed into something he isn't? Read some Marauders' Era story. Just going through “The Peace Not Promised” by Tempest Kiro linkffn(12369512) and it is very well written (although, as usual, in a need of severe cutting) Snilly story with well-written arc for James (and not so much Sirius).
