I was not talking just about you. I have just lost (not that I would care THAT much, I have plenty of them) some fifteen points in this thread because people called me a Snape apologist. Then I suggest that making Harry into James II. is not the best idea, because these two are very different characters (not that you CANNOT or MUSTN'T do it, just that it is stupid; if you want to make Snape into pink-robes-wearing prankster, go ahead), and I am accused that I don't know what fanfiction is. Awesome.
