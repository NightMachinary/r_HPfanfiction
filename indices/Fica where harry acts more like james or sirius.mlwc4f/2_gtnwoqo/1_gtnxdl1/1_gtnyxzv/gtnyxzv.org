I don't think I am (and BTW, I haven't uttered a word about Snape). I am not excusing Snape's horrible behaviour towards Harry, and I don't excuse his descent into being a Death Eater. Those both are absolutely horrible things and it seems to me that JKR got over them too easily (Albus Severus Potter). And yes, James obviously grew up from some of that and then by all accounts he was a good leader of his group and a good father dying for his kid. However, every child in his life has to have a moment when it discovers that their parents are not flawless Gods (I wrote linkao3(18770464) about it), and that each of us (quoting Sirius in a film, or Solzhenitsyn for that matter) we each have some light and dark parts, and yes James and Sirius certainly had some of both.
