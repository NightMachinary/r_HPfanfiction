Oh yeah, I totally agree about that. When I read the fragment you mentioned, I almost dropped this fic, it was that ridiculous. I still didn't finish that one in the end (I reached 5th year as far as I remember) but this happens to many fics I read once the novelty wears off there is rarely something that pushes me to finish.
