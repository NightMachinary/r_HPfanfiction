Was the one that came to my mind as well. It's pretty decent and I really liked the way the slowly shifting relationship between Harry and his sister was portrayed, IIRC. However, as a fair warning, readers have to be willing to swallow a certain amount of straying into Mary Sue territory, which I remember to be particularly bad during the beginning. showing her as a potion genius by helping Snape grading essays during her first year was particularly painful, even if it served slowly building something of a friendship later on
