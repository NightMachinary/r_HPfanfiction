Have you read linkffn(Splintered Dimension by TheTruffalo) ?

Poppy isn't a Slytherin OC, but she's way darker and has a different past. There's no wbwl shenanigans, Harry is the de-facto BWL, but Poppy is meant to help him. Can't say much more without spoiling though. Be warned, there's a lot of angst. And Harry can be even more dense than in canon sometimes (relationship/tact-wise) and even callous at times. Overal, pretty much canon.
