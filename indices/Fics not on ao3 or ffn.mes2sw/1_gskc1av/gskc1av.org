Not that much and the gravitational pull of the large sites (FFN and AO3) tends to suck whatever good stories are found on other sites there as well.

- I like stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter) which are on [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]]

- there are some specialist sites (usually order of magnitude smaller than FFN or AO3). So, for example, if you are a fan of Hinny, there is [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/]] which is not much active now, but have some older stories, and the leading Hinny site (still active) is [[https://www.siye.co.uk/]], however plenty of stories from there find their way to FFN and AO3 as well.

- and then there is [[https://wattpad.com]], which is absolutely gigantic site for everything (not only fanfiction stories, but original ones as well), with the fame of most of the stories of very low quality (by teenagers for teenagers). I know about two or three stories from there which are at least readable, but trying to find something there yourself is mostly exercise in futility. Wait here if somebody suggests anything.
