Are you looking for other archives to browse, or specific stories? Somebody has already recced the potionsandsnitches archive, but there is also [[https://www.faenfiction.com/fanfics/harry_potter/harry/anyone][faenfiction.net]], which is devoted to finished fics. I do not know if they have permission to repost these; some of them are marked as deleted from their original sites. It's also white lettering on a black background, which can be hard to read.

As for other archives, they keep disappearing. The most recent (I think) casualty being Skyehawke, which was known for high-quality works. Some of those stories/authors crossposted to ffn and/or ao3, but not all, which means a new batch of stories lost to time.

Others require a login, and requests may or may not be addressed at this time. This includes [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], [[http://www.turn-of-the-page.com][a turn of the page]], and [[http://sycophanthex.com/][sycophanthex]]. (Note that some of the hosted stories ARE on ffn/ao3, but not all.)

Then there are the websites dedicated to specific authors, usually the site owner and his/her friends. This includes individual accounts on LJ, IJ, and/or Dreamwidth, as well as hosted sites. You'll need to provide specifics to get recs there, or if you're looking for story recs that are on lesser-traveled sites.
