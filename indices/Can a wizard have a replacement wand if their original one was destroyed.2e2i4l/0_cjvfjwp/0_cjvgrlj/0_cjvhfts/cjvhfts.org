That was what I was hinting at, yes.

But only if there aren't any unstated laws about two wands or some flimsy unknown magical conflict to using two at once.

Though, since no one ever carries two wands in the book's wizarding universe, it must be very strong social pressure not to, or some other unmentioned reason. Because it would be common sense to carry around a back up wand if you were ever worried about your safety, or simply as a precaution.

I use this idea in my story actually, and it is common sense to get a backup or specialized wand for some people, but everyone keeps quiet about it because it's become a taboo subject to carry more than one.
