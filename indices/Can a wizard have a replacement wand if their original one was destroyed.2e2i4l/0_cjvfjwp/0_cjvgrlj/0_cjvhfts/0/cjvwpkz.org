This is especially true because wands are cheap. Not quite pocket change, but not a huge purchase either. 7 galleons each, with 1 galleon equalling 5 pounds sterling -- that should be under a day's wages for Arthur Weasley. Aurors are supposedly well paid, so I'd expect Alastor Moody to have three wands on his person, three more at home, and a half dozen emergency caches each containing at least one spare.
