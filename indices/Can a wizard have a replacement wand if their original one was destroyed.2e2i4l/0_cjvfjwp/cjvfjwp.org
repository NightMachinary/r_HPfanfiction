Ron used Charlie's old wand originally and a new one made specifically for Peter at the end. So it's likely that Charlie found a new wand that choose him after wearing out his first. Peter having a wand made for him might mean that anyone can get a customized wand, for the right price/motivation, unless it didn't work very well for him like stealing someone else's.

But if you think about there being hundreds of wand makers around the world, there can't only be one wand you're destined for, and it just happens to be made near where you live.

Since not everyone goes to Ollivander's, or even goes through his entire stock of wands to see if another might choose them. It's reasonable to assume each wand store would likely have one wand that might choose an individual, and possibly more than one.
