There's a lot of good recs in the older posts in [[/r/hpharmony]], and quite a few good ones in the wiki (though also a few sub-par ones) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/wiki/index]]

As a start i'd check out linkffn(11951348) and linkffn(12296750) though, which are both endearingly cute =).

One author I don't see recommended that often is [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/76'][Romulus Lupin]] on portkey, who has a really unique prose.
