Here are some really good, under-read complete ones.

linkffn(Hermione Granger And The Quest For Merlin's Blessing) is a very weird one that I enjoyed quite a bit. Reminded me a little of the Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks.

linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian) and linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) are two Book 7 replacements by the same author. They originally appeared on HPFF, so they're easy to overlook.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought by SPSmith) is another old one I like---feels more canon than the average fanfic tonally. There's a Book 7 that will probably never be finished, but this Book 6 is complete.

[[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/][Years of Rebellion]] and [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/][Last Horcrux]] are two very old fanfics by Full Pensieve. Years of Rebellion in particular is a post-OOTP fic that was extremely influential in its time. I love his characters and the size of his world. YOR will probably never be finished, but it's absolutely worth reading.
