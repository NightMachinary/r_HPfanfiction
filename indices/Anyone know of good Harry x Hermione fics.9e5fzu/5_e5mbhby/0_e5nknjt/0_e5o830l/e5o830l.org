If you want to download, it might be easier to stick with Ao3. They have epub, mobi, and pdf options.

Here's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Hermione+Granger%2FHarry+Potter&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=T&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=20000&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][Harry/Hermione, over 20k, complete, sorted by kudos]]. There are less than 200 results, so it's a browsable list. And you can always narrow it down further (like, by rating - I just realized how much smut is in those results).
