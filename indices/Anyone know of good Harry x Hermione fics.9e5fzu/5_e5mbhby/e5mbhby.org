What kind of stories are you looking for? When they're adults? When they're still at Hogwarts? What about time-travel, AU, or re-do fics? Do you want it to be canon-compliant? One-shots or longer stories? If it's the latter, how long do you prefer? Any preferences about what kind of medium you'd want to read on (i.e. [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]], Archive of our Own, etc.)? Would you be interested in any character bashing or not? Your request is a bit vague. If you narrow it down, perhaps others will provide you with what you're looking for.
