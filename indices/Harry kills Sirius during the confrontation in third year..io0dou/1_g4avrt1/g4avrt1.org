I just read a fic where it's mentioned offhand that it's possible to be trapped in your animagus form permanently, and if that happened to Peter Harry probably never gets convinced of Sirius' innocence. I think Sirius was in a pretty good position for a while to escape but if Snape shows up and the trio is on Snape's side I don't see that going well.
