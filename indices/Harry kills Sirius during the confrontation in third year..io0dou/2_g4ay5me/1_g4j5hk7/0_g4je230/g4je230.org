The fic itself is very good writing. Everything up until that point is worryingly plausible. It has one of the more interesting slytherin H&Hr. The scene with Sirius simply felt forced as if the author wanted to push them to the dark side only for sake of the plot. I couldn't stomach any version of Harry doing it without regret.
