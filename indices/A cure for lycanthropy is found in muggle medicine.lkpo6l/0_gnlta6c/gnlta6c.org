A brief excerpt from one of my fics. (Time traveling George is going by the fake name of Gil here.)

Gil rummaged through an inner pocket of his jacket. “Oh, and before I forget, I brought you the cure for lycanthropy,” he said.

“What?” said Remus. He grabbed the little plastic bottle of pills Gil was offering him. He read the label. “This says Amoxicillin.”

“Yeah, it took a muggleborn healer to think of testing muggle antibiotics on magical diseases,” said Gil. “Take three a day for a week, you'll be all set.”
