I'm fairly certain you meant deceased.

The resurrection stone is unusual in that the other two hallows are just near-perfect versions of something that already existed- wands and invisibility cloaks. Unlike them, the stone seems to call spirits back from 'beyond the veil'. This flies in the face of everything stated before about the absolute line between life and death. Ghosts haven't seen the other side of the veil and there is no magic anywhere to bring someone back once they're gone.

...except /this thing/.

Sounds suspicious. Maybe it doesn't retrieve the dead to speak to the living. Maybe it just calls up a vision of that person as the summoner remembers them. Or perhaps the vision is an amalgam of all those who remember the person. It's not like the spirits told Harry anything new or provably outside Harry's knowledge and within theirs.

I see the value of the stone, or of magic portraits to act as mentors for Harry for a fix-it fic, but... The closer to canon you'd want to keep the story, the more likely the stone just makes a powerful Illusion. The visions are a reflection of the owner's desires, operating much like the Mirror of Erised, Voldemort's drinking fountain of despair, Amortentia, Dementors and Boggarts. This is why the Resurrection Stone can never fill the hole of a person's loss.
