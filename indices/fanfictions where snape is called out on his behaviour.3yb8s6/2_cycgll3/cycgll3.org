Robst probably has a story where that happens. It sounds wish-fulfillment-y enough to happen in one of his fics.

Chapter Sixteen of linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie) has a Harry-Sue who quite easily dispatches Severus. Snape is then called out on his awful behaviour by Dumbledore once he's woken up.
