  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
