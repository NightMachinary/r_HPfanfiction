If you know of a still-working HP fanfic site that isn't ffnet, ao3, or the DLP forums, please let me know so I can mirror it. I'll backup the site and, should the original site become unreachable, publish it elsewhere.

I am currently mirroring:

- [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/][Fictionalley]]

I am in the process of backing up:

- [[http://siye.co.uk][Sink Into Your Eyes]]
- [[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/archive/][Moonshadow]]
- [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]]
- [[http://simmeringcauldrons.com/efiction/][Simmering Cauldrons]]
- [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/][Skyhawke]]
- [[http://sugarquill.net/][Sugarquill]]
- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/][Walking the Plank]]
- [[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/][WIKTT]]

I can't back anything up after it's dead, so ask early.
