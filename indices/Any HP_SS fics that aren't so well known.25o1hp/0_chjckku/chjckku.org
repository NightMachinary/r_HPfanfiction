Okay, I've got a few:

First thing I thought of when I saw that you didn't mean /only/ slash, was Lomonaaeren's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World]] in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333][Pieces]] (FF.net and AO3 links provided). It's a "Harry goes to another Universe and has to kill Voldemort /again/" fic, but there's many twists, and this version of Snape is decidedly different in a very familiar way. If you like Lomonaaeren's writing, she has skads of other stories, and while a large majority are H/D in relationship, Severus is very often a major character in one or the other's life.

Next, up is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2233941/oliver-snape][oliver]].[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/oliversnape/pseuds/oliversnape][snape]]'s well... everything... A real quick look over the story list shows that they're all H/SS in at least a parental role if not the traditional shipping. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5878880/1/The-Definition-of-Home][The Definition]] of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/329404/chapters/531524][Home]] and its sequels are some of my favorite Severus adopts Harry Potter stories and wins big time on the most original Voldemort death.

I keep trying to find a second series/story of his to recommend over the others but I just can't! They're all wonderful and unique and I might just have to reread them after I finish...

Lighting on the Wave's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifice Arc]], which happens to be my next suggestion. I've recc'd it before and I will again. :) It took me over a month and a half to get through the 3+ million words the first time and six months and counting for the second time (I will remember more details this time, dammit! Even if its so good sleep loses to it often!) This has Snape becoming first a in-the-way-head-of-house, to something of an ally, to a mentor, to a father over the course of 7 years. There's times you'll want to shake them both to behave and support one another better, but... if that isn't real life what is? It's also H/D slash, and one of the most detail-oriented re-imagining of the series I have ever read.

Another good Severus mentors Harry is Suitesamba's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6500900/1/Moment-of-Impact][Moment]] of [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54925][Impact]] and its sequels. (Doesn't look like Suite Samba has finished putting everything up on AO3 yet.) Her other work is wonderful as well, and I see she has a few new stories up that I haven't read yet, so Yay for me!

Well, that's what I've got for tonight. Can't find some of the slash fics I want to recc from my bookmarks, but I'll come back if I do. :)
