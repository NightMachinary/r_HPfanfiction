Okay, so I know I'm super late to the thread, sorry! Cybele (the writer of If You Are Prepared) just finished [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/34560][For Auld Lang Syne]] in January. It's epilogue compliant, and covers from a few months after Voldemort's defeat to a few months post-epilogue. It does have HP/OC and SS/OC at some points - but no worries, it is /very/ well written. I liked the OCs while they were in those relationships. (Usually I just want the Snarry to happen already!) Brilliant, slow-moving. Their relationship has to overcome so many huge obstacles. The sort of two steps forward, one step back thing I like to see in this pairing.
