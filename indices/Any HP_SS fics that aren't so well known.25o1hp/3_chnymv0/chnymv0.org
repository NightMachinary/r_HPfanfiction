For mentor I'd check out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Saving Connor, the first book in the Sacrifices Arc.]] The mentor relationship comes later in the series. It is three times longer than the original seven books, so be sure to bookmark. *" I've always enjoyed stories where Harry has a sibling who supposedly saved the world, and stories where Harry's Sorted into Slytherin, but most of the time all the characters except Harry wind up as caricatures of themselves. This is my attempt at writing a Slytherin Harry who's not necessarily evil, and a Snape and Draco who may be good but not nice, and a sibling (Harry's twin brother Connor) who's his own person."*- Lightning on the Wave

Another mentor fic is [Still Life by DianaArtemis16]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9186886/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/9186886/1/]]). Snape is very "in character" for this fic. *"I lived my life a hundred times and always found myself holding him in my arms, knowing that he would never even remember me. I want to save him Severus, but I don't know what to do."..."Why did you bring me back, Lily? What did you expect me to do?"..."I expect you to become what I've tried to be in a hundred lifetimes."*

Another mentor fic is [Visions of Sugarplums Danced in their Heads by fawkesfeathers]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10239915/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/10239915/1/]]). *Over Christmas break, Harry and Snape are attacked by a Ghangzou, a rare, magical genie that shows its victims what life would be like if one thing changed. What they see will alter their relationship forever, if they'll let it.*

[Yet Another Snape meets the Dursleys story by rabbit and -v-Jinx-v]([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/601118/1/][www.fanfiction.net/s/601118/1/]]) It starts off "meh" but gets interesting very quickly.I like it because Dudley actually has a personality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828645/1/][Everybody Wants to be a Cat by Les Dowich]]*Critically injured during the final battle, Harry Potter chooses a simpler way to live. As a cat, Harry finds love and acceptance but no man can be a cat forever and everyone has to grow up and face the world one day.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8646550/1/Far-Beyond-a-Promise-Kept][Far Beyond a Promise kept by oliver.snape]]. I don't remember too much about the ending to this one. *Snape never wanted anyone to know of his promise to Dumbledore, but has realised that he can protect Potter much better by taking a less passive role in the boy's training. Actually liking Harry Potter has never been part of his plan. mentor/guardian.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8888660/1/Forever-Young][Forever Young by Warviben]]. The slash is in Part 2 which you can find on the author's profile. Don't worry, nothing happens until harry is himself again. *Harry Potter goes missing during the final battle. Snape finds him in a most undesirable place.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2299450/1/Oblivion][After All by PissedOffEskimo]]*Dumbledore decides that he's had enough of the Dursley's abuse and brings Harry to Hogwarts at age eight HPDM main pairing, HPLM noncon, HPSS implied. Beware the cute.* I lost interest in this story. Snape is a major dick and iirc there is chan with Draco. That doesn't bother me, because like many kids I started playing with myself long before puberty, but I know most people dislike it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5263271/1/Alea-Iacta-Est][Alea Iacta Est By: EllaEleniel]]*When a bout of erratic magic delivers Harry into his professor's hands, the pair make a shocking discovery that forces Harry to face his toughest battle yet. Now, with Snape by his side Harry must fight to survive against a foe more deadly than Voldemort.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7375581/1/][Catch and Release By: Roozette *Harry has a "tell," when he needs affection. Ron never realized Severus had the same one. A Snarry told from a Ron-centric viewpoint. Yep.* Short.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8109637/1/][I'm Sorry by lastcrazyhorn]] Short. *Little Harry was rescued from the Dursleys by his Daddy, but not all of their lessons are easily forgotten. Entry in the P&S 2012 Prompt Fest. Prompts: It slipped from his grasp and shattered, Fight or flight. Is also a child fic, w/ adoption & self harm*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5482304/1/][ThE SeVeRuS SnApE FaN cLuB By: Lady Lianna Kari]] Crack fic. *Harry gets tired of Snape making digs at his fame, so he decides to get even. Not a Slash. Occasional references of abuse.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6855183/1/][Burnt By LastcrazyHorn]]. *WIP* I find Moody's character annoying and unrealistic, but I like the premise. I'm on the fence about this story still. *A disabled Harry comes to Hogwarts story. Everyone expects him to be like his dad, but how can he be with such a different past? A Slytherin Harry takes on Hogwarts in an unusual way.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul By: SensiblyTainted]] I found this very enjoyable, though like most fanfics there are unrealistic parts. *What if there was a darker truth hidden in Harry's story? Summer before third year, Harry begins to question his memory blanks. What happens when he finds himself before Snape for help? includes mentor Severus, MPD, child abuse, protective Remus*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7558470/1/][Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina]] *After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.* I loved this because Pureblood Traditions are a favorite genre of mine, but you won't actually see much interaction between Snape and Harry. If you like Ginny, you will hate this. Ginny and her family are wildly out of character in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5229890/1/][To Make It All Okay by Bonomania]] *When Harry goes back to school the year after Sirius dies, the unlikeliest of people start noticing a change in him. Mentions of child abuse, Dursleys, Draco and more brushes with death.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6141466/1/][6 Lessons From A Dead Man by Roozette]] *Harry Potter put himself in a vulnerable situation on Severus Snape's birthday. So, naturally, Severus took complete advantage.* A kidnapp crack fic slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/][Better Be Slytherin! by jharad17]] *YEAR ONE COMPLETED! As a first year, Harry is sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, and no one is more surprised than his new Head of House. Snape mentors Harry fic.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942221/1/][Broken Wings by Snapegirlkmf]] *Desperate to escape his guilt and nightmares after the third task, Harry transforms into a hawk by accident and ends up breaking both wings and suffering partial memory loss. He is found by Snape,who helps him and discovers the truth about his professor.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville]] *AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!*

(a lot more links coming, will reply to myself. I've read most of these however a few of them I never finished because they were WIP's when I started reading them and I lost my place. And a few stories I probably stopped reading if they became too cliched or if Harry ever referred to Snape as "Dad" within the first few chapters.).

Sorry for terrible formatting.
