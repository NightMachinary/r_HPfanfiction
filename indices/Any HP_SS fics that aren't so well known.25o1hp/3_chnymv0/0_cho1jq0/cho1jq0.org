The last list had more mentor stuff, this list has more slash stuff. I didn't do this on purpose, it just worked out that way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2183302/1/][Things I Never Knew by youcantseeus]] When Snape's son comes to Hogwarts, Harry discovers secrets about his Potions Master that he never imagined and Snape learns a few things about Harry as well. NOT HBP COMPLIANT. *No romance. A very enjoyable read.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/][Digging for the Bones by paganaidd]] Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6408514/1/][Forget Me Not by Sa-kun]]: Everyone seems to have forgotten that the Boy Who Lived exists. Harry's friends don't remember who he is. Harry tries to hold on to reality as he knows it, while trying to come to terms with who he is. He finds Snape as an unexpected ally. 6th year AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5901596/1/][Twentyone days by evil minded:]] AU / Death Eaters besiege Hogwarts. A spell from Dumbledore is going astray. A cauldron explodes during potions class. And the old castle enfolds its own magic. Can some students survive the next twenty-one days? How will they deal with everything thrown their way due to "the tragedy of Hogwarts" as reporters call it? Accompany them on their struggle to stay alive ... thanks ... *English is not this author's first language. There will be grammar and spelling mistakes. I still think it is worth the read, though Harry's behavior seems to regress and he seems more childlike as the story goes on.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6741433/1/Cartons-of-milk][Follow/FavCartons of milk By: evil minded]] AU / Albus Dumbledore needs a teacher for the pre-school in Little Whinging, Surrey, to cover the raccoon class which one Harry Potter attends ... and whom do you think he will send? Well, I am sure you already can imagine ... /lol/ ... watch our dear Potions Master handling a bunch of "little snotty toddlers" ... all reviews will go to the kindergarden for a carton of milk for them ... *English is not this author's first language. There will be spelling and grammar mistakes.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3402347/1/Bonds-of-Water][Bonds of Water By: Heather68]] Harry Potter has never been entranced by music before now, but he is willing to do anything to learn how to play the same melody, even if it means learning from Severus Snape. *Slash. This author has a lot of stories with Snape and Harry in them, but I haven't checked out the others yet.* I may have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3354694/1/Danger-In-The-Healing][Danger in Healing, though.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/][Insane Asylum Escapees by RuneWitchSakura]] This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt. *Wonderful crackfic that has alas been abandoned. I'm putting this here since Snape was mentioned, but I don't remember if they interacted at all. Cheating, I know.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/Crumbling-Pedestal][Crumbling Pedestal by Shivani Slash]], HPSS- Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway. *I know I liked this, but I don't remember much about it so I can't warn you about any cliches. I do remember that there were a lot of cliches though.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1183701/1/][Let the Darkness Take You By: RadeliaPotter]]Harry goes back for his 6th yr. at Hogwarts to find that darkness is sweeping over them. He soon finds that the only people he can trust is none other than Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy. Better summary inside. Eventual slash! H/D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3823410/1/][Pantogogue by BC]] Slash SSHP. Severus' POV: Potter is changing in front of my eyes, gaining a disconcerting resemblance to Tom Riddle. As usual, it falls to me to save the brat... for the price of 'only' my soul.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/][In Care Of by Fang's Fawn:]] During the summer before sixth year, Harry finds an injured bat in the garden and decides to try to heal it...and an unwilling Snape learns just what kind of a person Harry Potter really is. No slash. Part 2 continued in "Tightrope." *A good read*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5054723/1/][The Shadow of the Other by atypicalsnowman]]: HP/SS Slash, slave!Snape. As a creature, Severus has long known he will need to bond with his mate or face being made a slave to the whole of wizardkind. For Harry, the news is a shock made more difficult by the awakening of uncomfortable desires. *Basically porn*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4124611/1/][Foolish Gryffindor by DEATHmuse]] Harry Potter u:06-30-2008 - Snape has Tourette's. Harry is aroused -- That is, until Snape retaliates. SSHP. *Basically crackfic porn.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3818539/1/Property-of-the-HalfBlood-Prince][Property of the HalfBlood Prince by thesewarmstars:]] During his sixth year, Harry becomes very attached to the previous owner of his Potions text, but what will happen when he finds out who it really is? SSHP *BDSM porn. If this is the one I am thinking of, it's unrealistic but enjoyable if you like erotica.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/][Catechism by Dreamfall]]: AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP +02-12-2011 *Very messed up abuse in this. Worse, it is a WIP that hasn't been updated since 2011! I still have hope!*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3659281/1/Walk-the-Shadows][Walk the Shadows By: jharad17:]] AU. The summer after 5th year, Death Eaters find Harry abandoned in the Dursley house and bring him to Voldemort. Will one particular Death Eater give up his position and his hate to save his enemy's son? Snape mentors Harry fic. violence,chld abuse,rape *For some reason I don't remember reading this at all. I probably saved it to read later.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6056949/1/][a few syllables short of a spell by Ayla Pascal]]: Romilda Vane is pregnant. A paternity test proves that Harry is the father, and she insists on marriage. Desperate, he calls on Draco and Snape for help in working out how she did it. Snape/Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094080/1/][Breaking Forwards by lastcrazyhorn: HP&OP.]] The professors no longer can scare Harry with talk of lost points, detentions or Quidditch suspensions. He's been beaten down for far too long, and he finally has reached his limit. Severus mentors, maybe guardian. Abuse, non-con, AU, evil!Ron *You've probably already heard of this story, but just in case I'll post it.*

Lomonaaeren has a lot of stories with severitus AND snarry. Her stories vary greatly in everything from writing style to personality of the characters. You may like one of her books but dislike another. Here are a few favorites [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6655048/1/Phoenix-at-Rest][Phoenix at Rest]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5428900/1/Practicing-Liars][Practicing Liars]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740583/1/Inter-Vivos][Inter Vivos]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9412759/1/A-Thousand-Days-of-Fire][A thousand days of fire]]

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=653&warning=4][Parseltongue-Tied by DementorDelta]]

I'm sure you've heard of Severus and The Crup by Josan but just in case [[http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/josan/hp/crup.html][here is a link to it.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2470334/5/The-Birthday-Present][The Birthday Present By: excessivelyperky]] Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.

Okay I am mostly done. The only thing I have left is just one more reply to myself where I will post fics that are very squicky for most people and I didn't want to post with the other stories without any warning.
