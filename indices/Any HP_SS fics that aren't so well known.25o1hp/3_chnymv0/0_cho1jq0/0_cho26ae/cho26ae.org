*This last post contains stories that most people would find inappropriate or wouldn't like. I kept them separate from the others for this reason.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6634756/1/Desiderium-Intimum][Desiderium Intimum By: arielgobuss]]. "You want it. You love to provoke me so I can break you. You love it when I do this. When I call you to order, when I break your resistance, when I punish you. You love... ' the voice became hoarse, 'to squirm at my feet. And you know that no one else can give you this. No one else can make you feel like that. And that is why that Potion pointed you toward me, Potter. " *Humiliation, manipulation, unhealthy relationship. If you dislike any of those things you will hate this .*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6587471/1/][Love In the Dark By: Hecateslover]] *Growing up on the streets did not prepare Harry for magic school. Then again, Hogwarts isn't prepared for him either. HPSS, many other pairings. SLASH, HET, FemSLASH, Dark!Harry. Rated M for a reason. Harry/Dean friendship.* This has chan in it so I'm putting it here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2142832/1/Incubus-Heredity][Incubus Heredity By: Tinkering]] PWP.Humil.UST.Hopefully you'll think it's a SQUEEE. Harry's got the dominant gene of a rare magical creature and the incident of an electric shock has awakened the gene.How will this change affect Harry's 7th year? *Porn. Harry is PERFECT LOOKING FEMININE SUB GUY. Everyone wants him. Lots of cliches, which is why I am putting this here. I still liked it, IIRC*

The Corvus Fallere series is made up of two books. It is basically a story of a dystopian world where voldemort won. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are taken by Snape and trained and manipulated mentally, emotionally, and physically/sexually. It's beautifully written and I am glad I read it, but I'd be lieing if I didn't say I felt sick at times while reading it. I don't really consider it porn since the sex is just a tool rather than the main point of the story, in my opinion.The first book can be found [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=1703&chapter=all][here]] The second book can be found [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=mousewrites&keyword=CF&filter=all][here]].

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2736739/1/][Light on the Dark Side of Me by cocoa-snape:-]] Harry comes into his sexuality & discovers he wants Snape. Intense occlumency lessons pull these 2 together, but is Snape too troubled or too dark to return HP's affections? DE meetings & Dumbledore stir the already boiling pot, HPSS Slash, Angst COMPLETE *I put this here because I don't remember anything about it, but I do know there was a story with a premise similar to this that I hated. So I am putting this here just in case.*

*Are any of these interesting to you? Do you have any you can share with me?*
