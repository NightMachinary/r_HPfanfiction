I really enjoyed linkffn(6782408)

It sorta has major character death? But it's within the first few chapters, not a huge build up to it. I would say here who it is so you can decide for yourself, but I'd rather not give any spoilers, even small ones. Pm me if you're interested and want to know who dies.

But it's based on recovering from child abuse, and is a Severitus.

Maybe it's not lesser known, exactly, but I don't see it recommended enough.
