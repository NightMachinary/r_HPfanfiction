So it is therefore necessary to recognize that a shorter piece is going to accomplish less, seem not quite as good even in some cases, to a piece that is of similar quality but is significantly longer, giving you more content that you like. The flip side of that is, in order to qualify as amazing, a full fic has to hold up to that standard for let's say 20/30 chapters maybe getting away with a few hiccups, while a one shot by definition only has to keep it up for one, though the margin of error is by consequence significantly smaller.
