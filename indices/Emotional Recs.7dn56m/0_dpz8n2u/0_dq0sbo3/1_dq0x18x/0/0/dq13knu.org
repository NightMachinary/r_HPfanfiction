Ah, gotcha. I read far more one-shots than epic-length fic, partly because I incline toward ship fic and character studies rather than plotty adventure or rambling slice-of-life fics. Which is the opposite of my non-fannish tastes, where I rarely read short stories and usually have three or four novels going at once.

Apparently what I seek in fanfic is - at least most of the time - better condensed into a short form. Long works can be extremely detailed and absorbing, but the ones that satisfy me are few and far between. I haven't given a lot of thought to why, but it may be due to my preference for a more lyrical or language-conscious style. Long fics tend to have fairly straightforward prose as a general rule, and that sometimes wears down my interest. Also, characterization and pacing tend to suffer more in long works.

Anyway, sorry, I'm mumbling off on a tangent here. Thanks for the clarification.
