I definitely appreciate fics that make consciousness and judicious use of language. Hell, right I have Romeo and Juliet on replay via audiobook not because of the plot (its a tale of lusty and ridiculously overemotional twats...I mean tweens) but because I absolutely fell in love with Romeo and Benvolio's discussion where Romeo waxes laconic about love and Rosaline.

While I tend to avoid ship-centric fics in general, my philosophy isn't really so much that short is bad. But more that if I like a work, I at least think it natural to want more of it. Take A Black Comedy for example. A fun romp that is a good length all on its own. But given the choice, would have say scenes of Riddlebottom and Harry at the Wizengamont or more interaction between Harry and his "alternate" relatives. Of course. Add in that at least half the time shorter length fics are just only partially completed and abandoned works rather than full works on their own, and my tendency is to avoid them as a rule unless the description really catches my eye or it is an author I recognize.

In regards to characterization and pacing, I mean intentionally limiting yourself to a one-short can be helpful as an author to reel you in sure, but bad characterization in a longer fic is because the author needs to work on that area, not because the work is longer. What /can/ happen is that characterization gets in the way of pacing and plot, and the longer the fic the more this disruption is magnified.

And maybe I'm a bit weird but I don't actually see that as a problem? The issue is most pronounced in SI or time travel fics and is especially prevalent in Naruto fics as well as Harry Potter (if you will excuse the digression) and the grandaddy of SI fics in that area is Dreaming of Sunshine. I supremely enjoy it, but it seems almost like clockwork you will get folks complaining either canon is being stuck to tpo closely, or it is sticking too long on content from filler episodes of the anime that many folks just skipped over because they don't actually change the plot of the main story. But to my mind, I like these characters, I like this world and I like seeing them interact. Why would I want to skip over some of it? I guess with fanfiction there is a little worry of a work being abandoned, and there are future events that I may look forward to sure, but given the choice of 20,000 words that I like and 50,000 words that I like, why wouldn't I take the latter? So to me pacing issues aren't not note-worthy so much as almost a benefit. Though again Im probably a bit off the reservation. I mean id be perfectly happy on a digression on way too in depth analysis like this bit I happened to write in a post a long time ago:

Despite the fact that Britain is a major power in the international community (admittedly mostly via Dumbledore, though the implied earlier magical history might contribute), Magical Britain was left on its own to almost break down into a condition not much better than the 90's Balkans with one side aiming to imitate 1994 Rwanda. Keep in mind that Magical Britain, via Dumbledore, essentially defeated the magical version of Hitler (in threat of taking over Europe, if not in policy) single-handedly, yet a couple of decades later this is how they are repaid? What happened that no one else offered aid, even in evacuation if not in military support? Keep in mind, even if you assume that Dumbledore didn't head up the ICW during the First Voldemort War, he would have been elected head less than 10 years after it had ended.

Sorry for the rambling. There's not exactly a lot of places to talk about this sort of thing
