I'm in complete agreement with you. Fic amazing-ness is subjective. However what are the chances of someone reccing a fic they like - and that the OP will also like - being a hidden gem? Hahaha, to me the first sentence of the request sounds really funny.

And what's even going on with this post? People get downvoted left and right, the OP is nowhere in sight. Something is fishy here.

PS: the summary of 'The Power...' sounds really cracky.
