Linkffn(Seeking Ginny be Casca) is probably the fic that evokes the most emotion in me. It's fantastic, and probably the best romance fic I've read in the HP genre. That said, it is Harry/Ginny, which you mentioned you didn't want. I will say that it was written before HBP, so Ginny's characterization is way different than in canon. She's basically an OC.

The other one I'd mention is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry by The Seeker]]. It's a story about caring for a child who suffered abuse in their past. It's actually quite touching. There's no romance in this at all.

Neither of these meet the specific details you requested, but both are extremely emotional and you would probably enjoy them if I read them. I think it's safe to say both of these fics make me cry every time. Hope you enjoy them.
