This is a Harry/Order drama. Although I'm not sure if drama is precise enough, it's closer to tragedy.

The basic premise is Harry being moved to Grimmauld place in the summer after fifth year; a deconstruction of the 'Harry barely lets earth shattering shit affect him' trope that is prevalent in canon. This Harry is /not/ okay after Sirius' death; he's angry, confused and sad almost to the point of the despair. The Order tries to help him; unfortunately they barely have a clue and continuously make things worse.

I don't normally like such stories, but this is unique, in that Harry isn't a doormat like usual and it's got /zing/. It pushes all my emotional buttons. And all the character voices have a twist of authenticity in them.

The author abandoned this before the Severitus part played any role in the plot - the last chapter is basically a summary of what she intended to do in later chapters. I think it's worth reading regardless - I read this back in 2004 and it's stayed with me to this day, one of those fics that for reason you never forget.
