The only evidence of anything nefarious happening would be the disappearance of a person, if the culprit uses the full range of magic.

Then it's just a matter of good ol' investigative work. Motives, Alibis, possible suspects, witnesses,... and probably to look for the traces of magic. Impossible angles, unopened doors, a piece of carpet that is just a bit too clean, and so on and so forth.

The legal and justice system may be corrupt, but the executive branch probably works fine as long as a case isn't entangled with politics.
