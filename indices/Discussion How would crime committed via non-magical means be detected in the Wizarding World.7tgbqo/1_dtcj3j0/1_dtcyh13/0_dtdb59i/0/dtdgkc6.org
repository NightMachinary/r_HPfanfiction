That is not an entirely unreasonable assumption. Though, the example also indicates that wizards are mentally rather lazy. Even if magic were limited to turning corpses into bones and not easier to dispose of materials his reaction to having these bones was not to further crush them or to leave them where a lot of other bones are but to use the most traditional and conventional disposal method for a murder victim - a shallow grave in a garden for a dog to dig up. Can you imagine how much harder it would have been to figure the murder out even if only he had buried the bones in an actual graveyard?
