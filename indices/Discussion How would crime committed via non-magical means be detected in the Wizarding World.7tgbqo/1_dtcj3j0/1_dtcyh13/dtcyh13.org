Yes, but the Vanishing Spell does not undo the item being vanished. One example we have is a mouse that remains as a /wiggling/ tail after the spell was used on it. This indicates the spell has more to do with splinching than truly destroying an object, and items can be un-vanished.

It's probably safer just to transfigure the corpse into a piece of scrap paper and burn that.
