None at all, especially considering that you can make a body disappear completely with ease (transfigure into pebble and then dump in a river 500 miles away).

But if we are staying completely away from magic for the murder, there will be no evidence for magical authorities to find. A bullet alone does not betray the offender, and simply vanishing it afterwards takes care of any evidence they could find. Easy as pie.
