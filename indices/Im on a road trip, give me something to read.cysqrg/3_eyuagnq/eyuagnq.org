Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Heist story. Hermione wants revenge on Malfoy by emptying his vault. Harry and Ron become aurors with no idea about what Hermione is plotting.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Science! Academia! Math! Magic! Figured out something interesting? Let's write an article about it! Maybe you'll get the Gamp prize!

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Brutal war fic. When Voldemort gains influence and the Minister does nothing because 'Appeasement politics', when 'Don't buy from mudbloods' can be seen in Diagon Alley, when muggleborns get thrown out of Hogwarts, it's time to fight back. Luckily for Hermione, there's a lot of books about how a small number of guerilla fighters can bring down a country. Oh, and they have an excellent explosives expert on their team.
