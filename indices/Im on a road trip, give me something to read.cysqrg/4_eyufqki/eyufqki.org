*The secret language of plants series by Endrina*. Drarry but no Death Eater apologia. Socialist takeover of Hogwarts by radicalized Slytherin students. Harry dances houses into existence with his Walkman. No bashing except for slight Dumbledore bashing, basically the story takes canon Aberforth's opinion of Dumbledore as closer to the truth (he's brilliant and means well but isn't nearly as wise as people think he is, and he makes terrible mistakes). linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10181825]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12821004]])

*Stealing Harry'verse by copperbadge*. Wolfstar. Sirius never goes to Azkaban and he and Remus move close to Privet Drive to keep an eye on Harry. They steal him when they realize the Dursleys are abusing him. Dumbledore makes them hide away in an unpronounceable Welsh village when the loss of the blood protection allows Death Eaters to attack Harry. Attempt at series re-write that sputters out in the third year, but is pretty original and exciting while it lasts. Has explicit interlude fics but the main stories I'm linking are T rating. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/992265]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/992558]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000039]])

*boy with a scar series by dirgewithoutmusic* Various pairings that are not central. Stories are not a chronological series but rather re-imaginings of canon if things had gone a bit differently. Harry raised at Hogwarts. Ron or Neville being the BWL. If the Dursleys had died and Lily took Dudley in. If Petunia had raised Harry like a son. May leave you frustrated that amazing AU ideas were given such a swift treatment. I've linked the ones I like, there are more. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3454106]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7809337]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861]])
