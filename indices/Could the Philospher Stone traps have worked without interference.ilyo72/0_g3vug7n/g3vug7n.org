My headcanon, which is even less supported by anything, is that Dumbledore lied about going to the Ministry, intending for Quirrell to tip his hand.

All the teachers would have known he was up to something after that little stunt during Harry's first Quidditch match. They just couldn't legally do anything without proof, such as catching him red handed at something.

This is why Dumbledore flew out, he really just Disillusioned himself when out of sight and doubled back in hopes of catching Quirrell in front of the mirror (which would have counted as attempted theft of the stone).

The Headmaster is the most magically-powerful person in Hogwarts at that time so it'd be the least messy fight, plus he has an excuse for being there the other teachers didn't (he's the only person who knows the last line of defense, so he's the one who should be checking on that).

He was counting on Voldemort's involvement somehow - either by converting Quirrell to his cause or via magical means. He wasn't counting on /Harry's/ presence in the plot.
