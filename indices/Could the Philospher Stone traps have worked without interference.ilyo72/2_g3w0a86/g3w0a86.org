Anyone who actually makes a concerted effort to obtain the stone from Hogwarts is either too unthinking to be a danger or too powerful to stop. Thus, I always thought it was all just designed to delay whomever was going to steal the stone. There's not much you can do to stop a relatively powerful magical (Voldemort getting away with robbing Gringotts) if they really put their minds to it (also, incompetent Harry and co managed to rob Gringotts too) so delaying them and keeping them in place until you can get your Dumbledorean Trump Card there is about all you can do.
