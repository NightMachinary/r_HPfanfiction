Yes it could have worked. My belief is that all the safeguards other than the mirror were a smokescreen with the mirror being the true trap. Dumbldore couldn't put truly lethal or dangerous traps in the middle of a school filled with children but the mirror wasn't directly lethal it was meant to trap the thief until dumbledore could capture them.
