For what I remember from french fanfictions there were a bunch of somewhat good dramione, a whole lot of mary-sues going to hogwarts with the protagonists and falling in love with harry (or draco) and seldom hidden gems focusing on left out characters. I guess the problem is the way they are written, it always sound forced and remind me of the essays you're forced to write for your french teacher in high school, way too academic.
