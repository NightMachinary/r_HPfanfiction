I read also in Hungarian fics, you can also found some really good original stories and lots of good translations (and of course bad ones also). The reason to begin the English ones was some good Hungarian translation but I got impatient and went to the source. The Hungarian translator of the books was a genius, lot of names and terms are different so I needed to learn the English terms.
