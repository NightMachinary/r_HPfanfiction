You know those beginner fanfics in the early 2000s? They are kind of like that. More casual and colloquial than is common. Most languages use a different style for their written part of the language and if someone writes how they speak it is odd. German is a rather complex language to write in (four cases, gendered nouns, longer sentences) and in the oral part it is more simplified and that's the way I remember most German fanfics to be.
