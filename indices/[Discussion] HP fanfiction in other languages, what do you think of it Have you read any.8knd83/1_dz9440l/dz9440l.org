I have read many German fanfics (also from other fandoms) and they are weird. There is a certain style that all German fanfiction writers use (or used; I haven't read a German fanfic since 2004 or so). It's just cringe worthy in my opinion. You also get that in English but I haven't found one good German fanfic.
