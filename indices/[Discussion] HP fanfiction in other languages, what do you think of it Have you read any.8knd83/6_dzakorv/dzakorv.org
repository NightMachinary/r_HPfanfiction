I read a few in german... or rather, I began to read a few. They tend to be really awful overall.

I think the main problem with German is that most authors writing in German have to get over their "OMFG lets get /fancy-fucking-fabulous/ with the writing" phase, which may or may not end with maturity. German is incredibly versatile - any language with rules for compound words tends to be. But German even opens up sentence structures and whatnot at your leisure. Its insane, and I understand anyone who gives up on learning the language because there is literally an exception to /every single grammatical rule/, and Mr. or Ms. Fancyauthor loves to write exclusively in exceptions.
