I've read some German ones and while it is weird (Note: I am German and it is my native language, but I've read the HP-Books in English from the get go because I read them first when I was already 19 (they just flew under the radar before my then GF gave them to me!)...and reading them in German (and HP fanfiction in German) is weird, especially since the translations are off! They also translated names, which to me is a capital crime (note: I went to a foreign language school so I am capable of translating English into German and vice versa very well!), like Hermione becomes Hermine (sorry, but: Does not compute!) or the Knightbus becomes Der Fahrende Ritter (I think...I don't like remembering what I consider butchery and mutilation!)):

There were still some decent ones!

I'd love to try Spanish ones, but I've got a lot of work ahead to get my Spanish to that level (don't want to try that before I am speaking the language decently...did that with English! I read the Lord of the Rings (complete edition!) in English when my English was still pretty shoddy...It took me 6 months to read that bloody book! It was worth it, sure but it was still annoying to have to look up every 3rd-5th word at first!)
