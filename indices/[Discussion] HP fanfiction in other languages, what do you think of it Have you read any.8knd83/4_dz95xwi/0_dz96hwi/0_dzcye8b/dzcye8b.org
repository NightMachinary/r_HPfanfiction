Indeed, hell most of my reading these days is done in English (most books are writen in English - makes sense as most decently educated people have learned that language at school, not to mention that there are a ton of native speakers (the British, the Australians, the Americans, the Canadians...etc. etc.))...I only read a few German things (my native language) like my local newspaper! Books only if I can't get an English version :) (I don't want to end up like many other people who've learned a language in school and later lost their proficiency! Nope, nope, nope not going to happen to me!)
