I'm French, but most of the fanfictions I read are in English. I do enjoy reading them in my native language, however there aren't that many french fics in the first place. If I want to read something specific, or about a particular romance, I'm very limited.

Many authors who aren't native English speakers will still write in English so their story can reach as many readers as possible. Because of that, you can find a lot of fics with interesting and unusual plot. I think it's really cool :)
