Norwegian is not the most expressive language, and the official HP translations are so cringeworthy and bad (quidditch=rumpeldunk, which is an unappealing word even without the added connotation of it sounding like slang for anal sex), so I would not want to read fan fiction in Norwegian (and I don't think I've ever seen one). The "problem" with non-native speakers writing in English is easily solved by getting a beta who fully masters the language, and problems I see in fics by writers who say "not my native language" are also present in fics written by English native speakers who don't use betas. I tried reading French fan fiction, to see if I could keep up. However, having only read the first book in French I quickly realized that "no, my French us not good enough", and also that some of the HP-specific words and names were so different in French that I lost track completely.
