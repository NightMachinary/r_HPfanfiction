This is slash again (I read everything!) but I just remembered Two Households, Both Alike in Dignity ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/205899]]) by mad_martha. She builds a lot of details around magic, religion, and culture that feel rather appropriate to the Harry Potter universe. It's also an AU with a Slytherin Harry, but not a creepishly ambitious one. Written prior to HBP, which is a fave time period of mine.
