Darkly Loyal, Flight, and The Legacy, all three by Keira Marcos. Her worldbuilding is just incredible, and I have enjoyed every fic she's written in the HP universe, though those are my top three.

â€‹

Swung by Serafim linkao3(9821300) and the Of a Linear Circle series linkao3(11284494) starting with the first installment, all by flamethrower. The worldbuilding here is so amazing and well thought out that I just spent the last two months straight reading these fics in every spare moment available. And if you like 'em long, plotty, with exquisite worldbuilding, /and/ magnificent pacing, this is it right here.
