I'm thrilled to hear it! Swung was the first fic I'd ever read by flamethrower, and it just astounded me with its quality. I hope you enjoy the other fics as well! (Though definitely mind the tags in Darkly Loyal...as it says on the tin, it's a dark fic, but satisfying in a John Wick/Equalizer revenge story sorta way.)
