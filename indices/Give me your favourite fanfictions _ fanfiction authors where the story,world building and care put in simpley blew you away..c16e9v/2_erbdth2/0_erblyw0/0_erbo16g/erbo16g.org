Yeah I dropped it after 4th year. The worldbuilding elements were interesting (though not to my taste) but the real killer was the sheer level of angst... and worse, repetitive angst. Harry doesn't so much have a character arc as a character loop. You could strip 500,000 words of filler armchair psychology out of the series and lose no meaningful plot, characterisation or worldbuilding elements.
