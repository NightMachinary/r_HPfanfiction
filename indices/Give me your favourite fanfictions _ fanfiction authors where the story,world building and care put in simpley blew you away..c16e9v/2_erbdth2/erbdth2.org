It's not for everyone -- and some of it is just gruesome and disturbing -- but for world-building I don't think most can beat Lightning on the Wave ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]). They wrote like 2.3 million words of an alternate universe with the most amazing details about magic and magical society. It's quite a saga though.
