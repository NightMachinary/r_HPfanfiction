[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]], easily. Setting aside the excellently-written characterization, plot, and so on, there's an amazing level of care given to make everything and everyone sound like they were living 80 years ago, from the slang, word choices, and the slightest little details like ration stamps and book titles.

For that reason alone it's one of my favorite fics to read, just to feel the immersion.
