May I recommend linkao3(15430560), In the Bleak Midwinter which is about Hermione going back in time to raise Tom Riddle with the Riddle family.

I'm also reading: linkffn(13275002), The Imposter Complex about Diary-Tom, and linkffn(10942056), crawlersout, which doesn't feature Tom much (small primary character) but is set in his time period. Crawlersout starts off a little...slow and in a sort of disconnected tone but the story is grounded when Tom leaves the orphanage.

There's also the Evil Overlord List which is often recommended on this sub but it doesn't follow the same tone as the other stories (including Birds of a feather) since it's a crackfic (?).

Edit: Also linkao3(16480832), Carpe Noctem. Voldemort goes back in time, redo story. Redo his taking over of the world that is.
