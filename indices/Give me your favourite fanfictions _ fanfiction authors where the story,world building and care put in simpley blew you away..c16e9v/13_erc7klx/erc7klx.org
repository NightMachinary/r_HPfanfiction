I absolutely love the world building in LinkFFN(The Odds Were Never In My Favor)

It is a Fem!Harry with Neville as the BWL. It has an interesting dynamic between the Light and Dark and what the goals of the two sides are. Magic is interesting and the politics going on are well done and consistent within the story.
