Not HP, but my favorite worldbuilding fics have probably been To The Stars linkffn(7406866) and Mother of Learning linkfp(2961893).

Within HP... You named a lot of the good ones, but I'd add the recently completed Black Princess series linkffn(8233291). There's some major triggers in that one, though. MC starts out in a child brothel as a former worker who 'aged out' and keeps it running after her departure. She's also perfectly happy with killing out of convenience.
