Since we're doing long fics anyway... All the Young Dudes is, imo, the best marauders era fic ever written (though I would love to be proven wrong). The world building and attention to detail for era-specific pop culture references are amazing. It is a remus/sirius slash fic, but even if that's not your thing, it's the best characterization of Remus I've ever read. Warning: it's cannon compliant and goes all the way through 1997. linkao3(All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89)

The absolute best AU I've ever read is linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste). It's a complete rewrite of the original series, but the author does an excellent job of skipping over 80% of the story that would just be repetition from the books, only jumping in when events turn out significantly different. Snape is still just as awful, Dumbledore is just as morally complicated, and Harry is just as confused, if a bit more studious when it comes to potions. It's the ultimate fix-it fic.
