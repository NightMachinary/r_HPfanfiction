Just make me sob while bringing up All the Young Dudes. It is without a doubt my favorite fic in existence. I routinely go back to reread it. I'm also very honored that MsKingBean89 wrote a two-part sequel for me. Linkao3(out of the blue by mskingbean89)

Even if you're not interested in slash and have never liked WolfStar - read it. It'll change your life and make you cry a thousand tears.
