Basilisk Born by Ebenbild

This expanded so MUCH on the history of the wizarding world, as it takes place many many years ago, as harry is transported to the past. Its plot is kind of complicated to explain properly without writing around an essay, so I'll just link it so you can read the story.

Edit : I screwed up the link, here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]
