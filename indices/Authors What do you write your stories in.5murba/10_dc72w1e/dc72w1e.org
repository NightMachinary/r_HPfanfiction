Google Docs.

I can write everywhere, anytime, especially since Docs introduced offline functions into their mobile apps.

I got a very busy day and a 1 hour commute. I often use that hour to re-read what I wrote and pre-edit grammar and typos. Plus I like writing in my browser.

The comment function is also wonderfully practical, plus there are a lot of plug-ins that make your life easier.
