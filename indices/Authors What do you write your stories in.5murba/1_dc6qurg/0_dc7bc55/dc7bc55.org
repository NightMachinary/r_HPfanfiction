That's really cool.

I have similar goals to you for remote editing and the like. Having no experience with LaTeX but being a Redditor, I ended up settling on using Markdown (and storing my works in a Git repo).

Conveniently, there are WYSIWYG editors for Markdown and easy ways to export to HTML for distribution. I'm currently following the development of [[http://abricotine.brrd.fr/][Abricotine]] quite closely. My other like of Markdown is the way its syntax seems fairly intuitive to read plain

An example from one of my drafts:

#+begin_example
  # Chapter 8(?)
  ## The Hall of Records

  The door was plain and black, just like everything else on the Ministryâ€™s
  lowest level. A small black plaque sat in its centre, reading simply *Hall of
  Records*. Harry straightened his robes slightly and rearranged the files
  under his arm, before pushing open the door and stepping inside.
