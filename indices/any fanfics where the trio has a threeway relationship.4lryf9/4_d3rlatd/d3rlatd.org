I'd recommend linkao3(3499913) with a fair few caveats. It really, really earns its rating - there is a lot of violent and graphic stuff here. If you can get past that, it does have a lot of juicy character stuff that is better than it has any right to be. Having said that I couldn't finish it, not because of the graphic stuff but because it is super emotionally draining to read - apparently 150k words (Not even halfway!) of everyone being a psychological basket case is my limit. Do give it a go though, if I haven't put you off it too much, there is a lot to like.
