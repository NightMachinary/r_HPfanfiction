You and me both - as in this combination (if Ron and Harry don't become wipped!) they balance out each other's flaws (so you can basically have a trio that really amounts to something - unlike in the canon end (sorry: One of the worst endings in a book-series I've ever read...not that the last two books are all that great as whole -.-)) perfectly (Ron and Harry make short work of Hermione's total obedience toward authority and total trust in book-knowledge, Ron has the information on pureblood-culture the other two lack, Hermione makes them learn (breaks the habbit of them slacking off) and Harry destroyes the prejudices both Ron and Hermione have (both have some, not the same of course!) and acts as a buffer in what would otherwise be a relationship that IMHO has no future!)
