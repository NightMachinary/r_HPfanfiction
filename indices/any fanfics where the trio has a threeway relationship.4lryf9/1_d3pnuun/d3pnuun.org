I'm also looking for more Harry/Hermione/Ron threesome fics, but so far I have found only two I like:

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), has a different trio, with Theo Nott replacing Ron. Although fairly short, that story is pretty good though.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), only hints at a three way romantic relationship between the Trio. [[/spoiler][However, they did sleep together, and they accidentally created a soul bond between them while experimenting with soul magic]]
