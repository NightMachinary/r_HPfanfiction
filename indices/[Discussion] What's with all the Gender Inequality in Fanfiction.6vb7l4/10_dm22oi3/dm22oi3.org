We need to fix this with action hero Hermione.

Harry Potter / Crank

Time travel to the very second she grabbed her wand from Olivander. She died, she's pissed, and she needs to kill someone every 30 minutes for 3 days to stabilize the magic holding her in the past or she stays dead in the future. Fortunately she happens to know 72 people who need killing RIGHT NOW.
