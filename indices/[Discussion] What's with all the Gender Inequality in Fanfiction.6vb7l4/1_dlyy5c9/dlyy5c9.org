Usually, from what I've read it's Hermione and sometimes Ginny who thinks this because they don't want to end up like Molly. The Hermione ones go with some fabulous Ron/Weasley bashing because Ron doesn't want her to work and wants a bunch of children etc and Hermione doesn't want to be a "brood mare" like his mum. I've seen it done a couple of times with Ginny where she doesn't want to end up with so many children like her mother, or she doesn't want to have children early like Harry's mother.

It's kind of insulting in my opinion to reduce Molly Weasley to a brood mare. I don't exactly subscribe to the "Big Happy Weasley Family" epilogue and it's a bit baffling to me that she didn't work when they were so poor and all their children were at school but Molly Weasley being a house-wife and having 7 children didn't stop her from fighting in the war. It didn't stop her from killing Bellatrix Lestrange. Hermione and Ginny choosing to marry and have kids didn't stop them from having fulfilling careers. Hermione even became Minister of Magic. It is like many fanon tropes, stupid.
