Yeah I dislike Weasley bashing in general. It minimizes what the Weasleys did imo. They took a kid in and treated him like family, even when they may not have the resources to spare. Molly frets over him and Arthur gives him advice. Fornthe first time, he has people that actually worry over him. The family in general represents all the things that everyone wants in their life, love, hapiness, and good people. I'm with you on the big Happy Weasley family stuff.
