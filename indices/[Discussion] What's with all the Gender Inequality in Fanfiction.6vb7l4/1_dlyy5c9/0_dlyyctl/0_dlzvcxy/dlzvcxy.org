If a member of your family is abused/tortured and you do not inform the authorities then you are not treating your family right. Molly knew that he was starved and locked behind bars and she chose to send some food and threaten her kids with bars. Instead of ensuring that Harry does not have to return to an abusive environment.

That is the biggest shortcoming and failure of Molly Weasley.
