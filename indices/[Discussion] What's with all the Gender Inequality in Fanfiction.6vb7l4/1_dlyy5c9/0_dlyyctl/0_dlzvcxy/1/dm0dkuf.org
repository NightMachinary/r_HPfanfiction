Hmm... Is that the common sense of the modern world or the common sense of wizarding world? How does the people over the wizarding world solve problem like harry? Would that kind of common sense fit the setting or not?

I admit it is bad if it is happening in the real world, but in this fictional wizarding world, this may not be so, as people in that world may have their own perspective. This can be expanded in the world building, to be honest. So, not saying that your answer is right or wrong, but consider the society, culture, norms over the world you or the author are writing please.
