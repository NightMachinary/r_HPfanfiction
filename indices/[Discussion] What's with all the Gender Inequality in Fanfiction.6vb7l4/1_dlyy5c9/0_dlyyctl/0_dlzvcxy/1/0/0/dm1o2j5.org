Hmm... Why not? Like I've said, if Molly is being raised to only take care of Harry as a response of the abuse that harry experienced (this may due to several factors, like the availability of the government agency that handled cases like Harry (magical government only), how she is educated and whether this case is normal in wizarding world, again returning to the standard of what is normal, or other factors), this is the most appropriate response for molly. Call it ignorance or what, but the character do have its own sphere of information, culture, norms which had to be considered in how she act.

So, again, depending on the definition of tortured in Molly's perspective, and again, what is appropriate for helping. In perspective, open your law book that relevant to abuse, compare the law definition between now say, 50 to 100 years ago. Easy, right?
