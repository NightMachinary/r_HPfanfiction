  being a house-wife and having 7 children didn't stop her from fighting in the war.

Not to minimize her contribution, but there was only one open conflict and it was a last-ditch, all-or-nothing deathmatch. It's not like she was deployed to the front lines for months on end. She spent most of the war at home, just like everyone else who wasn't on the run.
