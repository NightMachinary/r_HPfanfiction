If you get paid in gold you should be able to pay for condoms. But the Weasleys chose seven kids they couldn't afford. They didn't even have the seven Galleons for Ron's wand and yet chose to have seven kids. Think about this. One or two pregnancies can be ab accident, but six? Having those kids, especially during a civil war, was simply irresponsible.
