I don't necessarily agree with that. Perhaps Molly had always wanted lots of kids and wasn't going to let Moldymort stop her. In the first war the Weasleys would not have been a threat as canonically they weren't members of any resistance (i.e. OotP) and were Pureblooded. The were next to nothing to Voldemort, like many Pureblood or Half-Blood families that hid in the background. What would have come from slaughtering them or trying to recruit them? They didn't have any money and they didn't outrightly oppose him. Also remember, Voldemort never took control of the Ministry in the first war. Arthur would not have been in the same level of danger that he faced in the second war.

War does funny things to the markets, perhaps the price of wands went up? Though it's not great to have a second hand wand, they always can afford the basic necessities for schooling and clothing and food. The Weasleys struggle but they are not destitute. The children never starve, they have clothes on their back and a roof over their head. Molly packs her children sandwiches on the train. They are frugal, that doesn't mean that can't afford the basics of life. She is still able to buy Ron dress robes and their books every year (even Lockhart's massive list). We know the Longbottoms were well off, but that doesn't stop Augusta from giving Neville his father's wand. Clearly, not everyone buys a new wand when they might have the financial ability to. People like Draco who have a very nouveau-riche feel would never be seen with a second-hand wand. And for muggle-raised witches and wizards like Harry, Hermione, and Dean they are forced to buy new wands. Seamus who's mum is a witch might not have a spare wand lying about. I think it's also canon that those who have died are buried with their wands, so I'd imagine it's rare for second-hand wands to be on the market -- leading it to be unlikely that someone not Pureblooded would have access to one. I wouldn't be so quick to say that the Weasleys were unfit to take care of their children. We have no idea if they could've gotten Ron a new wand at the end of second without the Ministry lottery winnings, but it's never said anywhere else that any of the others didn't have new wands. Perhaps, Ron's first year was a bad year for Arthur and it would've been the largest amount of kids they'd had at school at once.
