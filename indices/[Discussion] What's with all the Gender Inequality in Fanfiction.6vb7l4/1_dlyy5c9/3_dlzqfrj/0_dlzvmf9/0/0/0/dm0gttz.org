I just don't think it is canon that just because you have a second hand wand, you're poor. And my other comments still stand, the Weasley children never wanted for everything. They had brooms to fly on for Quidditch, food on the table every night, new clothing when they grew out of their old ones (second-hand new, but Mrs. Weasley never used enlargement charms on the clothing if my memory serves-- so she bought "new" second hand robes when needed), Ron and Ginny are bought dress robes. They are provided with every book on their list. And they don't just get sweaters every Christmas-- they always receive other things so they never wanted. And clearly Mrs. Weasley went out and bought Ron a new watch for his 17th (I presume she did this with all of her children). So I think a second hand wand while not preferable or even remotely as good as a wand that chooses you, is still quite acceptable and it's not like she has him go off to Hogwarts without one.

I'm about 100% positive Rowling admitted at some point she screwed up the numbers on the exchange rate and wands definitely factored in on that miscalculation.
