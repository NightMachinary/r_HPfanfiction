I have to say I think it would've been a bit difficult for Molly to work full time if they never had the resources to have a babysitter/nanny at any point. From 1970 (Bill was born) until 1992 (Ginny attends Hogwarts), Molly was giving birth and taking care of children at home. It could be argued that perhaps she could have left Ginny and Ron in the care of Fred/George/Percy, and then perhaps Ginny in the care of Ron at some point. But the eldest age her child babysitting would be was 11. And I don't think that's quite old enough to take care of a child... especially considering accidental magic and the twins!

Perhaps if early on Molly and Arthur could have afforded care for Bill alone, they could've started out with a decent dual-income and progressively been able to have more children as the babysitting fee increased and they rose higher up/accumulated more savings. But even then, Molly was having a child about every 2 years (4 year gap between Charlie and Percy... and a one year gap between Ron and Ginny) and presuming magical pregnancy is the same as non-magical, she would be taking off a minimum of 3-6 months every other year. Depending on the magical paternity leave regulations she could be anything from unpaid in that time to full pay checks on leave. Or on the other hand with magic perhaps a woman is fully recovered in a day after pregnancy. Of course, most women in the muggle world at that time who were having children and working were barely able to take off a week to have a child (my mother in the 90's had two weeks vacation leave as her maternity leave). But with magical Britain being relatively equal perhaps there were no stigma to having multiple children and working. But for the most part, magical family seem to have very few children as the norm so perhaps Molly would've been looked down upon in the workforce.

This is all speculation. But I don't automatically agree that Molly would've been able to easily bear 7 children and have a full time job to help support Arthur, partially presuming that they weren't that well off to begin with.
