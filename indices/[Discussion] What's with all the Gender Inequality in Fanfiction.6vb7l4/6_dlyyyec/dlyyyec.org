That's why harems or a strong patriarchal Magical Britain made no sense under Canon setting. Many readers equate Magical Britain with Victorian England or even Feudal Europe, and thought it was too dominated by males.

If polygamy was ever a thing in Magical Britain, it would be applied to both genders, where powerful and/or rich wizards and witches could both have their own harems.
