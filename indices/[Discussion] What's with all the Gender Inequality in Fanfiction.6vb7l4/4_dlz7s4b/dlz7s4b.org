That's interesting. I haven't read a whole lot of fics where the female lead fears being a broodmare, but I don't read on FF.net at all, so that may be why. I agree in the books the world is presented as reasonably equal (except where are all the lady goblins??), but at the same time a bit more old-fashioned as another commenter mentioned, so maybe these writers are getting their cues from how they perceive an old-fashioned world to be like? The popular view of the Victorian era is ladies in corsets and fainting couches, never mind all of the poor women who had to do whatever they could to keep their families alive. Pretty sure they weren't waiting around for the men to save them.

I have a dislike for weak "rescue me" female characters that lack agency, so that's something I try to avoid in my own writing. In my fics, Ginny is the rescuer as much as she's rescued. Wait, do I even have an instance where she needs to be rescued? Hmm...
