I don't read fics where goblins tend to show up, but now you mention it, maybe they're like Discworld dwarfs when it comes to gender---everyone uses "he" and appears male (especially by human gender norms) and early courting rituals involve subtle and sometimes awkward attempts at finding out what the desired partner's sex actually is.
