But are there any men who don't have any sort of career or breadwinningness and instead their primary focus is their family? My point was that in the HP books, women are shown with jobs, or they are shown with children, but with the exception of a handful of minor characters, they aren't shown with both. Men on the other hand are shown with both.

About those minor characters you brought up. Ravenclaw herself isn't actually a character who shows up in the novels and has been dead for hundreds of years. She's just talked about by a couple ghosts in a scene or two in the last book. Nor is Mrs Edgecombe a character. She's talked about by her daughter and Umbridge, but she doesn't herself show up. And Alice Longbottom is Neville's tragic backstory. Any agency on her part is entirely in the past, not actually part of the narrative. (For that matter, did she even keep working as an auror after Neville was born? Didn't the Longbottoms go into hiding pretty soon after his birth?)
