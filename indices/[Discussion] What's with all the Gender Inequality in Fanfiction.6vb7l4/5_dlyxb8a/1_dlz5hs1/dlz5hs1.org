  Looking outside the epilogue at adult women in canon, most fall into one of two roles: having no children or having their family be a key part of their character.

This is true of most men as well. There are only a handful of working males with kids (Arthur, Crouch Sr, Frank Longbottom, Amos Diggory) and a handful of working females (Rowena Ravenclaw, Mrs Edgecombe, Alice Longbottom). And Crouch Sr only got as far as he did by neglecting his family for work.

Wizards don't seem to bother with gender division in Quidditch and females are very well represented in areas like academia (Hogwarts professor seems to be one of the more prestigious jobs in canon) and reach high up in the ministry (Bones, Umbridge, Bagnold). I don't sexism is entirely absent in the wizarding world, but I do think it is more progressive than the muggle one when it comes to gender equality.
