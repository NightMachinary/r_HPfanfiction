  I see in so many fics where the female lead thinks, "omg! All I'm going to be is a brood mare"

This is pretty much how canon HP ends. (I know Rowling later made statements about what Hermione and Ginny got up after book 7 ended, but in the epilogue itself all that's presented is them and their husbands having lots of kids and sending them off to Hogwarts.) Looking outside the epilogue at adult women in canon, most fall into one of two roles: having no children or having their family be a key part of their character. You can be a transfiguration professor/undersecretary to the Minister/Azkaban-crazed Death eater or you can have be devoted to your family (e.g. Narcissa, Molly, Petunia), but you can't be both.

I can see why people would read the wizarding world (why not the /witching/ world?) as a place with deep-seated gender roles, despite Rowling's attempts at portraying a society progressive about gender. She didn't always do a good job with her world-building and often wrote in things that contradicted the moral she was trying to portray. This is just one instance of that.
