given that my only contribution to this conversation before your initial response was that I didn't think one example (singular) was a good one. I did not and still have not made any explicit categorical claims about equality, though it is implicitly apparent.

That aside, I don't know if I can give you what you want - it's certainly much easier to evaluate a situation than to attempt to create one that meets certain standards; it's why I'm a critic and not a writer, after all.
