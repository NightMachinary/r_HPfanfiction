So now we are comparing a fictional society of superpeople which is quite small compared to the amount of people in Britain to the US, a real world society which is many times larger than Britain.

Fine, fine.

I have read all the comments in this subthread, which make it clear to me that you do not want to be convinced. However, the people who argue against you make some very good points too.

I see only one answer: Make a fic in which you write the Wizarding World equal (call it the /magical/ world, if you want; /witching/ world is just as inequal as /wizarding/ world).

Alternatively, link one that you think has the most equal representation of the magical world.

Even more alternatively, you could dismiss this comment and call me something derogatory. However, the first two options are much better than this one, and I'm sure that you're better than someone who would choose this option.

I look forward to your recommendation/fic/answer.
