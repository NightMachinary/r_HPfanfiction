You know, I had a highly sarcastic remark ready for you, but I have decided to delete it and start over. If you want to know what it was about, I can tell you another time.

The thing that I wanted to know, from the first (admittedly annoyed) comment on is this:

"How would an equal HPverse look according to you?"

I was wondering about this because the main thing that had been happening in the discussion was you not acknowledging examples.

Could I have an answer to this, preferably without assumptions about myself?

Btw, nice quote. I'm flattered that you cared as much as to read my history. I admit once again, the first comment was not a very good one, even though I did so already in my second comment.
