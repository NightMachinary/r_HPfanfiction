It's true! I am confusing you and [[/u/completely-ineffable][u/completely-ineffable]] ! Funniest thing all day.

Implicitly apparent: true, though I would like to add that some people contribute different things to equality than others do- or so I'm led to believe. Which is why I ask these kinds of questions.

[[/u/completely-ineffable][u/completely-ineffable]], see last comment.
