I don't think correctly labeling your choice of conversational style is in any way derogatory, but clearly you're the only one of us allowed to disagree with things - after all, you begin from the presumption that I'm simply stubborn and refusing to engage with the evidence, instead of the more reasonable conclusion that I simply didn't find the evidence sufficiently compelling. I'm not sure how much more patronizingly superior you can be than claiming that I must be acting in bad faith, as otherwise I'd think exactly as you do.

I'm also a little uncertain as to what brought all of this on, and as to what you thought my initial contention was - the only point I had made in this thread was that just because some member of {minority group} is in a high position of power, that doesn't necessarily mean that they have attained full equality. I don't think that this is in any way contentious, and I provided one real life situation that reinforced that. My entire contribution to this discussion was suggesting that one specific piece of evidence was not particularly valid. I'm not sure how you managed to project all your other accusations onto me.

To quote someone I found on the internet - "How are you going to get anyone to listen if the first thing you do is insult the person you're discussing with?"
