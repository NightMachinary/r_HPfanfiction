I agree that the gender ratio for Hogwarts staff is pretty close to 1:1. But that wasn't my point.

My point was that from what we are shown of Wizarding Britain, men dominate positions of power or authority. Most positions at Hogwarts can't really be considered positions of authority in society. Sure, they have authority over children, but that's not the same thing. I would say Deputy Headmistress is a position with authority and could see a case for the heads of houses. But astronomy professor or groundskeeper or librarian are not positions of authority.

Outside of Hogwarts, power in Wizarding Britain is shown to be concentrated in the hands of men. That takes the form of most heads of Ministry departments we meet being men. It takes the form of Lucius Malfoy throwing money and influence around. It takes the form of Voldemort being really powerful in magic. It takes the form of Dumbledore being Dumbledore.

I think that part of why Rowling's world ends up being so skewed is that she shows us such a limited slice of it. This is understandable. The first few books are squarely magical-British-boarding-school stories. Of course most of what we see will be the magical boarding school. Of course most the adults we meet will be teachers or janitors or whatever.

(On a side note, it's kinda weird how starting from book 1, Dumbledore is portrayed as a really important person in Wizarding Britain. I get that to an eleven year old's mind their headmaster seems like one of the most powerful people in the world, but it's weird to take that child's perception and write it into the setting.)

I do think that Rowling set out to portray a gender egalitarian society. My understanding is that she's explicitly said such in interviews. But some of the decisions she made about how to tell that story, like the hyperfocus on magical boarding school, undermine that goal. (As all the Pottermore trivia mentioned in this thread attests, Rowling is able to avoid some of these issues when not confined by the needs of the story.) Also, while Rowling is writing about a fictional society, it's heavily based upon the real world, where things aren't so gender egalitarian. So things bleed through and some detail of real world sexism or gender roles gets incorporated into her world.

The end result is a world that has made some strides towards gender equality but still has noticeable strands of sexism. This gets exaggerated by some fanfic writers for whatever reason, but they are exaggerating from something that is present in the text.
