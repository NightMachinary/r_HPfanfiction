  The book is about a schoolboy who is orphaned and his only view of the wizarding world initially comes from Hogwarts. Her "decision" to "hyperfocus" on Hogwarts come from the fact that that's what the story is about.

I agree with all of this and none of it contradicts anything I said.

  I think the teachers at Hogwarts are pretty fundamental to wizarding Britain if you think about it,
#+end_quote

I certainly think that educators play an fundamental role in society, not just in fictional magic land but also in the real world. (I'm an educator as are both my parents.) But that's not the same thing as having authority or power. Looking at the real world, [[https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=28][most teachers in the US are women]] but this doesn't imply that the US is free of sexism or inequality or that women are equally represented in positions of power in the US.

  And I disagree. Lucius Malfoy is not in a position of power because he is a man... it's because he has a lot of money.

This is all irrelevant. The why of individuals isn't what I'm talking about, but rather the overall trend.

Let me put it this way. If, as you allege, Wizarding Britain is a gender egalitarian place, then why do we see so many more men than women in positions of power? There are some women, but they are outnumbered by men. Are we to believe that women in general just don't want those positions? That they're biologically inclined towards teaching or medicine or housewifing or whatever? Should I expect you to pull a James Damore?

  So I wouldn't consider that "all the people in power" are male, because they're not.
#+end_quote

Please don't put quotes around something like that if I didn't actually say it. That's dishonest. My claim was always "most", not "all". Indeed, I mentioned Bones a few comments above.
