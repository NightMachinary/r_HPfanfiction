I guess I just don't fundamentally agree with you. The book is about a schoolboy who is orphaned and his only view of the wizarding world initially comes from Hogwarts. Her "decision" to "hyperfocus" on Hogwarts come from the fact that that's what the story is about.

I think the teachers at Hogwarts are pretty fundamental to wizarding Britain if you think about it, most of the population will go there and teachers seem to work there almost up until they die for decades... affecting hundreds and hundreds of wizards and witches. All of the teachers are extraordinary at their subject. Snape is a revered potions master. Sprout is an incredible herbologist. Flitwick was a professional dueler and a master at charms. McGonagall and Dumbledore were /incredible/ at Transfiguration and Dumbledore is repeatedly one of the most accomplished wizards of the era. I honestly believe it's a major honour to be a teacher at Hogwarts -- except DADA. The only other teaching position that changes is Hagrid's promotion to Care of Magical Creatures professor. Many of the staff taught Mrs. Weasley and her brothers... I'm pretty positive Dumbledore taught McGonagall (iirc). Heck we know Dumbledore has been teaching for /at least/ 50 years because he taught Voldemort. I wouldn't discount Hogwarts professors just because they're teachers.

And I disagree. Lucius Malfoy is not in a position of power because he is a man... it's because he has a lot of money. And he uses that money for bribery, a woman is just as capable at that. That's not sexism or "inequality" that's just corruption and anyone is capable of that. I also wouldn't say that Voldemort is in a position of power. I wouldn't call male dictators getting where they are because of sexism and inequality. Though frequently they are rampant in sexist and unequal environments. I would look to the Ministry and actual heads of departments of which we are given four: Amelia Bones who is head of the DMLE and is technically the Head Aurors boss (Scrimgeour) -- this job is then given to Thicknesse for a year after Voldemort kills her and then Yaxley after Voldemort promotes Thicknesse to minister (so I really wouldn't even include either of them as heads because it was due to Voldemort's tactics), Ludo Bagman (head of Magical Games), and Barty Crouch (head of International Magical Cooperation) -- which was a demotion from his previous position as head of the DMLE. And then we have Fudge and Umbridge in the Minister's office. So essentially other than Fudge Amelia Bones is perhaps the highest up in the Ministry and is one of only three confirmed heads of department that we're aware of. The Auror department is under the DMLE. So I wouldn't consider that "all the people in power" are male, because they're not. And the second highest person in the Ministry is Amelia Bones. And Fudge's "right hand" man is Umbridge.

I personally think you're just trying to see the wizarding as unequal when it's put together incredibly well, as well as quite equal from the viewpoint of an 11-17 year old muggle raised wizard. And you can't come up with excuses that this is Rowling's downfall. You're missing the point of the books if we're going to start arguing about what Rowling's plot should've been in order to show the world. It's the Harry Potter fandom for a reason, we should be thankful Rowling gave us such a fleshed out beautiful world to explore and dig our hands into. It's not perfect-- the treatment of house elves and other magical creatures as well as the blood purity issues are rampant but at the end of the day in every way possible Rowling showed us a lot of gender equality. Umbridge is as big as a bitch as Voldemort. Bellatrix is a high up DE. Lily Potter sacrificed her life. Narcissa helped save HP for her son. Molly was a stay-at-home mom, while Tonks and Alice were aurors. Amelia Bones was one of the highest members of the Ministry. There's nothing wrong with a woman not working, that's showing equality too. Just as there are women of all different backgrounds with different strengths and weaknesses and equally as awful and some of the male characters.
