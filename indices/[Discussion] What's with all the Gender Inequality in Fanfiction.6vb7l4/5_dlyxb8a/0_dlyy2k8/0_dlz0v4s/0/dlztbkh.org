Per your "edit"-- if we're disregarding Pottermore/Cursed Child/anything outside of the original 7. Then Harry and Ron and none of the Hogwarts crew have jobs. So we can't use that as evidence either.

What I do have to stress is that the books do focus on school kids-- primarily an orphan in the muggle world. So Rowling's examples are just a mere snapshot that fit with the story and what Harry's most likely knowledge would be/any likely conversations he could have that would advance the plot. So with woman: we know that there are five teachers at Hogwarts who are female (Sprout, Trelawney, McGonnagal, Sinistra, Grubbly-Plank), as well as Pomphrey, Pince, and Charity Burbage (who we don't meet until book 7 at her death). Male teachers there are Snape, Flitwick, Binns, and Hagrid. Then there is Dumbledore and Filch. All but one of the DADA teachers are male. None of the above do we have any idea about children, except that Dumbledore, Snape, and Hagrid have none.

So essentially there is a 50/50 split if we give Dumbledore an extra point for being Headmaster. Though McGonnagal is Deputy so she could get an extra point, but I won't. The Heads of Houses are split ½ and ½ as well. Even when Voldemort is in power and Burbage is murdered and Snape becomes headmaster it's still 50/50. And the twin Carrows (a boy and a girl) are still given the same powers and "responsibility" for torturing children. So I say Hogwarts is even ground and can't be looked at for sexism or inequality and there's no proof that any of the teachers do or don't have children, which wouldn't make sense for the professors to share unless they had a child attending Hogwarts in the first place.

Within the Ministry, it can be presumed that none of the higher-ups male or female have children, which I think says more about being in power and not having children than it does about inequality and women in high positions giving up child-bearing. Amelia Bones, Umbridge, Fudge, and Scrimgeour are the only high-high ups I can think of who never are revealed to have children. While Crouch essentially looses his family in his greed for power in the Ministry. To me, it's less about less women in power at a high ranking level and more about high ranking Ministry officials not having children. Children and family are not seen as a way to make it in the Ministry and men and women make the decision to have none to succeed. -- I would not include Pius Thicknesse as a man in authority simply because he was in power through Voldemort's orders and a strong Imperius curse.

There is only one confirmed stay-at-home mom in canon and that's Molly. Nobody else is revealed to be a stay-at-home mom. Technically as some people have brought up so is Xenophilius though he works from home. Lovegood unlike Molly however only has one child and is a widower so his need to work is quite different from hers. It's never known whether he started the Quibbler after his wife died (and we know she was a Potions-master) to have an income or what.

Lucius and Narcissa are never confirmed to do anything so I'd put them at the same level.

Among other characters there's no conclusive evidence to suggest that there's any inequality in the wizarding world. I'm not including members of the Order as that being their "occupation" because for Arthur and other Ministry workers it was supplemental, for others it was the only "work" they did (Sirius, Remus, and Molly for instance). Tonks and Kingsley (and Dawlish) are the only current aurors we are introduced to. Both Alice and Frank made it as aurors and presumably when Neville was born and they went into hiding, both of them did.

Tonk's father is never revealed to have a job and neither is Andromeda. Technically, Tonks had a job and Remus didn't. Though he's not stay-at-home dad, his wife is the bread winner. Don't know what that counts in your definitions of working, etc.

I would call any of these characters "background characters." Our canon takes place in a school and so anyone outside the Weasley, teachers, and Hogwarts students are background characters, even then most of the teachers are background and so is the Weasley family. It's hard to pull the "women in this story who work are never met and don't have any story themselves" when our main three are children. Heck, even in Rowling's muggle world, both of Hermione's parents are dentists and Petunia doesn't work because she is so concerned with appearance and normalcy in a muggle world where most women didn't work. I'd say Rowling does a fairly decent job at promoting equality and virtually no signs of sexism (when Hermione and Lily are praised for their intelligence it has less to do with them being girls and much more to do with being muggle-born). Ginny is carte-blanc seen as a powerful witch, and that's about the end of it. I don't agree there's inequality in the gender sense or even racially. It seems to be by blood and creature. Even in terms of historical figures, ½ the Hogwarts founders are female (the smartest one being a witch) and Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are canonically the ancients of magic as well -- Morgan being dark and Merlin light and great adversaries during their time.
