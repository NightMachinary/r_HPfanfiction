I mean, I can point to more evidence of gender inequality in the wizarding world. For example, most people in positions of power or authority are men. While there are your Amelia Boneses and Minerva McGonagalls, they are outnumbered by your Severus Snapes and Cornelius Fudges and Albus Dumbledores and Pius Thicknesses and Lucius Malfoys and Voldemorts and ... Or I could point to the existence of stay-at-home mums with no corresponding stay-at-home dads being shown.

Some fics exaggerate the amount of inequality from what is shown in canon, but it is there in canon. So it makes sense that some would seize on that as a theme for a fic, similar to how other themes get exaggerated in fanfiction.

Edit:

  Hermione and Ginny have careers and family (isn't Hermione the minister)

This is all extratextual info that Rowling said after the fact. My point is that in the published books, their careers never merit a mention. (And it would've been so easy to do otherwise. All it would take is a sentence or two to establish that e.g. Hermione is high-ranking in the Ministry.) Rowling's fanfiction from Pottermore doesn't change that.
