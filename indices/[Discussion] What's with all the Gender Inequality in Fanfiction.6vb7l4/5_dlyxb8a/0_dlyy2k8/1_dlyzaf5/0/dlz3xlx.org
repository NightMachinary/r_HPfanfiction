Really, who says they have investments and family estate to "handle"? The Wizarding World certainly doesn't seem to have a very advanced economy --- mostly because all money is physical gold kept sitting in massive vaults guarded by literal dragons. But even if they /do/, then I presume the Malfoys just pay someone(s) to handle all of that for them.

The only actual thing they do that could qualify as work is Death Eatering about, and performing DE-related sedition. But I wouldn't say "Death Eater" is legitimately what you could call a "job", and if it was, then, again, Lucius and Narcissa /both/ take part in it, if reluctantly on Narcissa's part.
