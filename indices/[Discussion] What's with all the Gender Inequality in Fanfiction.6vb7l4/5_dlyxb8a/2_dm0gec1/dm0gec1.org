We only see the characters through Harry's eyes though; he' interested in his pairs, then the adults around (pairs' families and teachers).\\
Nothing in canon says wether McGonagall has children or not (they would be quite older than Harry, but maybe not old enough to have Hogwarts age children), the other teachers family is never talked about either (even their age is unknown).\\
Narcissa Malfoy don't work, but neither does Lucius; Molly had 7 children, which seems to be a choice, thus probably choose not to work; Neville mother was an Auror, as is Tonks; Lily, Pandora Lovegood, their employment status is unknown. Rosmerta and Malkin are "madams", so no one knows either.

The fun thing is: what we know about HP world is basically what Harry knows; we only see this world through a teenager deformed lens, not through sociological research.
