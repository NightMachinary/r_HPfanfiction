  From what we know about the wizaeding world, it's one benefit is that it's a gender equal society.

Thats not exactly right. Yes there is surprising gender equality considering the Wizarding world is a bit stuck in the past, but its clear that its still got some aspects where its not. The whole male heir aspect or head of house aspect for example. While some families (light more then dark) are more balanced, there is a clear lean towards male focused society in some of the older families in HP.

I think the gender inequality in fan fiction stems from two things. First the idea that the Wizarding world is stuck in the past (implying gender inequality), an idea that somewhat explains the above comment. That older houses are still carrying traditions of male dominance from the past somewhat.

And second that, apart from Hermione, HP is a heavily male dominated story. A significant number of the focused on characters are males.

  For a series with a solid number of female leads, on both sides, where's the inspiration for inequality coming from.
#+end_quote

As I stated above, while there are a number of solid female characters, the story itself is CLEARLY more male dominated. The 3 main characters (Harry/Tom/Dumbledore) are male. 2 of the 3 golden trio are male. A large number of the supporting cast are male (Weasleys mostly male, Snape, Sirius, Quirrel, Remus, Peter, Barty, Fudge and so on). There are women for sure (Bones, Ginny, Tonks, Minerva, Molly), but its definitely more male. Even the major side creatures are heavily male (Dobby and Gringots goblins for example).

And again, apart from Hermione, its almost exclusively Male when it comes to the important moments in the books.
