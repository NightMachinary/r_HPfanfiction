None of the Hogwarts teachers, male or female, is known to have or not have childrens.

There are a lot of female characters who are known to have a carreer (or otherwise activity like, for instance, fighting a war). Tonks and her mother, Lilly, Alice Longbottom, Hermione and Ginny(I think, I can't remember if Ginny's activity was mentionned) in the epilogue, Amelia Bones who was raising her niece while leading the dmle, even Luna according to Rowling.

Women in the magical world seem to live active life while also raising childrens. Those gender themes are a trend right now, so it comes up a lot in fanfic regardless of the place of women in canon, that's all.
