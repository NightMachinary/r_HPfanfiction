I wonder if the inequality in fics is based on the seemingly common assumption that the wizarding world is behind the times compared to the muggle world. (I've seen this countless times in fics) There are also few canon examples given of women who have children and work outside the home or women who work having any sort of relationship that could lead to children. (For example, are there any professors at Hogwarts who are married? Have children?) That being said, I have seen some fics where having children after having a rewarding career and it almost feels that the children are afterthoughts.
