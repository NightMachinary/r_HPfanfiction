Real life. Its safe to say that /a lot/ of fanfiction is wish-fulfillment, coping outlets and self-reflection (, probably because a lot of fanfiction is written and read by teenagers). So a lot of authors simply ignore stated canon in order to form the HP world more towards what they need in order to portray the world they want to fit into/ rule/ destroy/...

Also we have a few instances of gender roles in this society. For example, Narcissa Malfoy is for the most part Lucius Malfoy's wife and Draco's mum. She's defined by nothing but the two men in her life. So the "purebloods are super-patriarchal" thing is a short step further to take for a lot of authors.

As so much in fanon, general societal standards are often connected to a few examples of single individuals. So, I'm personally not too judgmental when authors go ahead and shift the gender roles in certain subcultures of the magical world.
