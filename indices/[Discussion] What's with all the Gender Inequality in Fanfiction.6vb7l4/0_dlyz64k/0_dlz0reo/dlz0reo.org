  probably because a lot of fanfiction is written and read by teenagers

I don't think this is true. The high quality fan-fiction that we read, recommend, and discuss here is almost entirely written by adults. Many state or insinuate their ages on their profiles.

Honestly, I think teenagers like myself are actually a large minority in the fan-fiction community, this one especially.
