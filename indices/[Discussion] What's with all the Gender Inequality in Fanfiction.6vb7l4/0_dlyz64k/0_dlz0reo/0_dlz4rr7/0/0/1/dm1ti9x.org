Pretty much. /Methods of Rationality/ and robst's fics were definitely some of the first ones I read when I got into this fandom at an admittedly late point -- and I'm no novice to fanfiction as a whole -- so I appreciate those fics for that much regardless of my actual opinions of them.

Sorting by comments for a new fandom has its drawbacks, but it also acts as a window into what the readers want ... or what to avoid.
