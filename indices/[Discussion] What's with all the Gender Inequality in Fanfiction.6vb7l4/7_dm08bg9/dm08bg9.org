The more extreme ones that have whatever character go on about how they're property and then fawn over how amazing the insert character is for behavior that amounts to 'bare minimum decency' in RL? To me, those seem to stem less from canon and more from a similar wish fulfillment/power fantasy as Lord Potter fics (and those interactions are frequently in those fics).

Those are usually a cheap way to try and make a character more amazing by handing them a bunch of shiny trophies (a Lordship! A vault full of gold! Saying how much better a man they are then all the other men around!) which completely fails to make that character more amazing to a reader who's hoping to see more than just a constant string of shiny trophies getting handed to the character. Authors can give a character a lordship and ten times the gold of all other wizards combined pretty easily, but to make them so much more attractive then all the men around them the author either make all the women they care about super attracted to power/status/money, make Harry (the self insert in 90% of these fics) way more suave† then he is in canon, or make the lives of the women way worse than it was shown in canon. Frequently you get all three.

Of course, besides the Lord Potteresque type fics you have the straight up ship fics where it's all about how the two characters are meant to be together, and if a ship war is involved how awful the third character is. To me, both of these things are more to blame for extreme cases then authors trying to do an honest extrapolation of how women are treated in canon.

As for less extreme, there is enough sketchiness in canon to as to make gender inequality reasonable enough to include in a story. The prominent men are more noticeable and tend to be in more important positions than the prominent women in canon. We have a couple of groups (the Ministry, the Death Eaters) where the men we know about significantly outnumber the women. For it to be a more egalitarian society I'd expect the ratio to be closer, otherwise I have to assume /some/ gender bias exists. It's not something I prefer reading about, but I can't blame someone for including what's hinted at in canon.

†Albeit, a lot of author's 'suave' Harry comes across less charming and more bizarre and vaguely creepy. It's one of those things where I'm actually less put off if Harry is /more/ OOC because the juxtaposition between a vaguely IC!Harry and some of the things they try to pass him off as saying is just laughable.
