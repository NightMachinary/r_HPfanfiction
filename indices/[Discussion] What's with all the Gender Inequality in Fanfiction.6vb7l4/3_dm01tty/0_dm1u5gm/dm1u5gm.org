That doubles as poor worldbuilding /and/ offensive. Household charms seem like they'd be useful af and they'd be some of the first things I'd learn if magic was real. The same would probably be true of most wizards/witches in canon -- Voldemort aside, most of them seem to live ordinary lives that don't require combat skills or esoteric spells and potions.
