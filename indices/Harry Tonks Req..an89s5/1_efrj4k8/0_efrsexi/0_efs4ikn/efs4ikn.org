Unfortunately, I don't expect it (or any of her other stories) to be updated. I found her site by doing a search for crossovers - I started with Ranma fanfiction, and looked for crossovers by using character names. Her site is basically where she puts things for herself and a few friends, but I find her stories to be interesting enough that I wish she'd continue some of them.

"Only The Good Die Young" is an interesting take on Hermione's parents that I'd love to see continue.
