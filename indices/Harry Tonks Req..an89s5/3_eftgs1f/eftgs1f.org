*/Harry Potter and the Metamorph/*, by hermyd

Is one of my favorites with this paring. Their relationship feels more equal than a lot of Harry/Tonks do. Maybe because, while there is some realistic sex in their relationship, it's not specifically a smutty story... so you don't have to deal with the Sex God / Sex Toy that is so often done.
