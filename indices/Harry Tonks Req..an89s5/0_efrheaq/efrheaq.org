A lot of stories with that pairing suffer from either "Sex God Harry" or "You ask for my /real/ face, so now I am your sex toy". It is sad really, because the pairing has so much potential. I don't recommend any of those, even if they are enjoyable in parts.

The first two are a pair of stories where Tonks tries to be a Dark Lady but ends up saving the day instead.

The Third is hands down the best Harry/Tonks story written even though the relationship is mostly in the background once they get together. Short range time travel. Tonks as the traveller. There is nothing even similar to it. Superbly written friendships.

Number four is another oneshot, short and humorous. Slightly smutty.

Five and six turn Harry into a woman early on, but are still some of the best fics for that pairing.

For platonic interactions between these characters there are number seven and eight (which I am writing since there is a lack of longer stories with a familiar dynamic between them)
