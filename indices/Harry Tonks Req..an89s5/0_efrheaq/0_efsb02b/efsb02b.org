Harry/Tonks is one of those pairings that I always want to like, but it rarely is done well. Most fics feel somewhat lacking in their portrayal of Tonks. She's never really explored all that much as a character. The 7 year age gap between the two is also a bit of a bother for me that is rarely addressed correctly. I'd like to see more fics with a post-war relationship is formed (Tonks survives of course) where they are both adults and ages matter less. Or more fics where Tonks' age is changed, for instance to Harry's age making them attend Hogwarts together.

I think you've captured all the decent fics of that pairing in your post.
