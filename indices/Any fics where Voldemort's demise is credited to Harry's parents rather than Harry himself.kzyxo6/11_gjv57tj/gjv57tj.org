I prefer leaving Voldemorts death a mystery, and Harry's fame stems from him surviving. Most people believe that either James, Lily, or both did something to ensure Harry's survival, and a few attribute it to God.

Later, when the whole Chosen One(tm) starts picking up speed, Voldemort's defeat its retroactively, and mistakenly, attributed to Harry.

Essentially, it comes down to what prejudices they carry.
