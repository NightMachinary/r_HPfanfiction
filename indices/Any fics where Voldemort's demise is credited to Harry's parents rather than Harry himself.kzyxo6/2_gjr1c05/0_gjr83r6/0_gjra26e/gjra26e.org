Still an in-world happening that demonstrates a lack of sound logic. I know a lot of people don't consider the movies canon, but others do and it's just polite to give a range that includes them as well. I have no particular preference, personally. I'd probably have thrown a Cursed Child and Fantastic Beasts thing in there too if I knew anything about them. :)
