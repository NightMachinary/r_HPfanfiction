I never said it made sense, only that some people consider it that way. Canon as a concept is pretty weird in this fandom. For some, it's their definition that matters (The original material/the books are the only canon, no these bits of the book and these bits of the movie and those internet posts I like best are all canon!) and for others, it's just whatever the author says it is. And for others, they're all canon, just in different ways - book canon, movie canon, internet post canon, wiki canon, etc. Right or wrong, the perception exists and as an ambivalent party, it's just polite to acknowledge that.
