I mean, the wizarding world displays a very prodigious lack of sound logic throughout the series.

Mr Cunning McControlsTheGovernment Malfoy casts the most illegal spell in the country on a child in a school outside the office of a member of government. Moody agrees to the Seven Potters plan. Dumbledore doesn't think to interrogate the supposed double agent in his secret vigilante group to find out exactly what he told the still-free-and-plausibly-active Death Eaters about them. For some reason, the Goblins control the economy. The Parselmouth with a Muggleborn mother and a Muggleborn best buddy who's shown no prior interest in anything but said people and Quidditch is suddenly believed to be a bigoted petrify-er. Their jailors are Dark Creatures who (IIRC) joined Voldemort in the last war and they're still gainfully employed.

To check vis a vis your request, are you specifically wanting fics where it's always believed James/Lily were the ones to defeat Voldemort, or where it's revealed or otherwise advocated for later on? (eg. Postwar Harry tells everyone to stop making a fuss, it was all his mother's doing).
