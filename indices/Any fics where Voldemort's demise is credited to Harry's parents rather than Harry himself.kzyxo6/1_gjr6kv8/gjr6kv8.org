Ghost of Privet Drive linkffn(13436100) has this end up happening part way through. The SI ends up commissioning an author to portray Lily as The Witch who Won, which does spread a fair amount. This only really starts happening over halfway through the story, so be warned about that (though it is all pre-hogwarts). I suspect whenever the author releases the sequel, it will have a larger impact on the narrative though.
