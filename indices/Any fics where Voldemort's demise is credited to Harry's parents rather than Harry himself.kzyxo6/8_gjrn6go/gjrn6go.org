If someone can remind me of the name of a fic about Lily taking care of Harry and Hermione in what is essentially a ghetto a la WWII run by Death Eaters as Voldemort rules the country. I believe Sirius was a spy (his pureblood background and family help with this) and Sirius, James, and Snape work to rescue Lily. The fic begins with a journalist going to interview Lily about how she defeated Voldemort and being surprised at how broken down such a young woman is, from the starvation and depravations of war.
