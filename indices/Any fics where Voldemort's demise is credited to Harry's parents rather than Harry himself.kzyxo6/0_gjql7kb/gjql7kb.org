I've always thought it was obvious why they attributed it to Harry.

At least Harry's a half-blood.

I don't see, with how prejudiced Wizarding society is (even Molly seems a bit prejudiced in a condescending way towards non-magicals at times) that they'd /accept/ the idea that Lily did it. Dumbledore does, but he's Dumbledore.
