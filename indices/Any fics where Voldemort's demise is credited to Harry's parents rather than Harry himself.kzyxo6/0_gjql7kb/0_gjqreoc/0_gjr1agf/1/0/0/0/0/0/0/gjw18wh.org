  Obliviation doesn't work on cameras. Even in the 1990s, London had one of the /densest/ CCTV coverages in the world. It's also said in the Fantastic Beasts books that you cannot normally Obliviate more than one person at a time. (The NYC thing was a very special situation). No 'I obliviate everyone in the room!' fanfic stuff. There was Internet in the 90s, I had a dialup Internet line in '92. And universities and governments were connected even back then. Data travels.

If you're taking Fantastic Beasts into account that oblivation is just straight up near omni-potent; it doesn't just erase memories but also physical evidence that would contradict those memories.

Even not taking it into account it's shown in canon that oblivatiors aren't idiots and thoroughly cleanse evidence.

  Imperius only 'subverts the entire system' if you assume muggles are idiots. Yes, they can cause havoc, but they aren't going to tear down the system. All the big things have failsafes and checks and balances.
#+end_quote

The big failsafes and checks wouldn't work against wizards. The imperius is literally perfect; a deep-cover mole essentially thats keyed in all the security systems, knows all the passwords and checks, ect.

If you mean multiple parties would be on the lookout; how would anyone not a wizard know someone is imperiused? There is no sign if the orders include to give no sign.

Thats not even mentioning that in canon wizards /already have/ infiltrated the top levels of every government and change things at their pleasure and whim without anyone stopping them; the /British/ MoM managed to get the president of the USA to "forget" a telephone call to the PM.

  Protego can certainly block at least small bullets, as it can block the force of things like Bombarda, which likely has a lot more force than a bullet (though we do get into whether a bullet's piercing changes things). However, shields can be broken, and once you start pulling in burst fire weapons
#+end_quote

Why do you assume Bombarda is just a regular explosion? It's magic. So is the protego. They don't work on anything resembling our understanding of science. There has never been any indication whatsoever that non-magical things would strain a protego. You made that up. There /IS/ however indication that magic works on an immunity basis; either a spell works and protects against everything it can handle or it doesn't. I can buy magic breaking magic. I cannot buy that same magic that ignores our understanding of reality suddenly being as obedient to the limits of physics as our muggle equivalents of shields are and breaking under repeat strain of bullets.

  Yes, wizards can 'blast through' walls. This is also very much obvious. And again, no AoE Obliviates, those are actually anti-canon (Again, see Newt).
#+end_quote

I was going more for a quiet infiltration type of vanishing, but yeah sure.

  In a war, it would likely end with one side winning for a while then the other side recovering, and you'd end up with a terribly bloody guerilla war where the wizards can strike easily but can't win and the muggles can strike back when they discover where a wizard is.
#+end_quote

In a war it ends when the wizards get their hands on the chain of command and nuke all of the muggle world into hell. Which they already would have before any theoretical fight even started.
