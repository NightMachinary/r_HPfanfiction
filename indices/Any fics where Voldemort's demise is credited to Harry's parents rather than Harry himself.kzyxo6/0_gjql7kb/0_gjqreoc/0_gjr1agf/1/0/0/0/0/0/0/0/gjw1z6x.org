... now you're pulling out 'nuke the muggle world to hell'.

The muggle world that wizards live near. The muggle world that, if enough nukes were thrown in the first place, would cause catastrophic damage to the wizards as well. The muggle world that, if they destroyed enough people, would likely lead to climatic shifts at best. I mean, usually the Muggle Wank pull out nukes on wizards, forgetting how silly it is. :)

Not even going to get into the other stuff, this is getting absolutely silly. :)
