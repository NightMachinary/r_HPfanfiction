True enough. Though given wizards can instantly teleport they still have the advantage of being able to transfer information about as fast as a telephone if they want. Not to mention the Patronus messages.

  As for the silly MvW debate, no, you don't get to say 'Wizards WIN!' as a proven fact.

But literally how could Muggles win? They can't know who they're fighting because of Obviation. Even if the statue of secrecy broke and no one bothered to recreate it, how could Muggles organize? There's no way that a single imperius wouldn't subvert the entire system against Muggles. No security system that can stop teleporting wizards that can just make walls disappear with a flick of their wand. Thats why as a collective wizards would beat muggles.

In canon, magic doesn't have an x number before it stops working. Either it works or it doesn't work. There are spells that stop projectiles. A singular muggle would need to either ambush an unaware witch/wizard with a gun or attack them in melee while dodging spells. It is heavily stacked against the muggle. Not as heavily as a group of Muggles vs a group of wizards but still vastly in the wizards favor.
