  Even in the 90s, telephone technology was far better than floo and owl communication

There's connected mirrors that vastly outdo any telephone technology then or now.

  It's why the 'Muggle vs Wizards' argument amuses me. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and so many people ignore or deprecate one for the other.

Magic, at least in canon, clearly works on a full immunity basis (IE a flameproof charm will either not work at all or completely ignore any fire no matter how hot). Even if we ignore things from fanfic's/ logical next steps from Rowlings words, wizards still have zero threat from Muggles. Are they completely advanced in every way? No just almost every way. There's places where Muggles have caught up or are going to catch up and outdo magic. But Muggles vs Wizards debate, if going from Canon is a firm and no diff win by Wizards.
