Obliviation doesn't work on cameras. Even in the 1990s, London had one of the /densest/ CCTV coverages in the world. It's also said in the Fantastic Beasts books that you cannot normally Obliviate more than one person at a time. (The NYC thing was a very special situation). No 'I obliviate everyone in the room!' fanfic stuff. There was Internet in the 90s, I had a dialup Internet line in '92. And universities and governments were connected even back then. Data travels.

Teleportation needs you to know the target location. You can't 'teleport to the other side of the wall' or other stuff.

Imperius only 'subverts the entire system' if you assume muggles are idiots. Yes, they can cause havoc, but they aren't going to tear down the system. All the big things have failsafes and checks and balances. It's unclear how many people one person can Imperius, but the 'Imperius Chain' the books hint at won't work with muggles, anyway.

Protego can certainly block at least small bullets, as it can block the force of things like Bombarda, which likely has a lot more force than a bullet (though we do get into whether a bullet's piercing changes things). However, shields can be broken, and once you start pulling in burst fire weapons (I'm not going to into fully automatic fire as you do NOT use that outside certain situations or in Hollywood. You're throwing bullets away.)

Yes, wizards can 'blast through' walls. This is also very much obvious. And again, no AoE Obliviates, those are actually anti-canon (Again, see Newt).

In a war, it would likely end with one side winning for a while then the other side recovering, and you'd end up with a terribly bloody guerilla war where the wizards can strike easily but can't win and the muggles can strike back when they discover where a wizard is.

Think a magical Vietnam war. No one would win.
