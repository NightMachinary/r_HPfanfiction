Depends on what you're referring to.

Even in the 90s, telephone technology was far better than floo and owl communication. Wizarding medical tech is better in many ways if you listen to Rowling, but we don't outside fanfic see things like LASIK. Muggles win hands down on pure destruction, while wizards win handily on guerilla warfare.

It's why the 'Muggle vs Wizards' argument amuses me. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and so many people ignore or deprecate one for the other.
