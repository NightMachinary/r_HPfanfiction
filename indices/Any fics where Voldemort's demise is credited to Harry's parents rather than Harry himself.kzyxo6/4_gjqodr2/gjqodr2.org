Blood bigotry is probably to blame. The purebloods in power don't want to give some uppity mudblood the credit for anything important. Better to attribute it to a halfblood baby.

Frankly I'm surprised the arrogant cousinfuckers didn't give James all the credit for beating Voldy - say he caused a mortal wound or something, and Voldemort didn't have enough strength left to AK Harry properly since Harry was the last vessel of the ancient pureblood Potter family magics, or some shit like that.
