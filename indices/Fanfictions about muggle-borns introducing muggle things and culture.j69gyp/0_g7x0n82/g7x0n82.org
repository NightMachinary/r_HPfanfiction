There's a fic I read recently called 'Things Hermione Has To Explain'.

Basically it's a bunhc of muggle things that Hermione has to explain to Blaise and Draco. Each chapter is a new thing. I do have to warn you though, that some chapters have a Draco/Blaise/Hermione pairing so you might want to skip those if you're not into that.
