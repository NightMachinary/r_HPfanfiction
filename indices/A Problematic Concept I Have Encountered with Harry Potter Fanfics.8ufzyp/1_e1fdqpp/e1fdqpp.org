I think it's how they view that character honestly. Let's take Snape and Lupin for example. I think we'd all see Snape as the Dominant person in that relationship wouldn't you? Or Lucius Malfoy and Fudge, Lucius would be the dominant one. The more domineering, commanding, "Stronger" characters will always come off as more 'manly' and more of the 'dominant' ones in the relationship, than say Harry, or Ron, etc who will be viewed as more soft/warm/emotional etc than their counterparts, so will be viewed as weaker and therefore the female equivalent in that relationship. Which than makes it easier to go from that to making Harry/Ron/Whoever it may be into a female.

I honestly think it's just pyschological. Take Slash Smut for example, could you see Snape being a bottom? or Voldemort?
