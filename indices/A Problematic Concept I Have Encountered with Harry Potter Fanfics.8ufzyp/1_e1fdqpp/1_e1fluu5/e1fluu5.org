I cant point this out enough:\\
GAY relationships dont necessarly need to have a DOMINANT and SUBMISSIVE.\\
They are guys. They have dicks. Not all gays like it up the butt. Not all gays are bottom. Not all gays are top.\\

I know a few muscled packed rugby players who have a fucking aggressive personality but like to get spanked by their 1,60 slim-twink boyfriend.

Cmon. Stop the stereotypical writing. Please.
