I see Snape in the abusive role in the relationship, you know, the one that warrants a prison sentence. He is a ruthless, obsessive person who couldn't get over a married woman who died long ago and whose death warrant he signed. He tried to manipulate Harry's opinion of his father, made a child's life hell due to a rivalry with said child's father despite the fact that Harry, thanks to Snape and Pettigrew, never got to know his father.

The only relationship I want to see him in involves dementors.
