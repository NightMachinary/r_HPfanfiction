  tried to manipulate Harry's opinion of his father
#+end_quote

James was a bully and Snape was his victim, there's no way around that. Of course Snape should not have let that influence his behaviour towards Harry, being a professor and all, but telling Harry what a git his father was never seemed like an attempt at manipulation to me, and it certainly never made Harry doubt his father. Only when he saw Snape's memories in the Pensieve did he even consider that his father could have flaws.

  made a child's life hell

I'm quite sure that even with Snape as his professor, Harry's life at Hogwarts was nothing like hell. It was a lot better than with the Dursleys and all the really bad parts (like Volde trying to kill him etc) didn't have anything to do with Snape.
