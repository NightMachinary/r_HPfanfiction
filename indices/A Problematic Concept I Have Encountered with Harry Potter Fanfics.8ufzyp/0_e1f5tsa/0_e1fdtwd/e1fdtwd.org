DEAR LORD WHY, you have thoroughly traumatised me with the last statement. Though I think it'd be one of those 'love it cause it hurts thing' i would read it just to die a little inside. And I would review humorously and we would become best friends until I drove you crazy and you ended up bashing my brains in with a wand. And then I'd be sad.

I don't know how we got there.
