You're also talking about wizarding culture, though, which is a couple centuries behind it feels like. A 15 year old with a 21 year old in, say, 1840 wouldn't be all that surprising. /Harry/ should have a problem with it since he was brought up where that's weird and socially wrong, but anyone who grew up isolated in the wizarding world probably wouldn't have a problem with it.
