It's less creepy the older you get.

If a 25 year old is dating a 43 year old, that's their business. If a 32 year old is dating a 14 year old, however, that's creepy and probably illegal.

Even a 6 1/2 year age difference is far too big if one of the participants is <18.

Basically, if the pairing starts while Harry is in Hogwarts both Fleur and Tonks are probably too old for him. Post-Hogwarts is a different matter entirely.
