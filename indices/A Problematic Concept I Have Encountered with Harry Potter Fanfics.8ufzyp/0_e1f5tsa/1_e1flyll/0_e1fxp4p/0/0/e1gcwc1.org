I'm aware of the age of consent in my country. That doesn't make a 20 year old (Fleur is closer to four years older than Harry) or a 22 1/2 year old sleeping with a sixteen year old any less creepy.

It's not the horny teenager I'm side-eying. It's the grown adult sleeping with the horny teenager.

You want a creepy fact. Teen pregnancies are predominantly fathered by adult men aged 20+. If the mother is under 15, it is *six times* more likely the father will be over 20.
