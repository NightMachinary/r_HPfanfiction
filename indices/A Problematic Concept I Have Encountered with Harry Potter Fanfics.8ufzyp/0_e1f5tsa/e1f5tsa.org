The majority of FF writers (notice I said writers, not good ones, and not prolific, etc) are girls and young women.

The majority of girls who want to pair Harry with Draco don't want to change the Bad Boy that is Draco. Occasionally they'll put him in leather pants (see: tvtropes page) but that's about it. Girls (read:immature females) want to write about how a bad boy can change if the right girl comes along. It's been a common writing tool for millennia.

Also consider. The vast majority of slash is written by female writers. Therefore, Harry gets feminized, as the women like the male character (or Alan Rickman) with whom they're pairing Harry. FemSnape simply wouldn't work, to say nothing of being somewhat disturbing.

Most male writers tend to pair Harry with a fantasy (OC standin such as Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass), a multi pairing, Emma Watson (Perfect Hermione TM) or with a completely illogical older woman like Fleur or Tonks.

Now I have a plotbunny.. FemSnape who crushed on James Potter and couldn't stand Lily. Hmm...
