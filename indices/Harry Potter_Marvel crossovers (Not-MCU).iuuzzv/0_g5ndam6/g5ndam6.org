There's this linkffn(9443327)

Really well written at first (I think it started to deteriorate a little later) and features a badass Harry.

And this linkffn(12321442)

Different from anything else I've seen so far, hasn't been updated in a while, but the author's been known to take long hiatuses and then update 4 stories with long chapters in a week

Edit: just remembered this one linkffn(12453963)
