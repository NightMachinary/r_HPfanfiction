I remember really liking the Running With Wolves series by Aurora Dawn on HPFF ([[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=226284][link]])! It's been a while since I read them, but the idea is there's this girl Kerri who turns out to be Snape's half-sister and she ends up having a romance with Lupin. There's a lot going on, with werewolf rights and work and drama. I'm not sure the author ever finished the series, but there's a couple.
