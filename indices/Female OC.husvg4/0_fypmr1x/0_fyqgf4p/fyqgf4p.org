oh man, when remus broke down. That's some good shit right there.

that's probably not the best way to put that but I stand by it. Remus was more real to me in those paragraphs than in any other i've ever read. That, in his anger and grief, he blamed Harry fro Sirius's death was shocking. and it made sense. Glad to be reading this, thanks fro sharing
