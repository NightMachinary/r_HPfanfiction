Linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) Evil and charming sociopath riddle paired with an oc who plays at his level.

Linkffn(When Harry Met Tom) Not as evil but still distinctly Riddle. Nice parallels with FemHarry.

Linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) Good!Fem!Riddle intepretation moulded into Voldemort by circumstances.

Linkffn(Paradox by olivieblake) Moriarty style transdimensional chess player Riddle. Good luck understanding the plot.
