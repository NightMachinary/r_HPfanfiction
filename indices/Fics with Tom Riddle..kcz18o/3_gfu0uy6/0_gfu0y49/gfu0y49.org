  Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...
