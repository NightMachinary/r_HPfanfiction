One of my favorite fics of all time is linkao3(The Darkening of Your Soul by Meaglin_Yedi). Its a fic where Harry as MOD gets to go back in time and do everything all over again. Only Catch? If he goes back, so does Tom. Toms soul gets glued back together and both Harry and Tom try to change the world.

While you dont see Tom until chapter 5/6-ish, he is in every chapter after that and while the story is very Harry-centric, Tom plays as much of a roll as Harry does and their relationship is so so well written.
