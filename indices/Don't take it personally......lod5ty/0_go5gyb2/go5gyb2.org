I never understood how some people could truly consider Muggles superior to Wizards. I mean, the only difference is Magic, Wizards can litteraly do everything a Muggle can do, *plus* magic. Magic could be the shittiest thing in the world, only able to make someone hairs grow that it would still give the Wizards an advantage.
