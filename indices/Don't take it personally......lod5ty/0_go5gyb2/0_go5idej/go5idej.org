I think it's mostly that Wizards seem quite unintelligent by most standards. They make looooots of really stupid mistakes throughout the series. Plus the whole 'Wizards are backwoods savages' cliche thing vis a vis the slavery and generally simplistic and low-tech society.

Just my guess at their reasoning - personally, I honestly don't think either of them are better. They both have their strengths and they both have their weaknesses. You play your resources well and smart and either side can at least hold their own against the other.
