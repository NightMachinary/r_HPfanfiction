For Kindle users, [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/webversion_kindle.php][FanfictionDownloader.net]] has a convert and email to Kindle feature on its page.

And the downloadable program (Windows, Mac, Linux) works on [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/archives.php][multiple archives]] and converts to many formats.

There's also a browser extension/app that I've been able to use for password-protected sites, GrabMyBooks.com.
