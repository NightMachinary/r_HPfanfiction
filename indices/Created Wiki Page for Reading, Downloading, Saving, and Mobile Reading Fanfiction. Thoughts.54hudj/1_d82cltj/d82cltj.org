Maybe add in [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicymango.fanfictionreader&hl=en][Fanfiction Reader]] app for Android possibly? This is what I've used for the past year and a half and never had an issue with it. I don't think it has as many functions compared to the official app, but it's quick and easy to download fics with the fic id and read on the go.\\
Everything else looks fine to me. Short, organized, and to the point.
