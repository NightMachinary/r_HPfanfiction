Ginny wakes up with her last memory being a high-speed broom crash, to find her parents telling her that her friends she was flying with are now dead and she only narrowly survived. But, her body now feels strangely different, her memory is full of gaps, and her parents are acting odd and not giving her answers. The disturbing answer she uncovers is that she did die... and her parents restored her from a Horcrux.

/The Adoration of Jenna Fox,/ by Mary Pearson. Good book, but don't bother with the sequels.
