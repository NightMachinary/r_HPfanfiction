Voldemort recovered his body almost immediately with his Death Eaters' help, and largely took over Magical Britain, with the Order of the Phoenix being reduced to an underground resistance movement. Instead of sending Hagrid to give Harry his Hogwarts letter, Dumbledore came in person. But with Harry out of the house, the Death Eaters were able to enter Privet Drive and assassinate the Dursleys. Unable to send him home, and alarmed by the re-escalating violence, Dumbledore instead takes Harry with him to search for the Horcruxes, ultimately sacrificing himself so that Harry can become the master of the Elder Wand and use it to destroy Voldemort's body - for now.
