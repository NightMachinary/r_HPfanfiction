Heavy AU where Harry grows up in the Muggle world with Dumbledore periodically dropping in as a friend, until - when the Dark Lord rises again - he tells Harry that he has the Dark Lord's horcrux and he must walk to the Mountain of the Basilisk to destroy it. Along the way, Harry will meet new friends, including Neville the rightful King of Wizarding Britain who will meet Dark Lord's current body in battle (no thanks to the competent but self-interested Fudge regency) while Harry secretly destroys the horcrux.
