No Voldemort AU. The magical world's masquerade is enforced via barriers and pocket dimensions, outside of which magic is heavily prohibited. Platform 9 3/4 only opens every 9 years, allowing for travel between the worlds for a limited amount of time. When Harry is accidentally left near a horrible Muggle woman who desperately wants a child, he's snatched up for 9 years until a rescue operation can be mounted.

Hagrid, Hermione, Fleur, and Dumbledore all wind up heading to the rescue. Weirdly enough, the Muggle woman's child is fat, lazy, and a bully, while the skinny kid who seems to be stuck doing all her chores instantly strikes up a friendship with the group of rescuers... The Secret of Platform 13, possibly the most Harry Potter-esque book I've ever read, that came out three years before Philosopher's Stone.
