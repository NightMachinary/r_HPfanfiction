I don't remember the name of the fic but Harry has somehow ended up in the past and at some point they're in Grimmauld Place and Harry comes across a boggart, which takes the form of Lily, begging him to end his life, "Wake up from this bad dream" and join them in the afterlife. From what I recall this is witnessed by Remus and Snape.

Edit: It's "Easier than falling asleep" by JacobApples in part 1.4. I was wrong, it was Sirius and Snape who witnessed Harry facing the boggart. I remembered it thanks to [[/u/Peace-wise]] looking for that fic in another thread.
