Crack! The bogart wast thrown across the room. Straight at Harry. He could see Professor Lupin moving forward wand ready. But Harry jumped forward. He was curious, wanting to know what he truly feared. Harry knew he feared some things, but what was his deepest fear? Dementors, Voldemort, basilisks all came to mind.

The bogart started to shift and spread out making a white wall. Harry was confused, what was this the infirmary? But the wall or rather the bogart grew more detailed. A set of stairs formed and pictures that hung in this oh so familiar hallway. It was the Dursley's house. Then finally the outline of a place Harry knew well. His cupboard under the stairs.

The cupboard looked normal, but almost seemed to pulse. Feelings of dispair, pain and quiet hatred seemed to float around the class. Harry could almost smell the dust and cobwebs.

The moment broke when Ron said loudly, "I don't get it." Professor Lupin swept up, the bogart turned to a silver orb and then was driven back into the wardrobe it came from. He looked at Harry, an of look on his face. With a small shake he said, " I think that is enough for today, read the chapter on bogarts, and practice your wand movements. Next class we will be practicing casting." The class was very quiet as the gathered up their things. Many were thinking about the things they feared. Some about what ever it was that Harry feared. Whispers and mutters spread as they all walked through the halls and stairs. All asking the same thing. Can the Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived really be scared of a cupboard? And why?

But Harry knew. He wouldn't even be put in the cupboard again. Never be broken, hurt, or feel the dispair that lived in that small space. Never again would he be that sobbing little boy in the darkness.
