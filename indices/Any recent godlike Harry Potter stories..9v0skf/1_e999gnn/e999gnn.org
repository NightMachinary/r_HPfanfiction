linkffn(Again and Again) is being recommended a lot recently because the author returned to it after years but it fits your requirements since that version of Harry is far more powerful than anyone else and is compared to Merlin later on

I like linkffn(Courage and Cunning) which is THE Harry is Salazar fic so obviously he's already unbelievably powerful

linkffn(Death is but the Next Great Adventure) Harry is a literal necromancer starting when he turns eleven and grows up with Death as his mentor
