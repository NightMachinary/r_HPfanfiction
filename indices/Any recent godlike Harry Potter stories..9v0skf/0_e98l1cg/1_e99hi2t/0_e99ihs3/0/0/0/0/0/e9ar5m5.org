  I agree that it very likely won't have negative consequences, but why risk it?

Because it's so unlikely to happen there's no point in worrying about it until it actually does. It just makes things harder for everyone.

The admins aren't running around nuking subs, anyway, unless the sub is completely dedicated to content against site rules. If this subreddit was [[/r/hplolismut]] or something, it might be an issue, but as it is the admins wouldn't start by banning the sub. I know of other subreddits that are larger and have more obviously graphic material that relate to underage sex that the admins don't care about even though they're aware they exist.
