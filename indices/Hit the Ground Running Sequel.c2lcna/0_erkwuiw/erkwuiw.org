I have been kicking around a sequel to this in my head for years, it's just such a perfect place to leave off for an edgy Grey Harry something-or-other.

But, I'd never actually written much of it and with the author having deleted it from ff.net and Ao3 it's kinda awkward, even though they did invite sequels at the time. As I recall, there were three written, two of which were utter crap and only a few paragraphs long. The third was linkffn(10770991).
