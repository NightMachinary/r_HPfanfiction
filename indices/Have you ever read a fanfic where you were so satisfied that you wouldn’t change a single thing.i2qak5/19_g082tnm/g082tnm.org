First time trying to link a fic so sorry if I mess it up. Linkffn(Dark Heir) is without a doubt the best â€˜Harry raised by Voldemort/dark wizards fanfic I have ever read. Doesn't go the usual route of making Dumbledore the main villain but instead gives that role to an often overlooked character that I never expected to even have any kind of importance in the story, yet the reveal still felt satisfying and believable because of how it was written.
