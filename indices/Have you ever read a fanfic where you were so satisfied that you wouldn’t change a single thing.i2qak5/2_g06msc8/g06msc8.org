Alas no. Not even my own, and the whole point of writing those is to have fics where I get to determine everything that happens. So in theory they should suit my preferences to a tee. But of course, ideas change over time...

About a year ago it was brought to my attention that JKR originally intended Vernon Dursley to be a government minister. I immediately took to the idea - it explained so much, like where the obsession with normality came from. They were terrified of being outed in the press. It would also explain the deference of the local community to the Dursley family, and the fact that Vernon and Dudley went to this posh boarding school even though Vernon is depicted as working class. Those things are all holdovers from when Vernon was meant to be a member of the political class.

On top of that, I felt that this background would have been perfect for Victoria Potter. Victoria coming from that background - moving within the world of Muggle privilege, but never being a part of it, always relegated to the sidelines - would have been perfect for her character arc where at Hogwarts suddenly she's part of the privileged group. It would also have been an interesting point of AU difference to keep the reader interested in the early chapters.

So yeah, if I was rewriting VP I'd use that idea. But VP is already a rewrite, I'm just not willing at this stage to go back and rewrite /again/.
