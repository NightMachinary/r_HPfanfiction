The Secret Language of Plants series is 3 parts + an epilogue and the story and writing are extraordinary. Featuring a Harry who gets “kidnapped” at a young age and doesn't realize magic has limits, a Draco who has read the Communist Manifesto, a Pansy who spearheads a feminist revolution and a Percy who is just trying to keep everyone safe, PLUS some of the best “found family” moments in any story, ever.

Starts with Linkao3(The Meaning of Mistletoe) just over 373k for the whole thing
