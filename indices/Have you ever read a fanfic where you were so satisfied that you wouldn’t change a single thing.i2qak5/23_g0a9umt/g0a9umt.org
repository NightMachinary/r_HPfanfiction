I almost always want to change something, even if it's just a spellcheck. But I'll add a probably-unpopular mention of Methods of Rationality, not because I think it's perfect, but because the author knows his subject better than I do, and so I don't think I could do a better job of what he was trying to achieve (namely, introduce the reader to the idea of thinking about how you think and trying to fix some of the mistakes you're making). Plus, he's a talented writer.

Note that people often dislike the protagonist. But part of being a talented writer is that the author doesn't always agree with the protagonist either. When Harry is arrogant and dismissive to people, chances are it will return to bite him in the backside. When he thinks he knows better than adults because he has been exposed to different philosophies than they have, he's sometimes right and sometimes horribly wrong. The community behind the story is called "Less Wrong" for a reason; everyone gets things wrong, and at the end of the story, Harry realises he was /just/ smart enough to make really big mistakes, like coming within a hair's breadth of either destroying the planet with an uncontrolled release of sensitive information, or handing it to Voldemort on a platter.

So, there's plenty about /Harry/ that needs to change, but I don't feel like I'm qualified to improve on /the story/. It's a thought-provoking read, in any case.
