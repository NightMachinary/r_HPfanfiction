Here are some crossover to add into the list :

- For LotR, I truly consider Linkffn( *The Shadow of Angmar* ) as a perfect fanfic. Steelbadger really respected the universe, his Harry changed while still being believable, I loved his OCs and I even get a Tolkien vibe from his writing style. And no, I do not check the fic every day to see if it has been updated.
- For Star Wars, Linkffn( *The Havoc side of the Force* ). I can't say I consider it a perfect fanfic, because there is one, tiny detail that bothered me, but outside of that, I have nothing to reproach to this fic and it has been one of my most untertaining read.
