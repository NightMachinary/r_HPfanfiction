Okay so, for long fics there are three: linkffn(faintest, slimmest, wildest chance)

linkffn(a keen observer)

linkffn(the bureaucratic error)

The Bureaucratic Error has like 360k words. Would I really not change a thing? Yes. The story is genius and makes you feel all the feels.

For short one-shots, this one will always be my favorite (it's hilarious): linkffn(out of the fire and into the cupboard)
