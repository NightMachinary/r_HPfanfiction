I somehow want to turn this into Hermione getting a sneak peek at the Wizarding World. Maybe have them (along with at least one of her parents because even then few 8yo wandered London alone) turn onto Charing Cross and Ron recognizes the street, then the Leaky Cauldron. Drags the Grangers in as the Floo activates, etc.
