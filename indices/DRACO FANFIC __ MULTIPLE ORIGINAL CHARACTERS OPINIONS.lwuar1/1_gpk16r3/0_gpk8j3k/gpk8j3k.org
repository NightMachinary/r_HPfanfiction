Thanks for this answer :) I think what you said about them having a reason to exist and a niche to occupy is a very good point. 1 of the side OCs has a fairly important role in the story and contributes to the breakup of the relationship between Draco and the main character, but the other 2 people I included aren't too important. Again, thanks for your answer and thanks for the help :))
