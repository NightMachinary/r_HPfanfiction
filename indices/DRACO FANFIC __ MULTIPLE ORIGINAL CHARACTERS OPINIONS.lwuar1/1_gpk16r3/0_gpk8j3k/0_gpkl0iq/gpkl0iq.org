Sure. Happy I could help.

And it's not so much importance as it is distinctiveness. They have to feel like interesting characters, rather than "My name is Alice and I'm a Gryffindor and I have blue hair."

And well, if they aren't those things and you agree they should be, you can always work to make them that way. Plenty of ways to make characters more interesting and important, if that's what you want 'em to be. :)
