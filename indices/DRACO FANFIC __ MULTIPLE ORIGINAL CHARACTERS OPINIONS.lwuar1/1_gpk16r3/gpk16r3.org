OCs as a concept don't make me think anything either way. I'll generally only stick with a story if those OCs meet two criteria - they have a reason to exist and a specific niche to occupy. I copy-pasted my answer below from one I gave the last time this question came up. If you need any clarification on any of it, feel free to ask. :)

  Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. Other than that, anything goes. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

  Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

  I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people) and where her interactions with the various other elements of the world (people, resources, places, etc) make sense.
