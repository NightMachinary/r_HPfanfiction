The problem I have with it is the casual abuse that's written in.

Too often those stories go a bit like this: Alpha drools over omega Omega doesn't like alpha and finds him/her threathening and just tries to avoid them at all times Omega goes into heat Alpha is the only one around (Halfway) forced sex because the omega isn't in the right mind to say no, and the alpha can't stop themselves Oh well, you're bonded now for life, too bad the omega never wanted that

I gave up on these types of stories. I'm sure there are some good ones written too that deal with these kind of things, but it's a hard thing to predict before you start reading
