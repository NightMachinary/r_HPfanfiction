Basically a very pelicular hiearchy beyond your normal male/female denominations. Typically involves a lot of mpreg. This link explains it in detail: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/403644/chapters/665489][Alphas, Betas, Omegas: A Primer]]

Personally it's a trope I stay far, far away from (to the point where there are ships that I significantly dislike that I would rather read over an a/b/o fic), so I'm unable to recommend you a good example of an a/b/o fic. Sorry! But I would assume that it would be at its most common in Wolfstar due to the dynamic originally being based on an (incorrect) worldview over how wolf society works.
