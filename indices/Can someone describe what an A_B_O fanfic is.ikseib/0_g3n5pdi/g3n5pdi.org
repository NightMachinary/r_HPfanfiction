ABO stories are AU stories in basically which there are more secondary sex characteristics that play a larger role in reproduction than the primary ones do. These secondary sex characteristics are broken down into the three categories Alpha, Beta, and Omega, which can be summarized as follows:

• Alphas: These are the impregnators, and they can be either male or female (so yes futas sorta exist in this AU). Most commonly known for their knots, which is basically a swelling that occurs at the base of the penis when they get aroused, and “locks them” into their mate, just like with dogs . Usually, in the Fics that I've read, female alphas can't become pregnant, but this is up for may, like with male omegas. Likewise, alphas may go into rut in some fics, but this is not true for all fics like heats are for omegas.

• Betas: These are your average people, not much to say here (although, it is worth mentioning that in some fanfics, betas are infertile/have a harder time conceiving than omegas).

• Omegas: These are the people who get pregnant. Can be either male or female, although in most of the fics I've seen, they're said to be usually female (just like how alphas are usually male). They also go into heat, as in the cat kind of heat, and it can be portrayed as a mildly bothersome thing down to insanely dubious in terms of content when it is approached*. Really just depends on the story. Like with female alphas, though, in some fics male omegas are able to impregnate others, although in most of the fics I've read this possibility just isn't mentioned at all.

Other terms you should probably know:

• Deltas/Whatever Else: Other secondary genders not mentioned in the standard ABO lore, which the author will probably explain for you at some point in the story. If they don't, then a quick search through Tumbler will probably provide you answers for this.

• Unpresented: Characters who haven't gone through the “change”, aka secondary puberty, yet.

• Knotting (describes the “locking” process between an alpha and their mate)

• And Nests: Just like with cats and other creatures, omegas have a tendency to build “nests” during their heats. Since everybody in the ABO verse usually had enhanced senses, they often like to steal clothes to build it, but not all stories are accurate to this.

Hope this helps!
