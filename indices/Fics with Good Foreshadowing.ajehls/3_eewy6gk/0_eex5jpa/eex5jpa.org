I've read half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble][Heroes Assemble]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]], it become less interesting after Harry become part of Avengers and the introduction of two worlds end. But fell free to recommend anything!
