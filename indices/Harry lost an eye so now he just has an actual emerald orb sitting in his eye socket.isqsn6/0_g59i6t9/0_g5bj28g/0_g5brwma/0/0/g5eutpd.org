I used to know someone who had a lost an eye. He apparently had several prosthetic eyes with different "looks," including a black eye with white skull-and-crossbones, but I never saw him with anything other than the one that matched his remaining eye.

I was also told that it was a mistake to ask him to keep an eye on your drink when you went to the men's room.
