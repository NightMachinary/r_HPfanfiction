A bit of what shadowyeager said, but also the fact that it'd make the change more interesting and impactful on Harry's life.

Just having a bright green gemstone eyeball isn't that much of a big deal, aside from noticing other people staring at you and they did that to Harry already. But imagine having this big eyepatch apparatus that you've gotta take off to sleep and strap back to your head every morning. That'd change your life and mindset a lot more, in the vein of any person with a significant prosthesis.
