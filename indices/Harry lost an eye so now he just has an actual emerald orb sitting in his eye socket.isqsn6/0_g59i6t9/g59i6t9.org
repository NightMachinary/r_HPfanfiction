I can see that being a fun snippet fic. First year, Harry burning the flesh of Quirrell leads to Harry losing his eyes (maybe Quirrell lashes out and literally melting/burning flesh hitting Harry in the face has some effect and since it's weird magic that caused it, Poppy can't fix it) and he gets a massive Mad-Eye like prosthesis with an enchanted emerald sphere for an eye there.

Lots of running jokes throughout the rest of the series, akin to that ditzy pirate eyeball guy from Pirates of the Caribbean. :D
