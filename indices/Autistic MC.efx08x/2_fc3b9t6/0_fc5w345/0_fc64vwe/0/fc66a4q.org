  when I say that Autism is a personality type I mean that it isn't some kind of disease that can be cured

Calling it a "personality type" is really condescending though, especially from neurotypical or higher functioning people. It shames people who need additional care or disability accommodations, including myself. I wouldn't choose to be born without autism, but it's not my personality. I think it's better to use the "neurodiversity" terminology than something that divisive.
