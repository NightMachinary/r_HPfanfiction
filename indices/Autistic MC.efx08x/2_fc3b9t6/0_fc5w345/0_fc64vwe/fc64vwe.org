I have also been professionally diagnosed, and when I say that Autism is a personality type I mean that it isn't some kind of disease that can be cured (it really annoys me that so many people talk about autism like it's a mental disease) it is just being wired a little differently. I have had a lot of problems because of my autism, but it is also a core part of who I am, and if given the option I would not choose to have been born 'normal'.
