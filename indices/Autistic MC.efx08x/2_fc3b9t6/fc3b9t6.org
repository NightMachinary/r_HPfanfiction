This story isn't a hp fanfic, but it is a really good story with a high-functioning autistic teenage wizard for a main character. I don't think he is ever diagnosed, but the signs are extremely evident if you know what to look for. I don't think I've read a better book with a high functioning autistic character, most works just portray autism as either Sheldon Cooper, or it being such a serious problem that they can't function, rather than what it is, a personality type
