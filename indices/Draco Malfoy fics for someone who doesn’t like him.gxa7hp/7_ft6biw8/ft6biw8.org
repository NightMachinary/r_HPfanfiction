I just finished a Dramione fic in which I put a great deal of effort into making everyone pretty similar to canon, since it bugs me when he's written as this sweet, caring dreamboat straight out of Hogwarts. Draco's an unrepentant arsehole at the start and Hermione genuinely hates him. Post war but not epilogue compliant.
