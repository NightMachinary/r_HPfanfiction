I know what you mean about George and Angelina. I like them too but there is very little of them out there. That said, I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882577/1/A-Bit-Unhealthy][A Bit Unhealthy]].

It is a sorta sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4460110/1/Hermafrosts][Hermafrosts]] which is Fred/Angelina. You don't absolutely need to read Hermafrosts first but know that A Bit Unhealthy referenced a couple of situations from Hermafrosts.

I also thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5341272/1/Say-What-You-Need-to-Say][Say What You Need to Say]] was pretty good as well.
