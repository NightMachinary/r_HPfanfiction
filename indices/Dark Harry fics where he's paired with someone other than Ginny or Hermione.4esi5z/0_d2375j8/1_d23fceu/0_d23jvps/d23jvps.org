I read the whole fic and the thing that annoyed me the most was that the whole drama with Katie and Harry that resulted in them breaking up was so unbelievable and unrealistic. I get that it was dramatized somewhat but I feel like the author just made up some crap to pair Harry and Fleur together.

Harry/Fleur is a really popular pairing and it was sorta a shame to see the author miss out on a less popular and more interesting pairing.
