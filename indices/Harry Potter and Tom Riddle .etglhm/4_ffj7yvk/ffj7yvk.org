*Lily's Changes* linkffn(6992471)

It starts as a adversarial accomplices, then accomplices, and then it moves up to equals with mentor vibes. There's a big difference between Voldemort and Tom Riddle, and this fic goes into this. I think it was the horcruxes doing it, the more there are, the higher his instability is. They fix this. This fic does throw Dumbledore under the bus though.

H/Hr/L, but it isn't part of the focus. Mainly the final chapter/epilogue stuff.
