No.

It's not like someone is going through every work and giving it a rating a la the MPAA. It's more of an 'honors system' than anything else. As evident by the fact that FFN explicitly does not allow any 'MA' (which would be closer to X than R in your description) content yet it's there aplenty.

It boils down to 'is it for all audiences?' 'is it for teenagers?' and 'is it for adults' and that's all you really need. There's next to no enforcement on viewing or actually posting and there's no reason to overly complicate it.

To be entirely honest the thing that most often determines 'rating' is language or sexual content. Since, theoreticaly (lol) ffn should have no explicit sexual content, that would boil down to language. You can write a mature story and not say 'fuck' or throw a lot of gore in it. There's no reason that shouldn't be T.
