I'm pretty sure that there is no child-friendly way to deal with watching your parents being brutally murdered (like in Harry's case) or your mother raped in front of you unless you want to make it unrealistic (like the Dursley abuse, but that is an entirely different can of worms).

There's a reason why people usually get therapy after such events, and unless you have a solid background in that area (degree in child psychology for example) or personal experiences, any attempt at writing about such topics in a child-friendly way will fail spectacularly. Hell, any attempt at writing about those topics without some sort of experience will fail spectacularly, no matter the target audience.
