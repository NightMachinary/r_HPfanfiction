I think they just need a system more like AO3. Not that FFN allows explicit stuff, but like has anyone ever really filtered for K+ solely? I mean an adult and a non-adult rating is all they truly need in my opinion. I wish if there was a change that they would remember I like M rated stories in my searches by default. Annoying to have to add it. Or maybe I should just log in more if they do this already.
