I actually meant for searching to be easier. Internet makes it basically impossible to censor anything if the user really wants to see something. It was simply to make life easier while searching. Considering that there isn't a tag system in FFN, we only have genre, rating, size and characters to mess around while searching, so imo it would make it a bit easier.
