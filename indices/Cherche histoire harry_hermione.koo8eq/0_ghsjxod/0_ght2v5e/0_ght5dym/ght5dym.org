  Hi, I'm looking for a Harry/Hermione fic with time travel but I only remember a tiny bit of the story. The bit that I remember best is that Harry came back during the Care of Magical Creatures class with the Hippogriff, and that he hugged Hermione. I hope that that was clear enough to understand, thanks in advance.

Unfortunately this isn't a great place for finding fics in other languages :(
