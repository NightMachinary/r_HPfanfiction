So the Harry Potter fanfic community consists of mostly Americans who write about Harry loving his mom, eating hotdogs, talking about baseball, calling Dean a soccer fan and walking around blocks in downtown London.

And you decide, it would be a good idea, to ask these people for a fanfic where Harry talks in a very specific British accent, without linking to a video or text on what a Geordie accent sounds or reads like.

Really?
