Someone from Newcastle. It's just a sort of nickname for them; like Mackems for people from Sunderland, Mancunians for Manchester, Scousers/Liverpudlians for Liverpool... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_regional_nicknames][there's quite a lot of them]]. Although, it's a rather specific request, considering Newcastle is in Northeast England and Harry's from Surrey, which is south of London.
