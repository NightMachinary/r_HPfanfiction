I read all kinds of next gen! Two questions: are you looking specifically for romance and do you mind if there are OCs?

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]] is a Rose and Albus story and deliciously intense and no-holds barred--I haven't had the time to properly read this, but what I have seen is very very good.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All The Abstract Nouns]] is a gen Molly II fic about growing up in her teen years--a common premise, but this fic makes it amazing. She's relatable and though her experiences are familiar, they feel fresh.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] is narrated by Rose but is Weasley-family centric and gives backstory to just about every next gen character. It's my favorite-ever family fic.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] is a Victoire/Teddy/Molly II and my favorite romance story. It's a love triangle that actually matters, with stakes and mistakes that don't necessarily heal cleanly.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] is Hugo-centric, an adorable adventure story with the best bromance between him, Scorpius, and Neville.
- If you don't mind a fic that is unfinished but one of the best grown-up rom-coms while it lasts, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=286886][After Hours]] is great. It rotates between Rose, Molly, Lily, and Lucy's love lives.
- Similarly for [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] which is a great humor story even if it isn't complete. It's narrated by Fred II, and also has James, Albus, and others in a radio show.

I tried to give a variety; I still have more, if you'd like! :)
