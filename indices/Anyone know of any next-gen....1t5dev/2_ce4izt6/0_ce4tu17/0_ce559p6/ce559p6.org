- I'd recommend any of [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet's]] stories. She writes a lot of Scorpius stories (either gen or paired with Lucy), and they tend to melancholy with a wry humor. Counting Daisy Roots is a really original take, with Scorpius dealing with the consequences of being sort-of resurrected.
- GubraithianFire has great writing style (complete opposite of JKR's though). [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]] is a dark, Hogwarts-political Albus/OC currently being updated, but is pre-completed. Something lighter but with a similar cynical flair is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=300442][The Horror!]]
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]] is a Lucy/Moody time-travel romance with a noir-like atmosphere.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][I write next gen too!]]
