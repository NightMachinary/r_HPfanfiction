This is the best next gen I've ever read. I've always loved the concept of next gen fics, and then always felt disappointed because they're too heavy on the romance side - that may appeal to some, but not to me personally, I'm afraid. But this... Oh my merlin, this is a fantastic story. There is romance (I know you said no scorose, but this is seriously worth a read, and they're not a couple for most of it), loads of suspense, some fantastic action scenes, a well developed host of characters, including canon next gen kids, and some brilliant Ocs... It's just... Wow. It's called Ignite, and is by Slide, and is superb. I cannot recommend it highly enough. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613]]
