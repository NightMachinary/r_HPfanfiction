Inverarity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is Teddy-centric and quite good. (Novel-length, complete).

Bad Mum's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199992/1/A-Strictly-Legal-Matter][A Strictly Legal Affair]] is a Rose/Draco one-shot (and surprisingly good for an otherwise squicky pairing).

Deadwoodpecker's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][Backward with Purpose II: The Book of Albus]] is one of my favorite stories (Albus-centric, novel-length, complete), but you probably need to read BWP I to make much sense of it.
