i have no idea which of these has been crossposted, so i'll just yeet these in

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13795605?view_full_work=true][Victoria Potter by Taure]]

- easily my favorite, and has very good worldbuilding

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin]]

-first in a /very/ long series

-very weird, also the tom riddle/femharry isn't /really/ a thing, so i recommend trying it anyways

and it's sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685944?view_full_work=true][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]] is also good stuff

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17241749?view_full_work=true][Breathe (Don't Falter) by silenceia]]

-i know it's already been recommended but this. fic. is. amazing.
