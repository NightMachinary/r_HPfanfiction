Oh my gosh, I just read Victoria Potter on your recommendation. Loved it so so so much. The characterization of magic in it is honestly the best I've ever read. The author took JKR's ideas for how the magic of the universe should go and somehow managed to make them better--more polished. Still consistent, just better. I love the dialogue throughout--it's all so spot on. And I really like this Dumbledore. He's powerful, not perfect, but also not evil or stupid. Love him!
