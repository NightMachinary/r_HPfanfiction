I remember going through these kinds of questions when I was writing one of my recentish fics, where Harry has an animagus form and is fighting a werewolf in the founder's era. It happens in chapter 3 of linkffn(12120450). I think essentially I went with something like the skill to transform into an animagus requires you to be so in tune with your body that it's able to prevent lycanthropy from taking hold.
