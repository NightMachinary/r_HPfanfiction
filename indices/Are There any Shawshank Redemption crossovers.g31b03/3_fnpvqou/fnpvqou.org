It would be great to see the inside going ons. I mean the inmates still have to be fed and I'm sure there are still different levels of secerety so just like a normal prison they probably have the inmates doing some of the work. Free labor. Perhaps with modified wands. Sirius escaped because he seen a paper with a picture of wormtail. So did they get reading material? There's definitely room to play.

I use to work at a jail and inmates were always coming up with new ways to pass messages and items with each other. I just don't see Azkaban being any different especially since the jailors can't see. The inmates could blantonly be passing things to each other as long as a wizard wasn't watching.
