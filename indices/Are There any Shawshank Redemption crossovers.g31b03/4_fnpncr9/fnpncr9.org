I think that you don't have much room for something like "Orange Is the New Black" or similar prison intrigues because Azkaban makes even a gulag look like a holiday resort. The prisoners are all isolated and exposed to soul-sucking demons who don't speak English. Having a PoV of Azkaban would be little more than torture galore.
