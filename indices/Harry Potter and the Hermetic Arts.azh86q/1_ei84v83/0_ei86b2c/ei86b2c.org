  But your friend really needs an editor.
#+end_quote

I am the editor.

  Among other things, at the bare minimum, it really needs another proof-read. Grammatical errors and typos abound.
#+end_quote

A lot of the "typos" are dialect taken from books. What you consider to be grammatical errors, are eccentricities in how Harry thinks, which is how the writer chose to write it. Let's face it, people's thought streams do not care about grammar.

  A much more important problem is that there isn't even a hint of the AD&D 2e content in the chapter which is the premise upon which the story was ptiched. I clicked the link out of interest in seeing how that would work out - instead I got, well, I'm not sure what I got, but it wasn't what was advertised.
#+end_quote

The intention was to establish the setting first. Furthermore, this is not a story where AD&D 2E's magic system is lifted wholesale; I read the entire PHB while doing research for the pitch, and though the book does provide tell you which spells need which components, the book never actually tells what any of those components detail. Furthermore, the tabletop RPG in the story description is in there so people wouldn't be thrown by it later, but the fact is, this story is going to build to it.

  Harry throwing the F-word at Hagrid? Harry not being the least bit impressed with magic? Way out of character and doesn't make the least bit of sense.
#+end_quote

It makes plenty of sense if you think about it and not demand everything go with your expectations. This is a kid who has spent the last three years of his life doing his own magic; magic isn't new to him, so why would he be impressed by it? As for why he's profane and foul-tempered, he's literally spent three years in the company of tabletop gamers, many of whom aren't exactly known for their social skills, and children are prone to picking up mannerisms from the people around them, particularly people they like. He didn't go with Hagrid because he thought he was being rescued, or because he wanted to learn about magic (he already knows magic, he's been exploring it on his own for three years), he left because he saw the situation between Hagrid and his relatives would likely escalate if he did not defuse it and thought getting rid of Hagrid would be for the best.

  Small point, but the phrase "Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts," should only ever be mentioned once, if at all, in a fic - not 15 times in a chapter that's barely 3000 words.
#+end_quote

I asked, and it's used like that intentionally. The writer is implying that Harry is not becoming attached to Hagrid, doing so through the use distancing language. Harry is mocking Hagrid for his overstuffed title every time he thinks of him in such a way.

If you don't like he way Harry feels about Hagrid now, you may want to stop reading before the next chapter; Harry is not kind of Hagrid, and deconstructs his behavior in a way that's extremely unflattering towards him. In fact, the way he sees wizards is extremely unflattering in general, because, as somebody who grew up in the company of mundane people, all the idiosyncrasies of magical people are frankly weird and backwards.

  I'm sorry if that comes off kind of harsh - that's not my intention.
#+end_quote

I don't find you harsh at all. It's an opinion, and everybody has one. Like the way Harry seems to be behaving.
