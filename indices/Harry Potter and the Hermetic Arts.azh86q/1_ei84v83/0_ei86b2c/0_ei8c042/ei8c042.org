  A lot of the "typos" are dialect taken from books.

That's not what I was talking about. Having Hagrid talk like Hagrid is fine. I meant misplaced commas, run-on sentences, and poor word choice. For example, the second sentence in the story is rather unwieldy. It basically boils down to, "[Harry] regarded [Hagrid] in the same regard as one might [an idiot]." But it's too long and awkward and uses the same word (regarded/regard) twice.

  the tabletop RPG in the story description is in there so people wouldn't be thrown by it later

If you want to go with that approach, okay. Normally, you want your first chapter to grab the reader's attention and get them interested and invested in the story. The summary should do this as well, but it has to be even more precise since it's so short. Instead, reading the summary and then reading the chapter felt like a bait-and-switch; I was lured in with the promise of HP and D&D, but instead I got Harry swearing at Hagrid with narry a d20 in sight.

  This is a kid who has spent the last three years of his life doing his own magic; magic isn't new to him, so why would he be impressed by it? As for why he's profane and foul-tempered, he's literally spent three years in the company of tabletop gamers...

Okay, /you're/ telling me that, but /the story/ didn't tell me that. It's okay to have Harry act differently from his canon portrayal, but the reader needs to know /why/ he's acting differently. The chapter gives no context for the change so it simply comes off as out of character.

That's the big problem. The fact that you need to explain why all these changes have taken place in a reddit post simply shows that the introductory chapter has failed to set up the character changes, the advertised plot hook, the setting, or the larger story.

If you want to establish that Harry's spent time with a bunch of foul-mouthed gamers, then maybe start things off with a Hogwarts owl arriving while Harry is in the middle of a game with his friends at the friendly local gaming store. Have them use that kind of language in the scene. And then, to show that Harry's already been using magic, and thus that walking into Diagon Alley wouldn't be quite so impressive to him, maybe he reacts out of surprise to the owl by casting Magic Missile. A simple scene like that would set up all the changes that have been added to the HP universe and allow the reader to actually buy into and follow what's going on.

As for the "Keeper of the Keys..." bit, if that's meant to be from Harry's point of view, it should be written that way. It would come across as Harry's thoughts if the chapter was written from a first-person perspective, but the author instead used third-person. The simple narration of actions doesn't necessarily come across as Harry's thoughts and opinions.

I think there's a good idea in there somewhere. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/]] has shown that HP and D&D can mix together remarkably well and tell some excellent stories, so I don't doubt that this idea could as well. But I really think it would benefit from some more time on the drawing board.
