To be honest, I think your friend's story needs a lot of work. I was interested to see what a HP story using AD&D 2e mechanics would be like, but I was only able to make it through half of the chapter.

Among other things, at the bare minimum, it really needs another proof-read. Grammatical errors and typos abound.

A much more important problem is that there isn't even a hint of the AD&D 2e content in the chapter which is the premise upon which the story was ptiched. I clicked the link out of interest in seeing how that would work out - instead I got, well, I'm not sure what I got, but it wasn't what was advertised.

Harry throwing the F-word at Hagrid? Harry not being the least bit impressed with magic? Way out of character and doesn't make the least bit of sense.

Small point, but the phrase "Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts," should only ever be mentioned once, if at all, in a fic - not 15 times in a chapter that's barely 3000 words.

I'm sorry if that comes off kind of harsh - that's not my intention. But your friend really needs an editor.
