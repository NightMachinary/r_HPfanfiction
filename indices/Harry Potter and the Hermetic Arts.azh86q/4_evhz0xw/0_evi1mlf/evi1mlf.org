  This might be a bit more legible if the sentences weren't bogged down by excess information and clauses. The writing lacks a certain flow because of it, as readers, especially modern ones do not respond well to overly descriptive long sentences. Try to switch it up more in descriptive paragraphs when it comes to sentence length and cut down on unnecessary adjectives and repetitive language.

Things are presented in the way they are because it reflects on how Harry perceives the world. If you don't respond to it, that's not my problem; it just means you can't keep up with this version of Harry.

#+begin_quote
  As an example: there is no need to repeat Hargrid's title, as the distancing is already being done and shown by all of Harry's conversation with him.
#+end_quote

There absolutely is a need to repeat Hagrid's title, because that's how Harry thinks of him. It is idiosyncratic to the character, the same way he never learns Ron Weasley's name, or keeps addressing several people by their surnames even after they tell him to call them by their given names.

#+begin_quote
  While I am sure there are reasons for why Harry is acting like a douchebaggy 18 year old, it hardly endears him to the reader. Which is an issue if he is the main character.
#+end_quote

He's not supposed to be endearing; he's the type of protagonist where the only reason he'd be the protagonist is because the audience spends the most time with him. He's meant to be a terrible person, a dungeonpunk take on the original story.

#+begin_quote
  That is not to say you cannot have an asshole main character, it is just a tad strange to have this kind of asshole and have him be 11.
#+end_quote

Clearly, you don't spend much time with 11-year-olds, then. I worked at a library for 9 years within walking distance to three schools, so let me tell you, children are major assholes, particularly around people they don't respect.

#+begin_quote
  Which leads me to my final point: his speech patterns do not match up with what one expects of an 11 year old, nor what one would expect of a first time interaction with an unknown person of some authority. Even if said person is a bit of a buffoon.
#+end_quote

You really don't know people who just don't put up with crap, or very well-educated youths, do you?

#+begin_quote
  I wish you both luck in finding the right voice and style of writing that works for you.
#+end_quote

We already have the right voice and style of writing. It's just not one you like.
