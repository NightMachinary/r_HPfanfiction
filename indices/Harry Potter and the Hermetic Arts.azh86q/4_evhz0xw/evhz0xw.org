Constructive criticism, take it or leave it. The writing: This might be a bit more legible if the sentences weren't bogged down by excess information and clauses. The writing lacks a certain flow because of it, as readers, especially modern ones do not respond well to overly descriptive long sentences. Try to switch it up more in descriptive paragraphs when it comes to sentence length and cut down on unnecessary adjectives and repetitive language. As an example: there is no need to repeat Hargrid's title, as the distancing is already being done and shown by all of Harry's conversation with him.

The characterization: While I am sure there are reasons for why Harry is acting like a douchebaggy 18 year old, it hardly endears him to the reader. Which is an issue if he is the main character. That is not to say you cannot have an asshole main character, it is just a tad strange to have this kind of asshole and have him be 11. Which leads me to my final point: his speech patterns do not match up with what one expects of an 11 year old, nor what one would expect of a first time interaction with an unknown person of some authority. Even if said person is a bit of a buffoon.

I wish you both luck in finding the right voice and style of writing that works for you.
