This made me picture Harry entering the RoR and meeting this crazy old wizard (picture Radagast from The Hobbit movies [if you've been tainted by them already, don't afflict yourself unnecessarily]). This wizard is the personification of Hogwarts who was locked in magical space. Harry frees him to resume growing like he used to.

Harry would then find out that Hogwarts was locked up for a reason as the last time he was loose he did all sorts of “improvements” to the castle that took a long time to fix (like making the stairs go crazy until the headmaster was able to make them only have the ability to move). Harry now has to fix his mistake as Hogwarts is now changing the castle drastically (making it float fifty metres in the air, attracting dragons to “protect itself”, etc).

I think this would be awesome...
