Errrr... sounds a little too straining to the suspense of disbelief for my tastes. The Room of Requirement is OP as fuck, but it's not THAT OP. I mean, what next? Harry using the Room of Requirement to create a big button labelled "push to fix everything"?

...I mean, that was the kind of Deus Ex Machina I wrote into stories when I was eight and couldn't think of a way to end a story. I literally had the main character find a button labelled "push to fix everything." My only defence was that I was eight years old, I'd written myself into a corner, and I was sick of writing that particular story.
