Affect, not effect. Also, there's a few fics where the RoR has the "soul" of the castle inside it, and Harry finds her (like 99% of the times, its a woman) and THEN she's the one that changes shit. Would that still work?

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Powe by kb0) is one of thoses. But there's a lot, just check this reddit.
