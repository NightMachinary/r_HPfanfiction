I completely agree. The fic just drops you right when things change for Ron when it could have taken the time to give at least some more background or exposition of their current relationship and activities. It's very evidently a PWP. I only skimmed it when I realized that (nothing against PWP, just not in the mood currently). So perhaps it's good if you're in the mood for a PWP featuring the trio, but it's definitely not the best.
