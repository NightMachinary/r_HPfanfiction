Romantic is quite possibly the last definition I would use.

As far as porn-without-plot goes I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. There are some punctuation and capitalization errors. Wandless magic of the caliber that Hermione uses is known to be outside of her skill in canon. There could be a bit more descriptiveness overall to improve the pace and immersion.
