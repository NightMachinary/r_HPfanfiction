Yeah, I was using romantic as distinguished from friendship. I'm aware that there isn't really much of a plot here. I think it's alright in terms of quality - loads better than what I normally find when looking around the site.

As far that being outside of Hermione's skill level in canon is concerned, well in canon Ruin would never be ok with this, so it doesn't bother me that much. Honestly, bumps in skill don't bother me much at all unless it's an unrealistic level.
