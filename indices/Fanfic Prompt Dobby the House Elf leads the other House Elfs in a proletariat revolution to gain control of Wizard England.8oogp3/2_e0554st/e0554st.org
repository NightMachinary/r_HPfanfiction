So what, in this fic Dobby is essentially Vladamir Lenin taking over the Soviet Union? Imagine if he dies, there was now a casket with a preserved body of Dobby on display in the Ministry of Magic atrium. Winky would be like Trotsky, and finally Kreacher takes over as the Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, and brings them to heel and purges huge swaths of the government and population, both out of fear and due to governmental mismanagement.

Also, by proxy, does that make Harry their version of Erich Ludendorff? After all, Ludendorff smuggled Lenin across Europe into the Russian heartland as a way to undermine and topple the Russian government. He regretted his actions afterward, because in nearly destroyed Germany when Bolshevism spread across Eastern Europe too. I can just see Harry being totally ripped apart afterward for not understanding why house elves were treated the way they were. And then Hermione, ironically, tries to lead a rebellion afterwards. I guess that makes her something like wizarding Hitler. No...wait...Voldemort already has that job.
