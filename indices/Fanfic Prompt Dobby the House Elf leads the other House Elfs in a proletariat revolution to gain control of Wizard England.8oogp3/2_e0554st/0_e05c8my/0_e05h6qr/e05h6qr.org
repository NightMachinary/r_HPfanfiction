No no no! This scenario supposes the house elves take over, so both Harry and Voldemort lose. So Ludendorff still fits, and I think Dumbledore is Hindenburg (that only sort of works).

I guess that makes Hermione the crown prince Franz Ferdinand or Gavrilo Princip (either one could work). They both got this whole thing started anyway, and Hermione spent all this time banging on about house elf rights. She even has her own organization for their rights willing to take drastic measures (The Black Hand = S.P.E.W. for those of you not following me).
