I found a harry/pansy story that i had to stop reading because the author loved to write useless and unneeded sex scenes between the two of them during third year. Like, I can barely read sex scenes when they're between consenting adults, mainly because if the story isn't pure smut i'm not reading said story for sex, but when the characters are fucking 13? get that shit out.
