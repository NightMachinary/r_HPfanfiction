They're probably wondering why a 12 year old is dressed like they've just stepped out of The Matrix.

But for me, when describing a person's appearance it should generally be limited to skin tone, hair and eye colour, and any immediately noticeable facial or body features (missing limbs, scars, even an especially large, bulbous nose would count). Just enough to get the reader's imagination to conjure up a rough image of the character in question. If you have to mention the clothes they're wearing, I would say to limit it to anything unusual, or immediately noticeable (Think Dumbledore's outlandish robes as an example).
