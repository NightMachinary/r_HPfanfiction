In my opinion, the clothes, by themselves, are useless. It only becomes interesting if it brings something else to the discussion.

For example, I don't care in what fabric the jean of Harry is, what interest me is that said clothes are handed clothes from Dudley and are horrible on Harry.

Or I don't care that the wizard robe of Draco is in Acromantula silk with golden threads forming little motive on the sleeves, I care that he seemingly expensive wizard robe.

In the Harry Potter universe, a character wardrobe description should be reduced to :\\
- Muggle or Magical\\
- State of said wardrobe (hand me down, expensive, good quality but really out of fashion . . .)\\
- Maybe color, especially if the character is flashy like Lockart or Dumbledore

The only case where I would see a precise description would be in a romance where a shocked character notice every little detail of his loved one after a big change of appearance (first date and meeting out of uniform for exemple) and even there I think the description above is a bit much.

PS: As for grown up men turning around to look at a 12 years old girl, guess it's time to call the Aurors.
