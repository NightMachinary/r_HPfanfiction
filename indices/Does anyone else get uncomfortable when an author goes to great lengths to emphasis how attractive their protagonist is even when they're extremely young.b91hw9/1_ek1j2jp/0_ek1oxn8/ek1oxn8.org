^ this is correct.

Unfortunately you get a ton of critics on Fanfiction that whine about not describing things enough. Which always irks me because it's way less effective for a variety of reasons.

One, the readers imagination is more likely to form a favorable picture of it than I am typing it out. So if I need the reader to like the character, I'd rather hint at things and let them fill in their preference than detail every inch of it. There's the whole beauty in the eye of the beholder thing. I'd rather let the reader fill in their own preferences. Of course I've only gotten I think four PMs asking me how busty characters are. So there's that.

Two, it makes plot points harder. If I'm specifically detailing clothing there's a purpose for it and I'm intentionally drawing the reader's attention to that. It should be a huge flag that it's something I want you to notice. IE Emily possessing the same wardrobe as Phoebe in LdS. If I describe clothing constantly that becomes pointless. If I don't, it's a huge context clue to a major plot point in the story.
