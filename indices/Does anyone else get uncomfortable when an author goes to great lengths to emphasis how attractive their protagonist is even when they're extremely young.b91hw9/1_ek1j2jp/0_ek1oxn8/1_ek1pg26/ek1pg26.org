An extension of Chekhov's gun in a way. If it isn't going to affect the story, then it shouldn't be mentioned unless you want to throw a false trail. Adding noise to the story is just going to make the important details be discarded with the inconsequential stuff.

I think we can all agree that the boobs of a character are important enough to mention though.
