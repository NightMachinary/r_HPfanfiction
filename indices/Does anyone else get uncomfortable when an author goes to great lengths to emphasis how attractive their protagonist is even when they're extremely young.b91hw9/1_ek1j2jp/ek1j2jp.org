My personal view is that appearances should be left to the imagination. I honestly can only think of a few very specific cases where we need to know the color, fabric, and size of clothing that person wears.

I don't really get uncomfortable as much as recognizing the poor writing. If someone uses terms such as sexy or whatnot to describe the kid, then that is just a weird term to use. Beautiful, handsome, angelic, or any other word that emphasizes appearance is just fine with me. Trying to describe your character as beautiful isn't as effective as just saying they're beautiful. It let's the reader fill in the blanks.
