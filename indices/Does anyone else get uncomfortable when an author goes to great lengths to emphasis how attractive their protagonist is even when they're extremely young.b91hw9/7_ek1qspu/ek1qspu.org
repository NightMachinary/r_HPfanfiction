I would have said instinctively yes but I think it depends on context. In this example I read the character as 'cool' rather than 'sexy', and the passersby as being of a similar age to her, judging by how they are impressed by this.

I've seen examples I find more egregious and uncomfortable - usually when it starts verging into descriptions of body parts, or self-objectification done by the character, or observations made by the author when there are no characters around to be an observer, so the observations are how the author perceives the character, not how they are seen in-universe. But, at the same time, going too strongly the other way denies or hides the truth that younger kids do think about dating and are - even if they don't recognize those feelings as such yet - impressed by other kids they might have crushes on.
