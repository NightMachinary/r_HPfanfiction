I mean, it's always an option to just wait till 5th year to give them a partner. It just means you can't get bogged down in the minutia of years 1-3 and drag out the stations of canon to 300,000 words, which is actually a good thing for the quality of your writing anyway. In fact there's no law that says you even need to HAVE a first year, or that you can't just brush over the first couple years in a single chapter each, letting us know anything which didn't happen as it did in canon (we've all read the books).
