It's both a case of Dawson Casting, and because the authors are forced to ignore their age to have some romance/sex before than half of the canon plot pass and they can legally have sex.

They would be forced to wait until the 5th year before giving them a partner, so they use the suspension of disbelief to force it before.

Expecially within the "Lord and Ladies" storylines where the characters are aged politician at the ripe age of 12y.
