While this description is not "sexy", it's style look like an error to give so much details of her appearance. And this "error" of writing also often come with making a character too "sexy".\\
I still have flash of some fic saying things like "She was wearing a little blue dress, and without her usual uniform, he could see she had grown in the right places" to describe a 13 years old.
