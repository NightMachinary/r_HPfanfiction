Dressed fully in Muggle clothes she drew stares from passersby, with her

skinny fit jeans,

*>It refers to how the legs are cut on the jeans. Not Sexual in any way just describing how the pant legs flair*

black leather boots,

*>Not sexual*

black leather jacket

*>Not sexual*

bird nest kept under control by a head band

*>Crazy hair, plus a hair band, Not Sexual*

She smiled behind her dark sunglasses

*>again Not Sexual*

as a few boys by the Quidditch Supply shop took their eyes off some new broomstick in the window to check her out.

*>No whistling or cat calling described. A muggle near a quidditch shop would draw attention anyway. A girl in high fashion would draw this kind of stare. They wern't even staring at her they just stoped looking at a broom to look at the girl checking out what she had on. Also doesn't say if the boys checking her out are 10, 14 or 28. I don't find this sexual at all IMO*

*I really don't find this paragraph spicy. I love it when they describe outfits and if boys are going to be drawn away from something i could easily see this happening. Mostly describes her outfit. Not like it says anything about her curves, or tits or arse. No winking or blowing kisses or showing cleavage. I think this is ultra mild on the sex scale.*
