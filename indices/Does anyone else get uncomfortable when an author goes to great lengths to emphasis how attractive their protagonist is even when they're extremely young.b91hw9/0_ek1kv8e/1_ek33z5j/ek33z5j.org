For some strange reason that quote made me remember the movie [[http://www.shellingford.oxon.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/bugsy-malone-2017.jpg][Bugsy Malone.]] It must have been a godsend to paedohpiles. 13-14-year-old girls were deliberately made out to look as sexy as possible, and watching that movie skewed my age perception for hours afterwards. Adults looked /strange/.

I vote creepy.
