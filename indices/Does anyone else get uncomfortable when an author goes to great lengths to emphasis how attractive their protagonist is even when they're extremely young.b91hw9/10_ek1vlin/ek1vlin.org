It depends for me, we have an adult perspective, I assume. Most of the protagonists in HP are younger than me so I always find it weird when it gets sexy.

But something to remember is that a lot of authors are 14, 15, or 16 and to them its either a way to look mature or its from their perspective. I just have to remember that it might be a 14 year writing it who rightfully sees nothing wrong with explaining how how a 14 year old guy is. I just see it and move on.
