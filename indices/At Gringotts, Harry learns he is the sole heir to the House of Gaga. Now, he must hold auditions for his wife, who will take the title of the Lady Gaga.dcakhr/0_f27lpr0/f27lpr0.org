Daphne Greengrass looked at the faces of the other girls at the table. Susan Bones tapped her fingers nervously on the green felt, a look of determination on her features. Luna Lovegood was focused on the small chips in front of her, stacking them over and over again.

Hermione Granger, meanwhile, was reading a small book about Texas Hold'em, whatever that was. This made Daphne a little nervous, as she thought they would be playing poker, not Texas Hold'em. Muggle games still confused her, despite these past few weeks with Harry and the others.

Her eyes turned to the dealer's seat, where a very relaxed Harry Potter shuffled a deck of muggle playing cards.

The anticipation grew to be too much for Susan. "Why are we doing this again?" She asked.

Harry grinned. "Because it's fun?"

"Relax, Susan," said Luna. "Lord Gaga just wants to see your poker face."
