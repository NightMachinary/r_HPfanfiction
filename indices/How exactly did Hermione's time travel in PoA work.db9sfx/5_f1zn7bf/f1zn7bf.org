Agree with Slightly Too Heavy. Time travel in PoA follows Novikov's self consitancy principle. Thay means you can't create a paradox (which in this case means eliminating the reason why you traveled back in the first place). So had Harry and Hermione already known their plan had worked, they wouldn't have needed to travel back. Everything you do in the past has already happened, so you can't really have your characters change anything significant.
