People commenting here are totally right. It's the causality principle, you can't change the past with a time-turner, if you try, as Hermione said "terrible things happen".

The interesting thing is that the only way they knew to use the time-turner, is because they've already done it. Since the timeline in PoA is constant, immutable, they couldn't have even thought of using of the time turner if they haven't already time-turned into the past before. It's a self contained system and probably why time-turners are so regulated, if you tried to delve from the past's script, you are going to cause a paradox, which would cause the "terrible things" consequences.

Therefore she just went to classes, time turned in a corridor, went to another class and appeared the moment or not very long after she disappeared and near the same place, so as not to alarm anyone.

Of course it's full of plot holes and requires you to suspend your disbelief, but it's Prisoner of Azkaban, not a sci-fi story about time travel by a competent author who understands such issues.
