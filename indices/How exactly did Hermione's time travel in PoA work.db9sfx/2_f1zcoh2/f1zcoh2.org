Canonical time travel in Harry Potter (at least before JKR forgot how her own universe works in Cursed Child) is not so much time travel as it is creating a temporary clone of yourself with future knowledge. You cannot use it to change the past, because your future self and your original past self exist within the same timeline. Any attempt to change the past will fail, because your future self already tried and failed, if not outright caused events to play out as they did for your past self.

This is how Harry was able to save himself from the Dementors with his Patronus; there exists no timeline in which his future self was not present to save him.

Within your example, Hermione 1 attended Divination and Transfiguration with the boys, time-turned when they weren't looking to become Hermione 2. An hour later by her perspective, Hermione 2 walked over to where she knew they would be and seamlessly slipped into the place Hermione 1 had occupied seconds before.
