I feel this story is so overrated because it's premise is relatively rare which is "Dumbledore mentors Harry and goes adventuring with him".

It's magic system is changed drastically from canon. Harry can do really cool things with magic no one else can because "intent". Also the shoehorned star wars references.

The author explains "loopholes" in canon very thoroughly, not trusting the reader to extrapolate, and almost disrespecting the source material by going out of his way to point out and rectify what he feels are mistakes.

The pranks are just cringey, honestly. Everyone's OOC, especially Sirius who's the fanon "unable to take anything serious and only above-average at magic" Sirius Black.

The writing is grammatically correct for the most part, but the style (in my opinion) is lacking.

There are a few good things about it, but I really feel like it requires a disclaimer when being recommended.
