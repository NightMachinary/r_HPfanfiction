Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

Harry, Hermione and Ron as superspies in training. No magic, but lots of Q-like devices, lots of background, and a Ron who is the son of a Lord, and yet still the Ron we know - but more importantly, is the Ron canon Ron should have grown up into.
