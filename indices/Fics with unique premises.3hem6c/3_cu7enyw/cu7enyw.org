I would say Hogwarts Battle School linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]) If you haven't read it yet, it's about Dumbledore dying in the first war, and Snape taking over as headmaster, reforming hogwarts into something in many ways similar to what we see in "Ender's Game". Focus is on dueling and group battles between the various houses.
