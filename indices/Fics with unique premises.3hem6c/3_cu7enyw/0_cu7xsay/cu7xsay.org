Battle School is pretty good, but is it just me that is bothered by the combat?

It portrays magical combat like some sort of flintlock pistol dueling, with dodging, rolling and magical exhaustion. I just couldn't take it, it seemed so outlandish.

In canon, as far as I can remember, combat is portrayed by the normally skilled fighters shielding or (mostly movies?) batting spells away, with only really unskilled kids dodging, while the truly skilled fighters barely even moving, just flinging death and destruction and using *magic* to defend themselves.

I don't know, I just think for a fic so much about fighting, it handled HP fighting pretty poorly.
