Since I was just writing about it on other threads, [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] is the only non-crack fic that I know of where Hermione ends up in Triwizard in Harry's place. It could be edited down by about a third, and the ending is kind of weak: too fixficish, but most of it is good.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) is not the only fic that gives Hermione a powerup or a special talent, but it's only one I know where the story is actually about her doing stuff with said powerup or special talent (rather than helping Harry, who got an even bigger powerup or special talent, or something like that).
