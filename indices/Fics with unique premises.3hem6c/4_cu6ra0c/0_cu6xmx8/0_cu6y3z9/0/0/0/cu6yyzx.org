  Ahh, but Dumbledore was another Powerful Wizard, so of course he wouldn't sympathise with the ministry.
#+end_quote

One doesn't need to sympathize with something in order to understand it and caution others against changing too much too quickly. Dumbledore, of all people, should have understood that.

  And Hermione is a book learner and the book was written by Dumbledore, who is one of her heroes.

This is a separate issue with this fic, which I didn't want to bring up: in a nutshell, Hermione in it is pretty fanonized. In canon, she wanted to be like Dumbledore when she grew up (and, had she been endowed with Power, she probably would have been one of the take-over-the-world types, for the world's own good, of course), but she had no trouble questioning Dumbledore's motives and reasoning on several occasions (PS and DH are two that I remember). And, as for her blindly trusting books, we actually have canon that directly contradicts that: she read what she could find on House-Elves that was written by wizards, and then she explicitly rejected it, instead applying her Muggle-derived ethics. She would know at least some of the long history of Muggles reigning in powerful people. (If she were American, she would know about Checks and Balances; but as a Briton, she would know about the Magna Carta.)

  Maybe the author didn't think of this and it's all just me reading to much into it, and I'm also playing devils advocate against your arguments.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, and I agree with your assessment.

  But I doubt a PW who had been trapped by the ministry would talk about how the ministry kind of has a point.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore would. He's wise that way. :P
