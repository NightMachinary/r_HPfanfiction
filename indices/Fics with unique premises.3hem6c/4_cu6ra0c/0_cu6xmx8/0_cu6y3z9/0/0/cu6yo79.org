Ahh, but Dumbledore was another Powerful Wizard, so of course he wouldn't sympathise with the ministry. And Hermione is a book learner and the book was written by Dumbledore, who is one of her heroes.

Maybe the author didn't think of this and it's all just me reading to much into it, and I'm also playing devils advocate against your arguments. But I doubt a PW who had been trapped by the ministry would talk about how the ministry kind of has a point.
