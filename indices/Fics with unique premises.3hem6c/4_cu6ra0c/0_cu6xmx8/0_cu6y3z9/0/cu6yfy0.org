It would be good, if the author didn't go out of his (I think it's a "he".) way to make his sympathies as clear as possible. We are obviously supposed to empathize with Harry and cheer for his actions. If nothing else, I don't recall Dumbledore, in his writing, pointing out that this setup has important functions and neither does Hermione.

The way I see it is as follows (copied from my post on a different forum):

Roll 5d6. If you got all 6s, then congratulations, you won the genetic lottery and get to be one of the Powerful Otherwise, sorry, someone else got the Power, and it's only somewhat correlated with their general intelligence, and is completely orthogonal to empathy and humility; and even then, power corrupts. So, you better hope that nobody who won the die roll takes a disliking to you or yours, and that you and yours manage to avoid becoming cannon fodder or collateral damage when some of those who won the die roll take a disliking to each other and go to war. (History shows that three out of the four Powerful wizards of the 20th century that we know about did exactly that.)

Oh, and that fourth wizard who didn't try to take over the world? He just indiscriminately crippled the closest thing to a police force the wizarding world has, and that force was in charge of punishing common crime, preserving the Statute of Secrecy, and protecting Muggles from abuse and exploitation. Roll 5d6. Unless you got all 6s, you're a Muggle. Have fun.
