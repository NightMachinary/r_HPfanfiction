I think the ambiguity of the "good guys" is a good thing. Because it's all filtered through the eyes of Harry, one of those few incredibly powerful wizards who would be fettered by the ministry instead of helped by them. So of course he will see the restrictions and control on power as a bad thing, because he can actually use that power.
