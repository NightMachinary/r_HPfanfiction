This is one of the things that I love about "Blood Magic" by GatewayGirl and "Digging for the Bones" by Paganaidd.

Both are Severitus fics and the focus is on that. But halfway through the story on Blood Magic there is an article on Harry's life with the Dursleys resulting in Fudge trying to get guardianship over Harry. Quite a few adults are shocked at the extend of the abuse and try to apologise to Harry and Harry does not take it well. I find it a really realistic portrait of a child with a bad homelife.

Similar can be said about Digging for the Bones. I find Harry's reaction to living with Snape really well done and in-character with how he is portrayed in the books.
