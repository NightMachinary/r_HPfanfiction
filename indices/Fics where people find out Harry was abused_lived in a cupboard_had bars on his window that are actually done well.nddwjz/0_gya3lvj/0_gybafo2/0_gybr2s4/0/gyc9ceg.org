My grammar thing is a left over from school. They drilled it into our heads, then had us read Halld√≥r Laxness (Iceland's only Nobel prize laureate). He consistently wrote words the way you pronounce them, which is a grammatical mess.

But if we tried to do that yourself, no dice. You see, when he did it, it was artistic license. We were just being prats. Pff. Hypocrites.
