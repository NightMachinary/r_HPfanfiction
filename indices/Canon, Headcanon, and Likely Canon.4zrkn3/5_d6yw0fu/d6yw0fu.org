I agree with other commenters that too many fanfics made him a mopping mess after the Battle. Harry was a mentally very strong person (immune to Imperius at age 14), and he would honor the fallen with effective actions after the war. The worst that could happen was squandering that one golden opportunity to remake the British Wizarding Society to their ideals.

Harry was also not someone resting on his guilt. He didn't even apologize to Hermione for getting the Taboo triggered.
