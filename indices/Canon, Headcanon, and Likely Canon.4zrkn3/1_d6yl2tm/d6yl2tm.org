I think you're missing something: that Harry often feels guilt, yes, but that it rarely affects his life much. For example, he felt bad for Sirius' death, but unlike so much fanfic, in canon Harry didn't sit around moping, crying, beating himself up about it. He just got on with his life.

So will Harry feel some survivor's guilt after DH? Likely. Will it stop him from celebrating Voldemort's death and being proactive in the clean-up of the Ministry? Extremely unlikely.
