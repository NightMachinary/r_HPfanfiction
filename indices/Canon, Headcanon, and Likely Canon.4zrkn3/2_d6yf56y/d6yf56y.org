I don't accept Harry apologizing to everyone like he does in fics. That drives me crazy. He'd feel guilty for not doing enough and confide that to Ron/Hermione/Ginny at most, but I don't think he'd go around apologizing to everyone. How often does he do that in canon? We never see him apologize to the Diggory's for Cedric death. The closest he comes to expressing his regret is when he tries to give them the Triwizard winnings. He doesn't want to talk about Sirius' death the end of OoTP. I don't even remember him apologizing for Mr. Weasley getting attacked even when he was so sure he did it while possessed. It's not in character for him.

I don't think there's anything that 'likely canon.' That's just headcanon that fits more to the spirit of canon. However, it's still unconfirmed and there can be a different sequence of events in everyone's head, and that is what makes it headcanon.
