It is unlikely Harry would blame himself for the deaths of anyone he was not in direct contact with.

He didn't even blame himself for Dobby or Hedwig dying. I very much doubt he will blame himself for the death of Lavender or Colin.

What you are thinking of is Fanon. Because in Canon, Harry did not spend much time crying, whining, etc.

It's only in fanfiction written by teenage girls that Harry is a whinefest.

In Canon, after Sirius died, it didn't long for Harry to get over it.
