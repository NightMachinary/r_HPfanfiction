  I think if he blamed himself for Cedric and Sirius, which were not his fault, he'd probably blame himself for everyone else who died.

They were a lot /more/ his fault than anyone else who dies in the series, though. When Cedric died, it was because Harry made an innocuous-seeming decision that got him killed. It wasn't really his fault, but direct guilt makes perfect sense. Sirius, outright, would not have died if Harry hadn't gone off half-cocked after falling for a trap. Both are deaths that he, though not intentionally, had a fairly direct hand in.

Feeling guilty for everyone else, beyond, say, Moody is just having more of a messiah complex than he ever does in the books. He doesn't hold himself personally responsible for people killed during Voldemort's campaign of assassinations in HPB.
