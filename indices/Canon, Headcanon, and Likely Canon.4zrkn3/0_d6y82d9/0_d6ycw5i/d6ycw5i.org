I think if he blamed himself for Cedric and Sirius, which were not his fault, he'd probably blame himself for everyone else who died.

I'm ok with him being an angsty mess if either 1) he moves on from that early enough in the story or 2) it causes him to do something drastic that creates a compelling story like moving away for a couple of years and then coming back. I always like those stories.
