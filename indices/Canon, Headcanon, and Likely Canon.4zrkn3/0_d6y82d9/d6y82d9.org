This is one of my least favorite things after post war fics. I don't think its really true either. Cedric wouldn't have died if it weren't for Harry, Sirius too. This can't really be said for everyone else.

He'd probably have survivors guilt, he'd certainly feel awful, but it wouldn't be the angsty mess of nearly every after DH fic.
