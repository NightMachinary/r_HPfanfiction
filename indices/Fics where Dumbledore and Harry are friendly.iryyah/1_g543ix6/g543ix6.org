Ingenio Ab Artifex is a fun one where Harry and Dumbledore are very close, with a very familial-esque relationship. I can't link directly due to rule 8 (to clarify, the older person doesn't know their partner is a minor - age fourteen or fifteen, I think? - and it's completely non-graphic and basically just 'we went upstairs and had a great half an hour' but that's semi-suggestive and better safe than banned :D), but here's a link to the author profile.
