Let's get these out of the way just because they get recommended here a /lot/. Both are great stories, both are quite cracky.

Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)\\
The premise is exactly what it says on the tin. Harry's a dragon, and that's pretty much the /least/ of the changes in this fic. Dumbledore is goofy-but-supercompetent, which means Voldemort is barely a problem at any point.

Albus And Harry's World Trip: linkffn(13388022)\\
Harry gets expelled after the Chamber incident. Albus, not having been re-instated as Headmaster, takes him on a world trip.
