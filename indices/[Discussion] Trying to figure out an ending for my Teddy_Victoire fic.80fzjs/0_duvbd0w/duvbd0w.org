That's totally up to you. How do YOU see them reconciling? As a writer, you need to really believe in what you're writing so it will come across as authentic. If you really want them to reconcile romantically, but you think readers want them to stay friends, then any attempt by you to write what you /think/ readers want will just ring false.

It's your story--write what you want to see. You're just inviting readers along for the ride.
