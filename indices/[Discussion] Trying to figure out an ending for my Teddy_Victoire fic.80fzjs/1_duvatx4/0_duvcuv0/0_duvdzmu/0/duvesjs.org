I think that this is mostly due to the time constraints of fiction. Usually you have years between "loves" but it is really hard to convey that in writing because the main plot will be long resolved by then. Also, according to the commonly accepted theory of Checkov, you ought to only include things essential to the plot and "relationships which didn't work out" just doesn't fit in there. If the readers get invested into a pairing only for it to turn out insignificant, they will be pissed, especially since it is difficult to write a "good" ending of a relationship without turning the first love interest into a villain.
