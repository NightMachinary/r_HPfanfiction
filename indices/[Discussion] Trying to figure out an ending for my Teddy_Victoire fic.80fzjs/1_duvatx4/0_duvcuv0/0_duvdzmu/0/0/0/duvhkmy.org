It really depends. I am not familiar with your works nor with the main plot so take everything I say with a grain of salt. If you start with an offscreen break-up and it is merely backstory, then I really don't care about it. But if you have some on-screen romance or a lot of focus on their mutual feelings, then there ought to be some payoff.

I am not a traditional romance writer/reader. I despise the "but will they end up together" type of stories. It makes a poor plot in my opinion because those stories tend to be riddled with unnecessary drama and angst. I prefer the "they get together and have to face some kind of problem together" because reading about a couple taking on everything from magical Nazis to an evil witch with daddy issues is a lot more than interesting than the stories where the reader can tell the outcome by page and age 5. You have to ask yourself what kind of story you are writing and which part romance ought to play. Then you have to pick whatever suits your plot and vision the best.
