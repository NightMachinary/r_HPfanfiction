it's definitely a /big/ part of the story, and maybe the biggest part. the general idea was that the adventure (save the world, etc.) would bring them back together, but as i've written the story and the characters, i like the idea of victoire and teddy growing up and growing out of their childhood love. BUT IT MAKES ME SAD TO DO THAT.
