I was thinking of having a permanent tag of let's say Harmony, there's always things mentioned like the lady thief, Not like a sister, so on and so on. Have it for that people recommend them but then there always up, that way if someone has a new recommendation it can be added to the list. Rather than that question being asked what's a good Harry/Hermione once a week and the same 10 answers.
