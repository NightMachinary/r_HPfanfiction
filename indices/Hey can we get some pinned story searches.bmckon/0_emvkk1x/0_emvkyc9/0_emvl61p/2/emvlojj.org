Thanks for even listening, it means a lot. I just threw up harmony since it's a big one. I'm actually Harry/Susan fan. Tried daphne and not badðŸ˜† but generally not my taste. The other might be is to have a wiki page like the Harmony Reddit were once a month there could be a list made of a significant trope picked and everyone starts building a permanent, this is quality list? And then knew stories could be brought up more... since well fanfiction.net has what 800000 thousand now. There's got to be some we might be not getting the good attention
