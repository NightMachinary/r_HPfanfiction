That idea is from a heavily reposted social media pic where someone comes up with it. Glad to see it used in a fic, though, I always liked it. You want to look for fics that claim to subvert tropes, maybe someone here can rec some good ones, all that springs to my mind at the moment is the Prince of Slytherin fic.
