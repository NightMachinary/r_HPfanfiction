It's somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, and generally quite different from most stories, but linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) has large-scale combat between wizards and [[/spoiler][more technologically advanced muggles]] as well as some inter-wizard fighting, iirc. There's also a fair amount of literal as well as metaphorical worldbuilding.
