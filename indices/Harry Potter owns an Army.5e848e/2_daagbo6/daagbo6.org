Hmm...it's not Harry Potter, and the first few chapters of setup probably wouldn't be to your liking (they aren't to mine), but perhaps you'd be interested in Dungeon Keeper Ami?

Dungeon Keeper Ami is a crossover between Dungeon Keeper & Sailor Moon, though it does enough worldbuilding that you don't need to be familiar with either series.

Besides the basic plot of 'Ami Mizuno accidentally becomes a Dungeon Keeper and has to try and find a way back to her own world while battling both Light and Dark', there's a lot of fluff about resource management, invention, and unconventional battle tactics.
