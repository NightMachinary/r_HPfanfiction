+FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF! The test broke on me on the last webpage.+

For a test that doesn't let you ignore some questions (giving it 0 score), it had too many that were either seemingly irrelevant in regards to HP House assignment (5; 21; 23; 24; 31; 55; 69 - WTF; 105) or simply poorly worded (e.g. #82 --- “hate” is a strong word). In the latter group there was also a large subcategory of questions that could've belonged to a fortune-teller's repertoire --- that is, they were too vague and would be true for pretty much anybody\no-one (12; 50; 70 --- yes, I'm not a spoon, hooray; 74; 91; 109)

Generally, it felt like they took the personality types discussed in their introductory psychology class and tried associating them with Hogwarts House descriptions, also sprinkling some headcanon into the mix.
