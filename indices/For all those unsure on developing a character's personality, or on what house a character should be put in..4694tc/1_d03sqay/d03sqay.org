I personally got 52% on all of them bar Slytherin, which was 50%. It gave me some generic traits to give Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs in my characterizations, as there was little fleshing out of characters in the books; it was more about the world and story. This quiz is more thorough and less straightforward than Pottermore's, and allows you to think "how does this apply to this character?" It transformed one character in particular from an uncharacterized mess to someone with a personality.
