There is a fic in which Voldemort and Harry both use Fidelius charms a lot. Indeed, Voldemort hides the secret "The monster of Slytherin is a basilisk"

However, Harry finds some usable workaround for them. For example, he figures out that the stone is hidden by a distance triggered Fidelius and avoids this by recording instructions for himself and training himself to follow his own instructions without asking why.

Can anyone help find the fic?
