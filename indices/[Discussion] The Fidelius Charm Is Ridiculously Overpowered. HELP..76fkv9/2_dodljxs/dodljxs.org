I wonder if the Fidelius weakens the more people know the secret. So if you have a population of thousands or millions all knowing the same secret, it just may not work. Theres also the fact that those who know the secret become the Secret-Keepers if the previous Secret-Keeper dies. What stops all of them from disseminating the secret of magic?

I also don't think it's any more OP than properly cast invisibility charms for hiding a person. It just covers more aspects (sight, sound, smell, etc) of a person than the individual charms. Plus it only works if you don't leave the charm. If Voldy had put a tracking charm on James when he went out for groceries, for instance, he might have found him that way. We already know that bringing someone past the boundaries if the charm lets them know the secret, after all.

I think it's stated in the books that Voldy can't use the Fidelius because he wouldn't trust anyone enough for that.

This brings me to why I don't think the Fidelius could protect a lie. The Fidelius is based on total and complete trust, and a lie is by definition a breach of trust. It just wouldn't work.
