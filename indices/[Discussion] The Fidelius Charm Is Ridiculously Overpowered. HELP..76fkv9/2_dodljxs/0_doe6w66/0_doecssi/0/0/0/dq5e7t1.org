  Magic distinguishes between squibs and Muggles, despite the fact that squibs and Muggles are magically identical (both have absolutely no magic). The only difference between them is how they are perceived in society. Yet squibs can see Hogwarts whereas Muggles cannot.

Squibs being able to do anything magical (even potions) being pure fanon, I always assumed that was simply Squibs being given some sort of charm that protects them from Muggle-Repelling Charms, as opposed to a natural effect of such spells.
