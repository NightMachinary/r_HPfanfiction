Magic distinguishes between squibs and Muggles, despite the fact that squibs and Muggles are magically identical (both have absolutely no magic). The only difference between them is how they are perceived in society. Yet squibs can see Hogwarts whereas Muggles cannot.

Magic can identify a job position as the target of a curse.

The rules of transfiguration observe the human concept of food.

The idea that magic can recognise these things but cannot recognise property rights would surely be quite silly. It is surely a result of a misplaced physicalist approach to magic.

It becomes even more absurd in the context of the fidelius Charm, where the essence of the spell itself relates to the magical manipulation of human-known information.
