You can be sure, but there actually isn't a precedent for that. Sure, Dumbledore spends a lot of time at 12 Grimmauld Place, but the place is Sirius's. Likewise, Bill may spend a lot of place at the Burrow, but the place is Arthur and Molly's. Sirius is letting Albus use the place for the order but he himself is living there, and Bill is Arhur and Molly's son so of course he is free to spend time there even if the house definitely isn't his in any way.

You complain about the charm being overpowered, and yet you discard very plausible and quite likely to be true limitations to it basically at the drop of a hat. There is something wrong with that, very wrong.
