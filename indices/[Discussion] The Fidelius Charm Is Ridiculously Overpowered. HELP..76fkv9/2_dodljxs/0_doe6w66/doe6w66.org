  I think it's stated in the books that Voldy can't use the Fidelius because he wouldn't trust anyone enough for that.

Er, I'm pretty sure you can essentially be your own Secret Keeper. Dumbledore spent liberal amounts of time in Grimmauld Place while being Secret Keeper for the secret "The Order of the Phoenix's Headquarters are in Grimmauld Place", and Bill Weasley later Secret-Kept for "The Burrow exists" while living in the Burrow.
