Again, the Vow seems to me to show a lack of trust. The whole point it the charm is that you show trust in another person rather than coercing the Secret to be kept. If the person you entrust a secret to is someone who does bot have the ability to betray it, thats not a lot of trust, is it? I mean, I can tell my cats any manner of thing and they'll never tell a soul because they cannot. I don't trust them not to talk; I know they're unable. However, if I tell my best friend a secret, I trust him not to tell anyone else.

As for Voldy casting only on the location, when I say he doesn't trust his Death Eater, I mean he literally does not have enough trust in them to cast the charm to hide anything, no matter the secret. As in, I fully believe the spell would not cast correctly or at all.
