The way Unbreakable Vows work in canon, though, they don't render you /unable/ to break them in the way the Fidelius /prevents/ you from telling unless you're the Secret Keeper; it just kills you once you've broken the vow. Technically, it'd still be within the free will of a Vow-bound Secret Keeper to betray the Secret --- it just would have dire consequences. My idle reasoning here is that functionally, the Vow-enabled death would not be all that different from any other consequence that might naturally befall a betraying Secret Keeper --- Peter had to have known Sirius would try to kill him if he betrayed the Potters, for instance.
