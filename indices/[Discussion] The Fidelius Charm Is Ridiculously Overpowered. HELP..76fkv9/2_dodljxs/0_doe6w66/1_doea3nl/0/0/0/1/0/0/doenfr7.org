Reasonably sure, yes. Deathly Hallows states the secret of their cottage died with them, implying one of them was the caster. In addition, Sirius says he persuaded the Potters to use Peter at the last minute. If he'd cast the spell, using Peter as Secret-Keeper, I think his guilt and need for vengeance would've been much greater. Plus he likely would've mentioned it.

We know it's not Dumbledore. For all his faults I don't think he would've let Sirius go to prison with everyone thinking he betrayed the Potters (whether or not Sirius would've gone down for the murder of a dozen muggles is another matter entirely), and he definitely would not have allowed Peter to be granted the Order of Merlin. Likewise, we know it could not have been Lupin because Prisoner of Azkaban says that Lupin suspected Sirius. He wouldve known it wasn't Sirius if he'd cast the Charm, and that's assuming the Charm didn't fail due to him suspecting Sirius beforehand. The only ones left are Peter, Sirius, and the Potters. We can eliminate Peter under the assumption that the Secret-Keeper and the caster must be different people, and Sirius is unlikely for the reasons listed above. Logically, the Potters are the only ones who could be the casters.
