  Deathly Hallows states the secret of their cottage died with them, implying one of them was the caster. In addition, Sirius says he persuaded the Potters to use Peter at the last minute.

Well, the secret /was/ some variation of "The Potters are hiding in Godric's Hollow", so one could argue the Fidelius would have broken because part of its target secret was now missing --- there /were/ no longer any Potters to be hiding in Godric's Hollow. All this being said, your other argument quoted above /do/ convince me. (On the other hand, I don't see how Sirius's guilt and need for vengeance could possibly have been greater than they were in canon. They already seemed pretty through the roof.)
