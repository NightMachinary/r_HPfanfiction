But the Unbreakable Vow, the one time we've seen it used in canon, was used because there was no trust. If it's use is a sign of deep distrust, that is diametrically opposed to the trust I think would be required for the Fidelius. In that case, either the Charm should fail on casting or making the Vow should cause the Charm to fail.

The difference between the Vow and what happened with Peter is simple: the Potters had absolute trust in both Peter and Sirius. It wasn't until after they were betrayed that anyone suspected there was a mole in the Marauders. Peter chose to betray the trust put in him, but no one threatened him if he betrayed that trust. Sirius chose to go after him partly as vengeance and partly to assuage his own guilt. And even if Sirius had threatened Peter, he wasn't the caster. His trust or lack thereof is immaterial for the working of the Fidelius.
