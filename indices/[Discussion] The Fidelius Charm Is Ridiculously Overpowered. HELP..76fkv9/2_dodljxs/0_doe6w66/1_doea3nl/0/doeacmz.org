Hmm... couldn't he place a Fidelius over the hideout without revealing the Horcrux's existence, though? Also, how would an Unbreakable Vow interact with all of this? If Voldemort and the putative Secret Keeper took mutual vow not to kill the other for the Secret's sake (in Voldemort's sake) and never to divulge the secret or act on it (in the Secret Keeper's case), wouldn't this magic-enforced binding vow provide "complete trust", after a fashion?
