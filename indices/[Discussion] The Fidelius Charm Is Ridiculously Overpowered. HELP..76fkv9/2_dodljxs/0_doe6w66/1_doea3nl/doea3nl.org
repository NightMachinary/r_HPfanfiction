Right, but you still need someone else to cast the charm. You cannot cast the charm and divest the secret on yourself, so Voldy would again need to trust someone else. We can assume he would never trust anyone to cast the charm correctly. We can also assume that if Voldy did divest the secret in someone else, he would kill them shortly after to leave himself the sole Secret-Keeper. This would fail for 2 reasons, I think. First, Voldy's intention to kill his Secret-Keeper would be a lack of trust and interfere with the casting. Second, even if cast correctly, I would think the person hiding the secret killing their Secret-Keeper would again show a complete lack of trust and would break the charm.

And if it is indeed possible for the Secret-Keeper to also be the caster, then it's just another instance of Rowling not thinking out her own story and world. Which there's way too many instances of to begin with.
