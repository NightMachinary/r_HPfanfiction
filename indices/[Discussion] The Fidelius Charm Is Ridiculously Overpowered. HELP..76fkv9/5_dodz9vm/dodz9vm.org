Easy. Simply assume that magic isn't simply spell = effect, and that esoteric magics exist, and that the Fidelius is a part of it.

Trying to "balance" the Fidelius like you would a spell in a videogame isn't going to work, and it will also harm the atmosphere of your story.

Let's assume you can only use it on locations, not concepts, as this is how its used in Canon. Let's also assume that the Secret Keeper can't live in the location, since that makes sense with Canon.

How do you definie "live"? This is where the esoterism comes in. Magic isn't a coding language, so there is no real answer. Magic just knows, it either works or it doesn't, and you can't fool it. Even if the secret keeper is kept in a dungeon and obliviated into a blubbering mess that doesn't even recognize the concept of "living somewhere", "Magic" would still recognize this as an attempt to "cheat" the concept, and thus not work.

You don't need to explain that, since the only people that can use the Fidelius, great wizards with significant and deep understanding of magic, already knows you can't trick magic.

And there's your last piece of "nerfing" this overpowered spell: in Canon we only saw Dumbledore use it, I'm pretty sure. Fanfiction writers make it seem like common knowledge, but we only know because our main characters are so involved with Dumbledore. It could be reasonable to assume that very few know about esoteric magics like this, and even fewer can cast it. If only Dumbledore and Voldemort are at this time capable of casting it in Britain, and Voldemort would never trust a Secret Keeper, which is necessary, your "overpowered" solution is already solved.

Why didn't Dumbledore cast it for more Order members? That's really up to what your individual story needs, but we can safely assume it's hard to cast, and/or requires significant upkeep. The best way to "balance" the stronger HP magics is just to assume that you cant just wave your wand and say "Fidelius Maxima" to hide a house. If it requires significant setup, and perhaps some sort of upkeep from the caster, your problem is solved.

- The process to cast the spell, be it meditation or a ritual or a significant chant, whatever fits your story, is cumbersome.

- The process may require expensive or rare components.

- The knowledge to cast the magic is hidden and known only by a few.

- The magic is very hard to cast, and only masterful wizards can succeed.

- Failure to cast the magic properly has significant downsides.

- The caster, and those living in the hidden location, must deeply trust the Secret Keeper.

- The Secret Keeper can not reside in the hidden location for any significant amount of time, nor consider it their home.

- The magic requires constant upkeep, either of resources or components or as a drain on the caster. If your story has magical cores (please no), a constant drain on that would make sure the spell is only used when absolutely necessary. If you want to stay more true to HP, the magic could constantly buzz in the back of the casters mind, forcing them to always keep the secret somewhat in mind, and thus preventing them from using it too many times.

Pick whichever you like of these, and you have your solution for your story. If you use all of them, the only Canon character that would even be able to set up a Fidelius would be Dumbledore, and he would be limited to a small amount of hidden locations.
