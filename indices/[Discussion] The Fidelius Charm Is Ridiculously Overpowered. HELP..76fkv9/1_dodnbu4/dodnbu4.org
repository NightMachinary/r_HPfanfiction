Ok, so let's start off with the big assumption: Is it canon that the Fidelius can hide anything other than a set location? All canon examples given seem to suggest that, no, the Fidelius cannot be used for conceptual ideas. It can only be used to hide a location. In this way it's basically an extremely powerful Unplottable charm.

But let's assume that the Fidelius CAN hide concepts. First thing's first, the difficulty. One would assume that the more people who knew a secret, the harder it would be to cast, as you stated. But you also need to account for the effects of the spell itself, and how hard it has to try to keep the Secret kept. You can't assume that the spell CAN NOT be broken. It's a spell, and like all spells it can be blocked or countered. In this vein are the effects of the spell itself; It's incredibly easy for a brain to just skip over the fact that there is no #12 Grimmauld Place, especially when looking at the houses as you pass by. It's a very easy thing to miss. But when it is made very, VERY obvious that there is no #12, then the Secret is put under stress. The cognitive dissonance that the brain would go through in trying to comprehend the Secret would be a great amount, especially if the Secret was being shoved in your face. To do this to a single person would probably cause insanity, assuming the Fidelius was strong enough to hold.

THIS, however, would put massive, MASSIVE strain on the spell, assuming that the requirements of a spell encompassing the entire world were actually feasible, which it probably isn't. People WILL understand that something is happening. MANY people will understand that. If enough people were to understand that there is SOMETHING happening, even if they don't know exactly what, then the spell would break. Or, tons of people would go insane. Either way there are problems.

There's also the thought that the Fidelius is an extremely high level charm and cannot be used at the slightest whim. Maybe it needs a very concrete foundation on which to build the secret, and a simple thought isn't enough to anchor the spell. Maybe the magic of the horcruxes would interfere with the magic of the Fidelius. Maybe any secret concerning a specific individual - say, Voldemort - needs that individual's exacting permission.

The Fidelius isn't OP, you're just not allowing for any weaknesses.
