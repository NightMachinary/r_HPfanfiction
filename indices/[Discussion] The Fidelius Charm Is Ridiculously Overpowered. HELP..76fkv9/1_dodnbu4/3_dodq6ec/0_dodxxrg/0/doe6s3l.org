I may just be assuming that because Dumbledore was the one who told them/helped them to go into hiding.

My thought process was that while Dumbledore could be the one to cast the charm for the Potter's he wouldn't necessarily know who the secret keeper was, allowing James and Lily to change from Sirius to Peter as their secret keeper without anyone else knowing. Now that I think about it it's more likely Lily or James cast the charm and chose who the secret keeper was. However we don't actually know for certain how the charm works. It might possibly require three people to uphold (like with an unbreakable vow); more risk for betrayal pays back as a more powerful fidelius. But again that is all conjecture.
