We do not know what's the exact casting process of the charm, just that there's a caster and a secret owner and a secret keeper and the last two cannot be the same person. It may be possible that only the secret owner and the caster, if it's not the same person, need to be present, and that the secret keeper gets their secret keeper powers automatically regardless of where they are when the secret owner chooses to trust them with it.
