I wonder how it determines what counts as a third party. Does someone like Dobby or another non-wizard count? Is having magical ability a requirement, or at least be magical in nature?

And about the other requirements for the charm. What happens when the secret keeper is obliviated? Is that even possible? Can a secret keeper be forbidden from being able to tell the secret?

Perhaps most importantly, is a Horcrux a possible secret keeper for Voldemort? It is clear that at least the Diary Horcrux and Voldemort himself were very distinct, the madness afflicting the actual Voldemort not quite there in the Horcrux. It makes me wonder what mechanisms the Fidelius charm has for determining a third party, since if it looks at souls, and the sliver of Voldemort's soul in Harry were to fuse, would it be possible that Harry could not be Voldemort's secret keeper?
