But Dumbledore was the secret keeper the second time. The secret for 12 Grimmauld Place was given to Harry via a note written in Dumbledore's handwriting. That means either 1. someone else cast the fidelius on Grimmauld Place, or 2. the person who cast the fidelius can also act as secret keeper. Also, I'm fairly certain its mentioned in canon that Dumbledore offered to act as secret keeper for the Potters, but they declined.

I don't think the implied limit is on the fidelius caster, but rather on the person whose secret is being kept. The house in Godric's Hollow belonged to the Potters, so they couldn't keep their own secret. Likewise, Grimmauld Place belonged to Sirius, so he couldn't keep the secret.

Edit: Plus its a whole plot point in the last book that Dumbledore's death caused them all to become secret keepers. Dumbledore was definitely Grimmauld Place's secret keeper, and presumable also cast the charm.
