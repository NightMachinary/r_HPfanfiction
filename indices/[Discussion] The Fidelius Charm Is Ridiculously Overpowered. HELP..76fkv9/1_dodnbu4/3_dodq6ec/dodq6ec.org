carrying on from your point, and I'm not sure this is a headcanon or something I construed from canon, but the secret keeper cannot be the same as the person who cast the charm. The charm is given more power by putting trust into a third party, but obviously that can backfire (see: canon events). It also seems to be a very difficult and near unknown spell - both times in canon we see it used Dumbledore has been the one to cast it (and we all know how Dumbledore is).
