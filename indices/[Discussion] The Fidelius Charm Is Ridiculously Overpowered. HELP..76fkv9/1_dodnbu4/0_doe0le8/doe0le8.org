As far as your #12 example, I don't think that's really a breakable secret. If I walked down my own street and didn't find a #12, I'd probably think someone fucked up the numbers and not think about it again. The alternative explanation is so simple to accept rather than "there's a house there that no-one can see".

Otherwise I agree with your idea that if knowledge of the secret is shoved in someone's face, it would either break the secret or they'd become aware that something was very wrong when they weren't able to focus on a specific thought, which would lead to them coming up with a round about explanation of the secret.
