I wonder...

I've always kind of assumed that, unless you were the secret keeper, you couldn't do anything which would endanger the secret (IE: Tell someone the location of the House of the Potters).

Wouldn't that, in turn, prevent people from casting magic in front of those who weren't already aware of it?

What does this mean for muggleborns? Would parents be unable to comprehend the magic being performed, or would the child not be able to cast magic at all?

It stands to reason that you couldn't just SHOUT the address of a location and break the secret without being the secret keeper.

If it's really just a "strain" and trying to hide an obvious secret could cause those being imposed upon mental damage, could you kill Voldemort by shouting "THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX IS LOCATED AT 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE!", while not being the secret keeper, in his face?
