That's just a quirk of expression. If you read the secret of Grimmauld place in OotP, that was also expressed conceptually (the Headquarters of OotP is at...), but hides the location.

This is an area where the movies unfortunately confused a lot of people. In the books, the Fidelius does not take a location "out of space". It merely takes it out of perception. So Voldemort can be touching Godric's Hollow or Grimmauld Place but not perceive them.
