I like the idea that

1) It's a ward, and thus works only on locations.

2) It requires highly advanced occurrence to cast, because while casting it one has to have the entire location in all of its detail, completely, in one's head.

In my head this is the "Stealing witches and Dodging Prison" interpretation. I also really like its incantation of "Fidelius Occultum".
