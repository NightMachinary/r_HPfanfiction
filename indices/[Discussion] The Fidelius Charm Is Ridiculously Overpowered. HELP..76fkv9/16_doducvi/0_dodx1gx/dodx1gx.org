Personal theory: the most powerful magics seem to require emotion to drive them. The fidelius could require absolute trust or the casting would fail. Any attempts to verify or force that trust in the secret keeper would cause the spell to fail. This would also explain why Voldemort never used it -- he doesn't trust anyone to the degree needed to cast the spell.
