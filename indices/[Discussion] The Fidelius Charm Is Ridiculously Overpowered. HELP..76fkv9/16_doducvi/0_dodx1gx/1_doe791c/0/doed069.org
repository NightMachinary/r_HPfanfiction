There is no precedent for anyone hiding anything with the spell without having someone else to give the secret to. So that's the answer, using yourself as a secret keeper is not canon and at most hypothetical, and doesn't make much sense, and it's one of the worst possible things to do if your problem is that the charm seems overpowered to you.
