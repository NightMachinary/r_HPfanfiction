That /would/ make sense, but it's just plain not how it works in the books. The house in Godric's Hollow wasn't "concealed" --- it was right there in plain sight; it works rather like what fanon imagines the Notice-Me-Not Charm to work. Re Rowling's statement that Voldemort could have stared long and hard through the window of the Potters' house and just not processed the information that they were /right there/. The /OotP/ movie muddled it all up by making it seem as though Grimmauld Place was physically concealed, but that's not how it actually works, just another example of that movie's chronic inability to get the magic right (like how Apparation was now more like flying while partially turning to smoke, and Death Eaters' smoke being black as opposed to the Order's white).
