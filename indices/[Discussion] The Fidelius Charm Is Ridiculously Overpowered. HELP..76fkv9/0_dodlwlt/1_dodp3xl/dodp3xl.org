I don't think it's ever stated that the fidelius works /only/ on tangibles items, but we have proof that magic does work on concepts or people, like the Voldemort Taboo.

EDIT: Now that I remember, wasn't it said in the 3rd book that it wasn't the /House/ of the Potters that was hidden, but the fact that they were living there?

"An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, *not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"*

That line tells me that it's not the house what was hidden, but the people in it.
