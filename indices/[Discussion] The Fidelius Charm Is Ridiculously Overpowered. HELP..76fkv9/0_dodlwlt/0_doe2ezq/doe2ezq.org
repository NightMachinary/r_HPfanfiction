Yes, in canon we've only ever seen it work on locations.

An alternative (but related) proposal [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lf86j/closing_plot_holes_the_fidelius_charm/][I've put forward]] is that it can only work on secrets you /own/. You can't hide knowledge which is in the public sphere, only your own secrets. There is some basis for this in canon: Flitwick describes the secret as being moved from your soul to another person's soul. So it has to be in your soul in the first place in order to use the fidelius. That implies some kind of ownership of the secret.

That in turn forces one to allow magic to recognise property rights of some kind or another, but that's not a big problem. Magic already recognises all kinds of social constructs.
