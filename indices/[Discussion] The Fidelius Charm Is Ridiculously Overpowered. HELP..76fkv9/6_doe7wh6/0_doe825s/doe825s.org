  you can't conceal a concept like 'magic is real' because it's not really a secret per se

Well, it /is/ called the Statute of /Secrecy/. But I get your point.

  This is based on when the trio brought yaxley to HQ after the ministry heist... They only showed him the location by bringing him there by apparition. There was never any thing about them telling him it was HQ. So the secret had to be tied to the location

I feel like this actually validates /my/ interpretations. You could get in and out of Grimmauld Place --- as Yaxley did --- just not /comprehend/ it was the HQ of the Order of the Phoenix.
