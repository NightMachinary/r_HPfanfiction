I think there one key thing here. The main thing is that whatever you are trying to conceal had to be a SECRET. I think this is a more platonic concept of secret rather than any specific requirements on what a 'secret' is.

What I mean is this: you can't conceal a concept like 'magic is real' because it's not really a secret per say. Sure most muggles don't know, but it's well known about a fairly large community that it can't really be considered a secret. However it doesn't have to be a secret that no one or really few people know either. Look at Grimmauld place. It was the ancestral home of the Blacks. How many people do you think knew that? Bellatrix and Narcissa and Andromeda certainly... Probably Lucius and Rodolphus as well. And what about all the other purebloods who came to visit? No what was secret was the order having their HQ there. But this leads me into my second point...

It likely does have to be a location... This is based on when the trio brought yaxley to HQ after the ministry heist... They only showed him the location by bringing him there by apparition. There was never any thing about them telling him it was HQ. So the secret had to be tied to the location

I dunno maybe this is just one of those things that Rowling wasn't consistent on
