Even if it could apply to concepts, I don't think your examples would work. By having wizards casting magic in front of Muggles, they are revealing the secret. The Fidelius charm keeps the secret from being told by non-secret keepers, not the secret from being known. So wizards wouldn't be able to, in the same way a non-secret keeper would be unable to name a location protected by the Fidelius charm.
