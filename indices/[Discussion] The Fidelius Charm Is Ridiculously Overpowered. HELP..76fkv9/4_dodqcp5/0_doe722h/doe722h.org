Flitwick's canon description of the charm:

#+begin_quote
  An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!

Flitwick says nothing of the secret having to be a location. He clearly says "secret" and "information".

As for me using the word "OP"... the phrase is pretty well-accepted on this sub, I think.
