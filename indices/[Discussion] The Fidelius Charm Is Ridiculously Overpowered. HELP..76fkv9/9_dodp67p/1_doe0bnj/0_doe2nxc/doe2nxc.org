It's not an important difference, it's the way the spell is always expressed.

The Godric's Hollow Charm hid the fact that the Potters were at Godric's Hollow.

The Grimmauld Place Charm hid the fact that the headquarters of the Order was at Grimmauld Place.

The fact that the secret is expressed as hiding a fact does not prevent it from hiding the location.

The confusion that there is some kind of difference in function between the Grimmauld Place Charm and the Godric Hollow Charm is created by the movies, not the books. In the movies the Fidelius Charm moves a location out of space. In the books it moves it out of perception.

So in the books you can touch a location hidden by the fidelius but not perceive that you are doing so. Voldemort could be touching Godric's Hollow, or Grimmauld Place, but not realise they were there.

In the movies you can't touch the location at all.
