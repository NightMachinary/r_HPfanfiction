I know everyone keeps bringing up the passage about the Potter's, but I'm thinking about how Shell Cottage and Grimauld Place actually worked. You couldn't find them unless someone told you where they were. With that in mind, I usually interpret that phrase about "looking in the Potter's window" and not even knowing they were there to mean you wouldn't even know the house was there. You wouldn't know that you were looking in any window cause you'd be unaware of the house. If they left the house, they're visible, so it's the house that's hidden. Just like with Shell Cottage and Grimauld Place.
