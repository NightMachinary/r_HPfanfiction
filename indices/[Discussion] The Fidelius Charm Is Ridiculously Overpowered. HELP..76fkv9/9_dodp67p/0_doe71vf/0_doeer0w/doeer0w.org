That's true, but every single described use of it after that is clearly hiding a location. It makes more sense to me that he was exaggerating, or that he meant to say "secret /location/ since it's never shown to be used any other way.

Edited to add: Even when he goes back to his parents house, it says "He could see it; the Fidelius charm must have died with James and Lily." As in, the Fidelius charm would have kept him from seeing their house. No matter how Flitwick explained it, every single canon described instance of it's use is to hide a location.
