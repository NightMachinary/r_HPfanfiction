Again, it is not his duty to info-dump.

Even if what he says is correct, automatically assuming that that's all there is to the charm and there is nothing more to it is just stupid, and if that is how you are going to approach this then your attempt to deal with the Fidelius being overpowered is doomed to fail because you will not allow anyone else to tell you that it has any limitations.

Either start thinking about it from the point of what limitations are supported by canon, or come to peace with the fact that you won't get anything from what is happening here.
