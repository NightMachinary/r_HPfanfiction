i think it already exists after all, people go out of their way to make up explanations for HP Magic. I think ithat it just doesnt work once people have 1st hand witnessed magic and that's what the obliviators are for. plus imagine this: wizarding children would then be born with magic but unable to comprehend that it exists because they werent given the Secret. they cant be told the secret until they'vre developed some, but by that point, their magic could be damaged, so no one risks the fidelius As a side note, anything that happened outside the 7 books, doesnt count as HP canon.
