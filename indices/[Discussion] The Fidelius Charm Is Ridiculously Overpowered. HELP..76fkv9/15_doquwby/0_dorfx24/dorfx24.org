  As a side note, anything that happened outside the 7 books, doesnt count as HP canon. FBaWtFT is AU to HP

Ummm, no. Officially, canon is whatever the creator says is canon. Rowling did say Pottermore, /Fantastic Beasts/ and /Cursed Child/ are canon. It's your right to invoke the "death of the author" principle and say /you/ won't consider them canon, but the true, official canon does include them.
