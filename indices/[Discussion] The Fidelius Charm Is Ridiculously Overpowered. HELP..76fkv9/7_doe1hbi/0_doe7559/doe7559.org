Thoughtftul post (though in other answers here I quoted the canon description of the charm which clearly talks about "information", not necessarily locations), but just one thing...

  Voldemort would almost certainly not be able to cast it as he would have to trust someone. If James could have just put himself as the secret keeper and just stayed there always im sure he could have. I could imagine him trusting a single person on something small, but on his horcruxes? No way.

...that's precisely a gigantic plothole. Arthur Weasley could be the Secret Keeper for the Burrow, Dumbledore stayed liberal amounts of time in Grimmauld Place while being its Scret Keeper. /WHY/ didn't James and Lily make themselves the Secret Keeper? (Also, I think Voldemort /might/ have trusted Nagini. She does already know the existence of the Horcruxes, doesn't she? But that raises the question of whether non-wizards can be Secret Keepers.)
