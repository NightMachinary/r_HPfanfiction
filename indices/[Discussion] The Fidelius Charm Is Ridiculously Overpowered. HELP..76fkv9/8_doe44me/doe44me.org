In my head-canon, the amount of power it requires is proportional to the number of people who knows whatever you want to make secret. So if you try to put "Lumos" under a Fidelius, you'd fail and land yourself in a coma.

So it makes it esentially useless for anything but secret hideouts and personal stuff, and it seems like you have to be at least two about it, which might explain why Voldemort never used it.
