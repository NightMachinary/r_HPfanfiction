Some of these I have read, some of them I haven't, but this is everything I've got in my new 'HP Lovecraft' bookmark folder for researching a fic I'm planning to write. Some of them I've read, some of them I haven't, but they're all fics and snippets I've gotten from threads here that people describe as Lovecraftian or Eldritch.

Some of the comments on this thread tell interesting Lovecraftian Snippets - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dero7u/privet_drive_is_an_eldritch_location_that_turns/]]

A lot of the comments on this are amusing-Lovecraftian - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f50myv/katie_the_cultist/]]
