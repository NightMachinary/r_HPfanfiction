Just dotted about mainly.

There is a supplementary reference book called "The world of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time". Which has a lot of information about the forsaken and the age of legends that never gets expanded on in the novels.

Worth a read if you can find it. It has spoilers for events that happen up until about book 7.
