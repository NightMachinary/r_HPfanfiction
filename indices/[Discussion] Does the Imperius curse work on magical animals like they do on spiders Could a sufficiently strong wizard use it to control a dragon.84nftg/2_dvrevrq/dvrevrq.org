One of my Dystopian ideas is for an underground pit fighting league where the wizards use the Imperius or even Possession on a magical creature, forced to fight other creatures. Experienced Imperators would work best with the monsters they've cultivated but might swap out to run a recently captured creature that hasn't been seen yet.
