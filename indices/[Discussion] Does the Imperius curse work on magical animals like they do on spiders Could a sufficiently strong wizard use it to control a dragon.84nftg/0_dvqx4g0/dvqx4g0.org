Iirc, it's specifically said that it's "casting an unforgivable on another human" is a life sentence in Azkaban, so that implies that just casting the spells falls into a questionable area, which would likely be case by case. I doubt 'mot would care much if someone used an AK on a vampire, for instance.

Harry using imperious curse on a dragon wouldn't have as much legal repercussions, but there's be fear regardless, because it means Harry can control a dragon, which Other wizards would have a hard time stopping if he's also directing it strategically and such. I doubt that it's an easy task either, or the handlers would just imperio the dragons to get them moved, etc.
