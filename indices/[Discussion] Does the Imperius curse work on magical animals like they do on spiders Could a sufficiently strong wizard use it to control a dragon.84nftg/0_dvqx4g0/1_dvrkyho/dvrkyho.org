  I doubt most would care much if someone used an AK on a vampire, for instance.

Why would that be? While wizards don't /like/ them much (but then, they don't like any nonhumans very much at all), what little we see of them in canon seems to portray Vampires as another nonhuman people of the wizarding world, akin to Centaurs and Goblins. There are treaties in place and stuff. Like killing a Goblin, killing a Vampire (with or without AK) would definitely be prosecuted. Of course, it might nonetheless not end with a life-sentence to Azkaban because of the wording of the law --- "another human": vampires are another species, not human, so the fact they're sapient beings means nothing.
