Drop 'em in the deep end with a Sigur Ros album. Let's see them try to wrap their heads around that.

But, otherwise, give them a real taste of all the period-approriate music their missing out on. New Order/Joy Division, The Smiths, Iggy Pop, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Cure, The Clash, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, Bowie, Massive Attack, etc.

Or better yet, just throw on the soundtrack for Trainspotting. That's pretty much the late 80s and early 90s UK music scene condensed into one record.
