Reactions to hip hop would be interesting. There do appear to be rock sorry, wrock bands, and I'm sure they also have explicit songs, and heavy metal, but I'm not convinced the wizarding world would be acquainted with rap. So that might be a bit of a cultural shock.

As for specific artists...I love to think Alice Cooper actually IS a wizard, or at least a squib, and Muggleborn fans minds would be blown to find out he's popular in that world, too. I'd probably throw Gangnam Style and What does the fox say on and teach them the moves. Mwahahaha. Then again, Uptown Funk and watch me whip probably would be just as peculiar to them

Personally, I'd love to be the first person to Rick Roll Hogwarts.
