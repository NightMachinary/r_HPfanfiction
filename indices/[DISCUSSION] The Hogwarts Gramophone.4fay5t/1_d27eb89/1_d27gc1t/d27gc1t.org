Yeah, definitely. I mean, while wrock obviously has lyrics about dancing like a hippogriff, I'd quite like to see wizards respond to Muggle songs that talk about magic or use it as a metaphor.

But also, I want to see a bunch of Pureblood, twelve-year-old wizards with Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls stuck in their heads.
