I'd go for Queen ;) and maybe for something that criticizes government (the ministry needs reform badly after all and getting people to think is always good and IMHO noble!) oh and something that criticizes SCHOOL (as Hogwarts over all - IMHO - isn't a good school: The Professors aren't great (defense, potions and history are good examples for shoddy teaching IMHO!), the building itself is dangerous, bullying is allowed (or at least tolerated!), the point system is to easy to abuse, the equipment is outdated (astronomy telescopes, school brooms etc.), important things (like economics, maths, politics etc.) aren't taught etc. etc.)
