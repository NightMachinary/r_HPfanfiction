That is assuming wizards use original muggle devices (it's obvious why they would appear in the films of course) or, in their own home-produced versions (wizarding society doesn't exactly favour going for supplies from the muggle side, even if supplies wouldn't have dwindled by now), obey muggle-set standards or the technological limitations of muggle construction.

Which seems rather unlikely.

Thus you can rest assured that a wizarding turntable will turn at any speed it needs to turn, with the flick of a wand.
