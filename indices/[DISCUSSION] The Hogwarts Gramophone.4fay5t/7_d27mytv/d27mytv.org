This is an interesting question, because it addresses something I've been thinking about a lot lately: the fact that the Wizarding World doesn't really have any sort of pop culture (or at least anything near what Muggles have) due to a general lack of mass media. We can argue all day about who would win a normal war, but the fact of the matter is that a culture war between wizards and Muggles would be a Muggle roflstomp. Which is why I really want to read a fic where the Internet is introduced to the Wizarding World--they'd never know what hit them.
