Muggles certainly seem to have the advantage in "high culture", but I'm not sure that they have the advantage in entertainment. There's so much that you can do with magic for entertainment that Muggles have to put in books and TV because it's not possible to actually do... but wizards can.

Just think of how much entertainment value alone you could get out of hanging out with friends and transfiguring each other into animals. That's the kind of experience Muggles can only dream of. And indeed it may also count as "high culture", though wizards probably don't think of it as such. But it's the kind of thing Muggles write about - see, for example, Thomas Nagel's celebrated essay "What is it like to be a bat?"
