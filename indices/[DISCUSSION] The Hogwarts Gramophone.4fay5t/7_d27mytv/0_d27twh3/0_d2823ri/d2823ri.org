Self-transfiguration is supposed to be extremely difficult and dangerous (which is why Animagi are so rare), but I take your point. What I really mean when I say "culture war", though, isn't necessarily entertainment alone. It's Muggles' ability to spread ideas: "memes" in the original sense.

Wizards may have the advantage in almost every other area, but I don't think they really have an equivalent for this, which is why I find it so interesting. It would be really fun to read about a "Muggleization" of Wizard culture via the Internet: it's so useful that even Wizards would want it, but it spreads Muggle ideas to Wizard nations that are usually hyper-isolationist. Even if they have better /entertainment/, that doesn't necessarily mean they'd be immune to that effect.
