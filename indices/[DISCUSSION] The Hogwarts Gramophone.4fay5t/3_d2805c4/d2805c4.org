Early-to-mid nineties? Rave music, Slayer, early Rammstein if there're any Durmstrang kids around (imagine their faces when bueck dich starts playing...) followed by Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, select works of the Red Army choir, La Marseillaise, the Internationale, Eurythmics and, finally, the Sesame Street Song.
