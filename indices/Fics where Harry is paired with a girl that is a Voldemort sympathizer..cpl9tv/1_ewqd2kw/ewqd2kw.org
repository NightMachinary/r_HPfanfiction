Checkout the Downward Spiral Saga. Linkffn(12867536). It has a super dark Harry that's paired with Daphne later on. Not much of a spoiler, but both are on Voldemort's side. The writing in the first few books isn't the greatest, but they get so much better in the third and after. 10/10 for this series. You should definitely give it a try.
