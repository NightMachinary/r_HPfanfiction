Well, !linkffn(Living Dangerously) is another Haphne fic with a blood purist Daphne. The sequel was recently published, actually.

!linkffn(Power is Control)

This one has a female Harry/fem!Voldemort pairing, which actually frames their relationship in an interesting way with respect to the war. Its sequel is almost finished.
