Can you be more specific? There are quite a bit of series with that description.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][Slice of Life One-Shots]] from FloreatCastellum is one, although the one on her tumblr is more complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075][mischiefmanaged!verse]] from irnan.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/441613][Fresh Pickled Toad]] from gryffindormischief. This is the one that has 80+ stories, so maybe you're looking for this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] also had a series like this, but it's on FFn.

and of course the one by Northumbrian
