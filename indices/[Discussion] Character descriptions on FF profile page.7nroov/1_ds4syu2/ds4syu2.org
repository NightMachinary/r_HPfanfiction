Re.1: Not really, I say. One could argue that when arguing hypothetical situations the knowledge of a character's personality and motivations is useful, but you generally don't think about hypothetical situations when talking about characters in derivative stories. Outside of that it is useful for any writer to keep notes on their characters, but you very much don't need to place them on a profile page (in fact, if you do and that---keeping notes---is the reason then that's kind of a fail). The only other reason is if the character does not make sense in the context of the story, in which case the solution is not giving the readers a character description but rather fixing your own writing so that you don't have to do this. It's a bit different if the character is a genuine original character, in which case it may be posted to satisfy the readers' curiosity without info-dumping in the story about stuff that probably doesn't matter, but people /very rarely/ do it about original characters.

Re.2: “Anyone”, no doubt about it. Probably not too many people, though, and I've never done it, usually only seeing whatever the author had on their profile page once I either got through one story and wanted to check their other ones or decided to stop reading for the sake of my own sanity and checked what kind of lunatic would write whatever it is that I couldn't get through.

Re.3: As trite as it may sound, my answer to this is “meh”. For me, what matters is that the characters are internally consistent and that the changes to them compared to how they are in canon make sense in the context of the story and its backstory (there's some leniency for comedy stories there). As such, if those requirements are fulfilled then I do not need to read about the author's interpretation because that will be clear from the story and if they aren't then reading about it on the author's profile page won't help me any.
