I mean, if I like the story, and I head to the author page to check out more of their stuff/their favourite list and stumble upon their character deep dives or whatever, I'll probably take the time to read it, unless it's he standard boring rehash stuff.

But I don't think you should put it there with the expectation that it'll be read by a lot of people. If you need to justify or explain something a character did in the story outside of the actual story, that's probably not great writing.
