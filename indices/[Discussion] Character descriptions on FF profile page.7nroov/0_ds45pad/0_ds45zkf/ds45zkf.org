  If you need to justify or explain something a character did in the story outside of the actual story, that's probably not great writing.

That's what I thought too! I always thought and made a great effort to make sure my characters' actions were well thought out and justified within the story without every having to explain it. But I can see/understand why someone would take it to another level, especially for a character like Sirius Black (maybe not so much for the Golden Trio) where most of the time (when writing in-character/as close to canon as possible) it's based off inferences and theories from what we were given.

But what made me think otherwise is that I've only ever seen the more 'advanced' authors doing this on fanfic.net (actual writers, people who have published 10+ fics with a good amount of reviews/follows/favorites). Ones that have super intense, multi-layered stories, and have taken the time to do full psychological analysis of their characters, which is what led me to ask.

Also, thanks for taking the time to respond!
