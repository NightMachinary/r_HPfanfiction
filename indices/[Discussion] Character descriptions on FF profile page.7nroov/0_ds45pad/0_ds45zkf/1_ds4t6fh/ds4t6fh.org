  But what made me think otherwise is that I've only ever seen the more 'advanced' authors doing this on fanfic.net (actual writers, people who have published 10+ fics with a good amount of reviews/follows/favorites). Ones that have super intense, multi-layered stories, and have taken the time to do full psychological analysis of their characters, which is what led me to ask.

In those cases it may (I do not know, just guessing) be that the characters have gotten diverse enough that they could count as original characters in the skin of canon characters, in which case the character profiles could be there for the sake of indulging the readers' curiosities. It's hard to say because a review/follow/favourite count does not actually matter all that much and there are people with multiple fics who've only ever written rubbish, but at the very least it's a possibility.
