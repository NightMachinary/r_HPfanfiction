In those cases I can understand and get behind them writing stuff out in further detail, mainly because the further detailed stuff on their profile is probably more ‘nice to know' instead of ‘story literally makes no sense if you don't read it'.

Basically it's just that they want to expand further on the character and possibly the world of their fic beyond what may be possible in the scope of the actual story they're writing, so they take the time to go further on their profile.

Not a writer myself, this is just what I've observed.

And yeah as you said, the extra detailed stuff tend to come from people who've written a lot, /because/ they have a sort of canon of their own within the fics they've written, since the characters/world have developed beyond the actual canon story. It's not something that should ever be necessary to a fic, but it can provide a nice addition.
