Yeeeah, you're looking for What Would Slytherin Harry Do. Well, as I recall, he's not exactly average, but he definitely gets by with smarts and cunning.

If you don't mind a bit of crack, I'd recommend checking out nonjon's The DA Missions as well. He's... well, it's crack. It's silly, but the focus is on the audacious missions.
