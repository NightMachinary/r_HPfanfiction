Possibly [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]]. He's very secretive and manipulative (in a good way) in this story, he's near Dumbledore level of secrets and yet still not the smartest and he has a ton of people helping him.

Keeping in mind it's DracoxHarry and very long. It's my favorite though because Harry's not an idiot nor a genius but he is smart and he is very human.
