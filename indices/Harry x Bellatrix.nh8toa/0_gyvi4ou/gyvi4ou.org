I think this might be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13250447/1/Something-to-Live-For][Something to Live For]] by Grey Silver Hawk.

I don't think Harry becomes a teacher, though. It does feature Dorea, daughter of Bellatrix (and grand-daughter of Tom Riddle aka Lord Slytherin) whom Harry saves early on. Bellatrix and Dorea have a tense relationship as you describe.

If it's not what you're looking for, it might be worth a look in. It does some pretty refreshingly original things with its AU setting. Pacing is pretty glacial, which is only made more marked by the fact that all 100k words were posted in two months back in 2019, with not a peep since, suggesting that what we have is all we're gonna get.
