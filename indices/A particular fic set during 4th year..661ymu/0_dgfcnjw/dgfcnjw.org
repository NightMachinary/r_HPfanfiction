I'm pretty sure that what you're looking for is A Different Beginning by Breanie. It's not a particular fic set in 4th year, but a retelling of the whole series as if James survived the attack on the Potters in 1981. It's mostly a canon re-hash, except it starts to diverge a bit somewhere in the middle of the story. It's ultimately H/G.
