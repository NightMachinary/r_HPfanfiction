Hmm, Question 3 is difficutl for me to choose. Does it mean, if i imagined Hermione as Emma right after the Movies came out or if i imagine her today, if i see the Movies or read the Books? (could be a replacement process, meaning: i imagined Hermione differently, but Emmas Appearance slowly "shoved it aside" and now i cant remember my original Vision anymore.
