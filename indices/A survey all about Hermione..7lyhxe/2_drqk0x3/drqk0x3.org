A couple of the survey questions didn't quite have the choices I wanted. Like, for example, there's a pretty wide gap between reading Hermione-centric fanfiction "once or twice a month" and "almost never." And it's in this gap I'm residing... I don't really SEEK OUT Hermione-centric fanfics, but I don't AVOID them either.

I do like Hermione and I tend to prefer it if she is in a story, and a couple of my very favourite fanfics are Hermione-centric, but all in all I'm not hugely invested in her as a character, especially not in fanfics.

My problem with fanfic-Hermione is that she tends to be based on movie-Hermione rather than book-Hermione. Not a bad word about Emma Watson, but she IS rather too pretty and stylish to really fit as Hermione the way I saw her in the books... this wouldn't have been a problem if the scripts hadn't rather botched up her character, but they did. Not AS badly as they botched up Ron's character, but badly enough. She tends to slip into "Super-Hermione" mode, to the point where the movies really should have been named after her and not Harry... and she's become a lot more one-dimensional and less interesting.

I think this is the main reason I've developed a severe dislike for Harry/Hermione fics: The Hermione of those fics is almost never actually in character. Either she sheds her personality entirely to become this super-amazing-fantasy-girlfriend, little more than a cheerleader for Harry who agrees with him on everything and anything... or the author goes on about how well Harry and Hermione "complement one another," turning them BOTH more one-dimensional and less interesting by removing all their flaws (and Harry is ALREADY the least interesting character in the franchise, he NEEDS the few flaws he has to avoid becoming a piece of cardboard), and then turning them into the perfect couple, who are so much in tune with each other and so perfect for each other, and so UTTERLY BORING that I tend to fall asleep after chapter two.

At least Ron/Hermione fics have a greater chance of actually keeping Hermione in character.
