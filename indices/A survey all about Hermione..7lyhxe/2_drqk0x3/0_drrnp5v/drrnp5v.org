Well, IF Hermione turns into a "Super Hero" mode, then its just, because the movies must have a runtime of 90 minutes, not much time for character developing, even if its for 8 Movies. The Runtime and the forced focus of the Directors to keep the 90 minutes is the most important flaw i judge Directors (and Warner Bros.) for, because it ruins the adaption. You, like others, commenting that Ron was made a Relief in the Movies. He had lesser to do and act like in the Movies (just one example: 2nd Movie, the Mudblood thing, RON is the one who explains the whole situation, while its simply hermione in the Movies). The Ridiculous Grawp scene in Movie 5 with Rons "stay away from her" or hermiones "brave" challenging to the Giant was just for the Purpose of showing Hermione/Emma to be a tough person, then the Humor (as near anything in Umbridges Year is) and a Reminder about Ron "Oah, you are still there?" I mean, Grawp wasnt really a important thing in the Books, but they cutted his agressive behavior totally (of course Ron had to be with the Trio to add another Ron/Hermione moment.....Ron jealous about a Giant....seriously?!)
