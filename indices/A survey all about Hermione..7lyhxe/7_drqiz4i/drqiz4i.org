The way I read fanfiction has changed a lot since the books and movies have come out. I started reading FF when the fifth book had just been released and all I read was Hermione and Ron, but I don't anymore for two reasons.

One, the movies butchered both those characters, in my opinion. Now it takes so much time filtering through the crappy fics written by authors that have their movie personalities (ie overpowered and flawless Hermione, drunk loser Ron who's just there for comic relief) that it's just not worth it to me.

The second reason is that the series wasn't finished yet so authors were free to write their own endings and each fic was more unique. Now it's hard to have a new and creative idea and I'm sure great fics are out there, but having to go through all the boring, repetitive ones is exhausting so I just gave up.

TL;DR I hardcore ship Hermione and Ron, but don't read fanfiction about them because for every amazing fic there's 50 crappy ones and I don't want to waste my time looking for the good ones.

Sorry for the long response, I just felt like I couldn't answer the survey well without explaining myself.
