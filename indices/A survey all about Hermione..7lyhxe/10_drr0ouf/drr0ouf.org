So far the results have not really told anything new but did once again confirm that more readers would rather have had Hermione end up with Harry, and as such often seek that pairing out in fics.

Honestly, the only question that I really found fascinating was the almost dead even split between those who picture Hermione as Emma played her and those who don't (at the time of this writing 50.1 to 49.9 %).
