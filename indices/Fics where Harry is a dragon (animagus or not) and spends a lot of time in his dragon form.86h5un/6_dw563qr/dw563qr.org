Esama has a few good dragon Harry stories, assuming you haven't read them already. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3717275][Chapter 15 of Tumbling HP Crossovers]] is a short, but good LOTR crossover where Harry ends up in Middle Earth stuck in his dragon animagus form. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765][Alone Together]], a Temeraire crossover, but I haven't read very far into it because I'm not that familiar with Temeraire. But pretty much everything Esama has wrote is great to me, so that's probably pretty good too.
