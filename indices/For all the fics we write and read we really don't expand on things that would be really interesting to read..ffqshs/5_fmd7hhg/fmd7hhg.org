I don't see a fic on the life of the witch daughter of the American wizarding school founder. It's said that she didn't marry and have any children in an attempt to end the Slytherin line. I'd love to see a fic detailing her inner struggles. How did she come to a decision like that?How did she feel about Salazar and about being a descendant of his?Then how did she feel about her Gaunt mother? Respect for being a remarkable and helpful witch or hate for passing the Slytherin blood down her?
