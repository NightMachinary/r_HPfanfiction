See I actually agree with you. I find it incredibly unhealthy that members of the magical community would rather hide such a big part of themselves from their S.Os rather than just tell them. It just adds to the vicious cycle of "Oh, muggles hate us and are jealous of us because we have magic, so let's lie and keep it from them." It strikes me as very egotistical.
