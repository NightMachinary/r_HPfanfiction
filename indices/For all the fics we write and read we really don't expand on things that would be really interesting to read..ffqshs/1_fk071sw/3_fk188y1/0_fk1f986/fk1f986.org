Look at the first chapter of the Half-Blood Prince, and it's pretty clear they consider themselves separate. Fudge's message there starts "To the Prime Minister /of Muggles/." The whole interaction that the PM remembers from Fudge's first introduction also shows 0 indications of even nominally being part of the same government.

Now, there apparently /is/ a rule that the PM had to be notified when the WW imported dangerous creatures (dragons/sphinxes in book 4), and they meet up irregularly when big events happen, but the PM seems to be consistently referred to formally as 'of (the) Muggles', compared to the 'Minister for Magic'.
