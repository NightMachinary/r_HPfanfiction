I don't think it's inconsistent. Imagine you're studying a civilisation on an untouched island through a telescope. You can see everything they do, but only when they're outdoors, and you can't hear anything they say. So you'd get a pretty good idea of some aspects of their society and material culture, while having no idea about others.

Same applies to wizards and muggles. Stuff like cars, trains, planes, and helicopters, or even rockets and military vehicles, would be well known (and therefore easy to adapt with magic). But they don't know how to use household appliances, or the postal service, or the precise cultural implications of a rubber duck.
