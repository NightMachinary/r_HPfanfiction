To be fair, canon is wildly inconsistent with how in tune wizards are with muggle culture, technology, etc. Arthur Weasley is supposed to be somewhat of an expert -- he turned a car into a flying machine -- but is dangerously incompetent with regards to most muggle technologies (which he calls artifacts). A lot of that is Jo waffling between silly children's humor while trying to tell a serious story with big themes, but it is something. I think there's supposed to be world building elements woven in to explain how out of touch wizards are with muggle society, yet we also get these random tidbits form Malfoy, who should be far more sheltered and close-minded than Arthur, dropping the helicopter line.

As far as everything else OP raises, it mostly comes down to magic: wizards know about planes, but muggles can't see dragon reserves because dragon reserves are protected from muggles by magic. Wizards flying on brooms are hardly a threat to air traffic (which is typically 20,000 ft or higher) and probably wouldn't even register on RADAR (modern drones can broadcast a signal as a required safety feature for certain agencies like the FAA).

I suspect it's nearly impossible for muggles to find out about magic due to some variation of the Fidelius charm. I have a suspicion that it's possible to be told "the secret" of magic by one who knows, since the original secret keeper during the establishment of the Statute is certainly dead by now, but there was a Fidelius raised on the secret of Magic's Existence and this causes magical creatures, areas, etc. to be easily hidden from muggles stumbling upon it without being first told the secret directly by a secret keeper (a magical person). The internet, CCTV, cell phones, etc can not "uncover" evidence of magic because magic itself is protected. Notes in canon kind of spoil this idea, but I'd rather think a limitation of the Fidelius is having direct speech contact. Fidelius is already a powerful can of worms.
