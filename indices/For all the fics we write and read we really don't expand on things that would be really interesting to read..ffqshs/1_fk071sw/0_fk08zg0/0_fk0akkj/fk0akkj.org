  I suspect it's nearly impossible for muggles to find out about magic due to some variation of the Fidelius charm.

I have a theory that is precisely what the Statute of Secrecy actually is. One of the most powerful spells ever created, it was collectively cast by the entire membership of the ICW - each member of whom represented their own country/people, allowing the spell to be backed by the collective will of all wizards and witches.

It would have to have a more subtle mechanism than the Fidelius. Overtime slowly changing the nature of muggle books and manuscripts to remove reference to magic, encouraging muggle minds to ignore unusual experiences, etc.

You would still need Obliviators for the large incidents, but even their job is made easier by the Statute smoothing over the edges of their Memory Charms and discouraging muggles from even thinking about the event. They would also be a necessary part of the spell - if wizarding society as a whole stops making the effort to maintain secrecy then the spell would break.
