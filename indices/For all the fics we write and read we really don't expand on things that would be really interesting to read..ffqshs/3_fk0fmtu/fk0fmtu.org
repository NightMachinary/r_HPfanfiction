There was a fic about that Seamus frase, it was about him trying to hide that his father was abusive, he ends up telling Dean in HPB or DH.

About the Wizarding primary school there has been some fics, some where Teddy goes to some kinda school with all magical children, most of the times is Drarry and Scorpius goes to the same school, but years younger. Other take is the one where parents teach them children to read and write and all of this things. They are usually about Harry being raised by someone like Sirius, who convinces Molly to teach Harry too, and then Ron and Harry becames friends and all of that.

And the one about the separation of muggle and wizard world could be interesting, I have seen some fics with this as a tiny sub plot, but I haven't seen anyone developed the idea to a bigger scheme. It would be nice
