I think a lot of that tends to be within canon-adjacent setups, even though you're somewhat off on the details (the ministry isn't a branch of the British government, wizards do seem aware of the most obvious muggle vehicles - cars, buses, and trains are obvious, and choppers get a line about them - I'd imagine that planes would be likewise impossible to hide). What they don't know - or mostly seem to care about - is /how/ they work. I'd also expect that less visible aspects - like computers and other electronic technology - would be a lot harder for wizards to keep track of, particularly in the 21st century.

However, those types of things to try to figure out - without contradicting canon - is a pretty specific thing. In a lot of cases, when someone is interested enough to look at some of the details that seem weird, it's more to /fix/ canon than to try to keep it intact. There are certainly a lot of people who take both of the approaches - but just that for some, the way the WW has strange/fraying worldbuilding at the edges/details of the world can make it seem like too much trouble to try to not contradict.
