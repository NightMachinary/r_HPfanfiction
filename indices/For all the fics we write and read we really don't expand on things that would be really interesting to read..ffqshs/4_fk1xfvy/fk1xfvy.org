  We read about it in cannon all the time. Little things like...

  Also we know the ministry is a branch of the British government not a self contained government. Does that mean...
#+end_quote

I'mma say yes. Why? Merlin/King Arthur. The Magicals always forget stuff that inconveniences them. And we don't exactly have a lot of evidence from other countries, do we? And anything JKR says right now will reek of Ex Post Facto, and nobody will swallow that very well. Because not only is she infinitely petty, she could also potentially open up even more plotholes.

  Also, is there a wizarding primary or elementary school? Where do they...

This is another plothole. I imagine that they hire tutors, or a mail correspondence course.

  How is the wizarding world so isolated from the muggle world?
#+end_quote

For the British Magical World? Ignorance goes both ways. They don't want to know. They want to stay in their little time bubble where they are in power and determine the rules. When you introduce new stuff, control goes away.

  There are so many little things that need to work together for the wizarding world to be able to be in state that it's in that it just seems impossible to just hand wave it away with 'magic' as an explanation.

I bring this up all the time, but then you have all of the canon stans that will misquote, misuse, or just shout NUH UH at me because I'm clearly wrong AKA don't mesh with their beliefs. Oblivate only works on people. Once something reaches bureaucracy/computers, you can't obliviate that.

Now here's a question of my own: *What happens to all of the Muggleborn once they find out they aren't wanted or won't be appreciated?*

They go back to the muggle side, maybe network with other disenfranchised muggleborn. Develop their own underground society. OR, they join the government. Because they have to know. Molly Weasley alone is a threat onto the Statute of Secrecy herself. Then you have King's Cross. Muggleborn/Halfbloods disappearing for ten months of the year, that don't get any of the *required* schooling, don't pay taxes, no death notices, etc.

​

Or, they go to another country that's less racist.
