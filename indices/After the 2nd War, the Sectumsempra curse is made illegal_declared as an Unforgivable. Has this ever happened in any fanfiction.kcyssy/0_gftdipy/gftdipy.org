It shouldn't be, tbh. The reason the Unforgivables are unforgivable, it that you need to feel them. This doesn't apply for Sectumsempra. I think murder (in any way) also gets you lifetime in Azkaban (unknown, really), so you still don't want to kill someone with it. But just attempting to would just be standard attempted murder.
