No, I am the exact opposite. I love it when characters die, OCs and canon characters alike. It doesn't even have to be for plot reasons. I just have to care and that the death is in someway meaningful. This is the reason I like shows such as GOT and Band of Brothers so much, I don't know who will die.

The only time I have a problem with it is when that character was the only reason I was reading the fic, and if that's the case then it probably wasn't a great fic in the first place.
