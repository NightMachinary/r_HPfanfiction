I stopped reading SDDJ:Auld Lang Syne by AJ Freas (sequel to Same Destination, Different Journey [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8464463/1/Same-Destination-Different-Journey]]) after one of my favourite characters ever died. I know death is a part of life and I'm sure this had a good effect on the story, but I just couldn't continue. I was so shaken by it that I cried for a few hours. The story is absolutely lovely and I do hope I'll finish it some day, but that day is not close yet.
