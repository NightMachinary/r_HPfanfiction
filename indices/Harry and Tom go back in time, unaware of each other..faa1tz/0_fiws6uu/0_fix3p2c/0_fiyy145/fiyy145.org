Even bigger plot twist, those lemon drops were originally invented by some goblin that wanted to make his clients less nervous when he discussed finances with them. Only for it to work so well that a human fell in love with him. Bing bada boom here comes Filius Flitwick ready to teach some students some leviosas and supply some lemon drops (without the amortentia) to Dumbles.

Flitwick was the true lemon drop master all along.

Someone tweet this and I'm sure JK Rowling would love to make it canon.
