Harry walked into the defence classroom, and while it had been many years since he had been in Hogwarts, he knew it wasn't supposed too look like this. Three elevated rectangular platforms occupied the center of the room, shortened dueling platforms, Harry noticed. Around them stood rows of seats, more like an arena than the classroom. Standing casually on the center of the middle, and most elevated dueling strip stood Quirrel, or Voldermort he supposed. Yet the man held himself differently to either of the aforementioned people. His back was straight and his head was held indifferently. Sheer confidence exuded of the man, not aristocratic "I have better lawyers then you" confidence, nor Voldermorts arrogance. Just, faith in his abilities as a teacher. This couldn't be the same Quirrel.

"Soldiers, Warriors, Aurors, Protectors, Rebels. These are what you might become, if you finish my classes. Have a seat wherever you want. " Quirrel said, making sweeping gestures to the seats that surrounded him. "I can't say I care for House based seating. Because to me, in this very moment, as I look out into this sea of hopeful and innocent faces. I don't see Gryffindors and Slytherins. I see the dead."

A wand appeared in his hand as if it had been disillusioned, rather than summoned from a wrist holster.

"Umbrania Maximus" Quirrel shouted out, accompanying it with a dramatic wave of his wand across the room.

​

The student's shadows rose up from the ground and seized their wrists forcing them against their desks. Every student in the room had been disarmed by the shadows and restrained, except for Harry. With a swift silent Lumos Harry had dispelled his Corporal shadow and had it slither back into the ground where it belonged. Turning to Quirrel in the same moment, wand raised, too see if he was hostile.

​

" Mr Potter, well done. Clearly at least one of you has read your textbooks. Because if you had, like Mr Potter here. Then you would know I used a modified shadow paralysis spell. Which while highly effective against squibs and muggles, is useless against any witch or wizard worth their blood, as a mere Lumos will dispel it. But judging by your apparent illiteracy, it would appear Squibs and Muggles might have done better. At least they wouldn't wait patiently to be disarmed and restrained by their own shadows." Quirrel chuckled, waving his wand around silently dispelling the shadows from the rest of the students. "My class is not too be made a mockery of. If you do so. You will die. As I have demonstrated here, a first-year curse, which admittedly did require a complex modification to affect all of you, was enough to put you all at my complete mercy. And more often than not, your friendly neighborhood dark wizard will not use some first year curse, or even complex dark magic. He will merely point his wand at you and say the magic words." Quirrel spoke quietly, yet his voice was projecting throughout the room so every syllable was heard as if spoken softly into their ears. He waved his wand, and conjured up a lifelike imitation of Harry Potter. It stood it's face blank, before looking at Quirrel and panicking, turning and running away. But not fast enough, as Quirrel finished his speech saying "Avada Kedavara." The clone falling to the ground was the only sound audible in the room. Students from both houses were seemingly stunned and terrified. Harry, always the exception, was only stunned. This wasn't Quirrel as he knew, what kind of past did he end up in? How did the nervous reck of teacher end up using a killing curse, which was admittedly legal when not used upon a human, as punctuation for a speech that was akin to what he was given in Auror training. This wasn't his reality, it couldn't be. But then, why wasn't it?

/Yeah i tried to respond to the prompt but i got carried away trying to make Quirrel a cool teacher. It still works, but it does lack some of the humour that i'm pretty sure you wanted./
