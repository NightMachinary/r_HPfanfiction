Voldemort (and Quirrell?) stares with his mouth open.\\
The Weasley twins (who are out and about to set up a prank) happen upon them and stare with their mouths open.\\
Dumbledore's finally tracked down who broke into his office, and stares with his mouth open.\\
Snape, who detected the mysterious awkward silence and came up to snark at it, stares with his mouth open.\\
