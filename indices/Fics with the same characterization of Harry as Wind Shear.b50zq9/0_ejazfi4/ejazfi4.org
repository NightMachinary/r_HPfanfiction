Obviously Delenda Est, but I assume you've read that if you liked Wind Shear.

Try Linkffn(I'm Still Here by Kathryn518) if you haven't already. Harry's a bit more angsty, but it's a good approximation.

Maybe Linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair). Kind of a stretch, but could work.

Linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgency) is probably the closest in terms of setting, but easily the weakest of the 3 in terms of quality.
