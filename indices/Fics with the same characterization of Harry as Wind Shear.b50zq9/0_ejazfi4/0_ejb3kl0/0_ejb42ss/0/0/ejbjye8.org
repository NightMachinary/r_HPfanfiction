That sounds about right. Most crossovers seem to be Harry Potter in the World of These Other Guys. But "strange" I don't see. My two favorite crossovers are linkffn(browncoat, green eyes) (HP goes to Firefly) and linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) (Hellraiser comes to HP). Characterization stays about right (or I've read enough fanfics that it didn't seem super strange to me).

But things like linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot; Dimension Hopping for Beginners) (HP and many) and linkffn(Denarian Renegade) (HP and Dresden Files) are really good reads, although DR doesn't focus nearly as much on HP's style as it does on the DF magic, as far as I remember - that being said, no prior knowledge of DF is needed to understand what's going on.
