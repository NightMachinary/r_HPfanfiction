I've been listing fanfics I like too but I've been using Google sheets to track tags, fic length, completion status, characters, etc. It gives you a much better overview and you can use the search function to look for specific fics and keywords that might not be in the fic summary. Or filter out discontinued fics and such

Have you considered using something like that?

In any case, thanks for sharing! Saving this to look through at a later time :)
