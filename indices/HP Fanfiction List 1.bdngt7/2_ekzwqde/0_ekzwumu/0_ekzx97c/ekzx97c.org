I've been reading fanfiction since middle school and I've always used bookmarks with folders to separate the different fandoms(Crossovers put in the folder where largest amount of story takes place). During my career I have read(Just did all this on a calculator) 1937 fanfiction stories, 424 of which are Harry Potter stories.
