Oh I know, it sucks to lose stuff like that. I recently had to upgrade my computer and i forgot to save the documents i had my lists in, onto a USB. so i lost those lists and had to redo them. thankfully they were still in my browser history so i could go back and find them but i'm pretty sure i still missed a few. In a few of my first lists i would say the word count, the gen and a few special notes but honestly there was so many, that i got lazy with it. I did that too for finding fanfics but after a while I just had to change it to update dates for the fics because it was easier to keep track of when something updates as well as when new fics showed up. I also don't usually put in pairing because i find that i miss out on good fics that way. As for word count I usually read 100k+ but sometimes i come across good fics that are only around 20+ to 30+ so i give those a go if they're good enough.
