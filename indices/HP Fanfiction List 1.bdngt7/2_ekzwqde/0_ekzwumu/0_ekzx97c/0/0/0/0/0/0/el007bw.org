Lol, glad I was able to help. Yeah this conversation was a great start to my interactions in this sub. Be glad to have more conversations in the future, I'll be sure to follow you and pop in if you see fit to post more. Send me a message if you'd like, all I do is eat, sleep, and drink fanfiction. But it is 1am so bedtime for me, have a goodnight or day whatever it may be :) .
