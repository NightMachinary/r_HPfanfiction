That sucks, I always hated when I lost stories. I would recommend that you use google drive for documents, I've personally never lost a document with it, and so long as you have your gmail account you can access them. That's how I keep my bookmarks up to date from my computer to phone, the account is synced with my phone and computer so it auto updates on either. I don't always put in pairings or word filters, but I usually prefer fics with a pairing in it. So glad that my first comment on this sub turned into such an awesome conversation.
