Yeah I don't blame you for not going my route it is a lot of work. Crtl+f can be a lifesaver lol. I've probably lost some bookmarks too as I moved from device to device. Another sorting method I use for unfinished and abandoned works, I put (UF) or (AB) in front of the title, finished works have nothing in front of them. I don't usually read fics with that low of a word count unless the premise is good or it just started. The best I've found to sort is by favorites(Fanfiction) or kudos(ArchiveofOurOwn), and add in a pairing if that's what you are feeling up to.
