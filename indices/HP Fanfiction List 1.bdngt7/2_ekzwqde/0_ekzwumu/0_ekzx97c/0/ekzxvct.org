Oh I thought about doing that too but honestly I'm totally lazy. That and it's easier to search through a document to find a story than it is a bookmark. Sometime i come across stories I already have and I can just crtl+f to look. So I'm lazy haha. I honestly have no idea how many ive read simply because even thought ive been reading since middle school as well, i never saved or bookmarked those stories. I usually have a good memory of what i have and havent read so i never saw the need till now when i started to have time to read more and more. Since october when i started this, i have read around 283 fanfics with most being 20k+
