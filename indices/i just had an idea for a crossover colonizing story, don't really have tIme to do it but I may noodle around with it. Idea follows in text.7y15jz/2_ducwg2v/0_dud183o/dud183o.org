It could be like my stranger in a strange land story, part diary entry, part narrative. Sadly, I don't know asoiaf but it seems like fhe only amazng creatures are white walkers, dire wolves, and dragons. Middle earth is rather close to hpverse too. The lands in a sword of truth have very different mythic beasties.
