Ohohohohohohohohohohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!

My friend - this type of story is my shit, and do I have one hell of a suggestion for you!!!!!!!! <3 <3 Sorry, this is just the first request for a /type/ of story (instead of a "I forgot this story title") that I can really nail.

The Difference On Man Can Make ( linkffn(11132113) ) is a story where, not to spoil /too/ much, Harry is thrown into the GoT universe. Instead of a normal crossover, however, where he is reincarnated as some lord, he's instead transported /directly/ as he is north of The Wall. Instead of going down to do some "southern" politics, he stays north of The Wall and builds an /entire fucking settlement/ for Free Folk.

It's abandoned. The writing isn't /really/ anything to write home about. But it's fucking beautiful settlement building and the concept is enough to make a re-read worth it, which is what I'm about to do now that you've reminded me of it. :)
