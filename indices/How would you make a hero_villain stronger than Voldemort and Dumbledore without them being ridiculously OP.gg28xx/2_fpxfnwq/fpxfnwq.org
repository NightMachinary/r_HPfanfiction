Rather than giving him more raw power (which is likely to come off as overdone), make him smarter in its use. This is hard, because it means the writer has to be smart enough to write a cunning villain convincingly, but a villain who was smarter/less unstable than Voldie, but more ruthless and less restrained than Dumbledore, could do more damage with a comparable amount of power.

Using disguises and mind-control to stealthily take power, rather than doing so openly, could fit with that.
