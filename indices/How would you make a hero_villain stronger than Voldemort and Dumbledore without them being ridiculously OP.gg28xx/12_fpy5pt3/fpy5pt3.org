Like all concepts that are usually executed horribly, this can /technically/ be done well. The way you're asking this question heavily implies that you won't be able to accomplish this feat, which is something very experienced authors struggle with. Go ahead and write the story, but do not expect it to be what you imagined. It will suck, it will suck /hard/, but the effort will not be wasted. Writers get better by writing, so when you decide it isn't up to your standards you can rewrite until it is.
