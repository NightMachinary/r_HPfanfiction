  What is the benefit to your story of making this villain be more powerful than Voldemort and Dumbledore
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is a direct threat to his plan while Tom is the very reason why he wants to control the world

#+end_quote

Because he wants Tom dead but he still wants Rowena's diadem intact, so a soul destroying curse would leave the diadem i tact.

  Just casting a charm and easily controlling everything about the weather?

If spell like meteolojinx recanto exist I guess blizzard, heatwave spells must exist
