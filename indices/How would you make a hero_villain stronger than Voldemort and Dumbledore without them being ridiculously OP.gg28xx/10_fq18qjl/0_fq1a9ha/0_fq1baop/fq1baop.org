  Dumbledore is a direct threat to his plan while Tom is the very reason why he wants to control the world

Neither of those necessitate making him more personally powerful than either of those characters. Better/smarter use of his resources and abilities, or a better/more competent organization of allies would be sufficient.

  Because he wants Tom dead but he still wants Rowena's diadem intact, so a soul destroying curse would leave the diadem i tact.

Again, that doesn't require something as ubitiquous as a 4th Unforgiveable. Make it a difficult, lengthy ritual if you need that plot point - something that he took the time to research and develop /just/ for that.

  If spell like meteolojinx recanto exist I guess blizzard, heatwave spells must exist
#+end_quote

A single spell that would allow for a far reaching weather manipulation would strike me as too strong - particularly if he's the only one capable of it. I would again point to some sort of ritual as being more palatable, or in restricting it to a fairly small region (eg, a few square miles).
