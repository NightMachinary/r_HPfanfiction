My question would be... /why/?

What is the benefit to your story of making this villain be more powerful than Voldemort and Dumbledore - rather than being more threatening through better use of his tools, through a better organization, etc?

For your specifics, point 1 does not presuppose that he's stronger - just that he's more strategically apt and willing to use the tools at his disposal - and, seemingly, has a good organization at his backing.

For the 4th unforgivable, I don't really see the point of it. I dislike it - I'd much rather see something like that handled with a ritual.

Similarly, weather control heavily depends on the form you have it take. Just casting a charm and easily controlling everything about the weather? No thanks. A complicated ritual that takes a while to setup? Much more palatable. Etc, etc.

Personally, I don't think a villain needs to be more powerful than Voldemort or Dumbledore to be a threat - and just relying on power is pretty lazy. It's far more interesting to take some other avenues to being scary - just like how Voldemort is at his most threatening and scary, not when he's at his own personal most powerful, but when he's got his legion of followers and his planning to take over the entire ministry/government.
