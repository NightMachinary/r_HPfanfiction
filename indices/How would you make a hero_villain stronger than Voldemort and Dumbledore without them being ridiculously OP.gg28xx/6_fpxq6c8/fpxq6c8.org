You just make someone that's not so isolated by Britain. Magical power is not that important outside of single combat.

Voldemort was a British Dark Lord, who had a niche group of supporters, and a cause that would not be shared by many outside Britain (blood supremacy), make a guy/gal who is international, whose cause is not limited to a single stratum of society.

They don't need to be more magically powerful than Dumbledore/Voldemort but they can be a bigger threat by wielding more political power.
