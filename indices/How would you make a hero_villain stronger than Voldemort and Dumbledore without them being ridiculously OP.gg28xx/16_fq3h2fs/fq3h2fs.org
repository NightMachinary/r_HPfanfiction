I wouldn't necessarily give them too many crazy abilities, but rather make them more powerful by using existing abilities more effectively. For example, Harry is about to return to the Dursleys when suddenly out of nowhere the entire house blows up, and if Harry hadn't been delayed he would've been just as dead as his smoldering relatives. No crazy powerful dark curse capable of breaking through the power of love, but rather something as simple as a sabotaged gas pipe. If the enemy is capable of attacking in a completely unexpected manner at any moment, they're much scarier than someone who throws around Avadas at the end of the schoolyear.
