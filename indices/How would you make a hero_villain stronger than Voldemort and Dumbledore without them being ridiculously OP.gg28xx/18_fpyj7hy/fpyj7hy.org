I think you're on the right path. You write him by being smart. As Goblins say in every trope-riddled fic, /wizards are idiots./ One, even slightly above average, witch or wizard could take over the world in less than a year if they have a well functioning brain.

Also, play a lot on subtlety. Him marching into Paris with a giant storm behind him won't be very realistic. You need a Palpatine, not a Vader.

​

Edit: If you develop the Wizarding World, make sure your MC can out-smart it in realistic ways. The canon Wizarding world is a mess that should barely function. Probably the easiest world in literature to exploit and eventually take over. If you leave it like that, good. But if you actually revamp it into something competent, make sure to have your MC act accordingly.

​

Edit. 2: There are a crap ton of unique and interesting ways for a wizard/witch to exploit the WW and make themselves OP. In terms of magical strength, physical strength, looks, agility, wealth, etc. Whatever you do, just dont have your MC go into Gringotts and leave out inheriting half the Wizengamot.
