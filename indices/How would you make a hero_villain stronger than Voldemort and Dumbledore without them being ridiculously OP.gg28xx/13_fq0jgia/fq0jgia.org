They would be ridiculously OP if you went with what you described. I suggest you give them creativity. They don't have to be ridiculously powerful to be a terrifying villain. They just need creativity. Poison the water system, destroy the hospitals, etc. They would want to blend in with the crowd but stand out when needed. Having them create that 4th unforgivable is going cause a Mary/Gary. In other words, I would instantly close the tab. Unless you plan on the villain stealing the spell. Perhaps Severus Snape invented it then they killed him and took credit for the spell? Or someone else known to craft dark spells. Maybe they saw Voldemor's unfinished notes? Point is, you can't give them raw power if you want a good story. Have them use tanning spells on Vampires to recruit them. Or provide free wolfsbane to get the werewolves.
