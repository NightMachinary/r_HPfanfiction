  In my fic there is a Wizards/Muggles WW3, this dark wizard and his minions crashed planes by apparating inside, sinked boats and burn all the crops. Basically he starves the muggles until they give up.

that's... okay but do you think apparating inside planes is possible? it seems kinda... hard. i mean the damn things go more than 1000 km/h :/
