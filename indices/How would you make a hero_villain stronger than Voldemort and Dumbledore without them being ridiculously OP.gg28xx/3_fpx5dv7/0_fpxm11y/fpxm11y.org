Wizards can multiply food they already have, but they can't create food from nothing (gamp's laws of elemental transfiguration)

In canon arithmancy is predicting the future using numbers. Absolutely nothing to do with spell creation. That's fanon, and should not be suggested as if it's an integral aspect of the setting.

Why not? If that's the scale of power you're taking your cast to, then go for that scale of power. If you're only taking Tim the dark lord to that level and it's an un achievable feat by others even if he was to share the knowledge and skills, THEN it becomes an issue.
