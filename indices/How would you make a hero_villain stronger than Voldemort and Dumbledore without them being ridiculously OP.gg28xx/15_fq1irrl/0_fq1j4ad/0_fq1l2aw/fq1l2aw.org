Well, you can always have our cool villain be on the same power level as them or a bit above or below but never too much above, I don't mean only unpredictable, also like him being able to make a trap in a few spells or start the duel with something that alone seems benign but together with other spells will be deadly

a cheering charm and laughter charm and then blow his wind out of his lungs, might suffocate opponent

That water bubble dumbles did on voldy + glacius + wingardium leviosa = another suffocation

If opponent likes to dodge then send a spell at him and two to his sides so he'll dodge straight into a spell

Accio something behind opponent, might give concussion

Smoke screen and send spells through

Or some other similar combinations, maybe even some spells that cant be shielded (villain is creative = probably smart = can make own spells)
