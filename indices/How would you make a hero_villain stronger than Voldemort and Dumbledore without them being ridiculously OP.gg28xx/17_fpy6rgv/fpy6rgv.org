Hello! Personally, I like your idea..

But I think that if you want to make your villain better than Dumbledore or Voldemort, then you have to make him have characteristics that the two lack.

What I mean is, for example, Dumbledore is extremely strong and a genius. But, he strictly uses light and sometimes grey magic and does not touch dark spells. He is also shown to not want to kill people.

On the other hand , Voldemort, while also being very powerful and smart, is ridiculously unstable and somewhat obsessive.

I feel that if you are writing a villain who is better than the two, you need to turn both their reluctances into the new villains characteristics. Make him/her ruthless- they don't think twice to kill somebody if it means a personal gain. Make them charismatic- make him somebody that you wouldn't have even thought was possible of committing such crimes and still find it hard to believe because when you interacted with him, he was so nice and charming. Make them young- somebody who can relate to the youth and at first look, is considered to be harmless. Make them good-looking- people find it harder to dislike somebody who is physically attractive. Don't make him unstable. Make him smart. And if he would have gone to Hogwarts, make him a hufflepuff- sorry to be stereotypical, but that is the least suspecting house where you would expect a Dark Lord to come out of; plus loyal minions!

I like the idea of using food-stalks as leverage for the population to do his bidding and the use of weather charms... You can also make him monopolise some potions or something on the markets.

If you've seen the second Sherlock Holmes movie with RDJ starring, then we learn that James Moriaty was planning to start a war and monopolise all the first-aid and weapons. That way, whether it would be for medicine or arms, he was the only person you could come to, making the world completely dependent on him.

You could do a similar line. Perhaps release a virus, with only the new dark Lord having a cure to it? Or with the food supplies maybe. Damage the world's/region's stock. He/She is the only supplier.

Make everybody completely dependent on him/her.

No offence, but the forth unforgivable idea is a little... too much. (Sorry). In that context, you can really make use of obliviation spells as well.

This idea is quite nice. Perhaps Dumbledore and Voldemort will have to team up or something? IDK, it sounds cool though. Just be careful not to make hm overly too Gary Stu.

If you need more ideas, then I would respectfully suggest watching movies with these types of villains (Mission Impossible, Sherlock Holmes, etc.)
