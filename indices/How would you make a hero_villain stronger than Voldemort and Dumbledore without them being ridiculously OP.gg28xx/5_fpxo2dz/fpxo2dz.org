I'm calling your OC Tim as i need a name.

I buy imperious and polyjuice to take over, that's literally what voldy did in book 7

Why do you need a 4th unforgivable to do this? Just let the killing curse destroy horcrux soul fragments without destroying the item. Make it like the cruciatus, you have to want to murder the target, not just kill them in a fight, but take them in their weakest moment and murder them. Make it so it doesn't work as a mercy, you can't have any intention but an outright desire to kill them without giving them any chance to defend themselves. It doesn't contradict canon, and in fact complements what we know of the cruciatus, and gives us a viable reason for why our heroes did't use this method in canon and won't turn people off your story. Honestly, 4th unforgivable sounds like rather imature writing, the kind of thing on tier with renaming harry into harridan because you think harry sounds too normal.

Well approached, the idea of weather control is great! Especially if introduced slowly, have it as a plot point, make it something people have been working on for a long time, introduce a character allied wi5 the heroes who's close to a breakthrough, but has had their notes stolen by a rival, who's part of the dark lord Tim's cult. Give our heroes access to it as the final confrontation approaches, not a great control, but enough to prevent Tim from controlling the battlefield. Trickle the power into the heroes slowly, a lightning bolt spell that's from a failed atempt at weather control. Then something that sorinkles water on an area. A spell they dismiss as an area version of a banisher that actually creates wind, then they start realising it all relates and they can combine the spells to create weather, before they learn proper weather control spells in time for the final fight, maybe even just having a breakthrough during the final fight because they need something to counter Tim's tornado with thunderbolts. Basically, make sure all the pieces are there, and Tim is just the first one to put them together.
