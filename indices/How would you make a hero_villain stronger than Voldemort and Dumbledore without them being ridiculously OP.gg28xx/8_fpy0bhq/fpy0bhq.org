HP is a kid's book at it's core.

That means there are inherent plot holes that /have/ to exist or the story simply can't function. JKR never had to consider the amount of rape that would happen at hogwarts from the magic she invented and the characters she created, because it's a kid's book. As an example. If bullying goes ignored, by logic, it'd be easy for the literal villains in slytherin to get an older graudate to teach them memory magic and have free reign over the other houses.

Another more relevant example to you is that it's a kid's book it ignores the reality of the real world. Like say how easy it would be for even a moderately strong wizard to wipe out a food supply.

Use imperious on muggles and you have a fighting force that has no resistance to it and yet can do quite a bit of damage given that wizards are effectively mortal without wands or without even reaction speed/preparation 99% of the time.

Now, if you tackle the plot holes without considering /why/ they exist, then your story will probably be unreadable.
