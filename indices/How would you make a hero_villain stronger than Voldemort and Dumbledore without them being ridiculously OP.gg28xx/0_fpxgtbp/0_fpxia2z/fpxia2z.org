  That one spell essentially negates all eight books and makes Voldemort a very weak villian
#+end_quote

tbh Voldemort (and other wizards) seem to be incredibly ignorant and unimaginative in canon:

-why didn't Ron transfigured a new robe?

-couldn't Tom use less flashy horcruxs or is he that arrogant?

-couldn't Tom just throw Harry threw a window?

Also yeah I wont talk about the curse until much later
