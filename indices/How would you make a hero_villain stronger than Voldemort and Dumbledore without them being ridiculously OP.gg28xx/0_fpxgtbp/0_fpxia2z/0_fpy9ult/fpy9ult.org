I kind of agree that it seems like magic, and especially transfiguration, should be able to solve most money problems your last two point are kind of silly. Yes a perfectly logical Voldemort would make less flashy horcruxes the last two books are pretty much dedicated to the fact that yes Tom is that arrogant and conceited and would only accept objects of importance to him and/or the wizarding world to hold part of his soul. And why would Voldemort throw Harry out the window? The Killing Curse had never been blocked before and is the perfect tool for murdering people instantly, using it makes total sense. Deciding to kill his prophesised foe in a less perfect way would be silly. The only different choice I can see is him deciding to use a more brutal method.
