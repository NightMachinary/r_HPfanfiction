Honestly, if I opened a first chapter and read about the new unforgiveable curse, I'd probably click out. My brain immediately jumps to Gary Stu.

A villain needs to be incredibly powerful, so a reader can see why he's amassed his following, how he conquered the world and why he appears unstoppable. So, I could see that, but he doesn't have to be stronger than Voldemort or Dumbledore to do that. Plus, If I read the unforgivable curse thing it would be way too much to swallow. That one spell essentially negates all eight books and makes Voldemort a very weak villian.
