Because I always love the idea that magic is inherently antithetical to the scientific method, i have the following head-canon. Beyond “this spell does this thing” it becomes inconsistent and unreproducible. Two independent scientists could perform the same experiments with the same criteria and get wildly differing results.

Just because 1+1=2 doesn't mean that 2-1=1 once magic gets involved. And this is why muggle technology doesn't work in Hogwarts, because the principals upon wich they work are not constants around magic. Something (relatively) simple like a mechanical watch still works because the weirdness around science is barely noticeable when a gear ratio isn't the same stepping down as it is stepping up, as now it simply takes the second hand 1.0003 seconds to move one second and 0.995 seconds to move the next, it would take years for it to be noticeably incorrect, while some5hing electrical would just stop working the moment electrons started behaving like photons.

Much like how photons switch between waveforms and particles when observed, so too does magic, switching between reliable and wildly inconsistent as you try to understand it's mechanics. If you managed to break down the whys of magic using latin, and discovered that it was some inherent magical property of latin that causes words in it to cause effects, suddenly all your spells require gibberish incantations, for entirely different reasons, if you work it out, suddenly magic only works through gestures if you remain absolutely silent, for a completely different third set of reasons.

Basically i head-canon that magic is actually magic, and not a heretofore undiscovered part of physics.

Which after i typed all that out i realise it's probably not relevant or helpful, but i'm going to post it anyway because i think people may find it interesting.
