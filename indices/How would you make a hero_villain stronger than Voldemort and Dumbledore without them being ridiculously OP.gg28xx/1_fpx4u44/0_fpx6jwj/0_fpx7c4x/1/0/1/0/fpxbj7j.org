Fair enough, it's really something I've given much thought to tbh. I would be careful to keep it to basic and/or crude inventions to start with, and they should have some disadvantages when compared to using purely Muggle or purely magical weapons. For example, even during the early years of the 19th century, man for man, longbowmen were better than musket infantry, they had a much higher rate of fire and were, on occasion, more accurate. The reasons muskets became more popular was because you could train a peasant to use a musket in a few months, while a longbowman needed to have practiced every week since he was 10.

Another thing to consider, it is much easier to reverse engineer tech than to invent it from scratch, anything your main guy invents will be eventually used against, firstly from captured weapons, and later from one's they've manufactured themselves, having cracked the secrets.
