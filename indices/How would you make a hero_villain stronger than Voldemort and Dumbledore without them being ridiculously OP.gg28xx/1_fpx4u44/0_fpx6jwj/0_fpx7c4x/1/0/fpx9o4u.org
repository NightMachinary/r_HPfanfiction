Again, my personal preference is that magic and science don't mix. It's like trying to use classical mechanics to solve quantum problems, it just doesn't work.

Melding magic and science would require the creation of a new branch of science, with exceptions to most of the major universal laws and constants we use today. It could be done, but similar to how quantum theory developed, you need many years, and hundreds of the world's best minds working on it, it's not something a teenager should be able to do over the course of their 7 years at Hogwarts.
