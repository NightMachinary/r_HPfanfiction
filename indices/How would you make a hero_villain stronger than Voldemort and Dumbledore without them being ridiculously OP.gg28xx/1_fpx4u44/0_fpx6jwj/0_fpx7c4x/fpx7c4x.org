I've never really been a fan of "character discovers an esoteric way to remove Horcruxes, proceeds to collect Voldemort's soul canisters like pokemon" story beats. I liked how in canon the only option was complete magical destruction, which had like two methods, basilisk venom or fiendfyre (and also Dumbledore's convoluted sacrifice method, I guess).

If you really want the diadem intact, I suppose you could say that what Tom actually found was a prototype, and the real diadem is still out there? Or perhaps lobbing it through the veil of death removed the soul piece while the diadem sails through unharmed?
