  He manage to conquered the whole wizarding and muggle world by excessive use of imperius curse, polyjuice and destruction of food stockpiles.

This is probably fine if written convincingly, JKR was writing kids books, and so didn't spend much time fleshing out how the wizarding world actually works, which is fine, but does create an environment where most things are either oversimplified (there's /one/ prison for the whole country?) or convoluted for the sake of being 'magical', (eg all fo Dumbledore's titles and the wizarding currency system). In short, a sufficiently intelligent antagonist could easily topple the whole thing.

  he creates a 4th unforgivables curse that can destroy someone's soul (they can't come back as ghost, they can't go to the afterlife and it can destroy a horcrux without damaging the said object).
#+end_quote

This would be hard to write well. While I'm a believer that any trope can be written convincingly, some are harder than others, and this boils down to "my character has invented a spell that's basically the killing curse, but it's better because it works on Horcruxes and kills them so hard they don't even get to be ghosts". Personally, I think this would make them too much of a Gary Stu.

  weather control.
#+end_quote

I don't think weather magic has ever actually been touched on in canon, so this could be fairly interesting if it's applied in a unique way. The key would be to make it subtle, eg perhaps creating a rainstorm above Hogsmede, so the kids stay in the castle and your guy can do his shady dealings in peace, rather than calling down lightning from the sky, killing tens of people in seconds.

If you really want to make him more powerful the Dumbles and Tom, I think the most convincing way is to just make him roughly the same power level, but Dumbledore is old, and Tom has damaged himself too much with his dark arts, while your guy has youth and vitality on his side.
