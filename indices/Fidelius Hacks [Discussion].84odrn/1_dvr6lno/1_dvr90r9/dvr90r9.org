#1 is fine, but the caster and Keeper can be the same person (Dumbledore was both for the Grimmauld Place). #2 is most likely false. There's no reason the Potters or Sirius couldn't have cast the Fidelius, given we know Bill could do so as well. We don't know who cast the Fidelius for the Potters initially, but we know Dumbledore didn't know about the switch so either they undid the Charm and recast it themselves or one is allowed to change Secret Keepers while keeping the initial enchantment going. #3 is definitely fine, but #4, as you said, seems to be false in canon.

However, you raised a question I think canon answers. We're told people knew the Potters were going (or had gone) under Fidelius - presumably they noted their house in Godric's Hollow had vanished - and Sirius said he knew the obvious candidate for their Secret Keeper was Sirius himself. My guess is that Sirius knew there were people Voldemort could capture and threaten so as to force Sirius to give up the Secret. Sirius might have been willingly to die if his own life were threatened, but what if, say, Andromeda and Tonks had been captured? Pretty shitty situation.

  The Secret-Keeper can not be an animal, according to the wiki. The keeper must be 'free to tell the secret whenever they desire'.

I know the Wiki says this, but it's a purely a supposition, The second bit I agree with, but the first bit is not said anywhere. It doesn't even contradict being free to tell the secret. The example I gave wasn't just any animal, but snakes, who can at least communicate with Parslemouths (of which Voldemort is a speaker of). The real issue is that doing this means he'd never find the random snake they gave the secret to, which is a bit of a tension killer. Better explanation might be that animals don't have souls to store the secret in, perhaps.

The ghost bit is confusing. Snape and others refer to them as imprints of souls, so it seems to say they aren't souls themselves (meaning the charm should fail). But Nick - obviously a ghost himself - says that wizards can come back rather than go on, which seems to suggest the ghosts are literally the soul of the person come back to earth. So I'm not sure. Horcruxes seem a simpler case: they would most likely register as the same soul as the original, so the caster couldn't hide the secret in a bit of their own soul.

Your 2-layer Fidelius idea seems like a solid one though given it was used in DH (I'd forgotten). Thanks!
