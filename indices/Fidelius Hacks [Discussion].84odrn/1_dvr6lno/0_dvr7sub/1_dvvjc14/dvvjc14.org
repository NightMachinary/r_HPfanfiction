Proficient enough to become an animagus while in school and without professional guidance (McGonagall or Dumbledore)...Peter might have been great at magic, but not the greatest among the Marauders (meaning James, Sirius and Remus are better, but that doesn't make him bad!), not to mention that Snape and Lilly were in that year, too and they both were also great at magic (remember Snape wants to teach defense and is qualified for that, too maybe even as good as he's at potions! I mean that guy made his own SPELLS while in school! Sectum Sempra anybody?)...so Peter is probably just unlucky that he's part of that class and not another that doesn't have that many shining stars in it!
