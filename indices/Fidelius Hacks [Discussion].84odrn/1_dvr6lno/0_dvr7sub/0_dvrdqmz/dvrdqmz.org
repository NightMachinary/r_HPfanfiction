  How do we know for a fact Dumbledore didn't know Peter was the secret keeper ?
#+end_quote

What possible motive would Dumbledore have for keeping Sirius in Azkaban and the traitor possibly at large?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore "knows" Sirius killed Peter and sold the Potters, but in PoA when he listens to the ramblings of two teens, he suddenly decides Sirius is innocent ? That's too far fetched for me.
#+end_quote

Why? They have no reason to lie, he might be able to sense deception a little bit, and it fits with the rest of what he knows. Sirius's "betrayal" was a huge surprise for everyone in the first place.

  I can't see the Fidelius being cast without knowing where you're putting the secret while casting it. Of course you'd forget straight away when it's done, but I'm pretty sure the keeper would have to be present to cast it.
#+end_quote

That's a very good mechanism explaining why Dumbledore thought it was Sirius: upon casting, he forgot, and then just assumed because that was the original plan.

#+begin_quote
  And then, to learn of the secret, Dumbledore would have to have been told by Peter.
#+end_quote

Or, he read a note written by Peter.

#+begin_quote
  So if we accept that Dumbledore didn't know where they were hidden (which seems unlikely, considering ... well ... he's Dumbledore they'd have to have told him),
#+end_quote

For that matter, did Dumbledore have need-to-know? James, Lily, and Peter were the only ones with need-to-know.

#+begin_quote
  the only logical explaination would be that Dumbledore didn't cast it.
#+end_quote

The "logical explanation" raises more questions and contradictions than it resolves.
