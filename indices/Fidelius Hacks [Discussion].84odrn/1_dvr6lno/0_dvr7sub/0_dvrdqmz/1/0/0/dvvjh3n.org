Maybe not, but Dumbledore was manipulative and it's easier to manipulate a hero who doesn't have a parent! Even if Dumbledore didn't plan Harry's sacrifice at that time, having a humble Harry dependent on Dumbledore's guidance would still be preferable with that prophecy in play (from Dumbledore's POV...the man is a chess master who plans his moves decades ahead!)
