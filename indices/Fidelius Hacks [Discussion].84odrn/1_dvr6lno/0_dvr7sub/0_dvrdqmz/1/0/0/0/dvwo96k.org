To condemn an innocent man to a hell on Earth, because at some point in the distant future, he might need to manipulate Harry into doing what Harry would have wanted to do anyway? That doesn't sound like Dumbledore at all. (Also, consider that canon Harry is actually pathologically distrustful of authority. It sounds like your "decades ahead" Dumbledore couldn't even plan for that.)
