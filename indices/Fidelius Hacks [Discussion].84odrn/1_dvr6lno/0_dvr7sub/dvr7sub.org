How do we know for a fact Dumbledore didn't know Peter was the secret keeper ? I really don't want to go in the old manipulative Dumbledore theories, but we really don't know that for sure.

Dumbledore "knows" Sirius killed Peter and sold the Potters, but in PoA when he listens to the ramblings of two teens, he suddenly decides Sirius is innocent ? That's too far fetched for me.

I can't see the Fidelius being cast without knowing where you're putting the secret while casting it. Of course you'd forget straight away when it's done, but I'm pretty sure the keeper would have to be present to cast it.

And then, to learn of the secret, Dumbledore would have to have been told by Peter.

So if we accept that Dumbledore didn't know where they were hidden (which seems unlikely, considering ... well ... he's Dumbledore they'd have to have told him), the only logical explaination would be that Dumbledore didn't cast it. Someone else must have. And the only four people who could have done it would be James and Lily (with Peter present to receive the secret), or Peter (which would mean the caster is the secret keeper, which seems unlikely considering how proficient Peter was at magic), or Sirius (who actually suggested they changed keeper (still with Peter present to receive the secret).

That's my take on it :)
