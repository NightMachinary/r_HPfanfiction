Can it not be the case that you have complete trust in someone but acknowledge they may still fail due to complications and thus add more insurance? Say if the Secret Keeper's family is kidnapped to force their. It's difficult to get angry with them and call it a violation of trust when nearly any morally normal person would be very tempted, and in most cases probably give up the secret to save their family.

And besides, other charms can be cast on a Fidelius'd location. The Grimmauld Place had other protective enchantments beside the Fidelius applied on top, so it's not like other magics being present automatically negate using it.

Tbf, I somewhat agree the Vow might go too far with my suggestion that it prevent even attempting to give away the secret. But seeing as Sirius, for example, said he'd have rather died than betray the Potters, I don't think it'd be a violation of trust to take him up on that an have him undergo the Vow as insurance should his hand be forced (e.g. if Andromeda & Tonks had been kidnapped by Voldemort).
