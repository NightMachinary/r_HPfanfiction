Depends on how ghosts work in your fork of the universe.

To me? The ghosts don't seem to be exactly ... sapient. They can, to some degree, process information and remember recent things, but they also appear to be somewhat stuck in a loop. More like the VI's of mass effect -- as long as you don't spend too much time with them you could mistake them for sapient, but after you spend enough time around them you realize that they're mere echos of a person and not the person themselves. Look at Professor Binns. Maybe he was a shitty lecturer before he died, but he doesn't seem to particularly notice the class or remember who is actually in his classes. In my mind, ghosts are unsuitable candidates for the fidelius because they are no longer proper thinking beings. They're an echo of a wizard, not a wizard themselves.

But if you want to use ghosts, I'd say, at best, ghosts have issues converting short term memories into long term memories. They might be able to be a secret keeper, but the fidelius would be weak and fail in short order - depending on the ghost, months to a few years. Some particularly ... /present/ ghosts might be able to hang onto the secret for a decade, at most, before their memory of the secret fades and the tenuous link to the charm fails.
