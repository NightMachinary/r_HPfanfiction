I'm not so sure about the loopy bit or them lacking good short term memory. The Gray Lady didn't seem to have any issues recalling Tom Riddle from decades prior and knew about Voldemort who was a more modern figure of note. There might be something to this (if so, I suspect it has more to do with how long the ghost has been around), but I don't think memory would be the issue with casting the Fidelius.
