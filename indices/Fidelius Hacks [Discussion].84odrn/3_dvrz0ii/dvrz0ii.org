In my mind, the fidelious is just as emotion-driven as the patronus or the unforgivables.

The charm doesn't merely require.you to trust someone with the secret, the foundational ability to cast the spell in the first place is complete and total trust.

Thus any attempts to make the secret more secure automatically makes the spell fail (or at least be too weak to do much good) the same way an insufficiently happy memory skunks the patronus.
