I'm not sure about that. Those hidden may well have to trust that person, but the Secret Keeper is well aware they could give them up if they chose to. Like, couldn't they /trust/ the other to put them under an Unbreakable Vow so they couldn't be intimidated into giving up the secret (through threats on family members for example). I mean, Sirius said he'd have rather died than give up the Potters so I doubt he'd have been too chuffed at the option to undergo a Vow for insurance.

As for the Elf example, yea I can see the point there, but how many purebloods would be able to actually put the appropriate kind of trust in their elf? Even an apparently good person like Sirius couldn't trust his family elf (understandably so). Elves can also break their master's orders, so it's not really foolproof (Dobby and Kreacher flouted their master's orders quite successfully).
