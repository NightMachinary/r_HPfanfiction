That was supposed to say "chafed" (I didn't know 'chuffed' was even a word, lol).

  'I trust you with this' and then add, 'but I'm assigning an enforcer to you so that you know to stay trustworthy'.

That's a misunderstanding of what I'm saying. Anyone can be threatened by taking aim at people they love. Sirius might have hated most of his family, but can we really say that if Andromeda and Tonks were captured by Voldemort (it was a war and Andromeda was a blood-traitor) that Sirius wouldn't be extremely tempted to give up the secret? Trust doesn't mean you are free from other possible obligations ensuring we uphold that trust (we regulate cops after all, despite ostensibly trusting them with lethal force).

As I said, I don't think wizards who actually have elves would have the kind of trust to make them the Secret Keeper even if they wanted to. But that said, Elves can disobey orders, they aren't an absolute hence why self-harm is sometimes done for failing to comply. And even if it were absolute, if their orders aren't completely disambiguous, they could pull a Kreacher and interpret an order in such a way as to give the secret up. That's partly why I suspect no wizards would be willing to trust a house-elf with the secret (if it's possible anyway).
