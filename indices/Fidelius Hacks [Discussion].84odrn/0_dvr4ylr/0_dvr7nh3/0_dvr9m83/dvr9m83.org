First of all 'chuffed' means 'pleased' and not 'bothered' -- your suggestion that Sirius wouldn't mind having a Vow help him keep faith was understood even though it was backwards. That said, at some level it's an insult to say 'I trust you with this' and then add, 'but I'm assigning an enforcer to you so that you know to stay trustworthy'.

For the house-elf, their owner has the power to make them obey explicit commands, so I don't think Regulus Black could make Kreacher a secret-keeper even if he'd wanted to, since there are other magics in play that disrupt the meaning of 'trust' for the sake of a Fidelius charm.
