Honestly while I understand how reading the cursed child and trying to act as if it was supposed to be a continuation of the main story would lead you to think it sucks, it isn't meant to be that. It's a play that is separate from Harry Potter, and for the format of a play is actually quite well written.

I thought it was very fun to watch, with very good acting and special effects for a play.
