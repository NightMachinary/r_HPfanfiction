Canon Ginny often fails (IMO) because she gets technically introduced early, but is relatively unimportant, one dimensional, etc. Then she pops back in in the back half, but seems to mainly be in there just to be Harry's love interest.

Her character absolutely had potential, but I would have appreciated seeing more of her if JKR knew that'd be the endgame - to show her as a character of more importance throughout books 3-5.

An alternative would be to make her stand out a bit more. I know that I find Tonks and Luna - who don't get all that much screen time themselves - much more interesting as characters, because we only get introduced to them later (when they're interesting) and they're more unique. Ginny striked me in canon as less interesting/unique, and burdened with her book 1-4 character that she never managed to overcome - at least for me.
