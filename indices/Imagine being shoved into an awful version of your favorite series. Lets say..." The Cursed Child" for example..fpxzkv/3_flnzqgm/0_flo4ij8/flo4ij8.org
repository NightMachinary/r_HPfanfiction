I don't like TCC at all, but it does have its moments which I wished were canon. This one particular moment when Ginny talks to Harry:

#+begin_quote
  GINNY: After I came out of hospital --- everyone ignored me, shut me out --- other than, that is, the boy who had everything --- who came across the Gryffindor common room and challenged me to a game of Exploding Snap. People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are --- have always been --- heroic in really quiet ways.

I really wished this would have been an actual scene in CoS. I really wished this would have been a canon moment between Harry and Ginny.
