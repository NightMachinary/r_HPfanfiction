Do I get to choose the fanfic? Can it be one where I can convince the goblins to love me and greatly increase my wealth with their incredible business brains just because I remembered their names and was polite? Maybe one where I become the Lord of multiple Ancient and Noble Houses and do politics by just yelling at and scaring people?
