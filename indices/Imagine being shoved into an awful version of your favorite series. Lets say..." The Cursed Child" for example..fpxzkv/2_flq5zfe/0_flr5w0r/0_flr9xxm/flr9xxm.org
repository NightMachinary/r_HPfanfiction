Yes, that was the joke. Although, let's be honest, if any of us could be a Mary Sue we all would be. If you could be well-liked/respected by everyone you know, if you could be naturally gifted to the point where anything you want to do is easy for you, then you'd want that. It makes for a shit character but that's why people end up making their SI's Mary Sues.
