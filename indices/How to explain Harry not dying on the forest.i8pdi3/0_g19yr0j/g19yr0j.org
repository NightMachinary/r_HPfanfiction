Its explained in the book. And the closest explanation is the second one

Voldemort had Harry's blood, so Lily's enchantment was kept alive. So when he used Avada kadavra Harry was protected like he was when he was a baby, and because he was still grounded to earth because of his mother's protection. And because of his blood bounding\\
he was able to come back from limbo and back into the living world unlike ghosts like nearly headless nick who was in a similar state who chose to remain on earth but their connection to their bodies was severed when they died, unlike Harry.
