Grey Space by noaact

"In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents.

When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have."

This is well written but is unfinished. It ends when Dumbledore shows up to try to talk a very bitter Harry Potter into attending Hogwarts.
