James and Lilly aren't bashed in that fic. None of the "light" side characters are bashed. They are all good people who made a terrible mistake and then ended up being too late to fix it.

Also, Harry in that fic isn't 'evil' per se. He has some deeply rooted self esteem problems that made him vulnerable to Voldemort's manipulation, so he ends up doing some abhorent things.
