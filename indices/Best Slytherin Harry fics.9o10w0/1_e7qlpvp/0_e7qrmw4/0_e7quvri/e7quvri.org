Spoilers for first like ten chapters

The Dursleys abuse him and then send him off to an orphanage, where he basically becomes Tom Riddle 2.0, complete with talking snakes and hurting other kids. He gets found by Death Eaters and they were about to kill him, but then they watch him talk to snakes and have his snake kill another kid and then they adopt him instead, so he's basically raised by Bellatrix.
