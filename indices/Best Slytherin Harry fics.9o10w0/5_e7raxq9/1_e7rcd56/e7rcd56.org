Oddly enough, Lomonaaeren wrote another fic that is similar to that one and just as long: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10748108/1/A-Brother-to-Basilisks][A Brother to Basilisks]] linkffn(10748108)

Both fics pick up at the end of second year with Harry forced to embrace his Slytherin side, but for different reasons. Both have Snape suddenly acting more like a father figure, manipulative Dumbledore, the Dursleys' abuse treated seriously, Slytherin vs. Gryffindor prejudice, and Harry solving the Sirius Black dilemma early.
