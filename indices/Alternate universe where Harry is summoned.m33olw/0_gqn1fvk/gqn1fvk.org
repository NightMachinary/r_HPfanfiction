The ones that come to mind are these(they are all complete):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1362757/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirror-Of-Paradox][Harry Potter and the Mirror of Paradox]] (Series) by Yih: I read this a really long time ago but I think it fits perfectly with your request.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333][World in Pieces]] by Lomonaaeren: I've read this, but for the life of me I can't remember the ending or whether or not it was satisfying...
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] by Kayly Silverstorm : I really really love this one. I read it a really long time ago but as soon as I read the name of this fic from my rec list, my heart soared. Beautiful.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]]by Lady Alinor: I don't remember is fic at all but it's complete....worth a shot.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]] by LeQuin: This is probably not what you are looking for. Dimension traveling is present but not for the purpose of fighting Voldemort...I believe.

This is all I can come up with sadly. This is such an interesting genre (Dimension traveling) unfortunately there aren't many finished fics... :(
