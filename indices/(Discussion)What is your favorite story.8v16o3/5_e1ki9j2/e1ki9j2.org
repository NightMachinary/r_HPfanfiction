I don't really have a complete favorite, I usually like different fics for different reasons. linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is one of the best written fics I've ever read. linkffn(The Power of Paranoia) is one of my favorite comedy fics because it has my favorite Harry-rants-at-Dumbledore scenes while not falling victim to a lot of the things I don't like about Dumbledore bashing fics. linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) is quite possibly the most interesting (to me) AUs and is helped by the fact that Enders Game is one of my favorite books/series ever. linkffn(Rogue's Bet) is my favorite 'HP where they actually act like teens' stories where there isn't really a big overarching conflict. linkffn(Picnic Panic) is my favorite 'normal romance' fic. I don't know how else to describe it, its definitely one of the more realistic romance fics and it's a REALLY nice change of pace. Fanfic writers really struggle writing actual romances and the buildup to being in a relationship, they usually just sort of throw characters together and call it a day. linkffn(Dear Order) is my favorite snarky-Harry story. linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die) is one of my favorite time travel fics. It reads like a buddy cop movie and it's great. linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7) has my favorite quidditch subplot and some of my favorite game narrations despite having a mess of an ending.
