linkffn(Yellow Submarine) and linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) (entire series)

I think these stories, and a few others, are miles ahead of even most "good" fanfiction that gets regularly recommended. Usually we just want something that meets our readability threshold but some fics reach truly great heights.
