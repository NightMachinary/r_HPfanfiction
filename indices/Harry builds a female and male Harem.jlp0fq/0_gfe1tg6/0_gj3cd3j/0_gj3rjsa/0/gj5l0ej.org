I'd recommend some harem fics but I haven't found any good ones. Some of the fics I've come across while looking for the fic I lost, have made me lose faith in humanity.

And I'd read a harem fic with just about any of the characters from HP in the harem. I lean more towards the main characters, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Tom Riddle, ect., But I don't mind others. The only characters I'd be opposed to are the older characters, Dumbledore and most of the teachers.

This is a Golden Trio threesome fic, it's well written and definitely worth a read if you're interested.
