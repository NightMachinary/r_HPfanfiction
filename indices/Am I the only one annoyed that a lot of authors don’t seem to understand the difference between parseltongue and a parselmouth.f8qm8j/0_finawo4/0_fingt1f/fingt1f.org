I consider myself a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, but not necessarily a fan of the English language. I put a proportional amount of research into both. I find the lack of knowledge of the parseltongue / parselmouth distinction more disturbing than the you're/your typo in Harry Potter fanfiction, if only because to be a fan of something is to follow it and try to know it.

English is a tool, but the Harry Potter series is a passion. Or, at least a fun pastime. I use one, and take pleasure from the other. I expect the same treatment from people who claim to write fiction about it from the position of being a fan.
