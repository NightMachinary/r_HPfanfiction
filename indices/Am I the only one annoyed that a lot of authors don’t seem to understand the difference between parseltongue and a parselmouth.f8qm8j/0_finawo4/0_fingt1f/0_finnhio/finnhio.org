Without a good tool use, even passions can suffer.

I don't know, I guess it's because I'm not a native speaker, and I make a decent effort in using the language as it should be (Though I know I fail sometimes), so when I see errors like that, it pisses me off that others don't make that same effort.

Same disturbance, different approach, maybe?
