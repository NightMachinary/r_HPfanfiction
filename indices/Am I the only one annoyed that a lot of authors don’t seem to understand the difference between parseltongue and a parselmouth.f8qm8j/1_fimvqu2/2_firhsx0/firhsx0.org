To be fair, "Kreattur" is Kreacher's name in the French version, one of the few names who are kinda translated in the book. No excuse for the spelling, but Kreattur is prononced exactly the same than "Creature" in French so if someone only watched the movie in VF, it's not so strange he wrote it like it.
