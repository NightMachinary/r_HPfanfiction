Maybe linkffn(9469064) and it has a bunch of sequels, currently in GoF, but they get very canon-rehash-y.

(It's Sirius raising Harry, and (spoiler) Remus does enter the picture after a while, but it's not Wolfstar if that's what you're looking for - actually it looks like it's going for all canon ships)
