The "Dangerverse" series fits that pretty well. Finished series with 5 fics, coming out at around 2 million words total:

Linkffn(2109424)

Linkffn(2306529)

Linkffn(2586720)

Linkffn(3113995)

Linkffn(7394834)

And a ton of companion fics. Keep in mind that the series was written between 2004 and 2014. So her writing gets progressively better over time. Also, any tropes you might find were no tropes back then. I liked it a lot back when I first read the series sometime around 2007/2008 and went back and reread it after it was finished in 2014.

The first part was a bit hard to get into during my second reading and I don't know how well it will hold up these days. But maybe give it a try and see for yourself.
