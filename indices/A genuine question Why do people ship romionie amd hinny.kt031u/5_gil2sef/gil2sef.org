Why not?

While I'm less enthusiastic about Ron and Hermione, Ginny is written to be the perfect match for in the Books, almost perfect. She's exactly what canon Harry wants and respects: a hot, fun, and strong Quidditch girl. On top of that, she's fanatically and unconditionally loyal to him:

- As a 14 years old, she got him into Umbridge's office and never raised a single objection over the entire (foolhardy) undertaking. Hermione didn't want Harry to go at first.
- After this brush of death (or worse) with some of Britain's most murderous and sadistic serial killers, she didn't hesitate to risk herself again and again. Hermione and Luna matched her courage here, but no other girls in the Books come even close to this feat.
- Never raised an issue with Harry using the HBP book, after verifying it's not another Diary. Hermione is pissed at Harry for almost entire school year.
- After Harry sectumsempraed Draco, Hermione was gloating with righteousness, while she fiercely defended him.
- When the Trio went Horcrux hunting, she attempted to steal the Gryffindor Sword from Snape. When that failed, she, Luna, and Neville restarted the DA, fully knowing that their actions would get them tortured or worse. Luckily for them, Snape was on their side.

Based on canon depictions, my shipping preference for Harry is obviously Ginny > Luna > Hermione. But they are all great girls
