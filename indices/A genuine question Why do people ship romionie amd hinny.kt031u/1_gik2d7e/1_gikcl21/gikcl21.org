Agreed on the difference between book Ginny and movie Ginny. Unfortunately, movie Ginny was badly miscast, and Bonnie Wright just couldn't pull off the fun, fiery Ginny from the books. She was far too posh (her accent didn't match the rest of the family at all), far too serious, and had no chemistry with Daniel Radcliffe (who I don't think made a good Harry, but that's beside the point).
