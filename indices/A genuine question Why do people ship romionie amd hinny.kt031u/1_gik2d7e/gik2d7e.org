I do go with most canon but regardless, Harry/Ginny IMO just seem perfect for each other. Ginny is into Quidditch, has common experiences, is fun and extrovert compared to his introvertion. She doesn't let him overcomplicate emotions. There's definitely a spark there. Romanticc dynamics with someone like Hermione in the other hand seem boring by comparison. Personally I don't think I have seen Hinny haters saying that Ginny doesn't work for Harry, because she totally does. The problem with Hinny, and what most people complain about, is that Ginny changed as a character overnight and off screen in order to be the perfect match for Harry. Not that she is not a perfect couple to Harry's canon personality.

About Ron and Hermione I could go on for a while as well. But I'll just limit to say that the spark is there, we all see it. There's chemistry. And to those saying it's a school thing and can't be something stable, I say my wife and I have a pretty similar dynamic and have been married for almost 10 years now.
