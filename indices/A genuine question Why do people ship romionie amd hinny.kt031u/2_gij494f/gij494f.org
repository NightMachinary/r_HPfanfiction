Considering that they're canon ships, it's not surprising. Even JK Rowling has admitted that Ron/Hermione doesn't make sense (at least I think she has), but as long as you don't conflate movie Ginny with book Ginny I can see the appeal of Harry/Ginny. She's a great character in the book, and while she could have used a lot more development (and Harry's attraction to her really came out of nowhere) I've seen fics that really make them work. Ginny is a character who's developed enough canonically to have a distinct personality, but minor enough that authors have room to put their own spin on her personality without her seeming too out of character.
