To me, Romione is cute. They have such a strange relationship because most of it looks like arguing but I think that's what fuels them and keeps them on their toes (I'm sure in the future they learn where to draw the line in their arguments). Despite this, it's actually one of my least favourite pairings just because I think there are other people Hermione would have been way better off with.

I shipped Hinny before I knew what shipping was because Harry and Ginny being together just made me so happy. I guess because I love Ginnys character so much so I like her with Harry. It's cute to me how they grew up together and Ginny had a huge crush on him half her life. I do think JKR could have developed it better because their relationship was very sudden.

Overall, I think these two being canon ships are the reason why I would still ship them? I've seen it happen and I don't hate them, I'm just like “okay I'll take it” and these ships have aspects that make them appealing/cute. (That being said, I think there are still other pairings that would have been stronger but that's what fanfiction is for I guess).
