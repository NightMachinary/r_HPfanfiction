Ron and hermione both have dominating characteristics that cause them to argue more often than not. They believe in different things. I also believe that Ron dampens Hermiones enthusiasm also he always says mean stuff to her

With hinny the movie versions was very bad. It showed a stalker/obsessed Ginny and the relationship came so sudden that it was unnatural and therefore people suggest that funny used love potions With hinny books, I love the way ginny was written but because they made her so dominating I feel as if he would rile Harry up or crush his opinion
