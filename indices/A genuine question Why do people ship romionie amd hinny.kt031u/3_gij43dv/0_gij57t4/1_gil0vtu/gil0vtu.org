Don't agree with this assessment of Romione. Ron is a young boy who has always lived in the shadow of his siblings. He has to develop self confidence. He likes Hermione and it's pretty obvious, even to Hermione, but he's a teenager boy and talks before he thinks and that's when he says the mean stuff. He's jealous of Victor Krum (and probably feels a little betrayed that his hero got his girl). Then this chick Lavender comes along and snogs him and it's the greatest thing ever and Hermione doesn't seem interested, so why not keep it up with Lavender. Both Hermione and Ron had to come to that point where they realized that they liked and respected each other and were willing to admit it - that's terrifying as a teenager.

Ron is intelligent, no matter what people say. He's a brilliant strategist. He is amazed by Hermione's intelligence. He probably thinks she's far too wonderful for him.

Hermione is a muggle at a magical school who just found out that magic exists. She's homely with buckteeth and probably never had a boy take a second glance at her. On top of that, she's crazy smart, and that intimidates boys (I know this because boys said it to me all the time as a teenager). She's a foreigner in a new world trying to get her footing. Ron saves her from a troll. He's funny. He's secretly brilliant. He's a quidditch star. Hermione sees her friend grow into a man and realized she fancies him but he's off snogging Lavender and then later when it gets really shitty, he leaves. But he comes back. He figures out how to break into an impenetrable bank and steal a horcrux and gets them moving again. In a sense, he comes back and gives them new life and hope. He admits he was wrong. He admits he loves her. It's a love story for the ages.

This doesn't mean that I don't think Hermione and Harry were suited for each other, too, just that Harry obviously saw what was happening between his two best friends and stepped out of the way. And book Ginny challenged him and was loyal and beautiful and had grit and moxie. She was the hot athlete girl. So book Ginny I approve of. Movie Ginny was too watered down. They made her one dimensional. Movie Harry and Movie Ginny weren't suited to each other. But the book versions were.
