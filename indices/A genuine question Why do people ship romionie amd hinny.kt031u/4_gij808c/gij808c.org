I'm someone who likes canon compliancy and like the dynamics of both ships ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è For me, Harry and Ginny have a really nice relationship with complementary characteristics that I wish there was more of in the books so fanfic can develop that further. Ron and Hermione - look, I can see why some people don't like them, especially people that are particularly averse to bickering. I think they would both need a lot of growth as people but I think that's ok and fun to read and write too.

I'm not opposed to non-canon ships and can usually see the arguments for them, they just don't capture my attention in the same way.
