The following are stories that I've let my eleven-year-old son read; none of them sexualizes children or contains much violence (no more so than canon).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] by blutaiger - Calvin is eighteen and living in England with his folks. Now, he's faced with the task of telling Susie what he's been doing for the past seven years. Novel-length, complete, a Calvin and Hobbes/Harry Potter crossover suitable for readers of that age range.

The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexander Quick]] series by Inverarity - The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why? Five exceptional, complete novels. Added bonus for a female reader: the protagonist of the series is a girl.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] by sib - Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. A complete, novel-length story that's basically a 6th year replacement.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins][Harry and the Hobgoblins]] by respitechristopher - Harry discovers things far more dangerous and cunning than even the traitorous Sirius Black. One-shot, Harry/Luna, complete.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] by nonjon - Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar. Novel-length, complete, and hilarious (especially if she likes science fiction and Firefly/Serenity).
