In linkffn(Harry Tano by TheBeardedOne), Umbridge decides not to go through animagus training because her form is a toad. She considers the potion to have failed because obviously, a toad is inappropriate for someone as good-looking as she.

I remember another story in which there's a short conversation in which a female student explains that she's not going through training after discovering her form, but I don't remember what it was.
