I've got an OC that I've tried (and failed) to write a story about who has a cuttlefish animagus form. It fits, given his personality (self-image issues, feels like an alien in human skin) and talents (the mind arts), seeing as cephalopods are the closest things we have to aliens on earth and cuttlefish specifically can hunt by hypnotizing crabs with their flashing colors. Practically, it would be a useless form (unless he fell off a boat), but I think it would be kind of adorable anyway.
