There's a story that I have a copy of, it's called 'A Fairy Tale Ending' that is absolutely beautiful. The basic premise is that during the final battle with Voldemort as Harry defeats the Dark Lord, Fawkes comes and saves Harry just as Harry is struck with a Killing Curse. Fawkes turns into ashes and Harry is found in them, a baby, just like Fawkes reverts to a chick when he dies. It's a very good story, but I can't seem to find it on Fanfiction.net (I'm pretty sure I got it from there), all I have left is an old .txt file of it.

edit: it was on Pheonixsong.net: [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/1783/]]
