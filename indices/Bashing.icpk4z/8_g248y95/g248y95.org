Depends on the writing. If they make it plausible I can enjoy anyone getting bashed even hermione anfthe twins who deserve it the least imo. But just cranking Ron's laziness and jealousy to 11 or taking molly's one off line about a love potion and making her some diabolical potion queen is just irritating. Best version I've seen of molly bashing was in linkffn(watching over harry) where it was because of a prewitt family grudge against the potters. Better than big happy weasley family via potions I see most of the time
