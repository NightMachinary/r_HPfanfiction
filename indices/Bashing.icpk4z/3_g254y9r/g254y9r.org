I've made fun of Draco and Lucius before, I even made Hermione beat up Draco so bad that he might've died in real life, but I don't like bashing if there is no reason for it.

It can be a good thing if it makes sense. I would never write even a subplot for bashing someone if it doesn't give anything to the plot, but after that, I'd call it a plot device instead of bashing.
