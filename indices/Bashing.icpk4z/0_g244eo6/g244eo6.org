I'm not really a fan of bashing, however it is quite funny seeing the lengths that some authors go to make Dumbledore look bad.

“Harry m'boy, have a potion laced lemon^{TM} drop^{TM} while I lead you to your death for the greater^{TM} good^{TM”} Dumb-as-door told him, while probing his mind, limiting his magic with one hand, and paying off Ron to be Harry's friend with the other.
