That's a new one. Craziest one I can remember is Voldemort was good all along, operating under Dumbledore's imperius curse. Voldy was sent to kill the Potters, but when he pointed his wand at the baby, he couldn't do it and broke the curse. Dumbledore had to step in himself and AK Harry, creating an accidental horcrux for himself.
