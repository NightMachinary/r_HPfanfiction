That's an interesting theory. I always thought Neville's boggart might reflect his fear of what happened to his parents. I mean, I doubt Neville knew what Death Eaters like Bellatrix looked like, and Snape was rumored to be a Death Eater, so I thought it possible his subconscious drew a connection there. Either way, I like the idea of the Snape-boggart being a totem for a deeper issue in Neville's life, like with Hermione's boggart!
