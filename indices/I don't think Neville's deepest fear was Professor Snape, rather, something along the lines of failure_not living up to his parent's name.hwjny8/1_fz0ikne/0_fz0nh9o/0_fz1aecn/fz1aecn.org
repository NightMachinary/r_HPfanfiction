I reread what you had said and i see what you mean now! you just mean why he chose to name Snape as his worst fear when Lupin asked, right?

i think its a mix of your 3rd point (he panicked) and the fact that he knows snape makes him miserable, but maybe he doesnt know /exactly/ why. Although he might, he does seem to be the introspective type!
