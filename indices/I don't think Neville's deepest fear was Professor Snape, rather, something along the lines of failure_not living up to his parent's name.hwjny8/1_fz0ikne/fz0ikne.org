I get what you mean, but just saying something is your worst fear doesnt mean it actually is. I don't think you can trick a boggart, or theyd be way easier to deal with.

I think you're on the right track though - - i think Neville's worst fear could be one of two things:

1. He is afraid he isn't a good enough wizard/isn't magical enough. This manifests as the teacher who makes him feel this inferiority the most.

2. He is afraid of death eaters because of what happened to his parents, and he knows Snape was a death eater (the trials would have been highly public). Perhaps his grandmother didnt let him see much about his parents' torture so he's never seen a photo of Bellatrix or Barty Jr, so his brain substitutes Snape in as the only death eater he has seen.

Personally I think its the first one, but who knows!
