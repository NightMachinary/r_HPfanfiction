  As far as the moon and Remus is concerned, Remus is obviously not thrilled about being a werewolf, but that doesn't somehow eliminate the possibility that thing he fears the most is the transformation process and that only gets triggered by the full moon.

I've always interpreted it as Remus hates being a werewolf, is always trying to fight the transformation every full moon (with the stresses of doing so causing him to prematurely age), and fears above all else the kind of damage he could potentially inflict while transformed.
