I've seen this argument before because Harry, Remus, and Hermione's were symbolic, and it's not at all impossible that Neville's was, too, but I don't really think so. If it was all about criticism or failure, it would be his grandmother. There's really no way to twist what Augusta and Longbottoms do and say to Neville while also keeping Neville's mind based in reality. I think there's even a line in OotP where Neville says his grandmother says he could be more like Harry.

I really just think Neville was scared of Snape. He'd just turned 13 and Snape often made him cry.

Edit: "Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse." - PoA narration
