The source material (the books) are written from Harry's perspective. Just because something isn't addressed in depth, or is shown from Harry's point of view and thinking, doesn't mean he cant be wrong or oblivious to some things. Harry can't read Neville's mind, and just because a 13 year old boy says something about what scares them doesnt mean they are telling the truth, or even that they fully understand it themselves... preteens aren't always the beat at sorting out emotions.

So saying that Harry's understanding of Neville's boggart is the ultimate true explanation is ridiculous.
