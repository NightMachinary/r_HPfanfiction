Yep. It's certainly a bit weird, but it fits the criteria. (1)Harry learns magic before going to Hogwarts based on, among other things, Doctor Strange comics. (2) Harry isn't in any romantic relationships, and neither is Hermione, so that means there's no H/multi, H/harem, H/GiW, or SS/HG. (3) The author has stopped posting chapters in it and posted a sequel, meaning this fic is complete.
