Are you familiar with the Václav Havel's verison of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beggar's_Opera][The Beggar's Opera]]? The logic of “if I won't do the evil thing, somebody else will and he'll be worse than me” is something very familiar to us who grew up beyond the Iron Curtain. The answer is obviously the one from the Lord of the Ring “Do not touch it, Frodo!”: if you do it, you are becoming to be them, and in the end you end up as Nazgûl.
