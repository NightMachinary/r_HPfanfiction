I'm not sure about the "powerful" bit. There are wizards and witches out there who seem to have a knack for magic and can wield it to baffling effects. But they all worked for it, very hard. Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort were all scholars and experts in the various fields of magic.

Maybe, and of course I'm only speculating, it's less about "magic power level" but the resilience and power, if you want, of the soul. Credence developing an Obscurus speaks for a horrible life. Maybe the simple fact that he could stomach that life, persevere through it without the Obscurus devouring him, is the power Grindelwald seeks.
