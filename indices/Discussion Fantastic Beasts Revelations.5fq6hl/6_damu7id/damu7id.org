The wandless magic is explained in the American magic lore. Wands were an invention of the magical community in Europe. The American schools teach magic mostly wandlessly.

I believe the information is from here: [[https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en]]

  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one.

The wandless vs wand magic has nothing to do with movie vs book, thankfully, it is just a cultural difference.
