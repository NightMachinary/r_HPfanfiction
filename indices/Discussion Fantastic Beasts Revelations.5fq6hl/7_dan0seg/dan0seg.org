You can apparate in mid-air, as shown when Newt jumped off the building and apparating mid-air. I believe that Graves (Grindelves?) also did this at some point.

We also saw that electricity can be conjured with magic, as well as channeled back through your wand multiple times. This was a very interesting revelation, as I was always under the impression that it never appeared in canon because Electricity and Magic don't mix well.
