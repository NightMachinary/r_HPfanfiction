WoW, You went trough the trouble at looking up all of that? That's dedication. Anyhow, I was guestimating there based on the armour that Newt gave Jacob. While we never heard what it was made of and what it was enchanted with, I'd believe it would make Jacob's protected regions at least 4 times as durable. Don't ask me why 4 times, it's just a number that sort of make sense to me.
