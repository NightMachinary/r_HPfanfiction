I haven't seen Fantastic Beasts so I can't really weigh in much here, except a bit on your last point.

  Magicals are not as squishy as non-magicals. Again, makes sense. But I have to wonder. Why would harry falling a hundred feet be so damaging then? Or is it something magical that happens ones he's a legal adult?

From what I've found on the internet, a fall of 20ft is going to have some pretty serious injuries, and this is assuming you don't land on your head.

55ft and you're just fucked.

[[http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8106/how-far-would-you-need-to-fall-for-it-to-be-fatal][All this comes from here]]

So, even if magicals are literally /twice/ as durable as a normal human, a 100ft fall is still a life threatening thing. Three times as durable, and a 100ft fall is still a big deal. Four times, and a 100ft fall is less of an issue, but still possible fatal if you land head first. Even if you don't land head first you're not walking away after.

Though like I said, I don't have full context here and may very well be wrong.
