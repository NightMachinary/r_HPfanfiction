Yeah I'm aware of friction, I know about the "hard limit to the speed you can attain when freefalling in atmosphere."

I think the term you're wanting is "terminal velocity".

But terminal velocity of a person is /way/ more than needed to kill them on impact.

I'm not entirely sure how friction is relevant here, but okay.
