The whole "not getting tired" thing is once again debateable. As most of the spells we saw in the movie, had to have been used multiple times by the people using them. Newt used Summoning Charms, an Unlocking Charm, etc... it is likely that he has always had to use those spells. Grindelwald is a Dark Lord, so obviously, the extensive use of magic for a normal wizard, would be nothing to him. In fact, he was the only one throwing around cars in the movie. We did see, that magic can overwhelm the body however, as Credence became unstable, and was essentially being ripped apart at the seems.
