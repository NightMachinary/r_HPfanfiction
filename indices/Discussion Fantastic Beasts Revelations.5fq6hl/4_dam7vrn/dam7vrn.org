It's always been the case that some wizards are described (and seen to be) as more powerful than others. The essential issue of dispute in the fantom has always been the factors that determine that power level, and the extent to which it can change in response to experiences. Essentially nature vs. nurture. I don't think FB has changed anything on that front.

Also notable is that once again we had no sign of wizards running out of magic or getting tired out from its heavy use.
