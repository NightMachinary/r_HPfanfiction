Try "The Python Defense" by canoncansodoff. [[https://fanfiction.net/s/4707140/1/The-Python-Defense]]

Good read but regrettably it was abandoned. Basically Harry uses Monty Python as his inspiration for a mindscape.

"Death's Doorbell" by Paladeus [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=660]]

Basically Harry/Hermione/Luna and Tonks play Knock, Knock, Ginger against Voldemort

"Harry Potter and the Power of Axe" by TheSilverboar [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8994074/1/]]

One-shot - the power Voldemort knows not is axe deodorant
