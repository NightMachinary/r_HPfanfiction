Almost all of the crack/crackish stories I know of are light-hearted one-shots. Perhaps my definition of crack isn't loose enough.

linkffn(And Seven Times Never Kill Man by Marcus Rowland). Cross with Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

linkffn(Community Service by Balthanon). Dumbledore takes advantage of the curse on the defense position.

linkffn(All Full of that Wizard Angst by CalamityJim). In the forest, Voldemort explains the source of magic to Harry.

linkffn(Hiding in Plain Sight by Clell65619). Harry defeats Voldemort; finds a way to hide from his fame.

linkffn(Excuses for Snape by dogbertcarroll). Acting skills and character growth are unnecessary.

linkffn(Constant Vigilance by Kevin3). Auror training under Moody.

linkffn(The Easy Way by Kolarthecool). This is the first oneI've listed that I think really deconstructs some wizard logic.

linkffn(So, Why a Train? by Lucillia). Why do students have to travel on the Hogwarts Express?

linkffn(Honestly, Harry by AvalonianDream). Harry and Hermione explore the limits of certain spells.
