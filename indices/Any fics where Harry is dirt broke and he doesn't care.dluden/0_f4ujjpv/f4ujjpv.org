I was thinking of doing a story where Harry doesn't go home to the Dursley's after first year. Once he discovers magic, he's just like... what's the point? So he sort of becomes homeless and meets a community of "Underground" magical peoples who... well, mostly live in the Underground / Tube tunnels. Children of hags, werewolves, squibs, mostly people who didn't go to Hogwarts or otherwise aren't respected by the ministry. Lots of muggleborns whose parents rejected magic or don't connect with their family anymore. He can practice magic during the summers and learns a lot of other useful stuff.

I haven't put too much thought into it, yet, but I might pick it up as a potential NaNoWriMo project.
