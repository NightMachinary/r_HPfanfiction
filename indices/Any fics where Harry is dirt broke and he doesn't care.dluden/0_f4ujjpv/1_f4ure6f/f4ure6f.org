There's linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) about a Harry who gets abandoned at 6 years old in a park and decides he's better off homeless, discovers he has some magic and decides too that he must be an elf.

I really enjoyed the story. linkffn(8197451) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them]]
