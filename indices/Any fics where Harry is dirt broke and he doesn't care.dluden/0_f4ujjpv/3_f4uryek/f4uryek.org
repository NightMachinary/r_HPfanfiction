This sounds fun! I would definitely read it! I have a similar fic to this, but mine is a fem!Harry who disappeared from the Dursleys just before she turned 11 and didn't go to Hogwarts at all, lived her teen years in the streets and now just enjoys the simple pleasures in life without caring for magic. Meanwhile, the wizarding world fights its war and tries to protect Violet (after finding her when she is already 18) who's just like 'leave me alone'.
