[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] has a Harry who was raised by enemies to friends to lovers Remus/Severus, and doesn't care about money or wands and just wants to go home. That's the least of the story, but he's definitely the kind of character you're looking for.

There's also linkao3(firepower by lucy_blue) where he's a squib on the run with Sirius and Remus. Ship-free gen fic.
