In my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179), Dragon!Harry accidentally causes a goblin rebellion when he tries to go to the bank while disguised as a human, so not only does he currently not have access to his money, but most wizards don't - including Hogwarts, which is struggling to feed a beast of his size. He's literally resorted to trying to sell his own scales (which are made of mithril) to make back the money he's cost Hogwarts.

He's definitely /poor/ at the moment, though not exactly humble or happy about it.
