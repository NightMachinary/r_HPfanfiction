Harry is not the best character to use for such story. You go massively AU and it is not fun. I have been more eagerly waiting on somebody to fulfill the plot bunny of linkffn(12278819) ... think Oliver Twist meets HP universe. Modesty self-taught witch (or taught by her Great Teacher ... hmm, who doesn't help her out of her poverty? no idea why) as part of (or leading) street gang of kids on streets of New York. It is just a setup (not a plot, I have no idea about the plot), but I would love somebody to write this.
