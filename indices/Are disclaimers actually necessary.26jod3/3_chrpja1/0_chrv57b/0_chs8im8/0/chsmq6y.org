I like using a complete boilerplate for each chapter in part because it helps identify my work when bots scrape and "steal" it from FFN to repost in weird places.

I don't care so much about the copyright issues, for /obvious/ reasons. But I think if someone randomly runs into a floating chapter somewhere, it will make it easier for that reader to track my work down if they have pen name and full title in the chapter text.

I also do the chapter template thing for consistency. Playing the "is that a <br> or a <p> new line?" game every chapter destroys creative flow and editing focus instantly.
