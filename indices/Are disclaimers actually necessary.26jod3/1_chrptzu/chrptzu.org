Back in the bad old days, it was basically a requirement to post on some of the older websites. JKR's lawyers were raging beasts and it was a voodoo charm to hold off the madness. Most sites of the time required it as part of their terms of service for posting, to try to avoid getting C&D letters.

As for a legal requirement nowadays? You can get sued for anything, but I understand it as not being a required ass covering measure unless you were doing something for money or that could have been confused for JKR's work. Like maybe if you were posting on a personal website and had paid ads on it, but that gets really obscure and I am not a lawyer. So you'd need to ask one about that.

You don't need disclaimers to post on FFN or AO3, but basically everywhere else that hosts fics still wants you to do it. I actually bounced off a few sites that wanted full disclaimers for /all/ real world copyrighted and trademarked mentions in the fic.

Like, for example, I mentioned the Terminator movies, and they wanted a full fucking IMDB note that I didn't own that copyright and who did.

/Yeah/, I didn't choose to continue trying to post with those bumbling idiots.
