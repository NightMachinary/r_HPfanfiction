The point of the house system, or at least its intention, is to create a place of familiarity at Hogwarts. You're supposed to get to know the people in your house, befriend them, rely on them, and be comfortable with one another. This would be moot if they were swapped around every year. And it would be super awkward getting to know a new set of roommates every year.
