I have a few, but there is one in particular I really regret never publishing.

Its called /Brushstroke/. A one shot about a small silent magical portrait of a little girl that falls out of its frame and is found by Voldemort, who picks it up and keeps it. It frames the interactions of the portrait and Voldemort with the Second Wizarding War as a backdrop.

I didn't publish it because I thought it was too dark and didn't match with the usual half-humorous style of stories that I publish on FFN.
