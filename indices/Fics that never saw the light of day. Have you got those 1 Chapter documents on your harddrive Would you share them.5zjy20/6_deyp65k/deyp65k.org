I have a lot of plot outlines I've not been confident enough - or skilled enough - to turn into full fledged stories. There is one though... one that I started writing for... it was... less than satisfactory and I buggered off to start plotting Sailor Moon FanFiction again. I don't think my Snek agrees though, forgive me - Snake.
