I have the first two chapters of a fanfic that I wrote when I was twelve. Needless to say, the quality is more than slightly doubtful. So we'll just sweep that under the rug hahaaa.

I do also have the first chapter of an idea I got from the Spacebattles forums. The summer before GoF, Ron gets obsessed with the idea of wizards in spaaaaaace (courtesy of some muggle picture books Hermione showed him), and decides to build a rocket. He drags along an enthusiastic Hermione, and a less-than-happy Harry who just can't see the point of building these Merlin-damned contraptions of doom.

All of this rocket-building would eventually butterfly into defeating Voldemort, although I never drafted the specifics of that out OTL

Here's a link to the folder with the brainstorming scribbles and the first chapter: [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B35G2ug44jLmTWQ0NmF5b0tQODA]]
