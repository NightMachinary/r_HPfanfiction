I have the first two chapters of Espionage (sequel to Aurors) written. I'm yet to decide whether to upload/continue writing. As of yet, I'm not ready to share them.

I also have a word doc with a nearly finished one shot a out Harry losing his temper with toddler Teddy and briefly shutting him in a cupboard. I would probably share that if people were interested in helping me make edits and such, but otherwise I think it will probably stay on my computer as a character exercise.
