A little late to the party but here's something I wrote awhile ago (the direction I was going in was for a beast master/CoMC fanfic:

There is an unrecorded, undocumented, but subconsciously observed fact in life; magic attracts more magic. This continuous occurrence often applies itself to reality in varying peculiar ways. The arrival of four magic user in northern Scotland who applied great magics invariably compelled a nearby forest to fill with magical creatures. In 382 BCE a family of wandmakers settled in Brittania during the Roman occupation, they built a shop in a walled marsh lands village ruled by King Belin along the rivers Thames and Walbrook, later known to be named London. Their humble shop become the center point of wizardry commerce in the area, which spanned the great market of Diagon Alley. And in a quiet mundane village of Little Whinging, Surrey a singular spark of magic would soon create it's own history.

The year was 1988, the season of summer and one Harry Potter had just finished with Year 3. He was tending the garden; a generally unpleasant chore when the hot sun beats down on you, but he had little choice in the matter. He wasn't allowed in the house during much of the day, and while more comfortable he might have been, he'd much rather be away from his family, the Dursleys. The Dursleys consisted of his giraffe-horse hybrid of an aunt, a walrus of an uncle and a piglet of a cousin, a twisted menagerie both irksome and cantankerous. Harry was nothing like them, and he was okay with that. He was a muted, unassuming boy of 8, with pickled-toad green eyes and hair the color of the blackboards at school.

Peculiar things happened to him while he had tended to the garden over his brief years. He dare not share these secrets with his family. Their utter abhorrence for anything not normal was burned into his memory; not hard to remember when he was the primary cause most days. The first bout of the supernatural for Harry was when he happened upon a common garter snake while planting some flowers. It had slithered from underneath the shed muttering to itself about crickets and mice. Harry had tried to hold a conversation with it, but after the initial surprise of having met a human speaker, it grew bored and irritated that it had been held up from it's hunt. Harry had met other snakes after that, they all tended to be grumpy and singular in their thoughts though.
