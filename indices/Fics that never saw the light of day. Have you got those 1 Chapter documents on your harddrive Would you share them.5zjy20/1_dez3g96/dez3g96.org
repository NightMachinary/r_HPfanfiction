I have a bunch, and the more that I review them, the more I want to share them.

Try this one, for instance:

Tonksworthy

Summary: Harry obsesses over Tonks from the moment they meet, trying to learn more about her. Somehow, he plans to become Tonks-worthy.

Outline: They meet as per canon; she's flirty and fun and extroverted and magical, and this in Harry's mind becomes the essence of what he wants out of life.

He stalks her at Grimmauld. He pines after her while at school, until he can't stand it anymore and sneaks back to HQ to find out what she's been doing. He catches sight of her flirting with Lupin and starts plotting to drive them apart.

He follows her on her next Order assignment, interceding when she's about to be ambushed and escaping undetected. Later he dreams about revealing to her that he saved her and her gratitude turns into sex. After the fantasy, he bemoans his vulgar nature and doubts she would see him as anything but a disgusting groupie. Sirius picks up on his obsession, treating it like a crush but also encouraging his hijinks, because he thinks Harry needs a good caper and hopefully a roll in the sack to help him grow into a proper Marauder.

The caper leads to Harry discovering Tonks having sex with a fellow Auror. And later with a girl working in Diagon Alley. And again, while in disguise on assignment to extract info from a source. He retreats to Grimmauld to wrestle with his mix of disgust and self-deception.

Tonks bumps into him there and attempts to cheer him out of his melancholy. He kisses her. She shuts him down, suggesting that he date kids his own age for a while. Harry says something rude about not needing to bed so many before finding what he truly wants.

She coolly states that he's proved her point on the maturity thing, then walks away.

Sirius tries to console him but dismisses Harry's feelings.

Hermione corners him as he's stewing and asks the important question: "Okay, so you think she'd be perfect for you. Are you perfect for her?"

"What?"

"What does Tonks want or need? What do you offer? Why would Tonks benefit from involving herself with you?"

Harry turns the question around on her [this may become a rundown of Hermione's legitimate canon affection for Ron].

Hermione's confrontation is a splash of cold water. At the end of the discussion, Harry kisses Hermione in thanks. She kisses him back. They have almost-sex.

Tonks catches them afterwards and after Hermione runs off, she confronts Harry on his obsession. They talk, they argue, Harry explains the whole litany of why he desires her and how Hermione has shocked him out of his foolishness. Tonks explains that she knew he was there all along, but didn't know why Harry was so keen for her.

She offers to train him, but only if he won't take it as more than what it is. In a rare bout of maturity, he begs off.

Flash forward through the canon, though with minor variances.

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry goes to Andromeda Tonks to personally inform her of the death of her daughter and son-in-law, only to find Tonks there, recovering from a bonk on the head. Andromeda left a note, saying that the oft-neglected art of Divination indicated that only one daughter and son from the middle line would survive the war, and that she'd rather give Nymphadora a chance to live a life than have to grieve another loss in her family. She implores Dora to take care of herself and Teddy, equally.

Harry helps her grieve. He offers any help. Tonks realises that her world has been upturned (as it is with so many other survivors of this war). She considers returning to work under Kingsley, who would be quite grateful to have a well-trained and loyal Auror still alive to back him up.

Harry visits Tonks and Teddy again. Over drinks, he tells the story of his misadventures and frustrations with the process of fulfilling destiny. She loudly sympathises with his plight over every betrayal, every shock, every disastrous plan. He tells her that he's a little unspooled now because he really was expecting to die. He doesn't know what he wants anymore.

After such a long, emotional conversation, Tonks invites Harry to sleep off the liquor there. Just sleep.

Ginny blows up at him the next day over it.

He comes back to complain. Tonks explains that girls like to be cared for sometimes, and finding that a beloved safety blanket is missing when it was needed can feel like quite the betrayal. She explains that she has her own checklist of desired virtues and acceptable flaws. It has grown from the relationships she's had- keeping the traits that attracted her to one or another lover and marking the flaws that truly spelled doom for the relationship long-term. Sometimes they're the same thing. Lupin hit most of the features [particularly his werewolf stamina] and had few, though extreme, flaws that she could accept, and she was so happy to have him for as brief a time as they had. Really, she should have expected him to self-destruct eventually. He wanted to be the man even though he was most obviously the woman in their relationship.

They verbally compare checklists from before the Battle. Tonks says, "If you want to settle in and build a family and feel like a pillar of society, doing what you feel you must for the sake of everyone, then you should go back to Ginny and do that. Other girls might fit as well, but she is strong-willed and outgoing and sexy and has a large family whose entire membership already loves you. Your checklist is looking pretty full with her."

[perhaps a brief comparison of the flaws and merits of Ginny versus Hermione]

"Or?"

"Or... if you're willing to brave the unknown with a loving companion to lead you on adventures across the globe, you should track down that interesting blonde girl who followed you into the Department of Mysteries, and hitch your wagon to her star."

Luna. He hadn't even considered her. Harry envisions a life of chasing her through jungles and ancient temples across the globe. There is an appeal.

He goes off to ponder this. The one thing that trips him up about Luna is how innocent she still seems. Asexual, even. It's a fatal flaw for his checklist.

He considers other girls- Katie, Cho, Gabrielle, Parvati, Padma... and he asks himself why he wants a permanent girl at all. What's the rush?

Because I'm still a target. I'll always be famous. I want love, and the further I get from the people I already trust, the less likely I'll find someone who can handle being part of my life. At least here in Britain, though that probably applies to most of Western Europe. A muggle girl? She'd be a victim before she knew she was a target. I have a feeling that my allies will want veto powers over my partners...

He comes back and asks her, "Now that you've had a chance to consider your time with Remus, what does your checklist look like?"

"I'm not looking, Harry. I've got enough to handle already with little Teddy. Wouldn't want to spoil the romance with infant detonations and sudden bouts of accidental magic."

"Do me a favour."

"Anything."

"Look up."

She did. She stared at him, mentally calculating all that she would want and hope for.

He did, too. "I want a family. I also want adventures. I want fun. I don't want to 'serve the community' anymore, not as my life's purpose. Not now, at any rate."

"Ah."

"So, would you like to come with me to France?"

"What?"

"I want to go look for the Flamels. They've left their place in Devonshire but I don't think that they're actually dead, yet. If anyone could help me get perspective on Dumbledore's life, it would be them."

"Okay, yeah, but why me?"

"Because, I'm going to need your investigative skills to actually find them. I also believe that, unlike a few years ago, we'd be good for each other. And I love you."

Teddy spat his breakfast onto her chest. They both broke out laughing.

"And I love Teddy," Harry said. He drew his wand and cast a silent Tergeo to erase the mess, then handed her a damp dishcloth to wipe Teddy's face clean.

"Aren't you still a bit squicked out about my past lovers?"

"Oh, I have a plan for that. I'm going to make sure we have sex together more times than all your previous lovers... combined."

"Hah! Ambitious, aren't you?"

"And then we'll move on to Belgium. And do it again."
