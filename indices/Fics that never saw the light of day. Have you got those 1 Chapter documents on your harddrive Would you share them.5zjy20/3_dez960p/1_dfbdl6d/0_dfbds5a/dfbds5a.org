That's actually partially a point of the story: the Industrial revolution didn't happen until the late 19th century, and even as the 21st century approaches mass production and factories are still new concepts. This is at least partially because I want Voldemort to be leading a faction of wizards who believe that the muggles are gaining too much power, and that their dangerous new methods will plunge the world into chaos. Meanwhile, the muggles are bucking for more rights and privileges as they become increasingly important to a modern economy. Hermione and her friends would find themselves caught in the middle of this struggle, trying to form alliances and a power base in the shifting political landscape.

Also, Dumbledore would be a lot smarter and just the Headmaster of Hogwarts (although a decorated war hero).
