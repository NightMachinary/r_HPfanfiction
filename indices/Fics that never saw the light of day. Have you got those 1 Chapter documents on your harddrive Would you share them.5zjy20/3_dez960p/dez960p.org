After reading a whole lot of half baked "Lord Potter" stories, I sat down and thought about what it would be like if the Harry Potter universe really WAS ruled by magical nobility. As in Britain was still a monarchy with a powerful aristocracy composed entirely of ancient magical families and the muggles were more or less second class citizens (but entirely aware of it). Harry would be an actual Lord, the Weasleys would be a family that were once considered to be politically powerful, but lost their fortune because of a failure to invest in the new industrial revolution (think what happened to a lot of landed nobility when farming quit being the main source of wealth in Britain). The main POV character would be Hermione though. As a muggleborn, she would be a true outsider. However, unlike in cannon, she is entirely aware of her status, and seeks to better herself by not just becoming a powerful witch, but marrying into a magically powerful family so that she can take care of her parents by gaining wealth and status.
