I have a couple of chapters of a story called Bring Them Back, set in the next-gen period that deals with human trafficking. It was very dark and I managed to disturb myself with it so much, that I put it on pause and haven't seriously looked back at it since.

Even if I go back to writing it, I doubt it would see the light of day.
