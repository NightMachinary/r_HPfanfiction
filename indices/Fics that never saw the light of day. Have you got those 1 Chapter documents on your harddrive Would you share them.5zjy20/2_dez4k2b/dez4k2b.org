I have one I have picked up, put down, scrapped and rewritten over and over since around 2005. At one point it was up on FFN as a WIP but it was (a) getting away from me and (b) awful. I've recently picked it back up but I have less time than I did 12 years ago to devote to it. I have a long prologue and a general arc but it needs bones before I can really start fleshing it out as a full fic. And jesus, it'll be long.

Nutshell: I wanted to explore the idea of Tom Riddle becoming the mentor he deserved, in nurturing Harry. I also wanted to explore Dumbledore's quite rigid outlook as a "everyone deserves second chances except Voldemort because if Voldemort can change then it means Gellert could have but I wasn't good enough, therefore Voldemort must be irredeemable". To do this in a canon compliant way required Riddle gaining some sanity and mental stability, and developing a reluctant mentor relationship with Harry. It's still a work in progress to make this as believable as possible. :/
