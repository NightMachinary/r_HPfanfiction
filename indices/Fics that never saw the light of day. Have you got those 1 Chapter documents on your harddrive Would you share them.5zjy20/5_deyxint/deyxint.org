I have one google doc that is just a plot bunny farm...I have two WIPs right now that I would like to finish, but here's a couple of the ideas I considered writing (and will hopefully write once I finish some of my other stuff!):

Purple Like Violets "Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge." A pureblood!Hermione fic

The Enigma of Thomas Gaunt "Lucius Malfoy has an agenda. Albus Dumbledore has a plot. Severus Snape has a secret. Lord Thomas Gaunt will stop at nothing to gain power. Nothing is as black and white as it seems. Gray!Dumbledore Gray!Snape Smart!Draco" Basically a politcal / scheming fic where nothing is as it seems. So far I only have the summary and opening sentence written... "Disturbing little was known about Thomas Gaunt."

Phoenix Tears "Post GoT. AU. The Dark Lord has returned. Dolores Jane Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor, will do anything in her power to stop him and the threat he poses to her Ministry ambitions. Even if it means turning school children into soldiers. BAMF!Umbridge, Powerful!Harry, Secretive!Hermione, and Mentor!Snape." A little bit of an Ender's Game vibe. A bit of Snape-mentors-Hermione.

idk if these are things people would actually want to read, but I'll probably end up writing them XD
