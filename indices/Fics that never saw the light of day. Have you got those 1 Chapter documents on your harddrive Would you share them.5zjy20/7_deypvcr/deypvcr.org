I don't know where I'd ever go with this fic. But there's not enough to link. Not even this is finished, there were going to be bits between Luna's sorting and Ginny's I never wrote. So here:

Knowledge Above All

The hat was enchanted to say anything to befriend the one beneath it and make them feel at home.

"Lovegood, Luna!" The tiny first year smiled faintly as she daintily wandered up to the stool. Somehow even managing to make the act of sitting down and donning the hat look distracted, she began swaying in her seat.

"Oh my, Miss Lovegood. You have a mind after Rowena herself." Luna grinned.

"Really?"

"Oh yes! Knowledge above all, Miss Lovegood. Why, the last child I met with a mind like yours was just about a century ago. A young lad, Jack. Poor child, lasted only a year here. Ah well. Perhaps, my dear, you'll have better luck than he did in RAVENCLAW!" Claps rose from the blue and bronze table, and Luna, with her distant smile, stood.

"Mr. Hat, what happened to Jack?" She asked.

"Spent his remaining days in Azkaban, if I remember correctly," the hat said before being removed.

Ginerva was sorted into Gryffinfor. That was . . . Unfortunate, though not unexpected. She was hardly an intellectual after all. Still, it would make monitoring her condition harder. She could try to enlist the help of a Gryffinfor, but that would run the risk of someone alerting a teacher, and she couldn't have that. No, she would have to just rework some things. It wouldn't be as precise but it was the best she could do in the situation she found herself in.
