Innocent -> Initate -> Identity

Has a friendly Draco that is part of the /'Golden Trio'/ but it doesn't happen until Initate when they finally get to hogwarts.

But i dare say that this may be the best friendly draco i have ever read as it's realistic. non-slash and non-ron bashing are always a plus
