Preface: I know that some of these have been widely read and have likely been read by most of the community, but I think for this book club to be successful some of the widely-read fics might need to be instituted to help get the book club a bit more off the ground.

Also just about any long fic by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] would likely also suffice, however they are all canon-compliant in their own little potter universes.

I really hope that this book club idea finally works. Its something that I would love to be a part of and a great way for our great community to come together.
