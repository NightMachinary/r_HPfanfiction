Here's one I find very rare.

Soul-bonds that are actually pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error Of Soul]]

#+begin_quote
  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

  If two people are deliberately created to be together, how will the challenges in a world of magic and Dark Lords be dealt with? What would it mean for two people to truly become one? A re-imagination of first year.

Hear me out on this one. Yes, the first two chapters are cliche filled and rather hard to take, I get that. Just get past them. While this fic is highly iterative of today's soul bond cliches, it does them all /really fucking well/. Hell, considering it's age, it wouldn't surprise me if the cliches are because of this fic and its sequel. It's probably the best soul bond story I've ever read, despite the issues.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

This is similar to Error Of Soul, instead with Ginny. It's a realistic view of what would happen if two twelve year-olds could suddenly hear almost every waking thought of the other. Really fun read.
