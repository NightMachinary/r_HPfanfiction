I could have sworn when I first read it that Tom Riddle and the SOW party had an emergency Wizengamot session on Halloween 1981, as the story's AU version of the climax of Voldemort. And they did, but that wasn't when the anti-muggleborn-at-Hogwarts legislation was passed. (See Ch. 12)

I don't know when the anti-muggleborn-at-Hogwarts took effect.

Lily didn't go to Hogwarts, instead she went to AIM. Kinda glosses over the fact that she married someone she only saw for 1 hour per year for 7 years... She went, presumably with Snape, to King's Cross earlier than needed for the AIM train.
