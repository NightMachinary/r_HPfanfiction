Quite liked reading this, but, as other people have pointed out, there's some pretty major problems. The plot is pretty well-structured and engaging- I was surprised that I didn't give up on this story very quickly because I usually dislike major canon divergence AUs, so the fact that it kept my interest anyways is a credit to the author- but the dialogue is really, really clunky, especially because just about every character (regardless of age) is written as Incredibly Formal And Eloquent. My biggest pet peeve, especially as the story went on, was how massively powerful Rigel/Harry was. I mean, the skill at potions is one thing, but consistently surprising every adult around her with her impossible talent is a bit much. One of the things I like the most about the way the original Harry Potter books handle the whole Chosen One thing is that Harry /isn't/ particularly better at magic than his peers, so it just didn't make much sense to me that this Harry has such extraordinary natural talent.

Probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone in particular, but it was a fun read despite the problems
