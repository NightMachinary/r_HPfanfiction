This isn't really my cup of tea.

That being said, the idea is interesting, as with a bit of tweaking it could almost be a magical "Gattaca" analog: where purebloods actually do have better magical talents (or something like that), and our half-blood hero tries to pass off as one despite everything.

Hell, maybe there could even be a similar goal or similar securities/suspicion on him for his duplicity, it could be a really cool drama.

If you've ever seen the movie, you'll know what I mean - and this would be a perfect setup for a Daphne Greengrass pairing, which is one of my favorites to read :)

Of course it'd have to be a bit more AU, as in canon JKR almost made it seem like purebloods were /weaker/ (which doesn't make too much sense), but what's the point in fanfiction if you don't change things around?
