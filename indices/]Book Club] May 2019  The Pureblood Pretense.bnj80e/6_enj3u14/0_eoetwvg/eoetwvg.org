These are mostly world building background details, so not really spoilers, but marking it as such anyway. But in this fic, the average muggleborn is magically weaker than the average pureblood, so sort of fits, but it's not a drastic difference and would only matter with certain career choices. However a small number of muggleborns are way stronger than average. Lily Evans was one of these. So muggleborns are either slightly weaker, or super powerful. Though half bloods seem to also benefit from the chance of extra poweredness, since the three most powerful wizards shown, Dumbledore, Riddle, and Harry are all half bloods. Plus purebloods have some sort of genetic disease making them unable to conceive more than one or two children, presumably due to inbreeding, so that evens things out a bit.
