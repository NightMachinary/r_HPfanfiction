I've read this story and its sequels through twice and thoroughly enjoyed them.

Others have already dealt with some of the major issues, such as the main protagonist starting out as an 11yo acting 30 from the start. I'm not going to disagree with any of that.

I see two big problems that haven't been addressed yet. The first is that the story requires every adult, especially Sirius, James and Lily, to not just be holding an idiot ball but to be juggling about five at once. For all that Harry and Archie take precautions, there's no way their parents are going to be fooled for long. It's a problem that only grows as the series continues.

The other problem is that the two kids are prepared to take such a huge, life-changing decision at such an early age: Harry is prepared to risk life in Azkaban so she can go to a particular school, and Archie is happy for his best (pretty much only) friend to risk that.

A minor quibble for me is that I don't think you can read this story on its own. Each canon book encompassed a complete story while being part of a larger arc. I don't think this quite pulls that off - there's not much point to this particular story on its own.

Having said all that I'm prepared to forgive the series its faults because the stories are well-written and highly inventive. Several original facets of potion-brewing are introduced and developed believably, for a start. A lot of stories dismiss potions as just following recipes but this story starts a process where it becomes a truly complex and enthralling subject.

Another great feature doesn't make an appearance in this particular story but the depiction of what murkybluematter calls The Lower Alleys is superb and introduces some great new OCs and story elements.

I put off reading this for a long time because the summary didn't appeal to me. I'd never heard of Alanna the Lioness for a start and didn't want to start a million-word series that I wouldn't understand. But you don't have to have a clue about the other series to enjoy this one. Once I started, I stormed through the entire series in a few days and eagerly await updates now.

Yes, you need to suspend your disbelief at certain points in the story but it's well worth reading despite that.
