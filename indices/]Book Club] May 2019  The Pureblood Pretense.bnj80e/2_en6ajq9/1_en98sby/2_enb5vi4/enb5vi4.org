I agree with pretty much what u\Akitcougar said.

Just to add, the author does a great job laying out Harry/Rigel's personality and motivations right from the very beginning. She's portrayed as a girl who's mature for her age. Also, at the onset, murkybluematter establishes that she's very driven and singleminded to achieve her goal of learning potions - even going so far as to break the law to do so. Because of this, she knows she can't afford to be so free and childish with her dealings in Hogwarts.

Same goes for Archie as well. As for the other minor characters, remember that we're focusing on Slytherins interacting with fellow Snakes here. These are heirs/heiresses to old Pureblood houses who put so much stock in tradition. Of course, they're going to be stuffier than the average kid. It's also not outside the realm of probability that they had lessons in elocution when younger. In real life terms, think Harrow or Eton who had similar subjects.

murkybluematter is an awesome author because, despite all of everything I've said before, he/she doesn't forget that at the end of the day, they are still kids. The characters, for their mature way of speaking and politicking, are petty, jealous, and immature in a lot of different ways.

I hope you can get past this because his/her series is truly great. Characterization, plot, and worldbuiling - freaking amazong. Like I seriously wonder why he/she writes for free. If she had a Patreon account, I would seriously like to support this author.
