OK, I am now choosing to imagine the kids as being 14 rather than 11 and it makes a lot more sense. Also, I admit I'm still skimming past a lot of the dialog where it gets more clunky and uses words like "eclat." Seriously, I went to school with rich kids and no one except the outcast weirdos talked like that. Maybe British people are different (I doubt it...)

Anyway, the point is, the story is picking up and I'm pretty invested in it! Hooray!
