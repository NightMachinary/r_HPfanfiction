I was in the same boat. Tried the fic a few times, gave up on it for years. Recently I saw it recommended and decided to try it again, and actually got hooked this time.

For me at least, I can ignore the "speaking like adults" thing because I like the characters well enough. I've also read a lot of fanfic, and I'd rather have decent if adult-like dialogue than horrid attempts to write kids dialogue.

If you're not a fan of the Slytherin politics tropes, this probably isn't the fic for you. I personally like it, tho it has to be done well (and it is here).
