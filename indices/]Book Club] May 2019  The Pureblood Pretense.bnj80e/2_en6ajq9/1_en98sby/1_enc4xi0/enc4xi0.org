To add to what others have said, I remember it being mentioned that magical kids in murkybluematter's AU mature much faster than Muggle kids due to the dangers that they have to face regarding their own magic. If I am not mistaken, she equals magical first years to Muggle highschoolers.

And you should definitely give it a go, this fic is so much more than political kids.
