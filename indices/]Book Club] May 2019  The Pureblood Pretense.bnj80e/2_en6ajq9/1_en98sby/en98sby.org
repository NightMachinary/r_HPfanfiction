Since you're a fan, can you help me out? I've tried to start it twice, but I can't get past the first few chapters. One of my pet peeves is children who speak like adults/politicking Slytherin kids. Like, I want to read a story where the kids are kids. Does that carry forward through the plot, or is it fixed soon? If not, what makes this story worthwhile enough that I should get over myself?
