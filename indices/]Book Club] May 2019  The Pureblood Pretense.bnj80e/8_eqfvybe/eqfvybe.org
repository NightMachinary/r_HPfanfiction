Its an enjoyable read, held back by some basic Mary sue problems. I'm surprised no one has mentioned the character Leo. He is my biggest pet peeve, the tall dark stranger who is immediately interested in our lead and set up to be a romantic partner. This is not necessarily bad in itself if not for the whole 'Prince of the lower Alleys' hogwash. You're telling me in this world of dark magic where 500 yr old vampires are walking around and the greatest wizard (dumbledore) is like 200 that a young teenager can become the mafia boss of the entire British magical underworld? I can't take his character seriously in any of the many scenes that exist to showcase how good he is at dueling or how all the people in knock-turn look up to him for protection.

edit: just realized he isn't introduced until the first chapter of the sequel, serpentine subterfuge.
