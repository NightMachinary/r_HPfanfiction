I kept avoiding this fic because of the description and because I've always prefered fem!harry where everyone knows she's a girl. At some point I just said fuck it and read it anyway, and I ended up liking it. There are things about it I don't like, but all in all the series has been a pretty good read thus far.

It's got good characters, the magical system is well thought out (although I don't like magical cores.) The expanded world (mostly with AIM and the lower alleys) is a nice touch. The premise of two people switching lives and going way out of thier way to keep the secret is interesting. I like that there are multiple close calls along the way, and the only thing keeping people from figuring it out is that it's such a bold and absurdly complicated plan that no one would think it might be a thing.

That said, I'm waiting for the moment where characters who in canon are known to smart, logical, good at deductive reasoning etc (Snape, Hermione, Dumbledore, Lily, James), end up figuring out the whole ruse. I'm also waiting for a moment where because they feel guilty lying to people the care about one or both of Harry and Archie end up just telling either their parents of friends the truth and then the person or people they tell are probably pissed for a while but end up helping keep the secret because they're friends and/or family. I haven't read the most recent two chapters of The Futile Facade yet, so it's possible one of those things has already happened but I don't know.

Also, as much as I like the premise, I'm not 100% sold on it's necessity. I mean, I know in the fic Hogwarts is substandard for learning healing and AIM is not a great place for learning potions, but, I'm not convinced that a. two eleven year olds are so concerned with the quality of their education that they're willing to inact an elaborate and illegal ruse and b. that two students who are as advanced in their chosen fields and as passionate as they are wouldn't get a lot of extra attention from their professors. I'm also not sold on the idea that Sirius would see how important learning to be a healer is to Archie and still insist on him going to Hogwarts.

A fic where Harry and Archie have to succeed dispite not having access to the highest quality education might have made for just as good of a story. Harry ends up impressing Snape with her work off her own merit anyway, due to her time working in knockturn alley and the lower alleys. Archie and Harry could still find ways to help each other achive their dreams, they'd still have to engage in lots of self study due to the limits of their education. Harry would have to deal with predudice due to being a half blood, as well as potions in this fic being a bit of a boys club. As Harry gets older her success maybe could have an unitended consequence of pushing her further into the poltical limelight as she ends up challenging the notion that half bloods aren't as good at magic.
