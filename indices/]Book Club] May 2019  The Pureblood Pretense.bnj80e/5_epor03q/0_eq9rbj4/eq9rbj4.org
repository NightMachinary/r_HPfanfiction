  I'm not convinced that a. two eleven year olds are so concerned with the quality of their education that they're willing to inact an elaborate and illegal ruse and b. that two students who are as advanced in their chosen fields and as passionate as they are wouldn't get a lot of extra attention from their professors.

I think this is a frequent mistake that even the best fanfiction writers make, and it's something I've learned to accept without judging too harshly for it, mostly because the quality of writing is otherwise 99% better than anything else out there.

The eleven-year-olds don't act like eleven-year-olds. They don't go through the stages of optimism, insecurity, or immaturity that other pre-teens and teens go through. They are always grades ahead of their peers in terms of research and general magical knowledge, and often have their futures planned out already. Sometimes everyone in the main characters friend group is this way, sometimes the main character is the only one that's set apart, and this is used to convey how smart they are. And this is mostly because the writer is unintentionally projecting themselves a bit too much into their characters.

Rowling has the ability to show that children are more capable than adults believe them to be, but still maintained a long-term character growth. Hermione is brilliant, but she still works through character faults as she grows up. She's starts out as a bit overenthusiastic, a bit haughty, and cares more for rules than principal. She has insecurities about the way she looks, and doesn't always handle personal or social issues well. But she's extremely intelligent and responsible, and in the end, her friendship with Harry and Ron helps her improve on her other attributes.

I'm fine with the premise that each school has its specialization, but I feel like an eleven-year-old would be more caught up in the image they've built up in their mind. I mean, it's /Hogwarts./ And in this world, it's only for the best of the best. Similar to how people choose colleges.
