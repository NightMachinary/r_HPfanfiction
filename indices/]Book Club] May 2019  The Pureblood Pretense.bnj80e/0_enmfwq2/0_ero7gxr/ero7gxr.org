  The plot was suspenseful throughout

Yeah! What a treat to not be rehashing canon, and to have something besides the Sorcerer-Stone obstacle course be the Big Bad. The 3rd book also tells a story that is nonhashed, and which I consider fabulous.

  The fact that she gets away with everything she comes up with is implausible and removes some of the narrative tension

Yeah, I feel similarly. It doesn't get better in the later books, either. She goes to absurd lengths to preserve her secrets, and it always works out.

I'll concede only a tiny shred here. If you consider potions to be akin to something like art, it is really believable that an 11 year old is good enough to be in a position to save the day. And not just good enough, but good with a recent track record of delivering while under a heavy work load.
