I've finished it. Thoughts:

Likes:

- The hiding the broken wrist subplot.
- Draco and Pansy as friends, Sirius as a parent figure, all interesting and well-done
- The plot was suspenseful throughout
- Original(?) plot ideas (I haven't read Alana the Lioness, so I will charitably assume all of the cool plot points were the author's idea)
- The author delivered a good ending, with heaps of tension and lives on the line, that tied up the plot. Finding something like that is extremely rare in fanfiction, and I was impressed.

Dislikes:

- Lack of consequences: at some point, Rigel should be caught doing something like wearing a wig to the library, or helping Flint cheat, or having a broken arm by the teachers. The fact that she gets away with everything she comes up with is implausible and removes some of the narrative tension.
- Lack of consequences (medical edition): If Rigel spent two days in meditation, shouldn't she be thirsty and hungry when she comes to? Shouldn't her mouth taste like she didn't brush her teeth for days? Shouldn't she be exhausted? Also she constantly pushes beyond even a time turner-era Hermione output of schoolwork and never has a single emotional, mental, or physical breakdown or symptom from it other than noting tiredness when she does full-time brewing. A lack of medical consequences (other than the arm thing which was nicely done) makes it feel like the hero can do literally anything she wants. Or more like a video game character with a resetting health bar rather than a real person.
- The prose and dialog. Never before have I powered through a story with so many overwrought, tortured, convoluted sentences and metaphors. The author uses the word "orbs" for eyes unironically. Eleven-year-olds speak like they learned English solely from reading Pride & Prejudice. Maybe Alana the Lioness has "big words are better words" syndrome also, and the author was trying to copy the style. I don't know. It was super frustrating because the author would pack sentences with "I found this in a thesaurus" words but then mess up on common homophones and make basic writing errors that made the whole story hard to read.
- The characters never talked or behaved like 11 year olds; they were too smart, too strong, too focused, too good at lying, too concerned with appearances and posturing, too concerned about crushes. The story read a lot better if I imagined the characters as being 14+.
- Too much instant powering up. The storyline with uncontrollable/too controlled magic was interesting, but I would have liked to see some progress, some setbacks, etc. rather than "I realized I have to ask my magic nicely and now I'm instantly amazing"
- "Only an 11 year old can save the day!" I am willing to accept Rigel's unique talent in curing the illness. But the brewing is absurd to believe. I'd be okay if Rigel were helping the competent adults and older students brew the tricky medicinal potions, but having the entire burden fall on her shoulders was just stretching belief. I get that it's tricky to set up a situation where only your very young protagonist can save the day, and even JKR wasn't perfect at it. So this is the least of my criticisms.
