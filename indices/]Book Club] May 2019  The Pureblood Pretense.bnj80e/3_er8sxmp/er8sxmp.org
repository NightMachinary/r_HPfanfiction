So I've reread this many times and this is one of my favorite fanfic series. In her early author notes, Violet said she wanted to write a good fem!Harry. I think this is very interesting even though Harry/Rigel is very OP. Like others have said, the eleven year olds don't act their age, and its easier to imagine that they are fourteen or slightly older. In terms of this book in its series, this is eclipsed by later "books" in the series as the ruse thickens. I'm biased but the years get more and more interesting.

Overall it's a very enjoyable read. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, especially with the sequels. I like how the time is used to make more story. The winter and summer holidays aren't just glossed over, things actually happen. There are also some interesting ideas about magic which is nice to read in HP fanfiction.

This series feels like ideal HP fanfic for me. There are fantasy/magical elements, not a huge focus on romance (yet), and is obscenely long. Some foreshadowing details are embedded within the story so it's nice to hunt for new clues.

I'm torn between wanting the smarter characters (Dumbledore, Hermione, Snape, TMR, etc.) to figure out the ruse or for Harry and Archie to keep making the ruse more complicated. Getting found out would be the climax of the entire series and anything after wouldn't have the same urgency as before. But I still want to see everyone's reactions.

Side note: there is a discord for discussing this fic series in depth and communicating with the author and her sister. This fic also has fanfic deriving from it which are nice to read while waiting for new chapters.
