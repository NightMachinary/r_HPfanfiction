You gotta say how much older because Hermione is almost a year older than Harry and meets your criteria.

In fact, since Harry is almost the youngest in his year (July 31st, cut off date for his year is Aug 31), most other girls in his year also qualify.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11379466/1/][Always]], linkffn(11379466), is a cute short fic in which Harry was KIA in his 40s and reincarnated as someone much younger later. He got together with Ginny again, now at least 25 years older than him.
