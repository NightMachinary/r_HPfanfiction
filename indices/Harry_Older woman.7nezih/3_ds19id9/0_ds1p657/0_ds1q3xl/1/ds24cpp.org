I mean part of me doesnt want the pairing to happen as the story could suffer for it. The characterization of Emily is incredibly well done, giving her depth.

But then I realize firstly I've never read a good Harry/femVoldemort. And secondly that Emily needs something to pull her out of her ways. And I think Harry could be that spark that makes her more like Emily Price was and less like Emily Riddle.

All in all your story is incredibly and I hope you continue.

Also if there are any good Harry/femVoldemort send me some recs.
