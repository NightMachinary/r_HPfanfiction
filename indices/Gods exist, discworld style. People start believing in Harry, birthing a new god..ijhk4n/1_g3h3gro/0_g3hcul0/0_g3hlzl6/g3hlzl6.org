I wouldn't expect Harry to get prayers or shrines either. But as I recall, in Discworld and the like, it's usually just the belief that's important, not actual worship. So if enough purebloods believe that Voldemort is their savior, come to free them from the taint of the mudbloods, or something like that, I think he could be deified just as easily as Harry.

Besides, I don't think that fear and worship are mutually exclusive, even in real religions.
