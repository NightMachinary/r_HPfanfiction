I enjoyed Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875189/1/The-Prefect-s-Portrait][The Prefect's Portrait]]; 94k words, complete.

  Now AU sixth year. Hermione's quest for a quiet place to read leads to the discovery of a remarkable portrait. CHAPTER 18:The Order of Merlin. The living are celebrated, the dead remembered, and it is a new day for the wizarding world. Multifaceted Nominee

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss is also enjoyable; he writes in a Jack Vance-esque, indirect style that appeals to me; 95k words, WIP, last updated June 2013.

  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.

I wrote a Hermione-centric one-shot [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/14/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Hermione Interlude]] that might qualify for the list.

  A brief Hermione interlude written for the Teachers' Lounge "Iron Fic" Challenge competition, a timed event, 1500 words with the prompt: "Is this real, or has it all been inside my head?"
