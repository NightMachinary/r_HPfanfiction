Just made it in under the wire for Hermione's birthday with an update for my fic, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]]. Hope you don't mind unfinshed fics. Things are from Harry's perspective, but it is obviously all about the smartest witch around. Note that this is AU in plot line and some added elements, but plays nice with canon.

  Harry never beat Voldemort, only barely managing a stalemate. Years later, Harry falls victim to a Dark ritual that sends him back in time to when he was 11. After Dumbledore discovers Harry's abuse by the Dursleys, things spiral out of control fast. His magical abilities damaged by the trip back, Harry's only hope is the Witch Queen herself, now known merely as Hermione Granger.

I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], which also updated today. Good read, Harry/Hermione but rated T, romantic in spots but mostly an adventure. Also, the best multiple-second-chance time travel HP fic I've ever read.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Prince-of-Serpents][Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents]] is an odd one. Some tone and pacing issues, but all Hermione all the time.

  At the age of five Harry turns into a snake. Five years later he saves a girl named Hermione.
