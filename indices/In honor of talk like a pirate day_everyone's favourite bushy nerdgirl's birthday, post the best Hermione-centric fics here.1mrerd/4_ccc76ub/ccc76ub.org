Here are a couple more recommendations:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] by MissAnnThropic: To me, this is THE classic H/Hr fic. It contains many of the cliches common to this pairing, but pulls them off better than anything else.

#+begin_quote
  Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become animagi.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] by Loten: I'm usually not a huge fan of Hermione/Snape, but Loten does a fantastic job of developing the pairing. Their relationship builds gradually and feels entirely believable.

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] by Minisinoo: This is the only Hermione/Cedric fic that I've come across, and it is quite good. Minisinoo's Cedric is a complicated and conflicted young man, which makes this version of the character far more interesting than most versions I've read.

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU

I'm also in the process of reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster][Spellcaster]] by SGCbearcub, and thus far I am really enjoying it.

  Hermione Granger was a witch. By the time she was done, the whole damned pureblood world was going to know it. HG/SS. Spoiler HBP
