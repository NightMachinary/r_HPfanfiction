My favourite Hermione-centric story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by Vera Rozalsky.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

This is a very well written story that takes a much darker and more complex look at both the post-Voldemort Wizarding World, and the post-war relationships between Hermione and her friends. /Warning/ There are some (few and brief) scenes of F/F and M/M slash
