I'd like to see people taking more risks when it comes to plots. At this point, I can read the premise of most fics and make a fairly accurate guess as to how it will go and I'm getting tired of it. More post Hogwarts adventures with their own self-contained storylines. More significant AUs where the Horcruxes don't exist, and Voldemort's return is by some other original mechanism. Oh, and more crossovers that don't merely cannibalise the events and characters of one fandom in order to make the other look cool.

I'd also like to see more effort being expended on more novel-style stories in the 50-150k word range. Tightly written, without tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of words of needless side threads. With a bit of luck these would stand a better chance of reaching completion than the planned 7 year epics.

And I'd like to see less blind shipping. I'd rather people focus on the story and characters first, and if a romance fits then sure, go to town. Stories that are built wholly on ships are often one note and incredibly samey for a given ship. Hopefully a greater focus on plot and character development will force the romance to stand on its own merit rather than simply expecting to be given a pass because it tags the right two people to draw in the hungry masses.
