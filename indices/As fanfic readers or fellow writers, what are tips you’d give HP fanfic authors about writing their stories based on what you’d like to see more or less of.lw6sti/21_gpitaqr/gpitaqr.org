I'd like to see Harry either failing or suffering the consequences of his actions even if later on he fixes the situation. Harry does a lot of questionable stuff in the books for which he never pays but seeing him elevated to Gary Stu (or whatever the terminology is nowadays) just pisses me off. Don't get me wrong. I love Harry and I always root for him but I want him to face consequences of his actions and not everything turn out perfectly for him.
