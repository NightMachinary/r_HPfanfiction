I'd like to see authors take a point of divergence and actually diverge. I'd like to see more stories start where the change begins. I'd like to see less of the same stations of canon be hit. I don't need to see another shopping trip.

I'd like to see more underutilized minor characters, especially villains and gray ones. Crouch Sr gets so little screentime, but is pretty much behind all of PoA and GoF. I'd love to see more of Slughorn, Scrimgeour, Romilda, Marietta, and Pansy.
