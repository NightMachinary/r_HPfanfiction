I am BEGGING for authors to:

1. Please use other female characters other than Hermione. She is in absolutely every pairing. you can't read about any of the male characters in a romance without the only options being slash or Hermione. Particularly would love to see Marietta, Romilda, Padma, parvati, Angelina, Alicia, Pansy, Tonks...oh and Blaise as a main love interest not just a friend!

Also would be really nice if:

1. People should act their age. If they are 11 they should act 11. If needed do sone research on child and adolescent development.

2. Do research. This is just part of being a writer and it's what good authors do. If you are going to write about bigotry, oppression, ptsd, war torn societies, abuse, mental health/illness, chronic illness, disability, trauma, assault, recovery, etc. please do some research.

3. Please have a solid understanding of anatomy if you are going to write smut. Also the idea that a 16 year old boy is magically a sex god with 11 inches is very unrealistic. Or honestly even that they would know the exact needs of a new partner without any level of communication is pretty unlikely. And if you are going to write in BDSM dynamics (in stories with ADULTS) it's helpful in writing better scenes to do some research on that as well. Like being a dom doesn't inherently include sadism for example. Sex doesn't even have to include these dynamics. Also this is more in slash but top is not interchangeable with dom and bottom is not interchangeable with sub.

4. I wish there wasn't so much Ron bashing and that ppl wrote him like he was in the books.

5. I know fanfic is just for fun but if you are putting in the work to write a well developed story it doesn't hurt to visiting the writing subreddit and read up on building tension in plots, writing original characters, etc.
