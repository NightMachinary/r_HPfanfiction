Really, i only recommend two things -

1. Don't follow the Stations of Canon. Every one of your readers knows the plots of HP books 1-7. If your story rehashes any of those storylines, think harder.
2. Don't base your story off of tropes that everyone else has already done. By that, I mean don't write WBWL, manipulative-Dumbledore, 'goblinfriend!Harry', etc etc. There are already a million bad stories using those plots, don't add another turd to the shit-pile.

Beyond that, have fun. Fanfiction is a great way to exercise your creativity and work on your writing.
