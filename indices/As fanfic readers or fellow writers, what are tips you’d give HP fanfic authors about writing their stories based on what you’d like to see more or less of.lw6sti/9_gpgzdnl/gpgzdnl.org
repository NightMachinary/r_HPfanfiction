1.  Good SPAG, flow and characterization. Doesn't take 200k+ words to get through year 1 (PS was under 80k) for example, and the characters have to be reasonably characterized.

2.  No bashing.

3.  No MarySue!Hermione (see my complaints with Fanon!Hermione [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jvue3g/hermione_is_not_allowed_to_be_flawed_in_most_hp/gcnbryu/][here]]. Taure's Victoria Potter has the best Hermione I've seen so far.

4.  Fics where Hermione isn't 100% perfect and her actions have real consequences. None of that canon weaksauce shit.

5.  No Muggle OR Wizard wank. A compare/contrast between the two and the things they provide to each other would be great. Authors like to project themselves on one side or the other and it's really cringy and obvious when they do.

6.  Good magic system with consistency.

7.  Fem!Harry is always nice to see.

8.  Incorporate some lesser-used characters. I've seen plenty Hermione/Neville/Draco/the twins subplots and redemption arcs, it's time for something different. Maybe Ron, the Creeveys, Percy, Montague, and canon OCs (Ã  la Daphne Greengrass).

9.  Fics where Ron is given the credit he deserves, whether he's the central character or not. Fics where he steps up are a special favourite.

10. Minimal canon rehash.

11. Character-driven vs plot driven. Plot is still important but I like seeing charcters learn and grow up too.

12. Competent protagonist. Enough said.

13. I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi and/or x-over fic.

14. Is complete.
