Yeah. And even if they do the whole ‘summer training montage' trope, it just still doesn't seem like he's actually /worked/ for it. It's a cheap way to pretend he worked hard for it without actually showing character growth.

Like, what did he give up to gain these powers? Does his dabbling in powerful Dark magic mean his impulse control is shot to pieces? While he was using a time turner to fit in all these extra study hours, did he fuck up time and now has to fix it?

One of the best examples of someone doing an Overpowered!Harry right is Antithesis. Every step he takes and every new magic he learns, he suffers for it. It really exemplifies the idea of “if it were easy, then everyone would've done it”.
