The whole trope you described, to me, just generally screams "self-insert". Which is a bit disturbing because that would imply the people writing it actually /believe/ that their Harry is good, and that his methods are good. Like, morally good, not effectively good.

I feel like titles have their place, but pretty universally end up being overstacked and severely misused. I don't even know how many fics I've read had Harry saying that he believes the muggleborn are equal to the older families, while sitting on his metaphorical throne that he inherited and constantly bringing up stuff that pretty much confirms that they are, in fact, /not/ equal. Such as the way overused trope of having a grimoire that takes your arm off if you're not a Potter. The good ol' "We love your kind, as long as you know your place."

Which, again, is a completely fine mindset for a fic and a theme that'd be interesting to read as long as it wasn't equating muggleborns to real life minorities as some authors tend to do. As long as the author acknowledges that it's not a view that a good guy would hold.
