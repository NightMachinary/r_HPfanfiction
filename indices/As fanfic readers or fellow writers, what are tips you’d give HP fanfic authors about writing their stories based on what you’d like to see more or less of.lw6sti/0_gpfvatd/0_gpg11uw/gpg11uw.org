You bring up a LOT of good points!

One of the main things I don't like about a lot of Harry fics is how far the authors go to glorify everything he is and does. It becomes all about the titles and the power he holds and they try to make him seem like some wildly powerful sixteen year old who also happens to know exactly what he wants to do with all that power despite being a child. So suddenly, he had really Good Judgement, Knowledge of Everything, and is Skilled enough to always be three steps ahead of Dumbledore while being a student and still attending classes at Dumbledores school. I feel like it takes him down a very Tom Riddle-y path without having him do any of the things Tom Riddle did (like actually extensively study everything he could and put hard work into achieving those skills). And like you said we just have to accept that Harry is a good guy because it is said he's a good guy. I don't know I just don't like the fics where Harry has more titles and powers than he has years in his life and he knows what to do with it and is seemingly always in control. I agree that I wish they would show teenagers be actual teenagers. Not fully fledged adults with politician minds in the bodies of teenagers.
