Some thoughts, not in order of importance:

I'd love to see people using named OCs as actual OCs. It feels like every Blaise, Susan and Daphne in the fandom are the exact same character. This goes double for Daphne. There are literal /thousands/ of ice queen fics, extremely similar down to the same lines.

One thing that I find myself missing is self-consistant mindsets. As in often times a fic has a Harry that has a set of morals that he pushes heavily, but then he randomly starts breaking it himself, not as a depiction of hypocrisy, but as something that the author doesn't even seem to notice. From fics that say "we're not discriminating against muggleborns, /but.../" , to Harry throwing a massive tantrum over bullying only to sic Fred and George on someone in the next chapter.

It feels like this one is getting better in the past few years, but depth for secondary characters/antagonists is still oftentimes lacking. This "Harry always good, Voldemort/Dumbledore/whoever Harry hates always bad" mindset skips out on a lot of potential, and results in bashing. Bad people do good things sometimes, and good people do bad things sometimes, too. Acknowledging it is something that fics seriously lack, i.e. all the cases of indie!Harry being outright malicious to people he doesn't like, breaking laws or literally becoming the ultra-authoritarian government that he says he's fighting.

Another thing I'd love to see less of is random bullshit happening just so Harry can be a hero. Like something that adds no value to the story, no story progression, just random scenes where a dude does something, Harry flexes his Mary Sue Powers(tm) and it's never spoken about again. If you have to constantly say that your character is a good guy, chances are he isn't. Which isn't even a bad thing, people just hate admitting it for some reason.

Tying into that, I'd love to see more fics where at least the author, if not Harry himself, acknowledges that Harry isn't a good person. A /lot/ of indie!Harry fics would suddenly become considerably better if they acknowledged that using your inherited wealth to more or less install yourself as a dictator isn't a good or noble thing to do.

Stepping away from the negatives, I'd love to see more fics with light-dark cooperation. Be it some external threat arising, forcing Dumbledore and Voldemort to get along, or something post-war, the two factions learning to understand each other and co-exist.

Another thing I'd love to see more of is Harry /not/ being the overpowered leader guy that he always is. Just an above-average kid climbing through the ranks, be it on the Order or the Death Eaters. Because seriously, no matter how much of a prodigy he is, you can only read so much of a fifteen year old suddenly creating a whole new faction and leading it decently.

One more thing that I rarely see is the characters being depicted as human beings, with their own flaws and vices. Not to mention /teenagers/. And little things can go so far here. Just minor, normal teenage things like having Harry be awkward at the Yule Ball, or Harry and Ron sneaking past Molly to have some beers by the nearby creek can easily make your characters feel that much more /real/.

And one last thing I'd love to see completely removed, or at least heavily reduced, is forced relationships. I'm not talking about marriage contracts (although those are also annoying to read), but rather a relationship that has no background nor purpose, that feels forced into the story. Way too many fics just randomly introduce a girl like 3/4ths of the way through (mostly Daphne, I've noticed) and have Harry suddenly fall in love at a frightening speed, only for it to serve /no purpose whatsoever/, or worse, to move on to completely take over the plot.
