Agree that Harry's far overpowered in fics, but Snape is also acknowledged as a highly skilled and competent wizard. Harry's still only 16, with a bad education in Defense, makes sense he doesn't stand a chance against Snape- but not because he's a bad wizard. And we know Hermione's intelligent and good at magic, which Snape either utterly ignores or insults. So him calling Harry "mediocre," doesn't really mean much

Definitely agree that it's exhausting how often canon seems to assume the reader/wizarding world is stupid. I read the books around age 8, and never believed Harry was right about Snape

Otherwise he just would have gone kidnapped Harry when he was outside Hogwarts in HBP with Tonks, taken him straight to Voldemort, raised the alarm and acted innocent.
