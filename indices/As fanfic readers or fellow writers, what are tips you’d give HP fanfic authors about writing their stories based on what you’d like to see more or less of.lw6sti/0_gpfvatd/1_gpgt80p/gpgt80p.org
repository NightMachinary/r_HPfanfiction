I agree. In canon, Snape was complaining how Harry is arrogant and mediocre. Readers can decide that for themselves. However, the fact is that Harry wasn't really a powerful prodigy, besides him producing a patronus in his third year.

That was proven once again in chapter 28 of the Half-blood Prince when Harry called Snape a coward and tried to hit him with Cruciatus and Sectumsempra, he never showed any powerful magic compared to Snape.

It would be really interesting to get a better Harry Potter character, because it is either a powerful Mary Sue or it is an arrogant but easily manipulated brat incapable of critical thinking.

My 10-year-old niece told me after finishing the Half-Blood Prince that she still thought Snape was obviously on the side of Light. So I really couldn't understand how no one else in the book did until after his death.
