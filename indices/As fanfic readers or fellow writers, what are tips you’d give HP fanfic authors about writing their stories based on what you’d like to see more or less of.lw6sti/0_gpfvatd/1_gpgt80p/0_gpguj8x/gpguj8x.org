Honestly, reading HBP when it came out I thought plot armor was the only reason Harry didn't die right there. It was what got him through the past couple of years anyway.

Also, I'd say the Mary Sue ones are even more arrogant. If you removed plot armor, I'd go as far as saying canon Harry would survive longer, purely because he's pretty good at running and hiding.
