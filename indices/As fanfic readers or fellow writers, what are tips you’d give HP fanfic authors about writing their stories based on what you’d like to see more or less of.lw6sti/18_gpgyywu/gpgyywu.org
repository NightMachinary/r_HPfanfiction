I hate it when a fic has excessive telling and not enough showing. I know this is age old writing advice which often misleads people but I still find it very hard to immerse myself in a story with this problem. Example linkffn(The Archaeologist). It's “this happened for a few months” then “that happened for a few weeks” and a bunch of exposition thrown in. I want to see Harry excavate the site. I want to see her suffer. I want to see the months spent on it. I want to see the her writing her book and thinking of Filius and Hermione. It felt like a summary of a great fic. And lot of fics read like this as well. I don't want the summary, I want the story.
