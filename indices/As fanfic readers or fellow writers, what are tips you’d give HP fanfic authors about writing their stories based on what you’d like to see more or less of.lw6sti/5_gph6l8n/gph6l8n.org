This is me just being annoying, it's not a big deal at all tbh, but most of the time, I hate when authors make Harry call Sirius and Remus by the nicknames 'Siri' or 'Remy'. It just always sounds so fake and disingenuous. Even nicknaming Draco 'Dray.' I don't know why but it just always sounds so forced and OOC.

Along the same lines (though I do this too, for the dramatic factor in tense scenes and whatnot) is having one character address a character by their name, when they are having a conversation with just the two of them. Like:

"Harry, you have to do what's right for you!" she said.

Harry responded, "But I just don't know, Hermione."

"Sometimes, Harry, you just have to take a risk," she concluded.
