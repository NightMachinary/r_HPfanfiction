lmaooo yeah, I've read more than a few where Harry calls them by those nicknames, and they usually call him 'cub' or 'pup' in every other sentence, which is also eh, not really a fan, but it can be cute. If it's done sparingly, it doesn't really make a difference, but when it's every time they address each other, I usually have to nope out of those fics.

And exactly! It breaks the flow when characters always refer to each other by their names in the middle of conversation, and it usually adds nothing to the story.
