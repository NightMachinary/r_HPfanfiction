Oh my god I haven't read anything where Harry calls them Siri or Remy but I would find that really weird. And Dray?? If a name is two syllables you don't need a nickname.

I know what you mean about the second bit. I'm guilty of doing it a lot too but I always make sure to take about half of them out when I'm editing. One of my English teachers in high school kept making us take names inside dialogue out because we used it too much and he said it wasn't natural to say someone's name so much in conversation. Didn't like it then, but I totally understand him now! It kinda of breaks the flow when it's overdone especially consecutively.
