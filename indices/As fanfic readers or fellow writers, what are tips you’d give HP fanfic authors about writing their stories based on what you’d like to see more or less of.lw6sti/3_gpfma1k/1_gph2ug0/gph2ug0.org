Yes! It's so sad when people decide to give every other character personalities and goals and desires beyond what we see in canon and then Crabbe and Goyle are kept as mindless goons.

Maybe Crabbe has trouble in lessons because he's dyslexic. Maybe Goyle is “thick” with school work because all he wants to do is be a stay at home dad so he doesn't need a job. Maybe they both nearly failed the end of year exams because they were busy running an underground black market, idk.
