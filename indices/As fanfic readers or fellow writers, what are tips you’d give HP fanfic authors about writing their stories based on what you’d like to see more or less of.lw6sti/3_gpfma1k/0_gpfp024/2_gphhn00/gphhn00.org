I'm currently writing a time travel fic where Harry travels back in time with Theo and is Sorted into Slytherin and he realizes that Crabbe and Goyle are just putting up grunt fronts because they're obligated by their family's positions as Malfoy vassals to be Draco's bodyguards. On their own time in the common room, however, they do their own things. Crabbe is a good artist who might later become interested in making little animated statues and Goyle is interested in Ancient Greek and Roman wizards and history and he has a decent understanding of the language. Both have a use for Harry in the future, of course, but that doesn't mean that they're not intelligent, lol.

They and Draco aren't really good friends since they're more like co-workers or whatever, and Blaise is still Draco's best friend, but they're not just mindless grunts there for comedic effect.
