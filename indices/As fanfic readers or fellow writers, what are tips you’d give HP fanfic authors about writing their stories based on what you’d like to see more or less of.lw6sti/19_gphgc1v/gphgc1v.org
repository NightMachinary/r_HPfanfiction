I'd love to see more unique takes on time travel fix-it fics and common tropes. I'm currently writing my own version where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin. (And yes, I did just copy and paste that description.)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/lp4vkx/just_posted_the_new_chapter_for_my_fic_hbi_hr_at/][This]] post I made has me going in-depth on how I plan to handle the various overdone tropes I've decided to write into my fic.

I know that I lot of people hate Lordship fics and Slytherin Politics, but I honestly love reading those cliches! I've decided to do a new take on it where the Lords and Ladies aren't ridiculously overpowered, but they do have additional perks to being a part of wizarding "royalty" except the term is only used for the old families that are a part of the Wizengamot. I'm also featuring PTSD in the fic a lot, too, even though it's been three years since the war. PTSD doesn't just go away.

Better Slytherin!Harry fics, too, especially if it ties in with Harry going back in time. Everyone makes Ron this petty little kid who despises Harry because he's in Slytherin, which is ridiculous! Harry is more prejudiced against Slytherins in the books than Ron is! Literally, all Ron said was that he couldn't imagine being in Slytherin because of his family's reactions.

No bashing, too. Or if you're going to bash, at least do it logically without making up a ton of shit. The only bashing in my fic is based on canon things. Like Molly Weasley taking over Sirius's house and throwing expensive shit away (he didn't care, but /still/), Mundungus Fletcher being a thief and no one caring, and Albus Dumbledore leaving Harry with abusive relatives.

No complete retelling of the books, either, if you're doing time travel. In my fic, Harry will be ignoring a lot of the events that got him in trouble or looked at in the books. He'll stop Hermione from getting attacked by the troll, he'll tell Dumbledore about Hagrid's dragon, and he won't be going to Lockhart's disastrous duelling club.
