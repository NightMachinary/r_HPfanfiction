What is it with snape fans and thinking lily should apologize for not wanting to associate with a bigoted wizard nazi that want people like her dead.

Let's assume Dumbledore's personality didnt undergo too much change between the marauders' Era and present Era. The reason he tried to redeem malfoy and not snape was simple. Malfoy showed panic, hesitancy etc once he became a death eater. There's no indication that snape did. He didn't regret becoming a death eater until lily was targeted specifically (not just as enemy combatant).

Snape fans like to assume that teenage snape reluctantly joined voldemort because he had no other choice or some bullshit. There's no canon evidence to support that.

Snape is obviously a smart dude. If he knew that Lily didn't approve of his death eater ambitions he would do his best to hide it from her. The fact that lily still figured out he can't wait to join voldemort with his future death eater buddies showed how obvious his actions were.

And seriously telling a woman that she should apologize for cutting off a toxic scum from her life is misogyny. It's all too common among snape fans. I'm tired of repeating it.
