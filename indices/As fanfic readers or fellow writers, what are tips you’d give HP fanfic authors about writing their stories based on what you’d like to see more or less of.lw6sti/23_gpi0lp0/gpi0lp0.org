I'm actually trying to set this up in my own sub(it's dedicated to writing drarry as good as it can be, fulfilling your very full potential and all that rot).

Although, it's much more centered at drarry. And, instead of asking you all generally, we're going to be posting advice from well-known writers(eleventy7, quicksilvermaid, AlexMeg, etc. to give an idea) and trying to sort by genre and/or trope(eg. pining, slow burn, angst, etc.).
