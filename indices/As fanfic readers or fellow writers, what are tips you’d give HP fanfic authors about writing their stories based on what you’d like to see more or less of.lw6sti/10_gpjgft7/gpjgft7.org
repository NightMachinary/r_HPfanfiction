The one thing I always ask every aspiring fanfiction author is "what's your angle?". If you're going to write a fic, then what makes it unique? If it's inspired by a other fic then what makes it different? Why should people read your fic instead of another fic with the same idea?

Every time I've written a fic, it's been inspired by a /lack/ of fics filling that niche. I wrote Scrambled Sorting because there was a lack of fics where lots of students were sorted differently and that then explored how that alternate universe would play out. I wrote Departure from the Diary because there was a lack of fics where the diary recognised Harry as a fellow horcrux and altered its plans. I wrote Unseen Perspective because there was a lack of fem!Voldemort fics where she wasn't shipped with anyone.

Don't try to write new versions of stories that haven't been written before. Write new stuff.
