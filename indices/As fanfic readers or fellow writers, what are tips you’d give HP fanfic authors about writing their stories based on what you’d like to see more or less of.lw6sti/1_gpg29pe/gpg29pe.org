1) Honestly, I'm absolutely done with reading Slytherin Harry. Nearly all of them are exactly the same. And as much as I'd love a /real/ Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff Harry, literally none exist. All Ravenclaw Harrys act like Slytherin Harrys (in some stories the Hat will even try to put him into Slytherin only for Harry to convince it into Ravenclaw) and Hufflepuff Harrys are the same as Gryffindor Harrys.

And in regards to the Houses, whenever Harry goes to the Goblins (which another nauseating occurence) he's /always/ descended from godric or salazar. Never Rowena or Helga. Honestly, these two houses/families never get any love.

2) There need not be /any/ more creature Harry fics if they're all going to devolve into crappy romance. Especially fucking vampires, goddamn! I mean write whatever you want, it's your right to do so. But, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! All of them? Seriously?!?!

3) This is kinda related to the last one but writers can write an interesting and developed love interest/romance without it taking over the story. /Please/ try to watch for your plot losing its original premise in favor of romance.

4) Diagon Alley was fun the first time readers went through that section. Unless something plot relevant has changed about that sequence, it never needs to be redone.

5) Neville is not Ron 2.0 and will not suddenly become some suave, sexy player when he gets a new wand.
