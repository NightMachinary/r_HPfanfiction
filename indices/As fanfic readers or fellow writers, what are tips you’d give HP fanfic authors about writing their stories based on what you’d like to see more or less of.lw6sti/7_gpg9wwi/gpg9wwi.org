The things that I would like to see more:

1)Magic being magic not a science that needs maths and things like that to create spells. Is not that I have a problem with a “scientific”approach is more that I find is overdone and takes away the magic that I felt when reading the original series. I like when fanfiction takes a more philosophical or abstract approach to magic.

2) Kids acting their age. I started reading fanfiction when I was 12-13 at the time I loved the dark, Indy Harry that acted so cool( that was what I thought at the time) and he already knew everything about everything because he read a book before school. This eleven year old already had a political agenda and was outsmarting everyone. He just happens to read that Sirius Black was in prison and went to find the records of the trail (as any kid would).If he was a slytherin the house had politics and he made power moves and things like that and all the eleven year old kids were also part of this power plays. Now that I'm older this just seems absurd to me and I can't take it seriously. I mean if you want a story with adults then write a story where the characters are adults.

1. Departure from canon. When I first started reading fanfiction I liked canon rehash because I liked to see for example how a Ravenclaw Harry would face the troll, the chamber or Sirius escaping. As I read more and more canon rehash it started to be boring as it was the same thing over and over. So I would love to see more fanfiction that explore different adventures that the ones we see in the books.

2. Exploring magical communities outside Britain is just something that I haven't seen much and I really like when is done well. I love when there are different countries in the magical world than in the muggle world. I would love to see more fanfiction outside Britain. Maybe Harry decides to travel the world after Voldemort's defeat, maybe we follow Dumbledore when he was young traveling out of Hogwarts.

3. Flawed characters that make mistakes and learn.

4. Character that we don't know very well being explore in an original way. With this I mean trying to stay away or at least twist the fanon tropes for them.

5. Competent ministry of magic, competent death eaters and competent order. Is just something that I like to see.

What I don't want to ever read again

1. Mini lords.
2. Globins solve everything
3. Bashing. You don't need to trash a character in order for them to be in odds with your protagonist they can just don't get along because they have clashing personalities or different goals.
4. Lazy Ron is holding Harry back this is just... I mean they are just normal kids that don't like to do homework all day. If you want to make a more studious Harry that's great but saying that he was always so intelligent but Ron holds him back is just stupid.
5. Muggles are the best wizards suck. Is just like bashing but with the whole wizard society.
6. House elves will die if they are set free. I find that is overused and a lazy way of facing the topic.
7. Voldy, moldyshorts, dumbles, old goat
8. Goblins just want wizards to say hi to them... no is not that easy and if it is then is pretty boring.
9. Adult/child romance. I don't care if you have adult/child relationships in your fanfiction as long as you show how this is problematic. For example a middle/high school student /teacher relationship is not good. So I dislike when authors try to sell it as something normal and romantic. Is just not something I like. That being said I would like to read a story where we see how this is problematic and the harm that is causing the child. If for example you are writing about character that doesn't care if she/he is molesting children okay but don't tell me that this person is normal and just love the kid and the kid is just also so happy about this and it is so romantic.

If doing a crack fic ignore all of the above.
