There's a bunch like this with a Drarry pairing and Dramione pairing.

** Mostly Canon Wartime Drarry**

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/41961][Paradox Series]] - Draco travels back in time and switches sides.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2088468/chapters/4545474][For the Sake of Grades]] - not one of my favorites, but the main plot is 6th Year Draco turning on his family and joining the Order.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2752127/chapters/6169592][Consequences of Redemption]] - iirc this is pretty much exactly what you requested - Draco rescues Harry from the manor and joins the light side. However I thought it was rushed and not that well written.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594][Temptation on the Warfront]] - the classic Drarry horcrux hunt fic. Very well done and one that's most commonly recommended for this prompt.

*Really AU Drarry*

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/28580][A Thousand Beautiful Things series]] - 5th year Draco trains with Snape to spy for the Order. I think this was written pre-DH, so it's canon divergent but really well done.

*[[http://archiveofourown.org/external_works/187426][Secrets]] - This is a famous fanfic AU for the 7th year and the search for horcruxes. It's very AU but the plotting is well done. A Fan Favorite to be sure but I didn't think the writing was that great.

*Draco/Hermione fics*

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] - a Draco/Hermione set during 7th year where Draco is at first neutral but then joins the light side.

- [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] - a wartime Draco/Hermione AU that's really gritty and depressing. Great writing though.
