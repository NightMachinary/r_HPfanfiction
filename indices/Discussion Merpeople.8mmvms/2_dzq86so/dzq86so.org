I never really thought about it before, but it's something to think about.

- I guess I think of the Merfolk as more tolerant of wizards, and by extent humans in general, than centaurs or goblins are.

- The Chieftess made it clear to Dumbledore that Harry only was delayed in completing the Second Task because Harry wanted to make sure all four hostages were brought to safety. So this indicates that the Merfolk are capable of looking at the "small picture," while centaurs are more concerned with the "big picture."

- They're secretive and quick to take offense, but also more willing to compromise and reconsider.

- They hate Moaning Myrtle with a passion. And the Giant Squid, none of them like the Giant Squid.

- While they can only speak Mermish above the water, they're actually accomplished playwrights. They love art, as it gives them a sense of community.

- Their family ties provide a contrast to the cultish clan of centaurs who kill "traitors" without hesitation.
