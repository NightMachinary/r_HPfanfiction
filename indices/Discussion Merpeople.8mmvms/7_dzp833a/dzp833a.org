I don't find them interesting at all because they are neither useful allies nor difficult to take down (explosions are far more devastating under water). Their mobility on land is severely limited and unless you write a Subnautica crossover, they will be a gimmick at most.

That's not saying that writing important merefolk characters is impossible, but usually that has them important on a personal level (hurt/comfort, love interest) and not the fact that they are maritime humanoids.
