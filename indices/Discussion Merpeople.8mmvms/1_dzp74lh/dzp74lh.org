My headcanon is that merpeople are basically just ordinary humans that ate Gillyweed on a regular basis for so long that the effects became permanent and now they can't actually get out of the water. Also a general headcanon is that magical creatures follow the rules of Lamarckian evolution, rather than Darwinian principles, so this sort of thing would have been a fairly common occurrence.

Why were they eating Gillyweed so often? Any number of economic reasons: clams, pearls, kelp, various fish eggs, even the ooze on the lake bottom would have been valuable commodities and maybe holding a bubblehead charm for that long is too strenuous for most magical fishermen to do.
