Mine's not too far from that, but I presumed all the magical creatures /were/ just Lamarckian evolution; e.g. ancient wizards whose collective informal magic slowly mutated them into forms that better enabled their lifestyles. Elves became small and fleet-footed with an affinity for Apparition because they were a tribe that lived near predators, Goblins were cave-dwelling carvers, etc.

So in my view Merpeople would just have spontaneously become water-dwellers at some point in the Paleolithic because they were, indeed, a kin of divers and fishermen. It had however not occurred to me they might have taken too much Gillyweed, though it /is/ a funny idea, because Gillyweed /only/ makes you grow gills and flippers; it doesn't make you grow a fish-tail...
