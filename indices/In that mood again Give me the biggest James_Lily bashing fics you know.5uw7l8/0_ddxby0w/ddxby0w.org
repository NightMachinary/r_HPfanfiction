Lily bashing (but not James) is rather rare, but chapters 7, 9, 10 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/7/Common-Sense][Common Sense]] by DisobedienceWriter are Lily bashing extraordinaire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5785108/1/Too-Late][Too Late]] contains the worst James/Lily bashing I've found so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]], linkffn(12307886), is also pretty bad.
