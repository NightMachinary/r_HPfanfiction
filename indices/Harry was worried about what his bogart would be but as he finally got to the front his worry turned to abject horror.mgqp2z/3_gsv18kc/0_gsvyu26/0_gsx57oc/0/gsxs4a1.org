Memetic hazards are pieces of information that hurt people when they spread, like germs but for minds instead of bodies. Most of the worse kinds are still just theoretical, but we have annoying, catchy music, disgusting images, and technologies that bad people could use to cause damage if they knew how. The good news is that if you have a memetic hazard in your mind, you can usually choose not to share it. Boggarts take information from one person's mind and put it in the minds of everyone in the room. If you've seen something that it harms you to remember, the boggart can force everyone in the room to have seen it too, meaning that the harmful information gets to spread more easily, just like how mosquitoes spread west nile virus.
