The second Weasley Girl story, Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past, has the protections on Privet Drive accidentally breaking and Harry essentially moving in with the Weasleys from there on.

The protections being gone mean that Vernon and Petunia aren't safe from vengeful wizards... though if you were hoping for a "haha, serves them right!" revenge tale, you'll probably be disappointed, because their fate here is... NOT played as a positive thing.
