I don't know the fic, but if it is on DLP, you can search just that site via Google by typing something like:

"Draco Hermione Bloodline Curse" site:forums.darklordpotter.net/

Put whatever words are related to the story you want to find in the speech marks, then whatever site URL you want to search after the 'site:'. Might be able to find what you want like that.
