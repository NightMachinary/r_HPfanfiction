Some of my faves:\\
linkffn(The Counterfeit Cousin by Tsume Yuki)\\
linkffn(Growing Up Black by Elvendork Nigellus)\\
linkffn(In Search of Companionship by Inevitably Insane)\\
linkao3(be brave by tigriswolf)

If you only have time to read one, read 'be brave' or 'counterfeit cousin'. 'Growing up..' has an unfinished sequel and 'In Search..' is a sherlock xover. I also have a few good!Dursley recs if you are interested.
