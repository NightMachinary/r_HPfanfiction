  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

      Warnings: Discussion of child neglect/abuse; violence towards children in the later chapters\. This is a newly\-edited version of a story written the early 2000s\. It has been edited primarily for grammar; having been written around the time OOTP came out, it does not incorporate canon from Half\-Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows\. Earlier versions of the fic are available in ebook formats from Chandri \(containing all the files of the Stealing Harryverse\) and from Deinera \(containing only Stealing Harry\)\. There is also a mobi version of it available from Mickawber\-fics\.
