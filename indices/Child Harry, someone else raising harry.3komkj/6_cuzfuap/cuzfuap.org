Try the Dangerverse! I read many of these many years ago and remember them being good. Located here: [[http://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

First story is Living With Danger

#+begin_quote
  First in the Danger series. What if Harry Potter had not just father figures, but mother figures as well? What if he had siblings? And what about Hermione Granger, or Draco Malfoy? Would they have been different with a different family? What if Sirius Black had a girlfriend named Aletha, his fellow Beater and constant verbal sparring partner? And what if Remus Lupin, one gray March day about five months after his world fell apart, met a woman named Danger who knew things that would change his life forever? Features Weasleys and Luna Lovegood in later chapters.
