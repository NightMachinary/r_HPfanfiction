Sex is horribly hard to write. If you're not careful the erotic can become the laughable. Well written sex scenes, even in published fiction, are rare. Long well written sex scenes are particularly hard (pun semi-intended) because you begin to have to vary the verbs, adjectives, nouns etc. Unfortunately almost anything you go with tends to be quite absurd because the alternative phrases used are often absurdly stupid. Then there is the question of, if you want to make it actually read well fitting a nice romantic aspect of it in is exceptionally hard because often romantic sex isn't massively engaging to readers and can come across as ridiculous. Then there's the possibility that you might want to give people some privacy. Some things are perhaps better not intruded upon.

Most importantly for me though there is the question of what it really adds to the story? Most sex scenes offer very little in the way of character development. Whereas violence shows a number of interesting possible reactions and interactions which reflect quite heavily upon how people treat other aspects of their lives.

I personally don't really like rape scenes either, partially because they tend to be a convenient way to create drama and people who haven't experienced it or sexual assault often treat it rather casually. Arguably you could say the same of most acts of violence, but rape scenes tend to rob female characters in particular of agency.
