  Most importantly for me though there is the question of what it really adds to the story? Most sex scenes offer very little in the way of character development.

I think this is a huge misconception. Attitude to relationships, intimacy, sex is a huge part of a teenager's development. I think it's crazy when someone is alright with slicing throats, cutting body parts, etc. but is very shy when it comes to sex.

  Whereas violence shows a number of interesting possible reactions and interactions which reflect quite heavily upon how people treat other aspects of their lives.

In most cases violence is used for just a bloody image only without affecting characters. Stories that truly looked into it are very rare (by heart I cannot remember even one).
