Those are fair points. What I am talking about is extended sex scenes. Is it necessary to actually show x person bouncing around with y other person to reveal that they have sexual intimacy? I would argue the average sex scene (and note that I said most, not all) focus on titillation rather than the connotations of such intimacy. It's fairly rare for the precise way in which y laps at the other to real reveal much about their personality or develop them as a person. If it does, congratulations I'll be happy to regard it as a useful addition to the story. However, I would argue most of the actually important stuff is put across equally well in a short and touching scene rather than a long and almost inevitably erotic scene.

In those cases violence is also pointless. Neither should be used gratuitously otherwise they lose impact and relevance for the character. If you want to write smut write smut, if you want to write action write action. However, if you want either to matter to the story then make it make a difference for the characters. I would admit that because violence is used slightly more frequently than sex it has a higher number of occasions on which it adds to the story, though not necessarily a higher proportion.

In any case writing about sex has a sort of intimacy to it which I would suggest many writers struggle to convey. Violence should have a kind of intimacy too, but it's easier to gloss over without losing the sense of what you're really seeing.

If I had to describe my first time having sex I wouldn't want to go into masses of detail. I would probably just say that although it hurt and I cried my partner held me close and wiped away the tears. They looked heartbroken at the thought that they'd hurt me and I struggled for the words to explain that I was crying not just because of the pain, but because the moment was both terrifying and heartrendingly loving. It ripped something out of my chest that I'd taken that step with someone. If I went into detail from there about the various thrusts, or movements I would feel that I had sullied a memory I want to keep. Let the sex scenes sleep quietly, sometimes less is more.

There's so much personally and culturally invested in sex that I don't think authors can easily put everything it means across to the audience. It will frequently merely be a pale shadow of what it should be.

Edit: I should have said it is easier for an author to show character development through violence. What tempo do you write in? How gory is the detail? Is the hero enjoying it? How do they fight, quickly? Or do they draw it out, savouring the challenge? Now transpose that onto a sex scene. Do you want a consensual sex scene which the hero isn't really enjoying? How does that reflect their character? It's a very delicate procedure which can be extremely tricky to write, and as I said before can easily become amusing rather than touching.
