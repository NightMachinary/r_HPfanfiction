Necessary to the character though, what do you really gain by doing it. As has been pointed out rather elegantly by [[/u/darklooshkin][u/darklooshkin]], sex can easily come across as an Ikea instruction manual. Of course the stories aren't necessary, but they do fulfil a purpose which isn't fulfilled by something else. Sex scenes can too, but often (as stated) they become porn. If you want porn that's all well and good, but most stories are not pornographic and it would destroy the pacing to make them so. Showing sex is not the be all and end all of human relationships. I have human relationships with my friends, it doesn't mean I watch them have sex. It also rather excludes groups such as asexuals to suggest that sex is a necessity to understanding human relationships. Furthermore I'm not suggesting that sex can't have a place in a story, I'm just arguing that (by and large) blow by blow accounts of it are not massively useful from the perspective of a story which isn't entirely about two people going at it like rabbits any more than the story of how Hermione combs her hair. It's important, it has an impact on her and her character. We don't need to see it.

Absolutely my point. It was something very personal. What do you gain beyond making that clear? Do you need to express every small detail of the sex or can you just make it clear what's going on? Sex is, frankly, fairly repetitive to write about after a point (oh the irony). You asked why the sex scenes are short? Answer, because otherwise they'd become extremely dull. Multiple sex scenes probably more so.

Taking a shit is part of who I am too, I don't need to spend 500 words describing it at every opportunity. It can even be relevant to your character (see Thomas More's comments on how enjoyable it is to evacuate your bowls when you really need to).

Okay, so have you only read good violent scenes in fics with good sex scenes? Because I'd argue there are a vast number of books which I could point to where I'd argue the sex is poor, but the violence is great.

I personally admire Neil Gaiman, but I have little time for his sex scenes, likewise with George R. R. Martin; Tolkien I can't even comment on, but there's a fair bit of decent violence there, and not much with sex. In the case of Gaiman the sex rarely has an impact on the wider story, but the violence often does. In Martin's case both have impacts, but the sex often doesn't really show much, whereas the violence is frequently part of a cunning plan (see Bronn fighting for Tyrion's life in the trial by combat).

Fair enough, but what would the sex really add to those stories? Would you like to give an example where you think it would really improve the story?

That's a reasonable point (that you don't often see authors trying to paint sex along with other parts of relationships), but I'd still argue that of all aspects it is strangely one that (if depicted in detail) adds least to the story. Perhaps because culturally we force it into quite narrow lines.

Edit: I should add that I do think there are occasions when Gaiman really makes sex relevant to the plot (for instance in the retelling of Snow White). However, often, for instance in American Gods, it doesn't serve nearly as much of a purpose.
