First of all, thank you for your input. I really appreciate your detailed answer.

It's always up to an author.

In the same way I can ask if it's necessary to write a story at all? Does it have any value if the author can't write about relationships between humans?

For you the first sex was something very intimate. For someone else it was just a drunk mistake. For others virginity was just a thing to get rid off. Another one could view sex as something intimate, but then changed the opinion to just fun physical activity, etc.

This is part of who we are.

As I see from the stories I've read, if an author can't write a decent sex scene he or she also can't write a meaningful violent scene. It's always just an image that really affects no one. I don't see much difference with smut in such cases.

I'm not voting to add sex everywhere. I started this topic with very specific case in mind: when an author is very comfortable with detailed violence, but then he or she chickens out with sex.

I understand that it's all about the author's skills. It's just very rare to see an author trying to improve in painting different aspects of human relationships including sex.
