I think one of these days I'm going to sit down and write a sex scene from a combat perspective [he knew she would be on the lookout for a kiss, so chose to feint by nuzzling beneath the jaw], then a combat scene from a sex perspective [she drove the knife point deep into his thigh muscle, thrilling at the soft shhlick of her weapon parting his flesh and soaking his leg in released blood. He cried out, and she savoured the sound of it], and see if the readers take to it.
