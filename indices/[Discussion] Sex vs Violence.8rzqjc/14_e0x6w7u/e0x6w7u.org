Maybe because many of them are Americans (from the US of A) where this sort of thing is kind of the law of the land?

Violence (even if you show it to kids!) is ok, but show one nipple and you are flirting with having your show banned (or censored...or worse, at least from the perspective of a company wanting to make money: Rated Adult-Only!) or at least you are provoking major scandal! I mean there was this (female) singer who had a wardrobe malfunction on stage (might have even been at that superbowl) and BAM INSTANT SCANDAL, when in other countries people might still have talked but it wouldn't have made front page in many of them!
