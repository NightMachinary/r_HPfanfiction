It may not be tied to culture, but the average American has a different attitude towards it than the average European. For example, Abstinence wasn't even considered a form of birth control during my school education (and we had sex-ed 4 times in 12 years) whereas several US states teach nothing else. Homosexuality also wasn't treated any different than heterosexuality, something also not standard in the US. And the US has that weird thing where they have to explicitly state that they are dating exclusively, something that is assumed the default by most people on this side of the pond.

From Anecdotal evidence:

You can often tell that an author is American when there is a disturbing fixation on virginity (I remember a horrible story where Harry "rescued" several women, regrew their hymen through a ritual just to be their "first" a couple chapters later). Ginny is a good example here. Americans often make her slut for dating other boys before Harry (and 3 boyfriends in 2 years is not really much) whereas the Europeans I wrote with disliked Ginny for using the other boys as distraction from/practice for Harry because that's a dick move towards them (unless they were told that their fling was just something physical).
