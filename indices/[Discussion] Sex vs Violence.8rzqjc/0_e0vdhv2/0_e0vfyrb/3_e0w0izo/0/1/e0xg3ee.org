  And the US has that weird thing where they have to explicitly state that they are dating exclusively
#+end_quote

I haven't really seen this in America. Certainly there's a lot of casual sex, and some couples who are dating will specifically say it's /not/ exclusive, but in a steady relationship, it's usually still assumed to be exclusive.

  Americans often make her slut for dating other boys before Harry (and 3 boyfriends in 2 years is not really much)

That wasn't just Americans, though. It was also her brothers, although they were nicer about it:

  "But you're moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?"

But in general, yes it is cultural. In general, Americans are more squeamish about sex, and that goes double for underage sex, where people (and websites) sometimes get paranoid about any kind of depiction of it. (The purge of MA fics on FFN might have contributed too.)

In my opinion, this is also reinforced by the American movie rating system, where a PG-13 movie will very rarely show nudity (and this was quite different in 80's), but can get away with all kinds of violence as long as there's no blood. I feel like it's helped normalized this double standard in the culture.
