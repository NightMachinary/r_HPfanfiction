That's totally fine. If you feel you're not good at it and have no desire to improve, then there's no need to include it. I feel like I generally succeed in making the sexytimes relevant to the story--at least no one's called me out for it--and I enjoy writing the closeness between the characters.

You do you and do the best you you can do. :D
