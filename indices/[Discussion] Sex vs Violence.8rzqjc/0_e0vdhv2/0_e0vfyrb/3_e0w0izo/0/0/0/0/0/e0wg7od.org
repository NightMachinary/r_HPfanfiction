It's not that I'm not interested, but the few good sex scenes I've read so far weren't really about the technical side of the act (with the exception of "Whatever happened to Bromance?").

And while I got similar reviews/complaints as well, I'm not going to write explicit scenes with poly juice/metamorphic schenenigans into a murder mystery just because that's what happens between the two protagonists. It just wouldn't fit in there.
