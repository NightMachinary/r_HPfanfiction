As an Author you have many options to Cover the "explicit" stuff. If you have written a lemon scene, but doesnt intend to keep it in the Story, you can still mark it "within" your Story as a Lemon Chapter "This chapter contains very explicit sex scenes. It only serves as a "Bonus" and you can completely skip it, as it doesnt have any important information, but i dont want to keep the dirty stuff from you guys, so enjoy" or something like that. You can also completely post this chapter as a One-shot with the Note that its cut content from your main story or you can (if the site rules forbid this) post this chapter on FF sites that allow this stuff and link it into your Fic.

I understand the possible worry, that you created a passage that you could keep, but isnt necessary for your Story, but it would "feed" the users, so you feel as if the Community decides, what you write. But the rest of the Story is your work and the cut content are 1-2% maybe.
