Also, writing sex scenes matters for pairings, in some respects, especially for Charlie/Hermione stories. Some of the most-reviewed and most-liked Charlie/Hermione stories feature numerous sex scenes. However, most of them are written with a Christian Grey-type mentality minus the BDSM (though some feature this). It's quite sad really as there's so much potential for a great Charlie/Hermione sex scene (one that isn't shoehorned randomly in the paragraphs) yet most authors (and readers) apparently don't care to build anything between them. They think that "having sex" is the build in their "relationship."
