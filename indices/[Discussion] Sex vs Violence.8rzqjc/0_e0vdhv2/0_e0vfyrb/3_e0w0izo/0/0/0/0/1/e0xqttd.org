  What's wrong with reading about what makes Harry feel good? What's the >problem with reading about how Ginny likes to be on top?
#+end_quote

Absolutely nothing wrong with it. The /problem/, to toss my two cents into the pile, is that I find it adds nothing to my writing. Some authors know how make a sex scene relevant beyond the smut. I don't. I also have zero interest in writing it. If people like reading it, great--there are many fanfic writers who produce that material.

Also, I'm a bit of a prude irl, which necessarily translates into my writing, to a degree. I can't take all of myself out of what I write.

I'm not trying to be combative, just offering an opposite perspective.
