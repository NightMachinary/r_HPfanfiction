I considered writing sex scenes for both of my stories, but I struggle to see the benefit of spelling out the explicit details of the act over simply implying it and then cut away when the foreplay was over. I mean, smut certainly has its place, but if I have a story with a romantic side plot, does showing that Harry cums when he is ridden really add value to it? Is there a benefit if the reader knows that they did it doggy style?

Maybe in a character-driven piece, but for most plot-driven stories the details of tab P going into slot V aren't really important. Talk about sex, pillow talk and the likes yes, those have benefits because they show us a lot of the characters. But lets say I'm writing Harry's first time making love (as in, with a deep emotional connection and not just to make his cock feel good), wouldn't it be more important to focus on how he, for the first time, feels loved and cared for, even safe in his partner's arms, how he relishes the comfort of her embrace as their gaze into each others eyes (and so on) instead of writing how awesome her cunt felt when it was stretched around his cock, followed by two pages of "The Kamasutra in 5 minutes"?
