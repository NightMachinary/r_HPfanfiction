Well, I for one would like to read those :) (unless it's slash, but then again: I do not read that in the first place and if the author isn't telling me it is slash at the start? Yeah you bet I will leave a less than friendly review!)

IMHO sex is natural, sex is beautiful and I don't get society's attitude towards it in the slightest! In fact I dislike society shaming sexuality (one of the reasons I truly hate religions - no, I don't want to ban them (I am all for religious freedom, as long as nobody tries to sneak in religious dogma into the laws because nobody who isn't a believer wants to live with religious laws but nobody is stopping believers living their dogmas either!) and I do talk about sex openly with friends and my partner (if I have one...I am single ATM and enjoying it!))
