Porque no los dos? I used to do the same "fade to black" and I got complaints. People /like/ to read about the sweating, the shuddering, the weird sounds, the skin that sticks together, the bed that squeaks, the occasional muscle cramps, the spontaneous laughter, the mumbled words ... there is so much more to sex than getting a dick wet and coming.

What's wrong with reading about what makes Harry feel good? What's the problem with reading about how Ginny likes to be on top? Two characters having a dominance fight in bed can be very eye-opening as to their personalities, no? Foreplay is all well and good, but descriptions of sex don't have to be mechanical. There's room for dialog and thoughts along with actions. I'd paste in an example, but this thread is not marked NSFW and I've been yelled at for that before.

It's fine if it's not your cup of tea--if you're not interested in it, then no amount of arguing is going to make you interested, but I do think it's maybe not quite right to assign a value judgement to it.
