I think it's very much tied to culture. A lot of people in this thread have said they're uncomfortable with it. Why? Because we are raised to perceive sex and everything associated with it--wanting to look at it, read about it, write about it--as something dirty and shameful. Even basic intimacy is hard to read and write for a lot of people because we're so cut off from it.

I've written my share of plot-what-plots and I've gotten lots of compliments on them over the years and I've had a lot of fun writing them. There is some sex in my longer works and I've had people actually be surprised that the scenes furthered the plot. Why wouldn't they? The story is about two people learning to live and grow together, so wouldn't sex and intimacy naturally be part of that?

Writing about sex and intimacy has helped me to think about my own relationship and how it's changed over 20-some years of being together. So many of the requests on here are for adult-themed stories, a lot of times under an "asking for a friend" vibe. No, you are asking for you and you owe it to yourself to be upfront and honest about it.

Violence, on the other hand, absolutely surrounds us in often the most mundane ways. A man throwing a homeless man's belongings in the lake, a person casually knocking someone over and taking their phone, a gang breaking windows of cars to steal backpacks--this is all around us and astoundingly, heartbreakingly common. But, it's easier to write about because that violence is something outside of you--separate and safe. Writing about two characters sharing an intimate moment is more akin to baring your inner self for the scrutiny of strangers and that takes a lot of guts.
