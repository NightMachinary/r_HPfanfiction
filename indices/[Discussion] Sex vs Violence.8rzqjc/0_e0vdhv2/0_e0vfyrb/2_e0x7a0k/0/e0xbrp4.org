That is more literary based I'd argue. Let's say the epilogue had Harry married to Demelza Robins, with two kids, a cat and an owl. Half of the readers would wonder who the fuck this woman even is and the other half would wonder how she ended up with Harry. You can't do such an asspull relationship (and even the canon ones felt like one of those) and expect it to go over well. You need build up, and unless you're writing a "Song of Ice and Fire" level epic, you don't have the time to write a proper relationship, have it fall apart, let Harry recover, slowly build a second one and repeat that seven times until you get the average number of relationships prior to marriage. You still have Voldemort to deal with, your goal is not to write "Sex in the Castle: Hogwarts unleashed". Therefore writing anything more than a second relationship is not feasible, at least if you want to have a plot besides who fucks with whom.
