Didn't talk about canon (as bad as Harry/Ginny was IMHO...I would have preferred Harry/Hermione, but then again: Even that pairing is far from ideal if both don't do a lot of growing up! Harry needs to get over his wanting to be "just Harry" and coasting by (Hermione would be more impressed by him if he truly wants to learn things!), while Hermione needs to let go of her authority worship and book-knowledge worship! Not to mention that she has to become a lot more open minded (as it stands it's her opinions/her way or the highway!)), but yeah:

Dating around (using the war as an excuse is kind of bad, especially since the fighting didn't really touch Hogwarts - sure Harry got hurt some, but over all most people weren't seeing Deatheaters regularly!) and getting married outside of one big happy Weasley-Family would have been great (IMHO for all of them! Ron/Hermione makes no sense what so ever IMHO and Harry/Ginny really came out of left field IMHO! Especially after we see her getting over her silly book-hero crush, even after Harry saves her life!)
