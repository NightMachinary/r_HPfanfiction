Or the one relationship marry your school sweetheart thing (no! Unrealistic! People tend to date around and not get married at 18 fresh out of school! (Well, at least not many do - some cooky cults might do this...I mean I've got a friend who had someone in his class who was married at 16 in Germany (no, not an immigrant who came in married))...but not the mainstream! Hell, I myself am advocating that people below 30 should not get married at all and establish themselves financially first before even thinking about it!)) :(
