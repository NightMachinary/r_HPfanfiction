I think a lot of authors are more comfortable writing violence than sex.

Partly this may be a cultural thing - in most of the media we consume (which in turn influences how we learn to tell stories) violence is handled much more openly than sex. Partly it may be down to the part where a badly written fight scene just sounds clunky, where a badly written sex scene is /funny/. Most authors, unless they're TRYING for funny, don't much like being laughed at.
