First of all, thank you for your efforts you put in such detailed answer.

To be honest, putting aside the cultural aspect, I don't see big difference between sex and violence.

Both of them often have huge effect on personality development. While violence is often use in fanfiction, a very rare story correctly describes how it affects characters. Mostly it's just a bloody picture for no reason and in that way I don't see how it's different from bad smut.

Everything you've described about personal and social consequences of sex can be also applied to violence. For example, PSTD is a very serious mental issue that affects a person and people surrounding him or her.

I believe with some efforts it's possible to find a lot of literature (including ancient) about sex. For example, it's possible to start with Kama Sutra. The only question is if an author actually wants to put some efforts into it.

As I said in another thread I'm not voting to add sex everywhere. I started this topic with very specific case in mind: when an author is very comfortable with detailed violence, but then he or she chickens out with sex.

I understand that it's all about the author's skills. It's just very rare to see an author trying to improve in painting different aspects of human relationships including sex.
