Well, there is one specific reason why good relationship scenes are hard to come by-intimacy.

Violence is often obvious and/or public in nature. It's methodically tracked, dissected and digested by people every time they read a book or watch the news/movie/tv series/docco of their choice. It's something everyone is exposed to on a regular basis and has clear guidelines on how people react to it-or how they should to at least.

By comparison, relationships are intimate, dynamic and discrete (in the mathematical sense) affairs. No two are quite the same and no two end in the same way. So when it becomes a topic of interest, it runs the risk of alienating its readership because they have Views on how the character should react vs how they react in the fic.

That's where I think the cultural aspect comes into play-the expectations one extends onto the characters in given situations.

Conflict has expectations and emotions that are easy to portray because they're nigh-on ubiquitous already. Even the worst of atrocities has guidelines for general portrayal of the events and people's reactions to them-even if the portrayals don't accurately reflect what people's actual reactions to them were. Consequently, you can portray a fight with little risk of rebuttal or condemnation if you stick to the script.

Relationships have very few such guidelines in comparison because the actions depend on the characters themselves rather than the events they are participating in. What few rules there are are informed by the writer's point of view-and that point of view can change drastically when planning things out.

It's both a more liberating and paralysing thing to write about because it's so free-form. A ton of things can go wrong and, in some cases, everybody's wrong is the couple's right. Like when it turns out one of them gets off from being subjected to violence or collapses into a crying mess at the thought of taking off their socks during coitus. Or using citrus fruit as a sex toy. Or only being able to have sex when you have a cat staring at you. Or what constitutes 'talking to your significant other'.

Point being, people are weird. And weird people probably do have weird approaches to relationships. And while the writer may be hunky dory in writing out such things (imagine just how funny you could make such discoveries-"and that's how Hermione Granger found out that cat fur was her personal aphrodisiac" practically writes itself), it would make people uncomfortable reading it because of the intimacy involved in two people experimenting that way.

It would make a great alternative/addition to the standard journey of self-discovery though, where the hero learns as much about themselves through their companion as they do through questing. Hell, a good heroic duo where the obstacles get overcome quicker when the two explore each other and themselves just as thoroughly as they solve puzzles would make for an awesome fantasy series.

But there is always the question of how to portray such intimacy, which is always the sticking point with the readers. The impersonality of violence and porn, with its rules and guidelines, is comfortable when compared to a scene where a couple gets drunk in a tavern and ends up accidentally fucking a fruit basket rather than each other.

The question of intimacy is the difference between relationships and violence. One thrives on it, the other can take it or leave it.

But... There exists a big exception.

One on one duels.

And now I am off to bed. Good night.
