It's because writing about fights and battles is relatively easy. Individual/team A goes up against individual/team B in environment X. Insert variable Y and account for changes in situation during the fight (environmental damage, injuries, deaths on sides A and B) and you are halfway to writing a gripping and emotionally charged encounter between the two parties.

Violence in general is also generally easy to write. Pick an atrocity of your choosing, any atrocity you can think of and chances are very, very good that there will be tons of documents telling you everything from the circumstances behind such events to the psychological profiles and side-effects to excrutiatingly detailed and graphical accounts on how such atrocities were carried out in the past.

If you write about concentration camp-style genocides, you have the Nazi Kz-Lager and the Stalinist Gulag models that you can draw from, both with extremely detailed accounts about how they were run, by whom, when, why and where. If you want to write about the violent subjugation and torture of an entire country, then you will have examples ranging from the Romans to Leopold the second to draw on-along with hundreds of examples in-between. Even street-level violence is easy to research, what with the proliferation of police dramas and true crime documentaries available.

And the more documented the atrocities are, the easier it will be to write about them. Eyewitness accounts become protagonists, forensic reports become scenes, reconstructions become set-pieces.

With the sheer amount of inventive and oftentimes creative ways humans have thought up to kill, subjugate, incapacitate, cripple or enslave other humans, the depth and breadth of violence you can write about is nigh-on endless and a well-written violence scene can often make an otherwise poorly put together piece of fiction.

Contrast that with writing about relationships and sex.

Let's say you have a character in a relationship. It's a first-person perspective you are writing in and your character isn't really a perfect psychic that interprets the thoughts and emotions of others completely correctly (unless he/she is and therefore likely some form of mary sue). They have to listen to their significant other and infer, deduce or otherwise come to a conclusion as to what the other party wants/needs/knows/is confused about in relation to themselves. If they get it right, good things happen. If they don't, bad things happen. Most of the time. It depends on the other person.

You, as a writer, are essentially writing about a conversation between two people that's taking place in another room. The conversation is happening through speech, body language, clothing, habits, manipulation, deceit, love, fear and hate and doesn't end even when neither character is interacting with each other. It's the kind of conversation where the silences and absences are as much a part of the conversation as the actual conversation is. You have a definite understanding of what both characters are after-if you've done your due diligence and planned out their motivations for being in a relationship, which can run the gamut of 'I'm in love with this person' to 'he/she's ugly af, but I want to pop that cherry before the Dark Lord murders my ass, so fuck it. Literally.'... yeah-but you are writing it purely from one person's perspective. They don't have a clear idea as to what the other person wants or is trying to say at the best of times and have to play it by ear.

You have to convey credible reasons for assumptions and mistakes to be made, provide reasons for out-of-the-blue changes in the relationship dynamic, account for the delicate emotional balances of love, hate, jealousy, greed, avarice etc that determines how the couple interacts with each other and generally try to make the relationship feel credible.

And THEN we get to the sex. Which, when you first write it out, invariably reads like a parody of an Ikea instruction manual with a few 'massive', 'bulging' and 'erect's thrown in there for good measure. There's only so many ways that you can write 'gently insert slot A into quivering tab B' before quitting in disgust.

Which is why you, as a writer, will never feel happy with the scene and try to make the sensuous sensations take center stage to bail your sorry ass out before the readers, beta-writers and editors you show it to start impersonating drill sergeants.

Which is when you end up having to map out exactly what is going on, how it compares to the current relationship status between the couple(s), which way the sex actually shifts the relationship itself as it's entirely possible that even awesome sex can somehow ruin a relationship (yes, that's a consideration), what the participants feel from a sensational, emotional and psychological stand-point during the major points of intercourse and how the climax plays itself out on all the aforementioned levels.

And that's from first person perspective. Relationships are one of the rare instances where third person perspectives actually create more headaches for the writer, as a first person perspective can be used to fudge the other person's thought processes somewhat whereas a 3PP will actually have to account for a surface-level understanding of the other character at the very least.

There's also the teeny-tiny problem of keeping your characters interesting when their relationship can easily suffer from bloat and take up half the fucking fic if you don't carefully manage the scope of their interactions. Balancing the two coming off as complete retards and their relationship basically hijacking the whole thing is suffering.

Also, while relationships and sex are hard to write about, secondary consequences such as STD transmission, pregnancy, community reactions and other things also need to be detailed and accounted for. If two characters have consensual sex in a classical setting, the aftermath can oftentimes be considered disastrous to all parties involved if mishandled-and just brushing such issues aside can have disastrous consequences on the number of people reading your fics.

In the time it takes to write 5000 decent words about two people dating and having sex with each other, you can pump out tens of thousands of well-researched and carefully thought-out words depicting violence and pain on a level that will leave even the most jaded internet surfer reaching for the tissue box (mostly for tears, some because they don't want to wait for rule 35 to kick in) and drawn an audience likely to dwarf that a high quality romance section would have achieved.

The fact that it doesn't leave your wall covered in post-it notes detailing the psychological profiles of your two love-birds at each planned point of the fic is a definite bonus too.
