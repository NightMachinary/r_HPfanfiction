FFN rules certainly play a role. Yes, some smut's there, but those stories risk getting deleted if someone complains. And writing two different versions of a story, one for FFNet and one for Ao3, is tedious.

Then there's the fact that often, leaving it to the imagination of the reader works very well for what you want the scene to convey. Character development can be done prior or after the fade to black scene easily.

In the same vein, action scenes can leave an obvious conclusion of a fight to the reader's imagination. You don't need to describe an execution-style killing in gory detail - what needs the detail is usually the fight that led to this end.
