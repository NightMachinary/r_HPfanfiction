  FFN rules certainly play a role.

If FFN rules affects a story quality, why write for it? Is a bigger audience really worthy of reducing the story quality?

  Then there's the fact that often, leaving it to the imagination of the reader works very well for what you want the scene to convey.

Unfortunately there's also the fact that some authors don't really know what they want to convey with a scene of either sex or violence. Of they don't have enough skills to express their vision.

Very often "the fade to black scene" looks like a very cheap way of getting out of the situation the author put himself or herself into.
