  If FFN rules affects a story quality, why write for it? Is a bigger audience really worthy of reducing the story quality?

I agree. When I first started posting HP fanfic, I did so on a curated archive (Checkmated) in their "Bedchamber" section. That's gone by the wayside now, so when I came back to fanfic, I looked at FFN's rules and decided it was too restrictive for me and went to AO3. I actually had a commenter tell me that I should edit my stories and post them on FFN. And then I saw what was recommended here on FFN and decided that I'd just go ahead and post as-is there and if they get scrubbed, they get scrubbed and I have a home on AO3.
