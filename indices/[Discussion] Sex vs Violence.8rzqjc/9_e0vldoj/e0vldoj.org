Everyone is mentioning the cultural aspect, which may well have shaped my opinions to what they are. I feel that sex scenes are almost always a detractor. Very often romance is too. Violence is some times gratuitous but this direct conflict, which in HP FF is often central to the story, reads a lot better than sex for the sake of it.
