If you look at my other posts here you'll see I agree. However, I think it is a matter of moderation. I don't think excessive description of sex scenes is of much use unless in erotica, but even in a civil war narrative I don't need two pages dedicated to someone slowly pulling each of a victim's nails out, taking delight as the skin stretches and tears, etc. Don't dance around either, but don't spend more time than necessary in it. If you're writing a piece from a sex addict's perspective the sex is really important, if from a sadist's or a victim's perspective then violence or sex might be very important. Please though, tailor it carefully otherwise the most extraordinary things can become mundane.
