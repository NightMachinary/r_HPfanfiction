Extreme violence is often also pointless, I'm not going to deny that. I am not a fan of torture-porn horror films by any stretch of the imagination. I find them dull. I'm merely saying that for similar reasons I don't find there to be a need for sex. Violence is a more common occurrence when facing conflict (particular in a setting such as Harry Potter where an armed conflict is going on). You can avoid sex, that normally happens behind closed doors and unless the participants are interrupted or are up to it whilst something crucial is going on, doesn't have as much of a direct impact on the conflict.

I think there's definitely a point there to be made. Violence is weirdly more socially acceptable. However, it also makes more sense in most of the stories anyway.
