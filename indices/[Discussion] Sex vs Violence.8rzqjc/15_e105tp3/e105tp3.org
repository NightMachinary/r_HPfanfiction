Sex is harder to write well than violence is, and the most commonly used site - fanfiction.net - has a policy of not accepting explicit content. In practice that policy is inconsistently applied (there's /plenty/ of explicit content on the site) but even so, authors don't want their stories to just randomly disappear if someone decides to mess them about.
