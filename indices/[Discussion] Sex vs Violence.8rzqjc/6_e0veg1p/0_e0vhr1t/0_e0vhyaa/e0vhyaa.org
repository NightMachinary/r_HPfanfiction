It's not first hand experience but I guess I just have a easier time imagining it having committed some form of violence in small doses(Almost everyone has to some extent) . Sex is not something I can so readily imagine. No need to take my example though. It's no secret that I'm not completely right in the head.

I can't speak for rape though. I have never considered it and it falls in the sex category for me.
