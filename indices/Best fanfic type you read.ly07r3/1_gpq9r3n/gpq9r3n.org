I haven't read this trop- and it's made stop and think a bit. How interesting...I really love to read Severitus- I definitely love me some Snape turns strict-but-caring daddy. Recently I've gotten into Snamione. Basically, I'll read anything that is Snape-centric, he's by far my favorite character and I enjoy reading what people can do with him.
