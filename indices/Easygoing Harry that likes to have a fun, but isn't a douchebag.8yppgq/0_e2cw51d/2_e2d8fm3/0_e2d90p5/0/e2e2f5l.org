That is good to hear. I might read it! I do not understand so many people's obsession with romance. Romance is not even romantic, because romanticizing of romance is what people think of as "romance". Real life romance is just...yes, just hanging out and eating food and doing all the things you do with your sister or friend anyway, except you're allowed to kiss them and stuff too. I do not think that is a good bonus though.
