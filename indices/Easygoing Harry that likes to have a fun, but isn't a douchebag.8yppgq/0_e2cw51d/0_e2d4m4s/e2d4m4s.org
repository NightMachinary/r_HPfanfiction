I wish more fics had this characterization of him. It feels like every fic I read he is either really nice and boring or a powerful wizard who is a complete jerk.

I love the sassy, not afraid to speak his mind, easy going but still kind at heart Harry. His sarcastic and sometimes a bit skeptical view on things combined with his empathy for others is refreshing to read. There is also so much great dialogue between him and Voldemort/Snape because of it.
