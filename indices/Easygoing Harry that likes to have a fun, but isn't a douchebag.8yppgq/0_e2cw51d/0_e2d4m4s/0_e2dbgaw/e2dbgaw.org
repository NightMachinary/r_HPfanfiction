I always go back to this scene when I think of that:

  He hadn't even realized what the boy was doing until the rock actually hit him in the face, smashing into the bridge of his nose and part of his right eye. He stum back from the blow, tripped over something, and fell backwards... into a ditch. And fuck, that hurt.

  "You son of a ­­argh! You broke my nose!"\\
  "Well, you cracked my ribs, you damn psycho," Harry called back.

  Snarling, he wiped at the blood pouring from his nose, but it was instantly replaced, making the effort futile. He crawled out of the trench, but by then Harry ha disappeared. Marvelous.

  "Expelliarmus!"

  "Protego!" Voldemort snapped out automatically, shielding himself. He glared over at the cluster of trees the spell originated from. "This isn't Hogwarts, Harry. Y going to have to do better than that."

  "I don't want to fight you. It's pointless."

  "On that we are agreed. You should remain still and take your punishment like a man."

  "How about I take it like a fourteen year old and sit in my room until I've learned my lesson."

  Voldemort let out a laugh. "I've missed you, Harry, I really have. No one else can survive being this cheeky with me." Then he had to spit, as the blood from his leaked into his mouth. Yuck.

  "I missed you too," and that sounded sadly sincere. "Do you think we could start over?"

  "This isn't a board game, Harry. We can never go back to what we were. You've made sure of that." He murmured a spell, static voca, under his breath, and mo of view, taking a circuitous route towards Harry's location.

  "... Could we at least stop trying to kill one another?"

  "I'm not trying to kill you. I just want to make you suffer," he said, and though he was moving closer, it sounded as if his voice were the same distance away.

  "How's that working out for you?"

  "I can honestly say, I've never had the novel experience of a broken nose. I feel obliged to share it with you."

  "I already broke my nose, remember? Moody and that damn potion."

  "... Oh... how about your fingers?"

  "...Yes?"

  "When?"

  "... Uh... at Durmstrang?"

  "If you don't sound convinced of your own answers how do expect to convince me..."

Classic.
