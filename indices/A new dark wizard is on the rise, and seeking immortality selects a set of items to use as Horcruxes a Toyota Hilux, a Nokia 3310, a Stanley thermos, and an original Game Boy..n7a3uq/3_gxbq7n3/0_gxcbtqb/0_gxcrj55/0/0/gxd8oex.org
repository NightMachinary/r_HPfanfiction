We had a 1982 Hilux when I was younger, and it had a petrol enhine in it, presumably the 22. I swear, whenever we came to a hill, the car would laugh and say: "I hope you brought some supplies, because we are going to be here a while."

My dad finally had enough and put un an engine from a Toyota Crown, and it was much better after that.

Yes, cars used to be very easy. We used to have a Å koda 105, and my dad always had an engine handy, because they would overheat, and go bad really easily. It took like 20 minutes to swap out the engine. It was tiny, had a couple of plugs and was held in place with four bolts.
