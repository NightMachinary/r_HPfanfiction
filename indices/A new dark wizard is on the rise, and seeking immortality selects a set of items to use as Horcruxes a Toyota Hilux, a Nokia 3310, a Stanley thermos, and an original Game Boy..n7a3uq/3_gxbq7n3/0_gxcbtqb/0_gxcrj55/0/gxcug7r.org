Ah yeah where I live we don't salt the roads, and I don't live at the coast so I never had rust problems lol.

And yeah the 22re was an underpowered little Toyota tractor engine, but god damn that thing will run forever. And they are SOOOOO EASY to work on.

I never did get my hands on a 22ret, but I ended up doing an OM617 swap anyways it was a Mercedes diesel if you aren't familiar with it
