Yes it is canon that Merlin went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin house but other than those two facts there's nothing else. The fic I linked above shows who Merlin was as a child and more specifically who he was before he became a legendary figure. As for yours and others quibbles about dates and time frames, one of the main themes of that entire fic is that specifics become confused or forgotten over the ages.

Also I if it helps I read this fic before I found out it merlin in Slytherin was canon and up until I found out it's canon Slytherin!Merlin in general became my head canon.
