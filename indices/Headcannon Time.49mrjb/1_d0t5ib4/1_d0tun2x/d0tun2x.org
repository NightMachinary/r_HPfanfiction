Is it really headcanon if your image of Merlin aligns with what is known of him in history and popular culture? The Merlin as he is represented in the books works perfectly well. It is only when JKR decided on Pottermore (It is Pottermore, where this particular nugget comes from, isn't it?) that you are suddenly forced to make up a headcanon about him because she insisted on him being born AFTER the muggles had already written about him.

The Merlin of muggle myth precedes Hogwarts by about 500 years.

Of course, you could always make the wizarding Merlin a great big fake. Someone who styled himself after a figure of legend and was skilled enough to be convincing when he scammed the gullible.
