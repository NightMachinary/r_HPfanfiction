ooooh! A fic where healers have set themselves up as ,basically , magical Switzerland. I love the idea and I love the fic you linked.

for me I have three fics that became head cannon but unfortunately I can't remember the name of the third fic.

This fic has captured my imagination and made potions and potion making magical. What Harry does in this fic when he's brewing or making a wand is the very essence of what I imagine Snape's doing when he's experimenting or what Olivander's very first bumbling steps into wandlore would have looked like. Ignore the middle earth setting and ignore the silly names for the silly people and just appreciate how magical potion making is. Because of this fic I will never be able to go back to canon or fics where potion making is just following a recipe step by step by step until completion.

This fic has become my personal headcanon for what early hogwarts would have looked like, how the founders would have interacted among themselves and how not evil Slytherin and Gryffindor were. Neither of them were evil, nor were they saints but rather they were just flawed humans beings doing what they thought was best. This fic also sets my headcanon for what Merlin would have been like as a child during his formative years in Slytherin -Slytherin's?- house.

The final fic I've lost the title for but it holds two spots in my heart that are near and dear to me. The first thing it did was show me a believable post war Draco doing what he loved and what he loved doing was fixing stuff. He works as a magical custodian and maintenance man, the story being that he discovered his passion for fixing things while he was working on the cupboard in sixth year and never stopped wanting to fix things.

The second thing that fic did is... well... It made me realise I'm a lesbian. There's a scene where Harry and Draco were kissing and it goes into excruciating detail on what Draco's lips felt like pressing up (and around) Harry's lips. I almost barfed, then I spent the rest of the day thinking about all the times I'd kissed men, which means I spent the entire day feeling ill.

So there's my headcanon and something completely different I look forward to hearing about everyone else's headcanons and maybe getting a few more for myself out of the deal.
