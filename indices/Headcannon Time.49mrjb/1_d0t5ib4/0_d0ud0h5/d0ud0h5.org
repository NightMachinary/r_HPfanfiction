  The second thing that fic did is... well... It made me realise I'm a lesbian. There's a scene where Harry and Draco were kissing and it goes into excruciating detail on what Draco's lips felt like pressing up (and around) Harry's lips. I almost barfed, then I spent the rest of the day thinking about all the times I'd kissed men, which means I spent the entire day feeling ill.

I actually made an account just to reply to this; about a year ago, I came across an HP/TR fic and the story was decent, but there was some really well-written smut in it, and I was absolutely baffled by the fact that it turned me on. So, much like you, I eventually figured out that I was at least bisexual. Unfortunately, I've looked for the fic itself many times just to revisit and see what it was that allowed me to discover my sexuality, but I haven't been able to find it at all. :( Anyway, just wanted to share a similar experience!
