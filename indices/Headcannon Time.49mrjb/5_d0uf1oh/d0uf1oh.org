I think this is linkffn(the forest of valbone). The sorting hat is actually the remains of gryffindor's horcrux. Godric felt remorse, healed his soul and passed on, leaving the hat behind. My single favorite feature of any fic. The sorting hat is far and away the smartest magical object we find . . . with the possible exception of Tom's diary, so I feel it makes sense. I also like how it blurs the line little between slytherin, the "evil" house and gryffindor, the "good" house.
