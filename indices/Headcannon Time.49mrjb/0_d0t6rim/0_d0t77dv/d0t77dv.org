I've seen it quite a few places, and I've got it stuck in my head that Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel were not the original names of the two people. It was either a Dread Pirate Roberts situation where their Stone and Alchemical prowess was a complete hoax, or the pair of them just killed off their names and started new lives every once in a while. Who knows why they lived for 600+ years with the same identities, but I kinda figured they had been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years already when they chose those two. And with as widespread as the relationship 'Nicholas' had with Dumbledore, it would have been easy to fake their death and start new lives.
