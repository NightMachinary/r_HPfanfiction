The Philosopher's Stone was either a fake or one of a pair.

Do you /really/ think someone who's been alive for 600+ years is just going to hand over the sole source of their immortality to use as Dark Lord bait without so much as a "by your leave"?

Also, parseltongues are immune to the Death Gaze of a basilisk. I like that too much to write it otherwise.
