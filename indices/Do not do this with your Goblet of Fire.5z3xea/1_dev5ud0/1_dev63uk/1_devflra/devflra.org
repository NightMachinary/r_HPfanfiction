Well, considering that it was /wizards/ who made it, it would probably contain some /really/ nasty curses. Considering that this is Barty Crouch Jr. who set the enforcement policy, he probably picked the nastiest one he could find, one that would make the muggles suffer.

My idea, which comes after binging on /Worm/ fanfics, is that the goblet sets everyone in a [[http://worm.wikia.com/wiki/Gray_Boy#Abilities_and_Powers][Gray Boy loop.]] You know those time travel fics where the traveler /can't stop/ repeating, like the original Groundhog's day movie? Now imagine if that loop was anywhere from 0.1 to 1 second long, and that the world around you keeps moving forwards while you're reset to the same position over and over again. And now imagine that any injuries you suffer in this loop never heal and constantly hurt you again. /That's/ a Gray Boy loop.

Imagine, the entirety of Britain mostly frozen, able to slowly talk one word or syllable at a time, but unable to ever leave that spot, forever tortured by injuries they receive. They are functionally dead, but most tragically /not./

Yeah, Harry Potter as written by Wildbrow would have been a very different, very depressing story.
