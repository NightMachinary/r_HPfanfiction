  Hmm...is 'the name was torn from one of Harry's homework assignments' actually canon, or is it just popular fanon?

It's not canon, but it is a canon-compliant possibility as we never learn what happened to Harry's homework assignments in general---so one of them might have gotten withheld for that very purpose---and making it happen that way eliminates one of the “what the heck” points of the entirety of how the Goblet of Fire works since, with it being a contract that one enters, you'd expect it to require someone to throw in their name that they themselves have willingly written and with just any random paper on which Junior would have written Harry's name it would then enter Harry into a binding contract with no action of his own whatsoever.
