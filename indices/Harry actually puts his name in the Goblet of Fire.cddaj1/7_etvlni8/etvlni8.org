Harry puts his name in the Goblet of Fire under Hogwarts, while Crouch does so under no school. Harry, of course, gets chosen twice, and now he must compete in each task twice or else lose his magic. Of course, this is a problem for the 2nd and 3rd tasks- they have to acquire a time turner so he can complete them simultaneously.
