I really liked the Battle of Diagon Alley in linkffn(Divided and Entwined), there's Harry with the special anti Voldemort weapon, Ron with his arsenal of Dumbledore's gadgets, the Twins with whatever they can get from their burning store, Sirius and the Order rushing in, the French allies helping after Voldemort's stunt in the Bastille, and Hermione's guerilla group arriving with machine guns, wands and grenades, all against Voldemort's Death Eaters in a massive and messy battle. The Avengers kinda didn't make it as the only surviving ex-member was still imperiused at the time. And the aurors arrived just in time for helping with the cleanup.
