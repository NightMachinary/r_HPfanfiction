Well, I'm partial to my own - the final battle takes place in two locations, over the course of two lengthy chapters, and at the end of over 750,000 words spread out over three fics. A lot of people are involved, most of whom receive a decent amount of character development over the course of the story. A couple start out more negative but gradually come into their own and play important, positive roles. The spells, the attitudes, and the plans are also all assembled bit by bit.

The villains get what's coming to them, the heroes get closure, and not all of those you're rooting for actually survive. There's one death which I'm sure is unexpected to most readers, but it was the only way for that character to get their "happily ever after" (which probably sounds like a contradiction, but it's true - and yet I still get a little choked up when I go back and reread it). And even that was set up, in some ways, well in advance.

Note: this story involves a female Harry with a femslash relationship, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea.
