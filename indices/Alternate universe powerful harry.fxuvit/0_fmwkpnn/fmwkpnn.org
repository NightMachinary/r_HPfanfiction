Linkffn(From Ruin) is almost cheating to suggest as it's the same plot (with permission) as "I'm Still Here." It's slightly longer, well written, but as yet unfinished.

Unfortunately most of the "powerful Harry from effin nowhere" stories I've seen have been time travel, rather than alternate universe - although at least one has ended up /creating/ an AU because of it. Linkffn(Wind Shear; Whiskey Time Travel; Delenda Est).
