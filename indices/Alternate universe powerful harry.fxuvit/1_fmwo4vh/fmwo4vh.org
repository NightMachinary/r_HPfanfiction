[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] is time travel but in the past long enough for it to be essentially an alternate universe. It's an intriguing premise where Harry travels to kill Tom Riddle but is stopped by Dumbledore. It's not quite your request but if you've exhausted a lot of time travel fics, this is my personal favorite of all time.
