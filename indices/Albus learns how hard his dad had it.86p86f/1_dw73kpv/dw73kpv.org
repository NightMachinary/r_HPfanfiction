I remember reading a fic where Albus try to prank James for payback with some type of potion in I think Pumpkin Juice. Instead both Harry and Ginny drank it. Both of them de-age with only memories up to that age. The three Potter siblings than had to take care of their parents in which they learn about their parents' past and what they went through as children.
