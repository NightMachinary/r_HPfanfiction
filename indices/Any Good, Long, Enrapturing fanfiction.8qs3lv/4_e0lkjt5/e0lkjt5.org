Everything by Slide. Their fics go pretty deep, they have 2 series that I've read - one follows the next gen kids in later school years & on an ill-advised gap year adventure, and the other follows a group of OC Slytherins a year ahead of Harry & co. Firsts of each: Linkffn(Latet anguis in herba) Linkffn(Ignite)

Linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) & all related stories by Northumbrian. Interesting interaction with Muggles throughout & interesting OCs.

Linkffn(Questions and Answers) and its accompanying canon is quite extensive and my favorite story. But it's a popular one so sorry if you've read it!

Linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) tells Snape's story. Canon compliant and very touching & believable

Harry Potter & the Summer after the war - it's not on FFN, I forget where it is... I have it bookmarked on my laptop but I'm on the bus rn so I'll post the link tonight! Looks like it is : linkffn(11593633) and its sequel: [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/14111507-harry-potter-and-the-winters-after-the-war]] Used to be on HPFF buuut yeah
