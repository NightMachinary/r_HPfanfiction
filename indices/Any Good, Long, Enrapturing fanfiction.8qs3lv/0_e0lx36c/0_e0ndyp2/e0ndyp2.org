Highly, highly, highly recommend Antithesis. I legitimately just finished the most recent chapter after reading it all in one day. I'm so glad I found this fic because it's the very best one I've read in a while. It's the only proper page turner I've read in recent memory and had me in tears at one point, balling near uncontrollably. I can't wait to see where it ends up.
