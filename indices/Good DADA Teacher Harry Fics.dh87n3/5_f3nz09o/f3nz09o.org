[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][The Archeologist]] has a old&ultra-competent (Curse Breaker) Harry that ends up back in time^{different universe}, as a female... who already died.

So she goes to [[https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Yharnam][Yharnam]]^{from Bloodborne, video game} to clear it up and establish herself as a major player in the Curse Breaker-business.

She also ends up as the +DADA+ History professor at Hogwarts... and this fic has my favorite depiction of Professor/Teacher-work at Hogwarts.

--------------

ps. The bloodborne crossover isn't pervasive in the fic and only exists as a place for Harry to clear up and reason for her fame.

edit: sorry, was history prof, not dada
