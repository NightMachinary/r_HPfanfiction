I'm going to cautiously leave my linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor).

There has rarely been a more unbashed Dumbledore than mine, and Hermione /definitely/ gathers a reputation as formidable... but your mileage may vary on how recognisable she is. I like to think that it's still apparent that she's the same old person from canon, but her circumstances have changed in increasingly major ways ever since her childhood, and so her end-result personality /is/ somewhat different.

As to Mary Sue, she is /not/ perfect and adored, and there's no romance in the story, but (largely because this is a comedy fic) she /does/ win more often and more thoroughly than realism would dictate.
