In addition to those already mentioned, here are several more:

- linkffn(Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter? by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel) is too tiny and incomplete, but still qualifies;
- in linkffn(The Morrigan by adriata) Draco is terrified of Hermione for a good reason (this is not this fic endorsement);
- linkffn(Without Her Letter by Colubrina).
