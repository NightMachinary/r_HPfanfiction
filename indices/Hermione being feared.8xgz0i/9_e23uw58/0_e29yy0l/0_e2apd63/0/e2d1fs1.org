  And the way she portrays Riddle and Granger interacting in The Green Girl was a treat.

That struck me as one of the more blatantly Sue-ish elements of the fic. The fic seems to have this tendency of having people---hardened, selfish, suspicious, "Slytherin" people---just out and out give her things and trust her, without any reason to do so or asking for anything in return. Case in point, Draco, Nott, [[/s][Neville]], and others have to pass difficult tests and suffer to get Dark Marks, whereas Hermione just gets a pretty amulet that prevents anyone with a Dark Mark from hurting her.

Anyway, I'll give LotL another shot.
