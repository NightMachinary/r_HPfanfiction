My personal opinion, I'm not usually a big fan of G-bash/S-worship, but a well-written story is still a well-written story. I've recently read a few more of Colubrina's fics, and the way she writes (I'm assuming "she" and profusely apologize if I'm wrong) dark and/or evil characters is really excellently done.

In Things in Common (linkffn(12473874)), the utter terror a certain character has at meeting the recently reborn Voldemort gave me chills. And the way she portrays Riddle and Granger interacting in The Green Girl (linkffn(11027125)) was a treat.

Like I've said, I'm not a big fan of Slytherin love fests (unless it's Haphne, my guilty pleasure within my guilty pleasure of fanfic reading), but Colubrina does an excellent job of making me root for the bad guys.

Honestly, in Lady of the Lake, which I decided to re-read after finding the link to recommend to you, I loved every bit of it once again. I really like Zabini's explanation of why he fears/hates muggles and muggle-born. Luna is characterized excellently here, as both a little crazy and totally loyal to her friend/s.
