Depending on your crack tolerance levels in my own linkffn(LIke a Red Headed Stepchild) Hermione developes a reputation as a terrifying slayer of beasts and monsters, and also for actually being a Weasley. Unfortunately for her the reputation is mostly the fault of Gilderoy Lockhart and negligent journalism, but the Weasley bit is her own fault for drinking one of the twins potions.
