There's probably someone better at writing the sort of plot you're asking for (though I'd love to I'm not sure I feel up to writing good fluffy happiness from nice characters), but it's not for lack of will, and if by some weird twist of fate you find nobody else I'll be happy to help.

What you're describing is, oddly enough, something I've never heard before around here. /Harry Potter/ would seem to lend itself to visual work easily, but somehow Harry Potter comics aren't really... a thing. Sure, there's a few good ones if you look, but it's a drop in the ocean of written fanworks. Heck, there's more fanfilms than there are proper comics.

Bottom line is, I may not be able to write it (though I'd love it), but I'll be a reader for sure!
