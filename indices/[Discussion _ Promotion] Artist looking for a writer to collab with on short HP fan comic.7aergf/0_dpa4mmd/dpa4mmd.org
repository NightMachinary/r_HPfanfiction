I would be interested in this. Going through a rough time at the minute and would like to write something fluffy and short to get back into it. I am also between jobs at the moment so have plenty of time to fill. Here is my profile: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/]]

I usually write about Ginny (my favourite character) and Harry but I'm not a big shipper. My most popular fic was a "what happened during DH" fic, and I really enjoy those missing moments type scenes. At the moment I am really interested in themes of family and motherhood, but open to anything. I stay canon compliant because I am quite strict on characterisation.
