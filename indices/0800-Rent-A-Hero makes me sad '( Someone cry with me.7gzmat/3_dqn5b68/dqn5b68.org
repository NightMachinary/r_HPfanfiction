I can't cry over it - except maybe tears of frustration? I really fucking wanted to see what happens with Tonks.

Does anyone else get the sense that Tonks was pulling a double entrapment? I got a theory that the first time she was revealed with the patronus was maybe staged (though equally possible it was accidental)... and then there were all the apologies, the pledging of her loyalty and the dark magic healing she used to transfer Harry's wounds to her. The talk by Mr. Tonks too felt kind of too well constructed to lead Harry towards a favorable decision. As I was reading all that, my gut was telling me that she pulled all that shit to make Harry trust her (because she was finally confessing to the "truth) and she /still/ intended to report to the Order. Leading to a possibly even bigger "oh shit" moment in the future, when Harry would discover her continued spying and shit would spectacularly get fucked up.
