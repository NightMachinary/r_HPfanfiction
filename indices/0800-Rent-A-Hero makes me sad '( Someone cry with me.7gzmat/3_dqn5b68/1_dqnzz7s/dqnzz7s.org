Tonks was the best part tbh. /spoiler warning!!!/ At first I really hated the whole Amanda subplot but the Tonks reveal was awesome. I wish it would be double thing you're talking about, but I gotta say I'm not sure. I have a sense from the writing that it might just be Tonks falling in love with Harry, tho what you're talking about sounds way more interesting. Not that we will ever know :(
