It's pretty clear that that's not the case tbqh. Dumbleodore is multiple hundreds of years old at this point (just look at that sweet ass medieval beard) so he's definitely got the whole metamorpagus timeturning thing figured out from his brief fling with WWII starting self-cest because I'll bet you never noticed that if you rearrage the letters in Grimdelwald you're just a few letters short of a Dumbledore, symbolizing how Dumbledore was always just a few cuts above the rest of humanity in intellectual power. See when scar man shows up he thinks huh. That's a potential sex slave but legal so he takes steps. First he tries Tonks because why not give cuckoldry a shot because what's the wosrt that could happen when you can just kill one of the participants and replace them but then that gets fucked up because tonka is incompetant so he decides that if you need the job done right you need to di it yourself and kills her to take her place in scar slave's bed. Unfortunately Andromeda notices so he has to do the same to her. So at this point we've got at least 5 sub-Dumbledore's running around to get Dumbledore prime's rocks off but we don't know from where in the time stream each Dumbledore is or whether there are more around we haven't found out about and maybe evern some that the Dumbledore's don't know about because obliteriating yourself is high fashion for wizards which realy explains the state of their schooling if you think about it.

Does that help with the frustration?
