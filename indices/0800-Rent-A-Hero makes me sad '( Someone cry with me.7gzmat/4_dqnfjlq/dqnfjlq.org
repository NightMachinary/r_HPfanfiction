Yeah I was following it while it was still updating. He went through about 2 months of updating every second Sunday, then went dark for about 8 months. Then he did the same again for about 3 months, I used to love coming home on those second Sundays anticipating a new chapter, then he just stopped again. Been nearly 2 years now, I still nurse a tiny bit of hope that he will come back to it, but it is one of those stories that is slightly painful to think about. It would be so much better if it was a shitty story, but it really hit all the right notes, and he was so close to getting to the meaty part of the story, its what makes it so bittersweet to read.
