Ooooh I've got just the one for you! One of my absolute favourite fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1349676/1/Bend-It-Like-Weasley][Bend It Like Weasley]] by Jedi Tess of Gryffindor. It's about... well, kids from all the houses coming together to form a quidditch team, coached by a rather unexpected individual. This is the funniest fanfiction I've ever read and I've been reading fics in the HP fandom for a very long time now. It's lighthearted, but with an interesting plot and it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Try it out! :)
