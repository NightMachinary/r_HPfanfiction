Reincarnation fics aren't that rare(though weirdly they seem more prevalent in other fandoms than in HP), though they are usually people from our world instead of another fictional world. Which is shame as that concept sounds interesting to me. So yeah this might not actually exist :(. Maybe I should make another topic where I request fics where characters from any other fictional world are reincarnated into HP, or the reverse. That would hopefully have more matches.
