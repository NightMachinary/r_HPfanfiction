I second "The Flat Next Door", even though it's not a reincarnation fic.

"Flowers, Hold the Funeral" by amusewithaview is a one shot that has Buffy reincarnating as Harry's twin sister. I really enjoyed it, although by the time I got to the end of the story I was very disappointed it was just a one shot and didn't cover any of their Hogwarts years.
