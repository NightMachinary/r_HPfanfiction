Seem interesting, and well written thus far, but fairly different than what I meant. Was specifically looking for fics where the two universes are still separate, but a Buffy character is reborn into the HP world either as a main char or an OC, and then either has their memories immediately or they are unlocked at some point early on (thus enabling the skipping of most of the pre hogwarts time period). This looks good though so I will read it.
