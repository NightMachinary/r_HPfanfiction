fanon Harry, for sure...

canon Harry, I'm honestly not sure. The closest scenario we have is the "not strong enough" crucio to Bellatrix just after Sirius death.

- In pro of not killing him: There would have been more time passed after the death of Ron to facing Percy than it was when he faced Bellatrix (so not as hot headed)

- In pro of not killing him: He didn't even try killing curse against Bellatrix, just crucio, which is a step down.

- In pro of killing him: Harry might feel Percy's betrayal to the Weasleys even bigger than Bella to Sirius.

- In pro of killing him: MIght be the drop that spills the glass

Of Hermione... we don't really have anything in canon to know how would she react to this.
