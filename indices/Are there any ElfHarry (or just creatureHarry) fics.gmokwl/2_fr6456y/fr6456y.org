Linkffn(Breath of the Inferno) is a pretty good one. Harry undergoes a transformation into a Dragon, then lives in a goblin mine for a while.

I really like this one because unlike 99% of stories, Harry is just chill throughout the entire story. There are no "punishment scenes", sappy cryscenes, edgy rants, etc. It's just "hey, how are you? I'm a dragon, btw. Cool, huh?"
