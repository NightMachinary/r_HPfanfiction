There was a fic similar to this. I don't remember what it was called but it was about how Dumbledore had time traveled several times and tried to change things each time, but they never worked out (he specifically stated that every time Harry did not stay with the Dursley's he dies before the age of 6) and that was why things had to happen the way they did even though it might be hard.
