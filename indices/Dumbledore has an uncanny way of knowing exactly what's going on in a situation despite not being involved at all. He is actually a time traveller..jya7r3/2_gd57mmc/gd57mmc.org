I came up with a silly idea in this vein some time ago. Dumbledore's ridiculous outfits is in fact him exploiting chaos theory from multiple travels by making specific people notice them and interpret them differently, causing subtle changes that ultimately spiral into very different futures. This is why Harry & co were as ridiculously lucky as they were: if he failed, Dumbledore just spun back the clock and used a different outfit.
