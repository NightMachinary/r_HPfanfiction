  Would he even have a quarrel with that Voldemort in the first place?

Probably, yeah. Not because of any personal or moral qualms, mind.

It's just that Voldemort, in most forms we see across the multiverse, is an insane megalomaniac.

He doesn't share. He doesn't negotiate. He doesn't keep any deals made.

And is quite obsessed with Da Prophecy, so he'd be a threat regardless of what Harry did. How much of a threat is debatable, but still a problem needing a permanent solution.

This makes diplomacy and seeking any kind of equitable settlement mostly a waste of time, but using him to cause chaos and devastation so that people who would oppose DL Harry die fighting Voldemort and the rest are cowed... Now that's a thought.

Additionally, defeating him later would mean Harry would be able to benefit more when time came to finally remove 'Ol Snake Face.

I love this plot point.

Normally, the WBWL fics are all about WBWL, and the MC is edgier than a monofilament wire. This, however, introduces a secondary protagonist that is easy to sympathize with.

Rejected, lost... There is no Deus ex machina, there is no white knight here. The one 'saving' the Girl Who Lived has ulterior motives. And it's interesting!

Because we see the moral contrast: Dark Harry is this terrible warlord, conqueror and tyrant... But at the same time he's the one helping the downtrodden GWL we have come to like. He's using her... But he's also making her happier, safer and more aware than she had been before...

Yes, I absolutely adore the concept.
