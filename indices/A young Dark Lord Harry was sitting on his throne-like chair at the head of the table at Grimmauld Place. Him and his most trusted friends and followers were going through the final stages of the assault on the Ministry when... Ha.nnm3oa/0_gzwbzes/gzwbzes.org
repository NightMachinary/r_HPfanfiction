"So since Dumbledore went through so much effort to summon you, a 'prophecied hero' who has defeated Voldemort, why aren't you going and destroying him?" Rose Potter asked him with a frown.

"...Because I have fulfilled the prophecy in /my world/ corresponding to me and defeated Voldemort. /Your world/'s prophecy corresponds to you... only you can kill Voldemort." Harry didn't expect her to beam like this - Dumbledore summoning him must have really alienated her.

"The way I defeated Voldemort probably won't help you - in my world, my mother Lily Potter left me the Power He Knows Not." At Harry's statement, Rose sighed and shook her head.

As it turned out, Lily and James Potter were alive in this world. And that meant that Sirius Black had sacrificed himself to save Rose.

Unfortunately, this meant that Voldemort's usage of Rose's blood at the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament gave him more benefits. The reborn Voldemort wasn't the pale shadow he originally had to deal with, cornered by Dumbledore's schemes into a pig even Harry could slaughter.

Of course, currently Harry was strong enough to crush Voldemort himself. But that was a different matter.

"So, you can't defeat Voldemort. I definitely can't defeat Voldemort. Dumbledore can't defeat Voldemort, or he wouldn't have summoned you. Are we all doomed to die?" Rose said with a sarcastic tone.

"...Not quite. I can teach you some things that should get you strong enough to fight Voldemort. For example..."

Harry waved his wand and conjured a live parrot which loudly squawked. With another wave, he stunned it.

Rose was going to ask how conjuring parrots would help her when Harry pointed his wand and vocalized a spell.

"Avada Kedavra." A green jet of light killed the parrot.

With a wave, Harry vanished the dead parrot and conjured another one. "Voldemort's signature spell, the Killing Curse. I showed you the wand motions and the spell pronunciation. Now, use it on this parrot."

Rose gasped. But she didn't ask any questions, simply pointing her wand at the squawking parrot.

"Avada Kedavra." A green jet of light struck the parrot, causing it to loudly squawk and fly at the astonished girl.

Before it could touch her though, Harry waved his wand and vanished the conjured bird. "So there, you saw it. The Killing Curse. Voldemort can mow through crowds with this spell, while you can't kill a parrot. Do you know why?"

"Moody says that it requires genuine desire to kill. Moody also said that even if my entire class attacked him with that spell, he wouldn't even get a nosebleed." Rose said after a pause.

That's true. Voldemort can cast it as he pleases because he is a psychotic maniac who shattered his soul to remove the few inhibitions that remained. Yet you, the Girl-Who-Lived, managed to survive the spell. Why is that?"

"...Sirius. Sirius sacrificed himself before Voldemort, protecting me with the Power of Love. That's what Dumbledore said." Rose said haltingly, probably not even able to remember the man who gave his life to save hers.

"Yeah. I can teach you a bit about the Power He Knows Not, the probable Power of Love. I can also teach you about the powers Voldemort /does/ know. It will take time and effort for you to master the knowledge I teach you, but it will definitely help you. So, want to learn?"
