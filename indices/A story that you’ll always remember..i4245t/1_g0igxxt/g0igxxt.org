[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642]] - The Weasley Girl books. The Butterfly Effect at it's best, fantastic storytelling and a special mention goes to how trauma from the first book was handled. Definite read.

Such a beautiful oneshot, clocking in at just over 1,600 words, yet so impactful. The story speaks for itself better then I ever could.
