I know how fuck up the world would be as you put it.that doesn't stop me from wanting to read about such a world

and Good luck to any outsider trying to change it after all residents of the magical world would be effected by the Potion from age 11 at the oldest when they start school. and any muggle that tries to change it would just get obliviated

which i guess would be an interesting one-shot about some Muggle who keeps finding about about what the Wizarding world does and being obliviate over and over again till the continuous obviation destroys there mind. and most of the wizarding world wouldn't care even if they found out after all it was just a muggle that was poking there nose in were it wasn't welcome

Hows that for a distopian Wizarding world?
