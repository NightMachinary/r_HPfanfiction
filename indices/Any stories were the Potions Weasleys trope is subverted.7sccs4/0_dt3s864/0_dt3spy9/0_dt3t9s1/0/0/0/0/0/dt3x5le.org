I'm not a fan of a dystopia either

Any way I don't think it would be something that could be done on a large scale the way that your mind went to. The WIzarding world would not have enough Ingredient to do it on a mass scale and even Voldemort would probably only dose his inner Circle. if he used it at all after all the potion would make the death eaters loyal to Voldemort but would also make him loyal to them.(edit Voldemort wouldn't touch the potion with a ten-foot pole he would see being Loyalty to his followers as a weakness)

I was more thinking of it as something that say the Wizarding Community of Ottery St Catchpole (about five family's) Get together for a Yearly get together were they brew the Potion and them each person adds a hair to it ( likepolyjuice potion) and then mixing it into the food that is eaten at the event. with it acting more like a Year long Reputation gains Booster with anyone else who added DNA. with the more people who add DNA the Weaker and more Spread out the potions effect would be.

The individual Family's might use a Second Potion that only has to be redone When a new child is born.

or maybe a couple when they get Married

With the potion having a Temporary effect and greatly reduced effect on anyone that didn't also add there DNA
