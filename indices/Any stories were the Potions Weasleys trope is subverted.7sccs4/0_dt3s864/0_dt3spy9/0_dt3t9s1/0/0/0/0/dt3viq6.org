I'm not a fan of a dystopia when nothing changes. Harry seems to resist the mind magics quite well. If he can shrug off Voldemort's imperius then I doubt a mere potion would do the trick.

I'd read the story if Harry fought the system French revolution style, or even followed in the footsteps of the Mossad. But not if the fic merely shows how fucked up the magical society is.
