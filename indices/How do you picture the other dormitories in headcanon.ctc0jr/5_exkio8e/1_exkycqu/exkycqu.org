I always thought that the founders created the dormitories in there own image. / future heads of houses might of added things. So like- if Rowana Ravenclaw wanted a ceiling that replicated the night sky... she'd have just done that.

Or like, if Salazar wanted to be a creepy snake boi- he'd add that into the magical architecture. (Or future parseltounges would / people in future generations who wanted to define what it meant to be a Slytherin )
