Slytherin: ceiling is lower, but there's much more room. Two or three to a bedroom. The decorations vary by room, but all carry the color scheme of black, emerald green, and/or silver and the lighting is green. Windows show everything in the lake.

Ravenclaw: rectangular. The walls are like the ceiling in the great hall (headcanom was that Ravenclaw was the main architect), but they show some part of the grounds. So like one room has the forest and when it snows or rains they see it. The carpets are blue.

Never thought about Hufflepuff cuz I've never tried to write a puff Harry, but I imagine there's a bunch of flowers. That could be something from pottermore, though. Polished, brown wood floor and pale yellow walls.
