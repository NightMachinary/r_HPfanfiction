  Never thought about Hufflepuff cuz I've never tried to write a puff Harry, but I imagine there's a bunch of flowers. That could be something from pottermore, though. Polished, brown wood floor and pale yellow walls.

In Hogwarts mystery, which admittedly doesn't rank very high in my own canon focus, the hufflepuff common room is certainly full of flowers, with several references to them any time you're in there
