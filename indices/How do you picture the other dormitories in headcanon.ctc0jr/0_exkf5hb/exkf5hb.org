I've always pictured the Hufflepuff Common Room as looking very much like a Hobbit's home; full of interesting clutter, and very much with a warm, homey feel to it. Structurally I see it as a large circle, with curved walls and a low ceiling (picture the inside of a barrel, but significantly lacking in height), with some large circular windows to let in the light during the day.
