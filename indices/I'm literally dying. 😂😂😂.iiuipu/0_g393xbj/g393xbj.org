No doubt it's the boomer in me, but I can never find these "kid backchats someone in authority" scenes funny. For me they're just cringe, no matter who the authority figure is. And the cringe doubles if the kid gets away with it.

It's all just so.. undignified.

For me, the best put down of Snape is when Snape loses his cool, is shouting, spittle flying everywhere, clearly unhinged - as he was several times in canon - and Harry just takes the high road and makes Snape look childish in comparison. Because nothing undermines Snape's authority and dignity more than looking more childish than his students.
