Whispers in the night This fic is not for everybody between the polyamory and the insane levels of abuse The world building is great the characters are fantastic and the magic awesome It also has one of the best Harry/Tom parallels and interactions I have read. Things that we usually ignore because they are too tropey I actually like dread like the war against grindlewald family histories and magic.
