*Premise:* Harry learns the prophecy and interprets it as a death sentence. Instead having to be abused at the Dursley's, he goes around Europe under the pseudonym Mr. Black and many Forrest Gump-esque coincidences and events lead him through a comedic-journey of action and adventure.

*Status:* Complete, with sequels

*Thoughts About It:* It's pretty humorous. Other people disagree, but I think it's fine. It's not supposed to be serious, so I think it is fine.
