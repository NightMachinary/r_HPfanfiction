*Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake*

*Link:* linkffn(11982933)

*Status:* oneshot

*Thoughts:* A thoroughly amusing account of Harry and Ginny meeting the Marge and the rest of the Dursleys after the war. There is some liberty taken in characterisation (Ginny's inherited her father's love for muggle objects in this), but this is intended as a humor story, so that's okay. Ginny's snappy comebacks are great, and the Dursleys' well deserved fate is immensely cathartic.
