What do you mean? Some post-war reconciliation? Those I could offer:

- linkffn(6142629) and its (slightly less perfect, but longer) sequel linkffn(6329597).

- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]]

- rarely mentioned but still lovely linkao3(This Calls For A Toast, So Pour The Champagne by tinyporcelainehorses)

- or oldies but goodies [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/][This Means War by Jeconais]]
