#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley lives with the guilt of what his family had done to his cousin, which can never be forgiven. He resents the person he used to be and tries to live as a better person, but a part of himself can never truly get over how cruel he had been to the kind-hearted Harry. After a car accident, he wakes to find himself a child all over again.He sets out to make Harry's childhood better, as much as he can. All the while he must hide the fact, he too, now has magic as well. It shouldn't be too hard, should it?
