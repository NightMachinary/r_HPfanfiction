It turns up in at least a couple of the 19th century penny-dreadful vampire stories that culminated in Dracula. And I can't put my hand on my copy to confirm, but I seem to recall that the ship the eponymous Count arrives in England on had everyone aboard dead, down to and including the ship's rats, owing to his having fed on them.

(I'm no fan, but I think Twilight gets a lot of flak it doesn't deserve. Being completely bloody awful nonsense has been about half of the vampire story tradition for nearly two centuries now. If it wasn't complete crap /it wouldn't be a vampire story./)
