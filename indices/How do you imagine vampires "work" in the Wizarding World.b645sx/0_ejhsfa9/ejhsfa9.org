I was listening to POA last night and there was a moment in the sweet shop When Hermione said that the blood lollies were "for vampires, I expect". This would imply some level of integration with normal wizarding society, to the point that they're not really considered dangerous/scary like werewolves.

But then in HBP we do see a vampire, albeit briefly, and there's a sense that people are nervpus/uncomfotable and the guy that brought the vampire to the party has to control him a little. But he was still at the party and openly a vampire, so it's hard to say.

Perhaps it's unusual for a vampire to drink so much blood the person actually dies? Or perhaps they can, unfortunately like twilight, survive on the blood of animals?
