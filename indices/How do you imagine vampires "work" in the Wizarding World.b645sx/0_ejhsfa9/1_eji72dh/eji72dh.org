People can act nervous around people even if they are accepted into society. My own grandfather was raving about how a black man should be strung upon a wall and shot. They also sell clothes targeted towards black people in my area. Just because someone has legal protection and are being sold products doesn't mean they are accepted.

My own view/headcanon of vampires in HP is that they have legal protections, and they are seen in the same light as werewolves although they are less feared due to less attacks. The newer generation is uneasy, but they don't write home to their families complaining.
