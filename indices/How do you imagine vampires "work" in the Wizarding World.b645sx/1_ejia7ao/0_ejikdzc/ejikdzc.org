  wouldn't it be odd, therefore, if such an easily-accessed (and, as [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] notes, relatively well-integrated) path to immortality existed, that Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone would be seen as such a big deal?

I think it depends on the drawbacks. If vampires immediately burst into flames and died if they touched sunlight, had a violent garlic allergy, couldn't eat mortal food at all (turns to ash in your mouth), couldn't step on holy ground or enter people's dwellings without an invitation - /plus/ having to consume human blood, which for most humans that really consider it would probably seem more than a bit horrifying...would vampirism still be worth it as a way to become immortal?

I think a lot of wizards would say no, absolutely not - especially considering that souls are a known thing that definitely exist in the wizarding world, and an easy argument could be made for death not being the end. If you sought immortality, vampirism would be an unattractive option compared to the Philosopher's Stone (drawback-free, as far as I know) and Horcruxes (which have the added advantage of allowing you to survive total disembodiment) and probably most other options, if they exist.
