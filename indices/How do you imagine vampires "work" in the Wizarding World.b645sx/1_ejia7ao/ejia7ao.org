A key point from the way they're discussed (in the same bag as Hags, Goblins and Veelas), HP vampires appear to be a separate humanoid species from Muggles and wizards, as opposed to people under a curse. This only makes sense, as the core of vampirism-as-a-curse is that it's a pathway to immortality; and wouldn't it be odd, therefore, if such an easily-accessed (and, as [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] notes, relatively well-integrated) path to immortality existed, that Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone would be seen as such a big deal?

As for the rest of it --- vampires' nature and culture --- one assumes they have an arrangement with wizards to use magic to produce large quantities of human blood for them to eat. Besides that, I would imagine that they can't turn into bats or wolves /per se/, but, like Goblins, are capable of wizarding magic, meaning any number of historical vampires may have been Animagi, thus explaining the Muggle misconception. They are, however, naturally covered by the Wand Ban.
