  This only makes sense, as the core of vampirism-as-a-curse is that it's a pathway to immortality; and wouldn't it be odd, therefore, if such an easily-accessed (and, as [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] notes, relatively well-integrated) path to immortality existed, that Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone would be seen as such a big deal?

This is interesting because I'm writing a story with a vampire in it right now and I've decided that vampirism is a transformational magic and one has to accept the change willingly. If you fight it, you die (no reward without risk). Once they go through the transformation, they are unable to cast any wizard spells as the cost for gaining immortality, self-transformation (bat, mist, wolf) hypnotic gaze and all of the other traditional vampiric powers and drawbacks. Because yeah, an immortal being able to cast spells? That's too powerful even for HP magic.
