For some reason I have a very hard time visualizing the main characters as taller/more physically mature as they age. Since many stories start off in 1st year, my brain seems to get used to that image, and I have a hard time adjusting when I realize they're supposed to be tall and lanky now.

It's odd because I have a slightly different mental image of Hogwarts, especially the Great Hall, every time I read a story, and it just happens automatically, like my brain has an infinite supply of subtle permutations.
