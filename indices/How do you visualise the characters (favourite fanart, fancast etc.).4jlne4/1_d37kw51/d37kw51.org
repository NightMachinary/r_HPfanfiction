Let's see... Well, firstly, DanRad is a pretty decent Harry in my book. He's pretty much my mental image with darker hair and green eyes.

Hermione my usual fancast for her is Kimberly Elise - a decent looking girl with big, natural hair, though with buckteeth in the first few years, obviously.

Ron I generally imagine as thinner, taller and lankier than Grint, with freckles across his face and a pointy chin, a square face. Percy I imagine as similar, and then Charlie, Fred and George I think of as having much shorter, stouter frames. The Weasleys share the freckles, but Fred and George have big muscled arms, and Charlie is muscled and scarred over.

I have an issue with Bill in the films, though. I definitely think the actor could have been great, but not with his sallow-white skin, terrible hair and generally gross face in DH: Bill is supposed to be cool-looking and handsome, which Domhnall Gleeson is completely capable of, but for some reason didn't embrace during the films.

I loved Mark Williams and Julie Walters as Arthur and Molly, though - and Ginny... Well. I generally imagine her as a pretty girl with a heart-shaped face and long, flowing hair. Bonnie Wright definitely isn't the mental image I have for her.

Snape I imagine much younger. I generally embrace Louis Garrel or Adrien Brody as ideal fancasts - Alan Rickman was a fantastic actor and I adored his portrayal of the character, but he was straight up too old. Same for Gary Oldman - a very attractive, talented actor, but... Good lord. Sirius was meant to be like, thirty. Gaz did NOT look thirty in the films.

Lucius I generally imagine as pale and broad-shouldered, with a square jaw; Narcissa and Draco I think of with the same complexion, but more slender bodies and softer features, with less definition of the jaw and cheek bones. I definitely embrace Lucius' long, straight hair, though.

With casting, though, Richard Harris and Warwick Davies in the first two films are the best for me. Flitwick with all his big hair is fabulous to me - I don't know what the Hell they were thinking with the tux and the ugly little moustache in the later movies.
