Dumbledore = Stephen Fry; tall, kind-voiced but can rouse a terrible temper. He even has a broken nose.

Snape = Tim Roth; more skeevy and spiteful-seeming, and 15 years younger than Alan Rickman

Hermione = Anna Poppelwell; the right age and has thick brown hair, with appropriately large front teeth but who shines as a discovered beauty when she grows older

Harry - Dan was good, James McAvoy could have been great but was too old for the role when cast

Voldemort = Hugo Weaving

Sirius = I'm a fan of Oldman and felt he did great with what the scripts and directors allowed for him. The only reason I'd replace him is for a better match for the character's age; maybe Rufus Sewell or Clive Owen

Remus Lupin = Paul Bettany, again mostly to adjust for age as I liked David Thewlis' performance; then again, Remus faded into the background of exposition for the later books. If Bettany was Lupin, they might have been more tempted to include the DH argument between him and Harry over abandoning Tonks

Bill Weasley = special appearance by Ewan MacGregor

Fleur Delacour = Keira Knightley

Quirinus Quirrel = Hugh Grant; he already has the stuttering down...

Minerva McGonagall = Helen Mirren or Charlotte Rampling or Emma Thomson - Emma did great as Trelawney but she could easily have brought more life to the role of McGonagall (while acting like a younger version of Maggie Smith)
