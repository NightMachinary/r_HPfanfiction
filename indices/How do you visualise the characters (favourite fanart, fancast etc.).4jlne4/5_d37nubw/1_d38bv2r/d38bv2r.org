I disagree about Voldemort, if only due to personal preference.

Instead, I would cast Doug Jones, who fits the "tall (6'4"), pale, skinny, and odd-looking" physique of the monstrous Voldemort of Harry's time.

Jones is American actor and former contortionist known for roles in the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres, often wearing heavy makeup to play nonhuman characters. He's also the "go-to" guy when you have a role that fits that criteria, and who you want to act out the role of a "monster", which makes him perfect for the role of Lord Voldemort.

His previous roles include:

- Billy Butcherson (zombie) in /Hocus Pocus/

- Abe Sapien (mutant) in /Hellboy/ and /Hellboy 2: The Golden Army/

- Angel of Death and the Chamberlain in /Hellboy 2: The Golden Army/

- The Faun / The Pale Man (monster) in /Pan's Labyrinth/

- The Silver Surfer in /Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer/

- The Operator (Slenderman) in /Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story/

- Edith's Mother / Lady Sharpe in /Crimson Peak/

- Frankenstein in del Toro's /Frankenstein/ (upcoming)

- Dr. Henry Vataber in /Universal Dead/ (upcoming)

Likewise, he also sometimes works closely with director Guillermo del Toro, who was once originally tapped as a possible director for /Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/.

  Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film "so bright and happy and full of light, that [he] wasn't interested". [[http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/][(Source)]]
