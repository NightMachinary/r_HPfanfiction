I used to have a different interpretation of Harry, Hermione, and Ron before the movies came out, but these days I pretty much end up visualising Dan, Rupert, and Emma as the Hogwarts-era trio no matter what I try otherwise. Any fancasting/visualisation I have is generally for a much older trio, around the age that they are in the Epilogue:

Harry: Somewhere between [[https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/28/1393607897303/Adrien-Brody-Roman-Polans-011.jpg][Adrien Brody]] and [[http://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/2014/04/14/956/n/1922398/b86ec0b24aa6a4f3_145548805.xxxlarge_2x/i/Jon-Hamm-Larry-Decker.jpg][Jon Hamm]], though I tend to err on the side of Hamm because he and Radcliffe played the same character in A Young Doctor's Notebook. I'd imagine these two are bit Hollywood attractive for the Harry, but Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are all significantly better looking than how I originally imagined the trio as well.

Ron: Either [[http://www.trbimg.com/img-5515f3ef/turbine/la-et-st-damian-lewis-pbs-wolf-hall-conversation-20150329][Damian Lewis]], or a longshot [[http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2015/09/michael_fassbender_2_-_h_2015.jpg][Michael Fassbender]]. Oddly, I also feel Domnhall Gleeson is a better fit for a late twenty-something Ron than he was for Bill.

Hermione: Definitely [[http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/18000000/Rachel-W-3-rachel-weisz-18059366-452-300.jpg][Rachel Weisz]]. She /is/ adult Hermione to me; if I were in charge of casting for a Cursed Child movie and they wanted to cast someone else for all the characters, this would be the one choice I'd fight for.

Ginny: Gin's a lot tougher because I actually don't know many redheaded actresses in the proper age range. In fact, the only one I'm super familiar with, due to her role in Mad Men, is Christina Hendricks, and she is most definitely not how I picture Ginny. If I were to guess, possibly [[http://science-all.com/images/isla-fisher/isla-fisher-03.jpg][Isla Fisher]], but I don't think she's a great fit, either.
