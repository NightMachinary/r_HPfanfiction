Anne Hathaway would make a decent Hermione (without the glasses though): [[http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/files/2014/10/gimme19_PH_princess.jpg]]

She's really close to Hermione's true age (81 vs 79), and has a passable British accent. Her roles in Les Miserables, Dark Knight Rises, and Interstellar show she can act, too.
