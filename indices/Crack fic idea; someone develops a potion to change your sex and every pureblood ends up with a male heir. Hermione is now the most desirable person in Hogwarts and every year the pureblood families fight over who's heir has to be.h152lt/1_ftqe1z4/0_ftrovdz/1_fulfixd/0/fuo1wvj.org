As I recall, it was one chapter in a collection of one-shots. Malfoy was harassing Harry in the hallways, who suspects Snape is hanging around waiting for an opportunity to take points, so Harry just whirled around and hit Draco with a finite, which instantly turned him female. Pansy wass as upset as Draco, but McGonagall told Snape he couldn't take points since Harry didn't cast an actual spell. Not much more to it than that.
