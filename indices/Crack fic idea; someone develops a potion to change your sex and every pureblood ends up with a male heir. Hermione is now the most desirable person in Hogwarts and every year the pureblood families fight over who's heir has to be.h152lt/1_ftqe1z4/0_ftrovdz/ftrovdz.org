Possibly. Then again, the OP doesn't specify whether the potion can be used multiple times. In linkffn(Effects and Side Effects), Draco uses a potion to turn Harry female, and he ends up in trouble for line theft, as I recall, because he took out the Black heir who was ahead of him.

I've read two stories where Draco was originally female, and Lucius had him potioned from infancy to be male for purposes of being an heir. In [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/the-wizard-that-never-was-t52.html][one of them]], he was actually a stolen Delacour girl.
