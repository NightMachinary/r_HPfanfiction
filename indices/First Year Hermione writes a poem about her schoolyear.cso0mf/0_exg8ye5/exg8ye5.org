My name is Hermione Granger, I'm no longer a stranger to danger.

I learned from a witch my strange talents were gifts and off to school I went.

I wanted to learn, I tried to be stern, but it only left me to yearn.

Instead, I made friends, found happiness in them and I'd do it all over again.

Before the term ended the hero I befriended discovered that evil was expected.

Worse than expelled, into a labyrinth we fell, and only lived by using all of our spells.

We saved the school and it's most precious jewel (even though we had to break some of the rules.)

I don't know what to expect next year, but one thing is clear, adventure awaits those who go here.

I went to magic school, made friends with two fools and broke a lot of the rules.
