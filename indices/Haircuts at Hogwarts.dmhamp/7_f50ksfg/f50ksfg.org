Well, there is a possible implication that, like Harry during his time with the Dursleys, wizards and even younger children can subconsciously control physical aspects of their bodies like hair length or nails. For larger endeavors they probably need something more nuanced (ex. hair-growth potion), but as magic seems to be partly directed by both conscious and subconscious intent, its entirely possible that they don't /need/ haircuts unless they are going to do something large (like Charlie having to almost completely regrow his hair after Mrs. Weasley cut it).

Thats kind of how I see Hogwarts actually: there are some rules that students must follow, they can be punished for breaking them, but as long as they follow those criterion the school/teachers allow the students to manage themselves accordingly. I mean, they let Harry and co. travel to Hagrid's often, despite knowing the general danger associated with that. Students swim in the lake with a Giant Squid and are often otherwise unsupervised.

The message seems pretty clear to me: follow the rules, turn in your homework, don't get out of hand, and you have free reign.
