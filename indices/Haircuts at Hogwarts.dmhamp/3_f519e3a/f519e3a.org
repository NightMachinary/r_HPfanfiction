Most likely, there are spells for it. Spells invented by barbers and such, sold for outrageous prices, which cut and style your hair in a specific way. There's probably even a charm to fix your hair into one specific position, so it always slowly reverts back to the state it was in when you cast it.

So barbering is literally just casting two spells and done.
