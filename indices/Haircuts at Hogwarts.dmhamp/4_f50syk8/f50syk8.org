Every student cuts their own hair as they brew their secret, illegal stashes of Polyjuice Potion. Hell, it's a challenge to keep presentable amounts of hair. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are actually quite unique in that they only did that once - it's normally every week, with rotating batches, for all the other students. They're lucky they got Crabbe and Goyle in their own bodies. I understand Parvati had to apologize for weeks to Neville after she got in trouble trying to stop Harry and co. from losing more House points in first year - she had to give him all her Cho Chang-impersonation time slots for the next year before he forgave her.

On the other hand, Malfoy's Patronus Charm was really benefited by all those times he attended DA sessions as Zacharias Smith.
