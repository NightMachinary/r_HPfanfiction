  Watching the style changes in the movies, you almost get the sense that the Gryffindor experts all left school after Harry's third year, and Ron took over when he became prefect, though his style options were very limited and basic. because * why else make Ron prefect and * Hermione proved barely competent at it when she and Harry were alone during the secret camping trip
