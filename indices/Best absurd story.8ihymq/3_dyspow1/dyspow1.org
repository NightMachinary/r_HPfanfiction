Hmm I think these should count.

- Linkffn(4655545). Reunion.

Middle aged Harry, Hermione, Susan, and Luna go back in time. Seeing as they are each very skilled and they know everything about what was going on at the time, they have a real easy time of it.

Harry has spent his life after Hogwarts being the world's deadliest magical assassin/freelance bounty hunter. Dark Wizards only, of course.

- Linkffn(11120132). Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous

Grizzled Moody-esque "Master Auror" Harry is in his late twenties. He gets put into Middle Earth as an Elf. Turns out that Elves in their late twenties are still small children.

He's not happy, and there's very little in the setting that can challenge the direct style of magic HP has.

I may come back and update with some more.
