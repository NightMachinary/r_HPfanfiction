Oh, now here we are. linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is one of my absolute favourite fics.

For someone who's read that, there is a spin off crossover with Pokemon, which is shaping up to be my favourite humor/crack fic, and yes I include Seventh Horcrux here, linkffn(Wearing the Faces of Men by The Carnivorous Muffin)
