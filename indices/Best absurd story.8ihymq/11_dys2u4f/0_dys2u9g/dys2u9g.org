  Draco Malfoy, like all his family before him, has looked forward to meeting the person behind the name that will eventually appear. Provided they are a Pureblood, of course. But for some absurd reason, she doesn't seem to like him. Even worse she appeared to be friends with Potter's group. This of course leads to hijinks. Not to mention, Potter's somewhat more annoying than usual with his constant retorts and somehow, someway, Ginny Weasley acquired a basilisk. (Draco honestly was not going to ask.)-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Harry Potter, for his part, was pulled headfirst into the confusing world of the Slytherins when Draco Malfoy decided (for whatever Malfoy-ish reason) that they were friends. It doesn't help that somehow, Malfoy wasn't actually the most insane of the Slytherins. How will Harry face the scion of Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Gellert Grindelwald, and whatever else the world (and author) throws at him this time around?
