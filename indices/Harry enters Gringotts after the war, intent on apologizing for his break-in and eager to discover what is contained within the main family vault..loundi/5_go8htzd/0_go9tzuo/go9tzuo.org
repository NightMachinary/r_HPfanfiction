No, they aren't. The whole "GOBLINS HATE PEOPLE" thing is as much a fandom meme as the opposite.

In the books, goblins are brusque and to the point. In the books, there are multiple goblin rebellions throughout history, but no real details on why. In the book, /one/ goblin betrays Harry, one who, y'know, was just kidnapped and tortured so might have a reason to hate people.

Goblins could be great guys. They could hate people. For canon, there's little sign.

Both types of goblins are equally valid, as is a more middle of the road interpretation.
