  HATE PEOPLE
#+end_quote

I never said that they hate people. I said that they aren't friendly or forgiving. They have armed guards at the door and a sign that says they'll fuck you up if you steal from them. Then Harry not only steals from them, but also frees their captive dragon, totally screws up their building, and embarrasses them in public. Thinking that they'll forgive and forget with minimal fuss after that is far more Robst fanwank than JKR. Hell, /I/ wouldn't forgive and forget that just because the idiot teenager has "a good explanation" (that isn't really all that good).
