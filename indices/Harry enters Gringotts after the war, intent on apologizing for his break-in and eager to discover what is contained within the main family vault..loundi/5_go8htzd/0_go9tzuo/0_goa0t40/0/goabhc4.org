Hey, so you responded to this, but not my response. Read that please instead of blindly continuing to insinuate that I want robst-tier goblins.

Because I don't. And I'm not requesting those either.

Again, if you tried /reading/ and /informing yourself/, then you might see how letting Harry agree to an unspecified debt amount and getting him to take over a stretch of land that's festering with monsters isn't exactly very kind of them. But you're obviously not a big fan of doing those things.
