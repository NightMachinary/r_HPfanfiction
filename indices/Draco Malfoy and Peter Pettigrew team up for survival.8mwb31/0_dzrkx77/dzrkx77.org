I think I recognise Voldemort and Draco's lines (graveyard and Slughorn's x-mas party,) but is the first one actual dialogue from the books? As for recs on that theme I haven't seen any where Draco and Peter team up, although I have seen them sharing space in Spinner's End but the relationship was acrimonious.
