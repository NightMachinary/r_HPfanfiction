Yup. Peter's line is from the end of Prisoner of Azkaban (when being confronted by Sirius & Lupin), Voldemort's line is from the start of Goblet of Fire (the Riddle House, while being eavesdropped on by Frank Bryce), and Draco's line is from the end of Half-Blood Prince (at the top of the Astronomy tower, having disarmed Dumbledore).
