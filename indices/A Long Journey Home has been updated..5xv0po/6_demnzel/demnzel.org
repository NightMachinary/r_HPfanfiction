What I like best about this story, and I understand why a lot of stories don't have it, is how completely comfortable "Harry" is with "him"self. I'm me. This is me. All of this. If you aren't comfortable with that, too bad.

[[/spoiler][Of course, most Harrys don't have 5,000 years to get so comfortable with themselves. Sad panda.]]
