What this fic has that most don't even approach is a heartfelt charm and personal relevance. I opened this new chapter and within a few paragraphs I was back into the current story arc, running alongside an apprentice living in the Indus Valley, hearing the carts rumble and the merchants haggle and feeling the cooler air from a winter breeze as he makes his way to his lesson- a lesson with Jasmine.

She's already lived hundreds of years and has been struggling with an insurmountable problem: she can't remember everything. Using magic day-in-and-out, it never leaves her, but the experiences of a hundred years or more in the past elude her as they just don't stay relevant. Thus she'd traveled from her near-mythic existence in Egypt to work with an accomplished wizard in the Indus valley- the apprentice's father.

The story itself is fractured like that, but in a way that's enjoyable. We start in present day but then the present is suddenly feeling less immediate and more like a reunion of old friends. Gifts from the journey prompt thoughts about her past and then we're seeing a life 1500 years earlier, when Jasmine was trying to stay out of the way of history and in this case, failing.

Each arc is like that- personal stories framed by greater events and humanized by the view of our powerful but not in the least bit omniscient main character.

Can you tell I'm a fan?
