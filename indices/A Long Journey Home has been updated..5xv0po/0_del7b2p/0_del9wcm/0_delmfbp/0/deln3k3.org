Well the Myrddin arc wasn't a happy ending at all, but massively bittersweet. To the point where his death is still something that Jasmine holds HUNDREDS of years later. Her life is defined by the tragedies she lives though and experiences, which is what makes the story so much more beautiful to read.

In fact, the only reason why the series has the hope that it does throughout is only because we know the end game. If we didn't know that before going in I doubt we would be able to handle the tragedy that is Jasmine's life. We know that she at least gets a "happy ending" in which she can bring closure to one part of her story.

This arc I actually didn't like at first, but the more it goes on the more I love it. Like you, I see it ending in complete tragedy so it feeds into the Myrddin arc. I do have to wonder, if there's a story that goes inbetween the two.
