In a lot of ways I love it so much more than the original series. It is in some ways so far AU that some might say it should just not be in the HP universe to begin with, but it does live in that world and expand on what we already know, so it still works.

This particular arc seems like it is working towards multiple things, which I do love. The recovery of her memories and the ongoing preservation into the future is very important, but I also get the feeling from this chapter that the arc is not going to have a happy ending, and may contribute substantially to the person that Jasmine was before meeting Myrddin.

It is a remarkable thing that this story is very much not a happy one, but is still a joy to read.
