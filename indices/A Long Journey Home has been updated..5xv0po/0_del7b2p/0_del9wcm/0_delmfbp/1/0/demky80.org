That seems likely, especially working with Durhmada in secret. Obvious foreshadowing is: Ayati gives birth, dies, Rahji attempts to raise her as Inferius, even an 'improved' one, cue everyone freaking out.

Seems to obvious to state that they /aren't/ going to solve the whole dying issue, though I have wondered if this is the origination of horcruxes. I seem to recall those being invented by Herpo the Foul, but names do change.
