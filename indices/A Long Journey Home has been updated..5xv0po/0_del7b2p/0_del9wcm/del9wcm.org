The part that I love the most is the little things that stay consistent through all of her years. Her dry, cheeky sense of humor is prevalent in every single version of her that lets you know that this is the same person. Along with a few other peculiar traits (that I'll let the reader find out because they're actually slightly adorable), she stays remarkably consistent - while at the same time growing. The Jasmine in the Indus valley has obviously not learned the same lessons that time brings her as the one that found her in Arthurian times.

What this mean is those base personality traits let you know that she's /always/ Jasmine underneath everything. This isn't a simulacrum that the author has shoved in just to write their own versions of Arthur, or stories wizards in the Indus Valley. This is a character developed in this story that in good faith is displayed in each of those time periods.

Then around that is the fall out from living these thousands, upon thousands of years. She has obviously struggled with the weight of history that has been forced upon her and is /still/ trying to find where she fits in. She's all powerful, and yet she's still Jasmine underneath it all.

It's a lovely story.
