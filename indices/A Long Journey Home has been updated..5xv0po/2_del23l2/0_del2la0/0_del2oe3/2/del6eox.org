The gender change is completely necessary in this story, it just isn't apparently why until you get a few chapters in. The other canon characters actually DO feature heavily in the story, and are a very important part of it - in the present at least. They are a solid frame of reference for the world building done by the author, and an easy point of comparison between what "was" and what "is."

I don't think I go more than a few days without telling everybody my love of this story. It is well worth the investment to start reading.
