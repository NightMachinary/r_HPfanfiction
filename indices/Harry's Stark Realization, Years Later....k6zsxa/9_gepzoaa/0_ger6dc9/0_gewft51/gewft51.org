Yes, it's the Left Words series by authoresswithoutwords. The first one is linkao3(18394907) and the final part, which won't make much sense without having read the first story (but is as hilarious as the first part is dark and honestly made the entire series end on a very positive note!), is linkao3(25225402).

It is slash; in case that's not something you read, you may want to consider this anyway because nothing more than a kiss is ever shared between the main pairing, and quite honestly, Harry is as appropriately horrified at who his soulmate is as he should be.
