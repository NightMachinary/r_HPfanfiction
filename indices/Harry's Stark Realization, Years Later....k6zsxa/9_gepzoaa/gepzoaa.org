This is a great prompt!

I read a very long and fantastic fic that didn't really go into politics, but there was a final one-shot/secondary story set years later where Harry's godson, a rather oblivious Hufflepuff, learns just who the Minister for Magic really is and that there's more to "Professor Harry" (he had no idea about Harry's history as the Boy-Who-Lived).
