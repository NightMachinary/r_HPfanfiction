I read one that was a little like this, and then it went too far and spiralled out of the realm entirely. Harry made some innocent comments to a guy in a store in venice without knowing who he was, and then left. The guy was head of the mafia and took the conversation as Harry telling him how to run the Family because he'd heard rumors of "Mr. Black", which was Harry's pseduonym. I can't remember the name of it but it was really good until it went weird.
