To me it's a unique take. It's both specific enough to be a good guide but vague enough that people can run with it. The fact that there wasn't a bunch of fics that people can point to saying "like this?" is another point in your prompts favor.

Also, as I've been watching a lot of West Wing I like the "it's not what it is, it's what it looks like." Which is always interesting.
