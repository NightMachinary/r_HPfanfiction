This is an utterly fantastic premise and I'd read anything - oneshot, novella, series - revolving around it. If someone picks this up, please link, because this actually sounds exactly like what would happen in real life.

All of Harry's friends and allies tend to be the most competent people shown in their generation of witches and wizards and Harry would naturally be respected for his opinions, being the wizard who defeated the most recent Dark Wizard in power. Here he's thinking that he's raising his children and occasionally doling out advice over a glass of wine after dinner, when the entire wizarding world thinks he's the shadow Minister.

Interesting parallels to the barmiest of alt-right theories in our current time as well - fascinating!
