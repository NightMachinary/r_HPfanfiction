Well, if one think of many instances that Harry's accidently influenced the magical world,it can go well over 50k.

But how I imagine it, it would be more like a series of one-shots, only connected by this theme "Harry accidently influence the magical world".

And it can be by a lot of different authors. And could even contradict each others.

Okay, I think my idea is more a trope or a tag than a fanfiction itself, but I think you get my drift.
