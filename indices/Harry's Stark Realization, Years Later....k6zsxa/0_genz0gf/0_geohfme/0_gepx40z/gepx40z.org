I'd think it would works as a series of stories. Some one-shot. Over longer.

Like first story would be when He discovers about it. Basically the prompt really fleshed-out. He asked around, discover everything that people are about.

Then, each one-shots are an instance were Harry accidently influenced the Magical World.

Like, now, Muggle studies are mandatory at Hogwarts ? (which helps in the tolerance bit)?

Well, once, Neville and Harry were out in Muggle London because Neville wanted to see Kensington Garden. Harry volunteered to take him because he'd be a nice outing with the kids.

Neville was useless and almost give away he was a wizard multiple times. And Harry jokingly said "seriously, every one should take Muggle Studies. At least you wouldn't risk to expose us the seconds you step outside the magical world".

Neville being embarassed by whatever misstep he did, find it is really a bright idea. He is a teacher at Hogwarts, and bring it to McGonagall, and they have to fight hard the Board to make it happens, but they did.

Also change the teacher and curriculum because yeah, most of it is bullshit.

And Muggle studies become a mandatory course.

And the story would be from Neville point of view, would show them their adventures in Muggle London, and then the fight to make Harry's not-even-idea-just-a-joke-taken-seriously happens.
