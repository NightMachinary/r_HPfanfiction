Oh I would absolutely love to read a fanfic like that. That sounds hilarious. Like, Harry boards the train to afterlife, steps out of it - James, Sirius and Remus all waiting with a smug smile on their faces, taunting and joking about "the great Lord Potter" and Lily just saying: "Don't be mean boys. Harry did great."
