Another one is this one.

​

Umbrridge basicly leaves the door of his cell in Azkaban unlocked and he receives the dementor's kiss.

​

Luckily for Harry, he's not occupying his body at the time.

​

What I like most about this story is the fact that he can spirit rove, similar to astral projection.

​

If only more fanfiction stories had branches of magic that's different to what you see in cannon.

​

One miss fired spell later has one that allows him to turn into smoke and travel to places.

​

They called it fumation I think.

​

That one was supposedly getting a sequel, but it's been a couple years since we heard about that and stil nothing.

​

Still, if you're interested in reading it.
