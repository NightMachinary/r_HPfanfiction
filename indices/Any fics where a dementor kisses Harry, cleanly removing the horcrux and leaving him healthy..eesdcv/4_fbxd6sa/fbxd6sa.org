There is the "partially kissed hero" (or "half kissed hero"?), but I honestly wouldn't recommend it.

I remember a ton of Dumbledore and Snape bashing, they were the evilest evil (but not smart, because a smart villain is a stupid idea).

Harry was probably OP, and it is lunar harmony.

I never bothered finishing it.
