Yep it's Partially Kissed Hero.

It starts out okay but after a while the author decides he loves the sound of his own voice rather than advancing the plot so we get endless dialogue where (usually) Harry and Luna explain something to Hermione. Almost always in response to something a reviewer had said.

Eventually it becomes clear there's no story plan (I recall an author's note saying something like "I'm not sure where to take this") and it meanders until the reader gets bored and gives up.
