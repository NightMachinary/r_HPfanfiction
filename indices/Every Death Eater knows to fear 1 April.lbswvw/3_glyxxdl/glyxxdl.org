Not for the first time, there were screams echoing through Malfoy Manor. That, on its own, would not have troubled Lucius. No--the disturbing thing was that they were coming from the upper floors, not the dungeons.

"My Lord?" Lucius asked, coming across Lord Voldemort in the dining room. "Is all well?"

Lucius smiled in relief. "Congratulations, my Lord. An auspicious occasion indeed. Long has he been a thorn in our side--no longer."

Voldemort's eyes gleamed with mirth. "You misunderstand, Lucius. I have not imprisoned Moody. I have given him a wand and set him loose in the Manor. April Fools!"
