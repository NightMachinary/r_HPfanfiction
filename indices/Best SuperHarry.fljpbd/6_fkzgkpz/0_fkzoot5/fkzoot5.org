The annoying thing about this story is there is little self improvement. Harry mostly just casually grows in power without learning much of anything new or training, he spends his entire time inventing things for other people, despite knowing there is a dangerous threat out there. I think I can remember about two times he actually worked on improving himself and one of those times were more to create a mass-produced improvement for everybody. I managed to push myself to chapter 61 but I just lost any interest after a while.
