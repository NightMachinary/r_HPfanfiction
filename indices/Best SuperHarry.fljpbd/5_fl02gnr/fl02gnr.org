My favourite hands down is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness]]) It's incomplete but somehow it manages to do more with 20k words than what most Super!Harry fics do with 5 times that number.

Harry doesn't start out very super but he becomes it in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]]). It's an AU where Harry isn't the BWL (Neville is) and where he isn't antogonistic w/ the BWL!
