I've read a number of them, but as much as I like excessive firepower on occasion, it's not my favorite genre. Too many of them use excessive power as a substitute for plot development. Kind of a "I can top that"/wish-fulfillment thing, I suspect.

That said, there's a list of super!Harry stories [[http://jenniboo.50megs.com/harrypotter/super_harry.html][here]].
