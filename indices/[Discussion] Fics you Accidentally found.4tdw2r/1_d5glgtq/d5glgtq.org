There is one fic I quite literally found accidentally about three years ago--as in, just loaded up FF.net, went to Harry Potter and there it was. linkffn(In Atlantean Caves)

Now the quality of this fic can be debated. It was amazing to me three years ago, and I do still love the concept, but the execution is a little shoddy.

It happens fairly often that I will come across a random fic with some slight filtering and read it, but it's a rare thing for me to remember a random, unknown fic after all this time.
