All the time. I find it quite important to go into ffnet and use the filters. There's so much gold to be found it's not even funny.

The most common thing I do is filter by:

1. Sort: favourites
2. Time Range: 24 hours
3. Rated: All
4. Language: English

And boom, start looking through. There are a few ultra-favourited fics that seem to be updated daily, but once you're past them it can start getting really interesting with short stories, good premises or simply excellent fics in their early days as well. I'm a little addicted to fanfiction at the moment, so I'm discovering stuff all the time.

One of my favourites in recent times was linkffn(11967877) , which is clearly just a fic on the up and up.

It can be tough finding finished fics, that's true though I find looking through a great author's list of completed fics - such as White Squirrel's for example - often works.
