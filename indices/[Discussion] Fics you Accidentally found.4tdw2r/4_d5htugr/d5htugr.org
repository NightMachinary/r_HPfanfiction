I'm almost exclusive on ff.net. I finish a story I like and go to the author's page to browse their favorites. I have found treasures that way. That's how I found (Fantistic? Fabulous?) Elves and Where to Find Them.. and Doghead13's stuff. 'The Book of Dobby' is a lot of fun. His elf counting system always makes me laugh.
