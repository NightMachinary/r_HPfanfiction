I've been branching out lately, so seeing less of this, but for a long while for me it was

- Snape - that dude gets tortured by everyone and their grandmas. Seriously... Ph.D in getting tortured to the brink of death.

- Harry and Ron - for 5 to 6 years they pretty much only tolerated Hermione and are in fact ready to drop out of her life almost entirely for weeks and months for practically any reason. (still ready for a quick cameo to behave like shits to her current love interest)

- Everyone would just love to be Head Boy/Girl and if not that than at least a prefect - it's not like there is something better for teens to do at a magic school than spending their evenings patrolling hallways to piss off classmates. And the mandatory assignments for school event organization - kids of Hogwarts apparently just live for that.

- Personal house elves: the only reason Voldermort and all Death Eaters weren't delivered to Azkhaban roped into a ball in embarrassing sexually compromising positions before being transported to the moon along with all Dementors and corrupt Ministry officials is that no one thought to order a house elf to do it. Cause any one of them totally could with a snap of their fingers.
