Ugh. I /hate/ this. Chess is not military strategy. The field of battle is constant, unchanging, and has no effect on the battle. The participants are evenly matched, have the same resources battle-to-battle, and all of your resources reset after each conflict.

In an actual battle, the terrain is uneven, unmatched, and mutable. The participants are unequal, don't have a perfect knowledge of what the other side has, don't know what their opponent is doing, and don't even know if there even is only one other participant (depending on the conflict). Your resources are alive, and resistant to sacrifice -- and you may need them in the next battle, too.

If Ron had been a master RTS player, and excelled at Starcraft or the Civ games... yeah, maybe he's a good strategist. Chess? No. He's just good at chess. And eating. ^{ugh} ^{he's} ^{so} ^{useless,} ^{even} ^{in} ^{canon.}
