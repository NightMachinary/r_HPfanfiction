Ah, okay. Interesting. I haven't reread the books in awhile, though I plan to soon. I've read so much damn fanfic that sometimes I really can't remember what's what. (I'm a natural speed reader, reading up to 1000-1100 words per minute at my max, depending on content. It drops to about 700 for more academic type writing. childrens/YA books are really damned easy to read, same for most of their fanfic.)
