I called it meme because I had that as a response in another thread. It is in every aspect the same as a cliche tied into the fanfiction potterverse. And no, they aren't because they work so well. They work well if done right. Reading a story where Harry suddenly learns his animagus form somewhere inbetween a day or 2 months is just annoying. It is clearly because it satisfies the writer, not because it brings anything important, or for that matter believable, to the story.

And cliches are in general more vague. Therefore meme is also prudent because it is very specific.
