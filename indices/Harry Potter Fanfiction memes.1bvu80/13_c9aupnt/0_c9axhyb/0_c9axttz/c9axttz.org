theory by someone with below average knowledge of sociology who has never read any male pregnancies fics, or in fact male slash at that -

1) slash pairings are by an extremely wide margin written and read by females.

2) Most females still love the idea of babies/kids.

3) It is much easier to love kids when one doesn't have to produce them personally, and/or imagine themselves doing so - pushing the capability on another gender entirely goes a long way to freedom from those hassles... (seriously, if we lived in a world where it's the men who have to go through the whole baby factory thing, I would sure as hell be fantasizing about women learning to do it for me)

4) Given a setting where anything is possible because magic and all the above reasons, why not?
