The Hogwarts letter is always received on the person's eleventh birthday. It's amazing how many fanfics make that error. Getting second wands and wand holsters. Zabini Blaise is a girl. Also, I nearly forgot to mention the author detailing horrible things that happen to the Dursleys, purely for the author's own satisfaction, because it's inevitably completely irrelevant to the plot.
