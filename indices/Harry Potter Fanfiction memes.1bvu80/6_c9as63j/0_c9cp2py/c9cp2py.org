As for the Blaise Zabini being a girl thing... it was only after book 5 that the character was identified as male, and fanfic really took off right after book 4. Having Zabini be a Ms. Zabini game fanfic'ers another female character with which to romance Harry, outside of the normal Slytherin fanfic favorites of Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass.
