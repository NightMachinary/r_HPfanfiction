I've read in several different stories by different authors wherein the Sorting Hat is named Alistair -- does anyone know who came up with this?

Also we can't forget the classic Veela inheritance. Draco, usually, turns 16 and all of a sudden everyone wants to do him and he needs to take a mate or else he'll die.
