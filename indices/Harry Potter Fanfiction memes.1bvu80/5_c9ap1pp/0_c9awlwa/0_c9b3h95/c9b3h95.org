yes, yes it is. They donÂ´t fit with the canon idea of what Slytherin/Gryffindor embodies. A sly person with big ambitions who knows how to do things on the sly by acting as a puppeteer behind the scenes? Yeah, that's clearly Malfoy who acts pigheaded by assaulting and insulting people in the open.

A person ruled by morals and his/her heart. A person who is sometimes selfless to a fault. Many describe the person as a witch/wizards who jumps into the fray wands blazing, but it doesn't have to be that way. It is all about acting honorable and helping people in any way they can. Hermione might be some of that, but she is too dependent on others rather than herself. If people are in trouble she wants to or does go to a teacher instead of getting involved.

If they are prince or princess of something that would mean they either inherited the title or embodied it. None of that is the case.
