  Harry is secretly a genius, despite always being perfectly average in the books
#+end_quote

In the books he's actually well above average. At least where it matters. He managed to get an E in most classes, one where the teacher hated him. The classes he did badly in were a joke in the first place. I could also understand him having bad studying habits, as it was mentioned in the first few chapters of the first book that he had to make sure never to do better in school than Dudley.

He's by no means a genius of course, just not average either.
