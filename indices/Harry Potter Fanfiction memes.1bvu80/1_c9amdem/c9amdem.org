- Hermione's parents are totally okay with her getting engaged at, like, fourteen because Harry is /that great a guy/.

- Harry is secretly a genius, despite always being perfectly average in the books. The reasons for this vary (evil!Dumbledore somehow blocks his learning ability, he was trying to not be any better than Ron, etc.) but the minute he decides to start learning he is the best at studying ever.

- Magical blocks. Someone is always putting a block on Harry's magic, despite this not being a thing in the books at all. Oh, and he's actually the strongest wizard since Merlin. Usually this accompanies manipulative/evil!Dumbledore.

- Harry doesn't have eyes, he has "shining emerald orbs"
