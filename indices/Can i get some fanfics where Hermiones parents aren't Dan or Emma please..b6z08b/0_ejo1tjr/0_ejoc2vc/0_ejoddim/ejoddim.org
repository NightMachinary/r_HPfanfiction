  It breaks the fourth wall, destroying readers' immersion in the world.

I wouldn't say so. I've never seen it as more than an easter-egg, and a pretty discreet one at that --- I didn't realize what the significance of the names was until the third or fourth time I encountered them, I think; and I've seen other posts on the sub to the same effect. It's just a character being named after a real-world figure of thematic significance to the author; how is it different from the thousand other "meaningful names" scattered about the Wizarding World by Rowling herself? Is “Dan Granger” really that much more distracting than “Emmeline Vance”?

  It's a red flag for lack of originality on the part of an author. If the author is following fanon tropes in one area, they are likely to do so in other areas also.

I can see the reasoning better there, but White Squirrel's reasoning on this matter, for example, proves that "sluggish uncreativity" isn't the only reason to use the fanon names. In Squirrel's case, they think the way the fandom can agree thusly on unstated aspects of the /HP/ universe is actually beautiful and inspiring, and I can see their point. Watching “Dan & Emma” and “wards” and “inheritance tests” seep throughout the fanfiction community is essentially watching a mythology being born. It's pretty neat when you think about it.

And again, unlike most fanon tropes which are annoying /plot elements/, an element of background worldbuilding like this isn't a danger to the worth of the story. Mr Granger could just as well be called John or Abraham or Gandalf-Hyeronyminus III, for all the difference it make; what matters is his characterization.
