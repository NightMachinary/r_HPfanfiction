¨shrug¨ I don't entirely see what you're talking about. Most of the times the names are used, it's /just/ easter-egg names --- I haven't noticed that any consistent characterization (or, indeed, physical appearance) comes with it. You could have parents called Dan and Emma who are nothing like whatever you're referring to, and you could have parents named Nathaniel and Iolanthe who have precisely the characterization you hate.

I have encountered some stories which use the name Thomas and Helen, and I personally use Daniel and Sally. But again, what difference does it make?
