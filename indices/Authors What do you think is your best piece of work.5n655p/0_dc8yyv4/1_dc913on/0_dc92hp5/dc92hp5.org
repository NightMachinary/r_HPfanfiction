I almost flipped Princess and Vitam Paramus. But in the end I felt like Vitam Paramus deals with a more difficult concept and subject matter and I liked the execution of it.

While Princess probably appeals to a much wider audience than VP, I felt that VP is just better written technically than Princess. And at the end of the day, I like it more.

I detest Letters for a wide variety of reasons that to go in to would end up being longer than most chapters I write. Without being too 'woe is me' or anything, Letters was written at a very low point for me and a lot of what I did during it reflects and reminds me of that.

So mostly I hate Letters because it represents an abject failure on my own writing style and ability and a part of me that I'd rather put behind me. I also think that it is my worst written story, technically speaking.
