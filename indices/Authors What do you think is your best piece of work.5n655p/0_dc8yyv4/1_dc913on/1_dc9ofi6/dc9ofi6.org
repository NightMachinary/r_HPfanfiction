As much as I love Pureblood Princess (especially the epilogue, which I've reread multiple times), I personally like how simple the story is with Vitam Paramus. It's written, technically, amazingly and the fact that it's a slower story, that focuses on the characters more than anything, is what makes me love it so much.

Plus, the Quidditch is the best written on the entirety of fanfiction.net, haha.
