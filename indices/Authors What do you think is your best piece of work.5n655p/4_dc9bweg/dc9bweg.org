I don't think I can muster a concise answer for this.

For starters, I immensely enjoyed writing everything that I've posted on FFN to date. Some stories/chapters/passages were as frustrating and challenging as they were fun, but the point stands. So I can't say that I'm more proud of one over the other.

I guess if I was to rate by overall reception, then it would be:

Untitled Tome/Squared Circle AU > Fruits of Ennui > Compendium of Hogwash

That some readers actually find Fruits of Ennui funny will always tickle me in a special +place+ way, however :)
