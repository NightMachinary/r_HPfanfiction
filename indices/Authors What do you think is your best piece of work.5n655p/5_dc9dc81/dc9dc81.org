See, I can't generalize quite so much. Everything I've posted and left up has a certain charm for me, even 'We Lost', if for only having a really concise summary of Les Mis to compare against Hermione's situation.

So, I have favorite passages, favorite chapters where things came together in a way I feel proud about:

- Holly Evans Chapters 42: Rumble Rumble and 43: Fresh Snow.\\
- The opening five chapters of Holly Polter.
- Of course, the Dementor chapters of Mad Ideas (1,3, & 6).

These all have a combination of good imagery, comedy and sentiment that achieve the style I would like to convey. I'd like to get better at action, but these aren't horrid examples of that, either.
