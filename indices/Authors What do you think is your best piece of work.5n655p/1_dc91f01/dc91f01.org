I both love and hate my own stories for so many different reasons. On one hand, I hate them because they are a reminder of how bad I was a mere few months ago when I started writing. On the other hand I love them because they remind me of how much I've improved and how much dedicated effort I've put into them. I doubt I could ever rate them on any scale objectively, but I'll give it a go for my completed one-shots.
