Honestly, I think linkffn(a mother in laws love by perspicacity) was best for me in terms of sheer fun and pushing myself to extremes of the absurd, while lampshading much of fanon. It was my reward to myself after finishing my most popular piece (which I don't recommend anyone read).

In terms of quality of writing, perhaps Whispers (in my one-shot anthology).
