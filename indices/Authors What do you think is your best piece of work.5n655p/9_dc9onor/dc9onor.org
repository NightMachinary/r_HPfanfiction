I'm still deeply in love with linkao3(starving by hexmionegranger) because it quite honestly just took off and basically wrote itself in less than a week and it's kind of ridiculous (modern au ft. surprise mafia involvement? what on earth?) but yeah, I have a big old soft spot for it.

I think my favourite is still linkao3(off course by hexmionegranger) - it was what pulled me back into fanfiction writing this past summer and even rereading it I'm proud of myself. Every email that I get that's like "wow! you did a really good job portraying what it feels like to be questioning your sexuality" makes my heart grow because I wrote it all from my own place of knowledge and I love that it resonates with people.

My older one shots are very cringe worthy. This Christmas a whole bunch of people found & commented on an old one shot I'd written years ago and like....... I just wanted to shake all of them and be like MY DUDES PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELVES I LEFT IT UP FOR POSTERITY PLEASE I HAVE WRITTEN MORE AND BETTER THINGS STOP NOW. So those would be lowest on my rating list.

I'm in a weird place with my current wip linkao3(don't take this sinner by hexmionegranger) just because I am still constantly nervous every time I post a chapter that people are going to be like "??? you wrote 80k+ of this? what the fuck were you thinking? this plot is so dumb I can't believe it?" and Dramione shippers can be /rabid/ and I've already had someone be like "this isn't good because there's no rape" which like? What? So I like it, but I'm just really hesitant about the whole thing, but I'm getting good feedback and it's 98% written so I'm still posting. I think I'll feel better once it's all out, because I'm so worried about disappointing people with my plot, but once it's all posted at least there's nothing that can be done.
