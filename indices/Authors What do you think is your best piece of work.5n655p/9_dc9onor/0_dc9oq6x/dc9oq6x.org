  Hermione Granger couldn't help but think that no matter how difficult they had all figured rebuilding their society would be, no one was expecting anything quite like this. It was another stark reminder that just when things were finally starting to level out, they would never truly have peace and stability.

  Marcus stepped closer again, lifting up a hand, but before he could speak Oliver cut him off.“I don't know what the fuck that was, Flint. But I'm not...” He shook his head. “I don't...” Oliver wanted to scream and throw his hands up in the air. “I'm not fucking gay! I don't want... Don't... don't do that again.”Marcus's hand dropped and he flinched back as if he had been stung. “Great. You're not in the closet, you're fucking in denial. Even fucking better.”

  Modern, non-magical, university AU. Pansy Parkinson is just fine, thank you very much, finishing up her degree with her best friend and mostly-boyfriend and no, she is not thinking about a certain pair of dark brown eyes and making a total fool of herself in the process. Unfortunately, Pansy Parkinson's year is about to go wildly off course.
