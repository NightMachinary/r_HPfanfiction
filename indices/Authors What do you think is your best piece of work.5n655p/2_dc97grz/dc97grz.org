I honestly have no idea. I have some I'm prouder of than others, but some are so different from each other that they're hard to compare. I suppose Not From Others, but I have a fondness for my humour one-shots. I was miserable writing Aurors so it might be my best technically but it's not my favourite and the more I plan the sequel the more I regret promising it.
