Well, all I've published is a crack oneshot (it's really stupid), a short story (it's... okay), this one fic I deleted from FFN because it was actually just embarrassing, and my WIP. I've /written/ some other things, but the WIP combines the best passages of my writing, favorite scenes, themes and characters I enjoy - it's a story I write for myself first. So yeah, that one is my best work.
