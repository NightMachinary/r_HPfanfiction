Editing and rewriting A Friend to Government Pigs during my last year of college got me back into writing fanfiction. There was a lot in there that I was proud to have written at the time as a high school senior, but there were things I wanted to fix and make the story stronger. Granted my lead is an unknown canon character and her primary supporting cast is quirky OCs, but still at it's core it's a bit of a dark fic that touches a lot on wartime PTSD and depression. I wanted to explore part of the postwar world through someone who was not tied into the series events, but had done heroic actions of her own and how her life was changed and altered through those choices.

In order of top three favorites : "A Friend to Government Pigs"> "Lucy Weasley and the Mask of Gold"> "Terminology"
