Well, I'm positive Hogwarts' students had plenty of “sexy time”. It's just that it wasn't an integral part of Harry's store so it wasn't in the books. And for it and religion, I know plenty of religious people who had sex before marriage. The banner is stretching thin now as compared to how it was with previous generations.
