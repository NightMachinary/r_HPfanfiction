Ohh im not saying all religious people wait until marriage to have sex, i know that to not be true, im wondering if the act of waiting doesnt have its roots in religion and that waiting is in general a thing only found in religious couples? -since we are discussing religion here i want to point out that i am not saying anything for or against this concept, to avoid religious debates as this is not the place for such :)
