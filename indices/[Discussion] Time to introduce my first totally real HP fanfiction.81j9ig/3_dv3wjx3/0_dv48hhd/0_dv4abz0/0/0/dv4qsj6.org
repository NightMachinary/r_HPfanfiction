Of course, religious debates is for a different medium. I think that maybe in families that follow tradition (arranged marriages and the like) have a belief that sex is sacred and should be kept only for after marriage. But the lines of tradition are blurring all over the world and becoming less of a norm. Also, maybe other couples just want to wait to have sex (religion and tradition aside). Obviously, it's a person preference.
