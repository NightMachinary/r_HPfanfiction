Because according to new reddit rules you cant mention sexy time and underage kids without high chances of beeing banned ^{^} or because teenagers in HP doesnt have hormones and doesnt have sexytime unless they already left hogwarts. And why is it that in 9/10 non-smut fanfics that nobody wants sexy time before marriage? Isnt that a religious thing? Since wizards arent really religious that doesnt really make sence, also teenagers+hormones in hogwarts with broom closets and abandoned rooms? No way they "want to wait"
