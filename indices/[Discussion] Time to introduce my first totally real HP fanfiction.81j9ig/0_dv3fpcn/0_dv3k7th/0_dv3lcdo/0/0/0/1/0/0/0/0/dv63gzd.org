I mean, if your character is going to a magic school, has all that, has a super smart bushy haired best friend and a red head one... Yeah, you'd get sued. You're not even really writing a HP story if you change enough that you wouldn't get sued. So if you've got that fem lesbian Harry and everything else, you can't really take your story and make it your own.
