Considering that canon Harry is not Dark and extremely powerful to the point where he's good at everything he tries and a girl, and gay, I would label that as a new original character in place of Harry Potter. It's not /Harry/ reacting to a new magical world. It's a completely different person put into Harry's shoes.

And yes, I realize that Dark!Harry is usually associated by Powerful!, or Ambitious! or Vindictive!, or Intelligent! but that leads to my other point about "too little change". Lots of Dark!Harry fics out there. Many of them hit the same points. Starts to get repetitive. Bash the Weasleys, Dumbledore is manipulative, and Slytherins are misunderstood. Got it.

"Oh, but in /my/ fic, Harry's a girl and has a /lesbian/ relationship with Daphne Greengrass, instead of a straight relationship."

...Right. So where's the story about the magical world full of wonder that shouldn't be exploited and ripped apart, and friends banding together and fighting the great evil? Nothing in these 1000 fics? Darn. Oh look, another HP:MoR ripoff just popped up, this time with a "[Harry P., Tom R.]" tag.

Fantastic.

But that's totally recognizable as the same Harry we all grew up with, right?
