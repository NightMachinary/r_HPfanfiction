But you can have a Fem!Dark!Powerful!Vindictive!Lesbian!Harry without taking things too far. A daughter of James and Lily that happens to be lesbian, who goes dark --- the vindictiveness and power usually comes with dark!Harry fics. Unless a dozen other characters had changes similar, it really wouldn't be taking so far out.

If you have a daughter born to James and Lily, part of the prophecy, grows up with the Dursleys, and has other similarities to canon Harry, can you really label that character as your original character?
