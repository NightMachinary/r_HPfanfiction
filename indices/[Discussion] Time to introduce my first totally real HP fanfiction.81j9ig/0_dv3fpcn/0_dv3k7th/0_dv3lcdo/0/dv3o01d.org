No, I know what he meant. I was simply using Harry specifically as an example, I should have included more examples to clarify that I don't like an overload of too many changes.

As for the the examples you mentioned, I've only read A Black Comedy, and although I do agree that Harry's personality is different from canon, the story as a whole won me over with its excellent writing and comedy.

Some changes here and there are fine. In fact, too little change is boring and uncreative. The meaning of my post was just a commentary on taking things so far out there that it's not recognizable anymore.
