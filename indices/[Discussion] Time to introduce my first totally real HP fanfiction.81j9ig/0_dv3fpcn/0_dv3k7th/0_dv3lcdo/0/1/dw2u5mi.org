I'm still kinda new to reddit and commening and everything so I had no idea that my comment spanned a discussion. I'm sorry if my reply is late or bringing back a thread that is too old by now.

Anyway, this is exactly what I was going for, not Harry as an individual, but any character that has been changed too much. I usually don't read fics that have Harry as a protagonist, so I did really take it as any character that's too much OOC. I definitely agree that too little change can get boring, nobody wants to read rehashing of the books.

Also, if the main character is OOC, even if it is a fem! Lord Slytherin! mightyallpowerful! whatever! Harry (or anybody, actually), if there's a good reasoning behind his characterization I'm willing to read it, but if it's a fic where I get informed in author's note in the first chapter, that this is not the Harry that we have from the books, and no explanation or reasoning whatsoever behind it, then I usually stop reading immediately.
