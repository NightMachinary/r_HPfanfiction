I don't think his comment was what you were going for. I'm fairly certain they were talking about "HP" as in the universe as a whole, not the character specifically.

Most fanfiction should replace the tag 'Harry P' with OC, then, with your preference, including much of the most recommended fanfics here. I honestly wouldn't still be reading fanfiction if every Harry had to keep strictly to his canon personality, or only be allowed a little bit of change.

A Black Comedy, Seventh Horcrux, Stages of Hope, Sum of Their Parts, etc. would all need to be labeled as OC, because they're most certainly changing Harry's character more than a little bit.
