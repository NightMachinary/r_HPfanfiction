Well said. That's exactly what I was going for.

A !Fem!Dark!Powerful!Vindictive!Lesbian Harry is not Harry Potter, it's an OC taking Harry's place.

If you're going to change the world or characters a little bit, that's fine; but at the end of the day I'm reading Harry Potter fanfiction because I love Harry Potter.
