[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble]] hero's assemble by stargon1 fits that criteria. It is a marvel cinematic universe crossover with avengers and so might not be what you want. The book doesn't really feature his travels before he meets the avengers except that he does leave Britain and travels. This is a really good story and even if this isn't exactly what you want you should check it out and the authors other hp series the cupboard series is really good also. I hope this helped
