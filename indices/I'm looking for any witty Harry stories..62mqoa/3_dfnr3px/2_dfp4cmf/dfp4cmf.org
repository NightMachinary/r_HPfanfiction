Well, this one has Hermione saying "damn" the whole time, but a second later chiding Ron for "Language". Everyone says "Jeez", "Damn" and stuff like that all the time, it's really obviously american.

Hermione, even when American, wouldn't say "Jeez". If anything, she'd say "Jesus". Also, chapters 2-5 alone have 30 (!) instances of someone saying "Mate". Maybe that's how people talk, but I wouldn't write like that...

It has some great ideas, but the poor language overall makes me flinch constantly and not enjoy the story too much :(
