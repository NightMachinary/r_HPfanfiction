What's going on with this one? I just started reading it, but after the into theres no mention of the dementor attack whatsoever....its like it never happened. Am I missing something? Because I expected a story where Harry slowly recovers from the effects of a dementors kiss and it doesnt seem anything like that so far tbh.
