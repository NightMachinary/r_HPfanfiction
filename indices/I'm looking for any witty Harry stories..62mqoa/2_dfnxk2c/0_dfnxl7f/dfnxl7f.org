  Born two years before the prophecy, Tom Riddle does not mark Harry as his equal, but life has never been easy for Potters. How will an intelligent, and independent Harry, fit into the two dimensional wizarding world? Will he conform to the prescribed paths or will he resist the manipulations of the powers that be? Harry/Fleur eventually. OCs major part of the story. More inside.
