When giving characteristics to these people you can take two routes: Try to make them realistic people or follow JKRs lead and make them into caricatures/archetypes. The second option makes more sense thematically, because that's how JKR approached most of her characters - depth beyond that is just 'crafted-on' later. People often complain about "ice-queen" Daphne Greengrass, but it's very much in line how JKR would have introduced a new character: Come up with a defining characteristic and ham it up.

Just look at the characters from the book: Molly (mother and housewive), Hermione (overachieving bookworm), Dumbledore (excentric wizard), Bellatrix (crazy bitch)

IMHO it's actually pretty difficult to put a 'serious' character into this world because it often feels tonally out of place to me, if there's suddenly a character that doesn't fit in some kind of box.
