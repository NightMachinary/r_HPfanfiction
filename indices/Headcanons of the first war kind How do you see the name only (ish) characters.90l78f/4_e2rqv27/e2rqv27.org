Always found myself drawn to Caradoc Dearborn of the first Order of the Phoenix. Disappeared six months after the photo Moody showed Harry was taken - assumed dead. I created a whole backstory around Dearborn being a muggle-born who had come to realise the war effort was failing, so he cut ties with the Order and fled to Europe or beyond.
