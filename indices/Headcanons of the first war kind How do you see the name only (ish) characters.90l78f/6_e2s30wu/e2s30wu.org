Marlene McKinnon, Dorcas Meadowes, Caradoc Dearborn and any other character from the Original Order weren't in the same year as the Marauders and Lily.

Same goes for Mulciber and Avery.

Frank and Alice are at least three years older than the Marauders.

I like to think that Mary Macdonald was close to Lily, with both of them being Muggle-born; that she married Reg Cattermole and that she was one of Jily's friends that sent photographs to Hagrid at the end of Harry's first year.
