I reckon charming, capable, intelligent Tom Riddle collected people that were useful in different ways. Like Rookwood was an unspeakable. Abraxas and later Lucius were financial geniuses. The Black family pre-first-war were top of Britains social ladder. I think Dolohov would be a curse breaker or a spell inventer or something.
