I have a three about the Order of the Phoenix, since I once wrote a bit of a timetravel Harry fic in which he militarizes the Order during the first war.

*Dorcas Meadows:*

I wrote her as probably the strongest, most powerful witch in the Order at that time, superior to even people like McGonagall, Moody and even able to give Dumbledore a run for his money. She was an ICW Executioner (another bit of fanon of mine), but resigned when the ICW refused to get involved in the nationally confined conflict of her homelands. She joined the Order, but was soon disillusioned by Dumbledore's pacifism. She was part of the splittergroup including Moody and Sirius that engaged in unsanctioned warfare against Death Eaters against Dumbledore's wishes and orders. She found death on the battlefield during the defense of a wizarding enclave that was infamous for inter-special relationships, holding off Voldemort himself in a fierce duel before he ended her with the "Hedgehog Curse" (charming the bones to produce spikes that then skewer organs and flesh).

Dorcas grew up in Wales, on a little farmstead that held a small variety of magical creatures and was part of the British Dragon Preserve. Her mother was a muggleborn, her father a pureblood. Her mother, Saanvi Meadows was brought to Britain by Newt Scamander, in an effort to rescue obscurial children from their abusive homes. As such she was an odd case of a muggleborn hating muggles. Her father, Dwight Meadows was ignorant of muggle culture, but shared the distaste against them with his wife. Dorcas came very early to them, when Saanvi was 17 and Dwight 18, as the result of some broom closet activities. The early pregnancy made them rethink complex plans of gainful Ministry employment and brought them to be potion ingredient farmers, which was and is a stable income. Her parents stayed out of the war as best as they could and are still alive.

Dorcas joined Hogwarts in 1964, as a Gryffindor. She was interested in all things "duel" from a very early age. She was great friends with Filius Flitwick, who joined as a Ravenclaw a year after her. They met in a Slug Club meeting during her fifth year and from then on out honed their skill in mock duels against each other. The difference between them was that Filius was never interested in actually fighting, only duelling. Dorcas, however, longed for battle, having grown up on the tales of heroism in the Grindelwald wars. After their graduation, Filius shook up the duelling circuit, and Dorcas joined the Aurors. After she finished Auror training, she soon grew tired of investigative work and looked for a more suitable job for her. She found it with the ICW, who employed "Executioners", a job in which powerful mages of all nations gather for a special, international Magical Criminals task force. She drew first blood on the planes of the Serengeti, against a slaver ring dealing with Veela, Sphinx and witches. Codename Scythe (Meadow... scythe... you get it), as she was soon known, made a name for herself as being a just, but brutal executioner, who liked nothing more than the criminals resisting arrest. People in the Order who disliked her often named her as "Dumbledore's Dolohov".

She is the most detailed because I had her as Harry's second in command, and eventually confidante in the fic.

*Marlene McKinnon:*

I wrote Marlene as the first true intelligence officer of the Order. She was a witch of average skill, but cunning and remarkable social skills. What she lacked in reading books, she made up in reading people. She was employed by the Wizengamot as procedural overseer and archiver, which gave her insight into the comings and goings of the legislative and juridical branch of magical Britain. She knew of new laws coming before they were discussed and was capable of seeing patterns and alliances emerge soon before they became public knowledge. As such she added a lot of political pressure for the members opposed to Voldemort (even though in the end it wasn't enough). Her direct link to the Wizengamot was her own mother Jenna McKinnon, who was seated in the council representing Marlene's grandfather Marek Ollivander. Her faher, Alban McKinnon, was Head of Magical Maintenance and Heritage, and as such a well reowned man as well. It was the McKinnons networking and connections that allowed Dumbledore detailled access to the political side of things his own political party (The Phoenix) was barred from. It was their efforts that allowed The Phoenix to work against legislation before it was even introduced.

The McKinnons deaths marked the point where Dumbledore deemed the war lost. Without their intelligence network, there was no chance of predicting any move by the political forces backing the Dark Lord.

*Benjy Fenwick:*

Benjy had even been known in Hogwarts to be a sly bastard, slippery as an eel and full of tricks. He was a remarkable wizard when it came to concealment, camouflage, illusions and deceptions. As such he was the Orders main saboteur and infiltrator. Dumbledore said about him that he was "as close as someone can get to /becoming/ a metamorph". His uncanny ability to transfigure himself, and sometimes forgetting about these transfigurations, made some people a bit uneasy. He was also part of the more militant splittergroup, even though he was only seldom seen in the midst of battle. He wasn't the guy to shoot spells at people. He preferred traps, poisons and the subtle elegance of a well placed Confundus Charm. Benjy also held the muggles ways of sabotage and assassination in high regards, often citing that "no wizard ever thinks about checking for dynamite" and "you can't shield what you can't see coming". Despite the limitations on mundane weaponry against magicals, he had been able to score devastating blows against the Death Eaters by the use of pressure plate-triggered IEDs, and was especially proud of his assassination of Phillip√© Malfoy by the use of his muggle father's old Lee Enfield rifle. However, his most important role in the Order was the infiltation of gatherings of functions and galas where the backers of Voldemort gathered. His information led to remarkable numbers of arrests and kept the war going for way much longer than Voldemort had predicted.

He was found out at one of these gatherings by Yaxley who ran counter-intelligence within the Death Eater ranks on orders of the Dark Lord. When Benjy drank firewhiskey with veritaserum in it, he spilled his identity to the gathered crowd. Panicking he contacted the Order over Protean Charm, but even with their fast response time, he wasn't able to escape with his life. He suffered through a wild mix of curses before Bellatrix Lestrange disposed of him with a blasting curse to refocus her troops on the arriving Order forces.
