[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]] does this extremely well. It's probably one of my favourite fics because of all of the world-building. The first few chapters are terribly cliche, and some parts of the story aren't the best, but it's absolutely brilliant.

I also plan to write something similar two that where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna, Draco, and Astoria are sent back in time to their younger bodies. Harry, Ron, and Neville are Aurors (Neville is just doing it part-time as he does his apprenticeship with Professor Sprout), and Hermione, Draco, and Astoria are Unspeakables. Ginny and Luna kind of tend to drift around, Luna often going on Magizoology exhibitions when she's not helping them with ancient spells, and Ginny got seriously injured during a Holyhead Harpies game and so she looked to Bill, a Master Curse-Breaker, to teach her curse-breaking. She and Harry both became apprentices to him and they rekindled their relationship due to this.

I'm not sure when I plan to post the fic, or if I do, but it's definitely going to be fun to write. So many different point-of-views and different interests and all of the relationships!
