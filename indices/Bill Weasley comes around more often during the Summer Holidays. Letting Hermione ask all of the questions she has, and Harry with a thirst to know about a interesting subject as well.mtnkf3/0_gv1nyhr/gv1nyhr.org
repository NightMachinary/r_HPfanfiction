Bill and Charlie are both terribly underused characters. Bill is essentially an older version of the twins that is more mellow. Charlie is just Arthur but his obsession is incredibly manly (dragons) as opposed to kind of geeky (muggle otaku).

I like to imagine that Bill and Charlie take more after their father and the Weasley line: they have their obsessions, they're calm and level-headed, slow to anger and easy to forgive, they have a natural emotional maturity. While the younger children all take after Molly and the Prewetts side of the family more. Emotional highs and lows, tempestuous tempers, quick to anger and they carry a long grudge. The Twins, Ron, and Ginny all seem to be Prewetts by nature, and they get the most screen-time by far.

We barely, by contrast, see much of the Weasley nature: Percy is clearly one, but he's barely involved in most things and ends up being something of an ass. The only other brothers besides Percy that take after Arthur and the Weasley side of the family are, of course, Bill and Charlie. Which is why I feel more stories should use them. They're both far more like Arthur, and Arthur is a great character.
