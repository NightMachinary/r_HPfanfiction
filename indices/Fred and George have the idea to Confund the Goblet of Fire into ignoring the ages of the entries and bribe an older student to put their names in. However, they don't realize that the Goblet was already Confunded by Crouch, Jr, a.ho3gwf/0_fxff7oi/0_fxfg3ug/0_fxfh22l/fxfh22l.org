We need fanart of the following:

â€‹

Karkaroff's mom putting a dragon on its place, as some kind of Augusta Longbottom

Percy trying to fight another dragon as Fudge trembles behind him

Sirius winking at Harry as he appears in the last minute to complete the first task.

Pomona Sprout with gillyweed

Filch in a swimsuit about to enter the Lake, something in The Adams Family style. The twins one at each side teasing him

Krum looking sideways at Peeves in a disapproving manner

Fleur and her sister looking astonished as Filch rescues a cat out of the Lake.

Cedric and Harry in the maze running looking at malformed baby Voldemort with smug faces.
