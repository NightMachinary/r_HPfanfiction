"Harry Potter!"

It was as if the Great Hall had gone completely silent at once, and, suddenly every set of eyes there was turning to Harry. Eventually, he stood up, but a new burst of flame distracted him.

"Pomona Sprout!" Dumbledore yelled now,

The alluded professor jumped on her place, after a questioning look from McGonagall, "I- I didn't-" she managed.

Then new flames threw Percy's name in the air, who was gobsmacked by it, to say the least. The twins' names came next, and everyone was suspecting them already when a the name of "Moaning Myrtle"

"He can't mean..."

"The ghost?"

The whispers grew to a loud mumbling as Dumbledore read the name of Peeves out of a parchment. The silence long forgotten.

"Argus Filch," the headmaster said next, causing the caretaker to pale and almost fell on his face in shock.

Igor Karkaroff rushed to the front, "Is this some sort of joke to you?" the headmaster of DUrmstrang said, when the flames threw anew piece of parchment.

"Your Mom." Dumbledore read, looking at Karkaroff.

Karkaroff caught a paper himself, this time reading "Sirius Black." and he almost toppled over.

"Enough! What's the meaning of this? Dumbledore?" asked the minister.

A new name flew to them, "Cornelius Fudge" read Dumbledore.

"You can't expect me to..."

Then the flame burst out last time before shutting off, and Dumbledore caught the last name, "Voldemort" he read.
