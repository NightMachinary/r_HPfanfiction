I'd enjoy this, but mostly if the only thing Peeves put in was the 'yo mama' and we had an entire story where Kendra Dumbledore (since Dumbledore took the parchment from the cup, he'd semantically be the 'your' of the paper) rises from the dead and participates in the Tournament. Now that would be fun. :D
