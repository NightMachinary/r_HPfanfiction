I swear on my honor that I've never read such a fluffy story in my life. Harry's heart is just soooo innocent and pure and Voldemort is so in love and smitten with him that it's honestly pathetic.

"Almost..." whispered Harry. "Kiss me again..."

Know that you hurt me with your foul, disloyal ways, and that I will rest peacefully in the ever after knowing that you will never rest peacefully again. Love, your dearest Emerelda.” Tom scoffed as he lowered the note once he was finished reading it aloud, and looked at the solicitor with one eyebrow raised. “This isn't for me.” Tom's got a bit of a curse on his hands. Luckily for him, this curse comes in a rather attractive form.
