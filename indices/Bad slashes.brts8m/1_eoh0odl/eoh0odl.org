Some other threads have asked this same question (or similar). I recommend checking out this one for some excellent answers of why some people find it plausible and appealing to read:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8uyp4g/how_do_authors_realistically_and_successfully/]["How do authors realistically and successfully pair Harry(male or female) with Tom/Voldemort?"]]

A few examples:

 

*** Unhealthy relationships can be fascinating
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: unhealthy-relationships-can-be-fascinating
    :END:
Many people enjoy reading about explicitly unhealthy relationships because of the intense drama/emotional tension/heartbreak that such stories contain. Of course, this is not something that the reader would ever want to happen in real life, but it can be interesting to read about tragedies that delve into the darker side of human nature.

In those sorts of fics Tom Riddle (or Voldemort) may manipulate Harry through mind magic, the horcrux connection, Stockholm syndrome, etc. In many cases Riddle/Voldemort is written as unhealthily possessive of Harry, since possessiveness is the closest that he (a psychopath) can come to approximating the emotion of love.

 

*** Redemption arcs can be romantic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: redemption-arcs-can-be-romantic
    :END:
Many people enjoy reading redemption stories in which a 'good' guy successfully turns a 'bad' guy away from the path of evil through the 'power of love'. It's a happy ending trope that is common even outside of fanfiction.

This is especially common in fics where Harry time travels back to before Voldemort opened the Chamber of Secrets for the first time. Many people set Tom Riddle's last chance of redemption (i.e. 'point of no return') at before he committed his first murder and/or made his first horcrux.

 

*** Good guys/girls like bad guys/girls
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: good-guysgirls-like-bad-guysgirls
    :END:
In fics that don't involve time travel, Voldemort often regains his sanity/good looks before the plot delves into any hint of romance. That way he more easily fits into the 'antihero' or 'bad guy with a heart of gold' archetype. This is a very popular trope in the romance genre.

Sometimes the fic invents a backstory in which Riddle started out with good intentions before the horcruxes drove him crazy, so once his sanity is restored he 'recants his evil ways', or Harry uses love to persuade him to 'be a better person', etc. In other cases, the fic author creates an AU in which the 'good' and 'evil' sides of the war were more like shades of gray with well-intentioned extremists on either side. In that case it's plausible that Harry would side with Voldemort over people who would want to kill him for being a horcrux, which can then be setup for Harry and Voldemort getting closer to each other emotionally..
