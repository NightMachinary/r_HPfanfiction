Haha ! Sorry ! while writing it I knew that it wasn't exactly the way to say it correctly.

I wasn't talking about the « safe » characters with which Harry or the main characters are already friends in canon. More like Draco, Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Nott, etc, etc.

And like I said, most of these ships call for an AU where either the murder/various crimes are not committed or it happens before anything happens, or in the case of Draco, there would be an actual redemption, etc.

So, it's rarely about Harry, mid war, deciding that « eh, it's fine, let's get into a relationship with Voldemort while he kills all my friends ». (Or if it's the case, the fic will clearly be about unhealthy relation, Stockholm syndrome and/or others manipulations).

If you want to read about a cute relationship that you'd want to have in real life, that obviously wouldn't be the good ship for that.

Anyway, I feel like my English is meeting a limit while trying to explain it correctly/clearly. But it's the same than any other AU ships like HP/Daphne, Snape/anyone, where the relationship is not something for a romantic comedy (does it makes sense? Haha). But the next poster actually explained it so much better than me!

In the end, the difference is more that of Ron/Hermione (for example) being more of a Jane Austen type of stories, more of something realistic, that you'd want in real life. While ships with LV and co, it's more like Hannibal/Will (at least, from what I saw on tumblr), or characters like Patrick Bateman. It's clearly not healthy or as romantic than the other, and you'd want in real life. It's « good » in a literary sense, the interest is literary, it's not a normalisation or anything of LV's moral. Everyone is aware that LV deserves death if it was real life/realistic. Just like, for me, Draco and Snape are terrible, awful people. But still, I understand the interest in fan fiction with ships involving them. We don't always read fiction for relationships or characters that we'd like or even tolerate in real life.
