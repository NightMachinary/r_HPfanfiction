Someone asked the same « question » a few days ago, I think (if you want better answers than mine).

I don't see what you means by « after his horcruxes ».

But, I guess one of the prominent interest in HP/LV/Riddle is the trope of the hero and his nemesis with which they share so much (the whole « we're two sides of the same coin » thing). It's not new, it's not limited to this fandom either.

Also, a lot of the fics are either very critical of the relationship and the interest is in the fact that's it's an unhealthy relationship to begin with. Or, they play with time travel because it's very interesting to see what would have become because Harry and Tom are literally the same at the beginning (orphans, difficult relation with muggles, etc, etc) and how they'd influence each other.

To be fair, I don't see how it'd make less sense than Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Snape. HP/Bellatrix is probably just as « bad ». From this reddit, it seems that Pansy/Harry is very en vogue, and I don't see how it's any « better » if you just focus on canon and don't give a chance to the writer's own universe.

I've read fics with Harry/Tom that are written in such way that it's so much better than a lot of Ron/Hermione I've read where the characters became so caricatural that the relationship became literally so abusive without the narrative or the characters realising it.

So, yeah. I don't really understand. It's just like any other non-canon ship, from my POV.
