I imagine the therapist would try to get him to accept that the things that happened to him weren't his fault. He probably also has a lot of survivor's guilt to deal with. The ultimate goal might be to have him be willing to get emotionally close to people again. That'll be challenging, considering what happened the last time he got close to people.

In one of my stories, he internalizes the hate society directs at him, and is a cutter. The abuse he accepts from Tonks is another manifestation of his self-destructive impulses. Good luck to a therapist trying to fix that.
