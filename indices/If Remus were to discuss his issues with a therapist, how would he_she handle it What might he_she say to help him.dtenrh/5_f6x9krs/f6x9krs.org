I thought of a Muggle therapist and how they'd be doing some very interesting psychoanalysis on how this mild-mannered man thinks he's a werewolf and what kind of a childhood event could have made him hate his inner self so much. (Because, of course, the werewolf is symbolic.) Since I mentioned psychoanalysis, I suppose the therapist would think it has to do with sex.

"It's perfectly fine to be different as long as you don't hurt anyone with it, Mr Lupin. It's been known for many years, that homosexuality isn't a sickness." Or something along those lines. This one was just an easy one.
