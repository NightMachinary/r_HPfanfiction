I keep thinking about the relationship between Lucifer and the psychologist in "Lucifer". Basically, Remus would tell the therapist he is a real werewolf from the start and the therapist would just think he has a form of delusion and just goes along with it. Remus would try multiple times to convince her he is the real deal unsuccessfully while the doctor tries to cure him. Until Remus actually transforms in front of her and she runs away screaming or something lol

In the end, she would come to accept werewolves are actually real and continue having sessions with Remus. This would be a hell of a story, I would definitely read it!
