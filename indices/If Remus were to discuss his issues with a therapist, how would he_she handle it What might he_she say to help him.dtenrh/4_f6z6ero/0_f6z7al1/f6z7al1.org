Thanks. I have a question though I do realise it's sort of a spoiler. I haven't started the fic yet, but in your tags it says Remus is gay, so what are you going to do about that canon romance? I now imagine that this might be something he chose either out of loneliness or like you said in your comment, because they sort of manipulated him. I'm just really curious about everything that writers think about Remus and his behaviour, particularly since you are maybe the only one to recognize that Remus lets other people treat him badly.
