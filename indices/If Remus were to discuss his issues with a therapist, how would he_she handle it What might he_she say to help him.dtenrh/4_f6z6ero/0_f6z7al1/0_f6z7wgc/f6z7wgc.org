Well, I'm considering the metaphor JKR said she originally had in mind, right?

So basically, like Remus suppressed the fact that he's a werewolf, he would suppress that part of himself as well. Especially since it's canonically stated that Tonks has a very similar personality to someone Remus has a lot of respect and affection for.

Though, I'm hoping to expand on both Sirius and Tonks (and others) and make them more complex than they ultimately were in the Harry Potter books.
