Hopefully this link works.

Also, I should clarify the first part of the story is a seven-part “novel” series about how the Marauders grew up as friends (strictly from Remus's point of view) and the sequel is a one-book look into the first and second wizarding wars for most of that generation's point of view. So Tonks doesn't show up as a love interest until the sequel.

If you're still interested, though, I'd love to hear what you think!
