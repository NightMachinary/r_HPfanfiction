Big disclaimer: I'm not a therapist, but my stepmother is.

And the answer, as per my understanding, is "it depends". There is no one form of therapy, there are multiple approaches that the therapists chooses based on their diagnosis, own experience, gut feeling and other facts that I don't know about.

Let's take one example that doesn't apply, but involves less of the talking you would usually associate with therapy: there is behavior-theraphy, which you do when you want to change a certain behavior, to help the patient out of patterns they aquired over their lifetime. Instead of talking about the past you would instead try to develop new patterns and strategies to apply to your life.

What you're thinking of is called "analytical psychology" or perhaps psychoanalysis - two distinct approaches that both (and I might be wrong here, so take this with a grain of salt) have in common that they assume that current problems stem from stuff that happened in the past, and base their therapy of that.

In general, in psychoanlysis a fundamental idea is that by talking about your past and being confronted by it, you gain insight into it, allowing you to get better. And here I put my third disclaimer: I'm not a therapist, so I might be misunderstanding things! Despite the risk of being wrong, I'll continue: it might involve the therapist asking questions and trying to understand Remus' past, and then confronting him with things he isn't willing to talk and think about.

"Do you think you deserve hate for being a werewolf?" "Do you blame your parents for it?" "Do you truly believe Sirius could do this? Why haven't you visited him yet?" "So do you think Harry deserves to be with the Dursleys, or why did you stay away?" "If it's so shit in England, why stay?"

Stuff that Remus might now /want/ to think about on it's own, or questions that may help him realise things he hasn't realized yet.

Anyway, that is one approach to therapy. There is also [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy][Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], that is a bit more modern and tries to take into account to progress made since Freud. Because just like physics research didn't stop with Newton, psychotherpay research didn't stop with Freud.

If you want to check out how to write this, I'd go to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Phases_in_therapy][Phases in therapy]] section of the article, and figure out what phase you want Remus to be in, and then you can chose approperiately.

tl;dr: There is no one "therapy", instead there is a host of approaches that depend on different things, so the questions asked depend on the therapy, the therapist, and the patient
