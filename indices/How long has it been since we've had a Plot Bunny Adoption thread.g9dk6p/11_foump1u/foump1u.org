I don't have the writing chops or the time to do this justice.

An AU where Merope lives. Riddle is still a psychopath but in a CEO way rather than a bloodthirsty dark lord way. His manipulations have Abraxas Malfoy beat out Eugenia Jenkins for Minister on a campaign based on being tough on the Squib rioters and anti-Muggleborn dogwhistles about "pureblood pride" and "wizarding tradition". They pass policies gradually that reduce the ability of Muggleborns to hold positions of power. Then begin requiring magical children to go to Ministry run schools before Hogwarts age, this gives non-Muggleborns the advantage of more magical education than Muggleborns and it allows the Ministry the ability to indoctrinate children. "Mudblood terrorists" infiltrate the MoM sometime in the late 80s/early 90s and kill several employees who just so happen to be muggle/muggleborn friendly purebloods (Arthur Weasley, James Potter, one or both of the Longbottoms, etc). This massacre is used to justify even more oppressive policies and elevates Bellatrix Lestrange to Head of the DMLE.

Eventually, sometime in the early/mid 90s, the pureblood regime, with their power firmly secured, turns their focus to anti-halfblood policies. Riddle is outed as a halfblood and falls from power and starts building his own resistance. Riddle and Dumbledore + his supporters find themselves reluctant allies.
