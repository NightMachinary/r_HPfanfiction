I've had this idea for ages where Voldemort won the war, forcing most of the people on the light side to flee to other countries. Harry goes into self-imposed exile out of shame, and not even Ron or Hermione can find him. Years later, Ron and Hermiones daughter (She doesn't have to be called Rose, this is an alternate timeline) manages to track him down and convinces him to return and fight. They rally the Order again, take the fight to Voldemort, and win, although Harry is mortally wounded, he gets to spend one last moment with Ron and Hermione before he passes.

Some other notes to go along with it.

- Voldenort wins partly by securing his Horcruxes.

- Harry carries a war wound from losing to Voldemort the first time, something like missing an arm.

- Everyone initially fled to Europe, but Voldenort slowly began to take that over, forcing them to flee to other countries.

- Harry went into exile in the mountains, either the Alps or the Himalayas.

- Rose is about 19 when she tracks down Harry.
