I have /so many/, but here are some highlights:

- Harry gets access to the memories in his scarcrux, and development of Occlumency allows him to access his own early memories. He's aware of how things were at the end of the last war, and is uncertain about whether to even bother with Wizarding Britain. He decides to attend Hogwarts, at least for his first year, to get a feel for how Wizarding Britain responded to Voldemort's defeat, and whether it's worth fighting for when Voldemort returns. He'll certainly find a few people worth protecting, but how will he judge the society itself?
- Somehow, the Wizengamot and/or the general Wizarding public get a complete and detailed accounting of the events of the graveyard (Pensieve memory played at Harry's hearing?). One of the Darker pureblood lords stands and, after reaffirming his belief in the importance of blood purity and the superiority of purebloods over other wizards (and wizards over Muggles), calls out the Death Eaters as the /real/ blood-traitors. After all, here are a bunch of purebloods debasing themselves before a lowly half-blood son of a Muggle, and murdering other purebloods for refusing to do the same. Now the Death Eaters have new opponents - the Dark families.
- They say that those we love will always remain a part of us even after they're gone. For Master of Death Harry Potter, this is a far more literal statement. He carries the souls of departed loved ones within him, and they're far from silent, conversing with him and with each other, and often influencing his behavior and personality. Having outlived pretty much everybody he's ever known, his head can be a very noisy place. At times, he can be distant yet strangely insightful, bossy and axiomatic, or even just hungry and craving a chess game.
- The war ended, and within less than a year most of the people of Wizarding Britain had turned on Harry. /Again/. Now he's in the past, in the body of his younger self, and he's going to do things right this time. No, he's not going to vanquish Voldemort more quickly and efficiently; he's going to basically leave him free rein. He's going to save the people worth saving, and leave the rest to burn.
- Trelawney is deliberately teaching Divination poorly, with the intent of lessening people's belief in Seers and thus helping protect those that truly have the Gift. She herself is a gifted Seer, but the constant influx of what-may-be is just too overwhelming, so she drinks to keep her Inner Eye closed. Should a Battle of Hogwarts occur, she'll sober up for the fight, using her gift to fight with foreknowledge of the enemy's moves and of where she can make the greatest difference.
- Phoenixes are born not of other phoenixes, but when a magical being of extraordinary character and purity of heart dies. The Order of the Phoenix is (unbeknownst to any but its founder) named not for Fawkes, but for Dumbledore, who has convinced himself that he'll become a phoenix. For decades, being reborn as a phoenix has been one of his main goals, though he also tries to encourage others to behavior that he believes would help them towards a phoenix rebirth. This is also why he has no fear of death - he honestly expects it to turn him into a phoenix - and why he seems so intent on reforming everyone: He both wants to give them a chance at phoenix rebirth, and considers redeeming evil people "light" and thus part of his journey to becoming a phoenix himself.
- Deathly Hallows indicates that there is no separate Heaven or Hell in the Potterverse, just an afterlife where the punishment for misdeeds is the damage they did to your own soul. Merope Gaunt's punishment for raping Tom Riddle Sr. is to first watch the horrors perpetrated by the child of that union, then spend eternity caring for the eight mutilated fragments of her beloved son's soul, forever wishing but unable to ease his pain. Could work well as a horror/tragedy oneshot.
- When Harry is first introduced to the Ministry of Magic, he's told that they handle keeping the magical world secret, but as the series progresses they turn out to be more of a full independent government (one which clearly doesn't follow the laws of the UK, and at least borders on autocracy). This idea is: The Ministry was /originally/ founded as a secret government agency/department/organization/whatever with the stated mission of maintaining the Statute of Secrecy, but since that time, they've been gradually (and past a point technically illegally) expanding both their role and their authority, while cutting away the ties binding them to the rest of the British government. Nowadays, very few in Her Majesty's government know about magic, and though they know that the current Ministry is flouting a large number of important British and international laws, they can't really do anything about it without risking a full-scale conflict with magicals. It doesn't help that, every time the British PM confronts the current Minister for Magic about the illegality of their Ministry and its actions, they tend to forget about the entire issue (even if other people still remember and have records).
- Occlumency is meant to protect the user's mind from external intrusion and influence while granting said user greater control over their own mind and emotions. What if there's a downside to this? What if, the more you master and use Occlumency, the more resistant you become to new information, ideas, opinions, etc.? In this concept, Occlumency tends to result in the gradual ossification of the user's thought processes, making it harder and less likely for them to change their mind or their plans. This might explain how, no matter what happens, all Snape sees when he looks at Harry is a mini-James, or how Dumbledore and/or Voldemort might keep trying the same thing or attempting to salvage the same plan despite repeated failures.

*And Crossover Ideas!*

- The Second Blood War wasn't won as quickly and decisively as in canon. Instead, the fighting began to spread to other countries and other populations, eventually pulling in even Muggles and nonhumans. New would-be conquerors arose across the globe, each preaching their own version of a genetic utopia. This period of war and devastation would echo down the centuries, and later referred to as "The Eugenics Wars"...
- Remus Lupin shares at least the spelling of his last name with a couple of other fictional characters. What if they were actually kin? How would a Remus that's descended from and/or related to a notorious thief change things? Heck, what if a certain modern-day thief bearing that name came along to help out Harry and company, bringing his somewhat eccentric friends with him? In other words, Remus Lupin is related to Arsene Lupin and/or Lupin III.
- Umino Iruka (from Naruto) ends up teaching at Hogwarts. He acts as something of a mentor and genuinely supportive adult to Harry and other outcasts (Neville, Luna, Hermione, etc.), and during the Second Blood War advises the Order as someone with actual military training and wartime experience. Alternate version: ~15-year-old Sakura gets dropped into the summer between Harry's 4th and 5th year, leading to a Harry/Sakura pairing. I recently finished posting my take on the first idea as "Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire" on ffn and AO3, but would love to see others' versions.
- High School DxD crossover. Harry dies for real at the battle of Hogwarts (either Dumbledore was wrong or Harry decided not to come back). A Devil (Rias? Sona? Somebody else?) fills in some of their peerage from the casualties of said battle, starting with Harry. If Harry accepted his death and decided to move on, that could create some serious tension between himself and his new King after they dragged him back from his rest to fight in new battles. Another possible source of tension - I never said that only /defenders/ would get reincarnated.

Deciding that desperate measures are called for, Sirius summons the ghost of a distant uncle/cousin (the Black family tree is a bit of a tumbleweed) to help in the fight against Voldemort. He knows of this particular ancestor thanks to being compared to him by some older relatives: Both were free spirits with a love of pranks and a sometimes cruel and vicious sense of humor, though the latter was far more pronounced in the ancestor.

This ancestor was posthumously cast from the family due to his increasing fondness for Muggle American culture. Choosing to no longer call himself a Black, he went solely by his first name, one completely in line with the family's preference for astronomical names.

As his mother would often shout after his latest bout of antics: Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
