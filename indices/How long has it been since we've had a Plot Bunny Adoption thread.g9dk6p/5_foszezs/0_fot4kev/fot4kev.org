When would you roughly have it set? And what do you reckon is Ginny's special thing? Just because, I can see with the older brothers what their special skills and achievements are, various prefect, headboys, quidditch captains and cool jobs, but Ron did become a decent keeper and was a prefect as well. Just interested to hear what you'd presumably do to pull it off!
