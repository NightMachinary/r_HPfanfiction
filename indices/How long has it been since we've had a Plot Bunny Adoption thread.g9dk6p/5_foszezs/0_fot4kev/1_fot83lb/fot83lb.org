Ginny went on and became a professional quidditch player. She already won the quidditch cup without Harry in year five and six.

Besides that, she is the only girl child in the family. That may sound cheap, but it really isn't. If you are the only girl or boy child in your big family, you will definitely have a special place in your parents heart, and even your siblings. Not to mention she's also the youngest.
