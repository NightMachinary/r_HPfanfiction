A fic where James and Lily live and Harry's brother either is/is thought to be the boy who lived. James and Lily train Harry's brother way to fucking hard, to a point where he hates magic and actively tries to suppress it in the thought that is he were a squib they wouldn't train him anymore. He becomes an obscurial and Harry is brother to the-obscurial-who-lived. There'd prolly be a bit of James/Lily bashing or something but idk. Harry loves his brother and they've always been there for each other. Idk where to go from there.
