Arabella Figg would probably be the best option. She's already lives next door to the Dursley's, knows about magic, can live in the Magical or Muggle World, and with Dumbledore wanting Harry to have a "normal" life before Hogwarts, Figg being able to live in the Muggle World but keeping the two boys in the loop about magic, would be ideal.

Bill Weasley could be another option. Doesn't live with his family, works as a Curse Breaker, so he'd have odd hours, but he could also have Molly and Arthur babysit, instead of just having them raise the boys. Plus Bill would be able to protect the house with ease, with his knowledge on such spells.
