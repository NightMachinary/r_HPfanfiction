Arabella could always move away from the Dursley's, that wouldn't be too much of an issue, depending on how much money she has; of course. Also we know nothing about her past, she could be very experienced with raising, or helping to raise kids.

As for Bill, you have a point there. I didn't think about that.

Mhm, Remus would be out because he's a Werewolf. Severus would be out, just on principle, for how much I love Severus raising Harry stories, it just wouldn't happen in real canon, or even close to canon. Andromeda might be willing to help out, though after raising Nymphadora, she might not want to raise any more kids. I don't trust Augusta Longbottom, after what Neville went through.

Nymphadora would be a similar issue as Bill, at that point she'd be young still, and might at least be starting out as an Auror, if not still at Hogwarts.

Could always make it AU with the Flamels, though I don't know how much they'd be willing to raise kids at that age.

I doubt that Dumbledore would be willing to have the kids be raised at Hogwarts, if so he would have taken Tom Riddle Jr out of the orphanage the moment he saw where he was going.

Kingsley could be ideal, he's an Auror, he'd be able to protect Harry, he'd have odd hours because of his job, but again could ask Molly and Arthur to babysit, which I'm sure they'd be willing to do. Or even Andromeda or the like, if in a pinch.
