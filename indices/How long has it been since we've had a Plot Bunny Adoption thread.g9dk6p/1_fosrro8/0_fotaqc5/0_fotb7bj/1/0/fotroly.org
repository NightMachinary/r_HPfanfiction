I kinda disagree with those two, for a couple reasons. Arabella Figg has no experience raising kids, let alone two magical children. It's also implied that she moved to Little Whinging after Harry was placed with the Dursleys to keep an eye on him. Even if she was there before, if Petunia and Vernon didn't want to raise the kids, I doubt they'd be to pleased if the boys ended up living down the road from them. Overall she just doesn't seem like a good fit to me.

As for Bill well, all I'll say is at the time Harry and Dudley would need to be placed, young Bill was very much looking forward to the year after, when he'd be attending Hogwarts for the first time.
