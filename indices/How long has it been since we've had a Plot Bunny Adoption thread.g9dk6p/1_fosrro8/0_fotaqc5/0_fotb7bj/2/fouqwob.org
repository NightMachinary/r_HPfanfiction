The son of Dorea and Charlus? Or even Charlus himself? There's nothing that indicates they are dead and they are likely distant Potter relatives. Their questionable allegiance and the distance of their relationship (1st cousin once removed or second cousin) is why Harry never met them in canon. My headcanon is that Charlus was a Percy-like black sheep who adopted the soft bigotry of the establishment which put him at odds with his family of muggle/muggleborn advocates, hence why Dorea was not blasted off the tree. But maybe by 1981 he's had a change of heart?
