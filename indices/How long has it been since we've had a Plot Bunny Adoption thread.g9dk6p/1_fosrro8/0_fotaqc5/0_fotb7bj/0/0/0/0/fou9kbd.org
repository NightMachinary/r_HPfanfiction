I can't help but feel Figg would be his top choice of those, since Dumbledore didn't want Harry growing up in the magical world, plus I think it could give some interesting scope into how Squibs actually live, right on the edge of society. Plus I wouldn't put it past Dumbledore to hope Petunia would change her mind, on the grounds of being a close relative/"mother" figure.

All the others would be a cool read, though.
