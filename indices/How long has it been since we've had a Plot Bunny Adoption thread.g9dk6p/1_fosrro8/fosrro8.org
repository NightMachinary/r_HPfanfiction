I'll start with an idea that I haven't managed to get off the ground yet:

When Professor McGonagall is watching the Dursley's for the day, she sees an upset baby Dudley perform accidental magic, and let's Dumbledore know this when he arrives. This prompts Dumbledore to *actually have a conversation with the Dursleys* instead of just leaving a bloody letter.

In my mind, this then branches off into a few different possibilities:

1. Petunia and Vernon are so shocked by the fact Dudley is magic that they demand Albus take both boys away, and state quite emphatically that neither of them will have a home here. Dumbledore now needs to find a new family willing to take in not only the Boy-who-lived, but also his muggleborn cousin

2. Petunia and Vernon decide to keep the boys and stamp the magic out of them both, resulting in two abused children attending Hogwarts, with maybe one of the two being more brave and looking out for the other. I think it'd be really cool to have a very shy Dudley with a fiercely protective brother figure in Harry

3. Petunia and Vernon keep Dudley, either spoil or abuse him, but Harry is sent to a different home, with people who actually treat him well. It'd be very interesting to write the dynamic between a healthy, well-adjusted Harry and his recently discovered muggleborn cousin who was neglected in some way (either over-indulged or treated like Harry was in Canon)

Anyways, that's the bunny so far. Or maybe it's three bunnies...

Let me know what you think!
