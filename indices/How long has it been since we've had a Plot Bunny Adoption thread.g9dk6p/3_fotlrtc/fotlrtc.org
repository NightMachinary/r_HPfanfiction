where lucius malfoy is the sports rich frat boy. it's why he's friends with everyone upper class. it's not just money and privilege but shared interests.

he'd be the kind of guy who made a full event of going to a puddlemere game spent his time at the dinner table talking with draco about drafts and formations. head deep in a paper every day looking up the bulgarian league games to discuss with Crabbe senior/ and Nott senior if Ireland has a chance this year. and all the while Narcissa is quietly running his finances and political endeavours with an indulgent smile. and the whole death eater attack after the world cup is them having been completely wasted from celebrating the irish victory and are letting off some steam.

i always thought it was an interesting dichotomy about how southern racists love american football and are deeply appreciative of the game and individual players despite their tendency to be black.

like Lucius would champion a muggleborn before the fucking wizengamot if she was a competent seeker for his home team.

secondly i wish his rivalry with arthur came not from a political hatred of blood traitors but like an old school quidditch rivalry. or and i think this idea is hilarious an old romantic rivalry over either molly or narcissa.
