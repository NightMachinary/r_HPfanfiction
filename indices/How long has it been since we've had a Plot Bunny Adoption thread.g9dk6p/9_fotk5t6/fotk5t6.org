Petunia is asked by Harry after the Battle to come with him to return to Cokeworth for some reason. Most likely, Snape made Harry executor of his will, and particularly he is asked to find any relatives of his father's family and give him all his money (Harry then gets all magical books, Potion material, laboratory etc.). Petunia is thus forced to comfort her past (also, to attend the Snape's funeral) and explain it to Harry.
