I kinda second this. Would love to see Harry get to Hogwarts without the instantaneous bias against slytherin. Thus he should get put in slytherin himself and see where it goes from there.

It can easily fix two of my major problems with the series. Slytherins basically being faceless evil bad guys as well as Harry actually acting slytherin in some way. He does have clever moments but like it's the house of cunning and ambition and uh he just doesnt rlly show that much even though that's the first choice.
