That's fair it's just a pet peeve of mine.

Like when he sits there he is considered for the house of cunning and ambition. He as far as I'm aware had no goal in mind for his ambition at this point though so it's kinda like oh he's an ambitious person but he doesnt seem to have any beyond killing voldy.

And it's fine not to have ambition cuz the house isnt just that. The problem is he doesnt really show much cunning from what I remember.

Yeah personality traits arent fixed but like we are told those traits are there and they are basically never even mentioned again. It's just annoying for this potential to be there and its just like not mentioned and that's painful.
