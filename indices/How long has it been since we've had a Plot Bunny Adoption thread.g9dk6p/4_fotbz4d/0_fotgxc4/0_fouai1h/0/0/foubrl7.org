The only things I can really think of at that point are his ambitions to one day leave the Durlseys (which I suppose must seem mammoth when you've got no money and live in the environment he does). He could have come out of it all completely downtrodden but instead is looking forward to a fresh start at Stonewall High. He wants to make friends and the train's barely left before he has one, sort of thing.

I'll admit that it's a bit of a stretch, however. A bit like Albus Severus being in Slytherin yet seeming more Gryffindor than anything. I could understand the idea of the houses not being nearly as split personality-wise as made out (I strongly suspect this is the case) but I don't think that was where JKR was going.
