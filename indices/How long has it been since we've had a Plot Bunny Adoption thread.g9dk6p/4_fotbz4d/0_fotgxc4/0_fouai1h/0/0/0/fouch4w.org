Honestly it's annoying cuz it seems like the only reason the idea of him being slytherin is ever mentioned is "oh he could've been in the bad guy house".

It's annoying because a house of people who are ambitious and cunning could be so much more than how shallow it actually seems.

Like nobody needs to be a carbon copy perfect example but it honestly doesnt seem like slytherin characters were given the chance to be developed enough for them to be different.

I love the series but it's annoying how much potential was missed for those characters.
