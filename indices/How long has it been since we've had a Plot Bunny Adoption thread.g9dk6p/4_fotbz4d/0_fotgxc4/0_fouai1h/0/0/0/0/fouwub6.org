Yep, it's deeply uncomfortable how even many adults in the series suggest they are uncomfortable with children sorted into Slytherin. When we look at the size of Voldemort's inner circle, it's simply not possible that the majority of Slytherin's were involved.

Once you get outside that circle, you fall into the 'you don't know who you can trust' zone. I suppose that's probably a fair write up of people, though. There's nothing to stop someone being an extremely loyal bigot, after all.

I mean, what were Crabbe and Goyle's personality traits?

All the houses, save Gryffindor were quite weak, really. Even then, Gryffindor was essentially a demonstration of how most characters had traits from other houses.
