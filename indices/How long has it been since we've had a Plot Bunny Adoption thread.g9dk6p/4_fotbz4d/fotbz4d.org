One thing I've always wanted to see is that the Malfoys help Harry onto the platform instead of the Weasleys, and treat him the same way Molly did. A similar but separate idea is that Harry isn't prejudiced against slytherin (and by extension malfoy) from the very beginning, and ends up in slytherin. Or literally just anything that involves taking Harry from the dursleys early, blood magic be damned, and fostered with a magical family.
