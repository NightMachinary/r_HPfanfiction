First Idea: Remus ends up sitting with Severus and Lily, on his first train ride to Hogwarts.

Second Idea: Sirius is sorted into Slytherin, while Severus is sorted into another house.

Third Idea: Regulus secretly lived, and became a spy for Dumbledore.

Fourth Idea: Harry is Boy Who Lived, but also a Squib.

Fifth Idea: Next Gen story where James, Fred II or whomever else isn't impressed by their family and what they did, but get all excited about bands, or the like. I just imagine, seeing so many "influential" people, would make them immune to acting excited, that people in bands or the like would excite them more.

Sixth Idea: AU Where Remus and/or Tonks ends up surviving to help raise Teddy. Just would be nice to seeing more of those.

Seventh Idea: Sirius comes back from the veil, sometime after the war ends, and gets a trial to prove his innocence.
