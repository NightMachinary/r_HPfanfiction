The sorting hat refuses to sort Sirius into Gryffindor, reasoning that Gryffindor will bring out the worst in Sirius and turn him into a brash bully.

Sirius becomes rivals with James, and friends with Severus. They lean on each other from shared experiences with bad family, temptations of dark magic, and problems fitting in in Slytherin as a Black that makes it clear he doesnt want to be there and the half blood son of a disgraced Prince.

Eventually Sirius needs to step up to protect Regulus, and begins playing the part of the perfect son like expected of him. Sirius and Snape join Voldemort with intentions of bringing him down from the inside. Working alone at first, then with some other Death Eaters that want out, and finally with the Order, including a highly untrusting James Potter.
