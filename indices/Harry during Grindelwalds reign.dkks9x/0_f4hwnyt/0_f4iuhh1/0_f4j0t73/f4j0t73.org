Here's the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/double-vision-m.38707/][link]] but you need to be an active participant on the forums to access wba which is I think like 5 good posts that aren't deleted.

It can take some time to get approved as a member before you're allowed to post. But not everyone can access wba because it's mostly unfinished work it's not generally how people fully want to portray their story and they post it for critiques.
