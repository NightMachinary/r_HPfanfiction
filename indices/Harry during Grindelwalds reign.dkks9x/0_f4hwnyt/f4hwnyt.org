Well there's on in the WbA section of dlp about Harry Potter who dimensionally travels and meets his fem!counterpart cuz they both got their asses beat my Voldemort and then end up in grindelwalds time. They are both pretty stupidly powerful. But we haven't seen any conflict with another powerhouse to really gauge them off though.
