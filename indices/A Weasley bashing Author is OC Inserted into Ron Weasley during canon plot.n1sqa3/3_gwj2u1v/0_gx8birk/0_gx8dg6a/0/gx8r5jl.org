I'm not saying that Fred and George should be put on trial, what I'm saying is that these events shouldn't be dismissed as bashing material since it exemplifies how mean, cruel and sadistic the twins were, which is the point of character bashing- to magnify and exaggerate a character's bad traits. Other example of their mean, cruel and sadistic behavior include shoving Montague into the vanishing cabinet and threatening to sodomize Zacharias Smith, both occurring in Book 5.
