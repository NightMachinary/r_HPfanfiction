There's a bit of justification for the vanishing cabinet, seeing as how book 5 marks the transition from "random bigot" to "enemy combatant" at some point, but I'll give you that one, it's still a bit muddied. The Zacharias smith thing isn't really a good example though, "Shove it up your ass" is a fairly common insult IRL and it hardly ever means anything.

I understand the concept of bashing, I'm not directly opposed to the concept (although I'm not very likely to read a fic that purports it as one of its main features), my point is that you're changing the character more than you think you are by doing so.
