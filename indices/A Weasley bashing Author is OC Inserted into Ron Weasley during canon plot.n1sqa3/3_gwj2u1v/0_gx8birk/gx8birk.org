You're right, the spider incident was an accident, however their attempt to make an Unbreakable Vow wasn't. The twins went out of their way to learn such advanced and dangerous magic and most likely stole the wands needed to make the spell work. Not only did they put in a lot of effort into what they were doing, they also manipulated Ron to go along with it.

They also beat Ron's pet puffskein to death when they wanted to use it as a bludger. This information was included in the /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ book Rowling wrote in 2001. It doesn't mention any ages but I'm guessing the twins were in the single digits. Just because they're children doesn't mean they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions.
