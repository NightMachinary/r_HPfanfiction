I've seen a couple where Hermione cast a powerful version of the /Finite/ at him. Once he got hit by accident and it knocked off several levels of spells and the other she cast at him while he was sleeping on the train and it only took off one (an aversion spell on the Dursleys, IIRC).

I think you could make a case for the Patronus, though. Could be an interesting story.
