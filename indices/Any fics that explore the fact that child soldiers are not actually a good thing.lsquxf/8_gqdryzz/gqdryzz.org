I just read this fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][What We Are Fighting For]], and thought of your post. I think it has a lot of elements of what you want. The ending is a bit abrupt, and doesnt cover much of the aftermath, but I think you might still enjoy it.
