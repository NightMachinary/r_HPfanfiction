I've been getting really into the ‘Of a Linear Circle' series by flamethrower. It's very long and very well-written. It's more in the vein of someone being upset that Dumbledore is setting Harry up to be sacrificed for ‘the greater good' and deciding to do something about it than any sort of post-DH PTSD though.
