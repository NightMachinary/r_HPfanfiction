  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

  “And you knew this? You knew -- all along?”

  “I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.

cf. Dumbledore's look of triumph in GoF, where he realises he now has a way for Harry to survive his own death.
