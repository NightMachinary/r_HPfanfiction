THANK YOU! Even in canon, Harry brushes off Quirrell's face melting under his hands pretty fucking easily for being 11-goddamn-years-old. I doubt that even as an adult I'd be able to get past something like that without quite a bit of therapy, but everyone's like "Way to go, Harry! Now back to your abusive home, see you in September!"

I ring that bell pretty often in my fic, including this very on-the-nose passage -

  The truth was, Sam was beginning to work through his grief. The rage and the utter hatred he felt for Norm and Diane's murderers was as strong as ever, no doubt. But his fear and powerlessness diminished with the increased distance from London, from Great Britain, and that made the actual real-life repercussions of what he and Harry were going to do hard to ignore.

  '/I'm basically crafting and molding Harry into a child soldier,'/ he thought, not for the first time. A despicable thing, that he used to see documentary specials about on the BBC and condemn. '/What would Norm and Diane say if they were here?'/

  "Norm would call me an unfeeling bastard, and Diane would murder me with her bare hands," he said aloud, a rueful smile on his lips. They weren't here, though, they were dead. The way his friends had been killed was unforgivable. But if the only path to vengeance lies in forcing a damaged 13-year old to graduate from 'victim of unfortunate circumstance' to 'intentional mass murderer', perhaps revenge may not be the answer.

Context being that Harry's adoptive parents are murdered after his 2nd year, and their best friend essentially grooms him into being a murder-machine to take revenge; naturally, this has all the predictable consequences you might imagine (in that it fucks Harry up immensely).
