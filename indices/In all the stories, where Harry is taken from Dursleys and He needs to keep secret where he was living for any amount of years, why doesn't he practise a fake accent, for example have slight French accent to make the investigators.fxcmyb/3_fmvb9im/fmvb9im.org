Trying to teach a kid an accent or how to fix one is... really hard.

In school, have you ever had a classmate in "speech" class? It's for fixing horrible accents and speech impediments.

I went to school with this kid, he had the most obscene southern accent. The accent was so... thick it was like he was faking it. But it was legitimate. The poor bastard was in those speech classes from the third grade until highschool. He ended up moving back for highschool.
