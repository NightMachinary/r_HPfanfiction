I feel that, as I've had speech lessons from kindergarten go third grade. It's really about fixing impediments in most cases, since accents aren't normally a problem to do having the similar accents in a region. So imagine how hard it is to try and replicate an accent that's obscure enough to not be localized, but still easily recognized.
