It is most likely because people forget about it when writing a fic.

But realistically speaking it is difficult and I mean extremely difficult to fake an accent so that people believe it. You have to speak in the accent constantly without any slip up.

It is even more difficult to fake an accent and make someone who has an ear for accents for example anyone from the department of International Magical Cooperation or the Supreme Mugwump of ICW.

It would take a LOT of talent and practice to fake it convincingly.
