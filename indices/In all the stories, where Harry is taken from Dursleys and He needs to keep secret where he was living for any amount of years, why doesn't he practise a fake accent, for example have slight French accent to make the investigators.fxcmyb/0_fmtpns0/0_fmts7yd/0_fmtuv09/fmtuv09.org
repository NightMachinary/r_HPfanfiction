That's what a dialog coach is for. :)

But really, they wouldn't need to take him to France to give him a French accent: just have French-accented people take care of him. After all, in most of these he's being picked up as a very young child. Children mimic the accents of those around them.

Besides, if they REALLY wanted to muddy the waters, they'd WANT him to have a mixture of idiocyncracies, to indicate that he was moved around a lot.
