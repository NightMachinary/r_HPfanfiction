I read that fanfic recently where Harry accidentally time-travels himself back to the start, and this time he realises just how silly the whole house point thing is. Can't recall the exact wording, but he points out to someone (Hermione?) that the House cup was worthless apart from one feast and one train ride. Apart from that, what use was the House cup? It's not like it even sat in the Common Room the next year! Come to think of it, neither did the Quidditch Cup! You could at least have them inside the previous winner's Common Rooms, or by the House hourglass.
