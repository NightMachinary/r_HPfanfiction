I think people just need to Overhaul the house system. Gryffindor/Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw, all these houses need to mean something. (Also think the mascots of the houses need to change, Dragon/Basilisk for Slytherin, Griffin/Phoenix for Gryffindor, Fairy for Hufflepuff, Sphinx/Centaur for Ravenclaw.
