  The question that I have is how exactly the hat determines who belongs where.

My headcanon is that the hat places you based on what you value, not what you are. As a part of growing up, many people do become what they look up to (especialyl when surrounded by people with the same mindset).

That's the only way I can explain Neville, Hermione, Draco, etc (without giving the hat some "future potential seeing" power). Also the fact that the hat is supposed to find abstract qualities in 11 year olds.
