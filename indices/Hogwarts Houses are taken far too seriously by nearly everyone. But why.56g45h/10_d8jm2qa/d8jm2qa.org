It's a perspective bias. The books are told from Harry's point of view, who is a student and the houses of Hogwarts are super important to him and his peers.

I always assumed that no-one really cared all that much after school, but I agree that many authors don't seem to realize their insignificance.

One thing though:

  Oh yeah we won the house cup! Take that, evil slytherins who were evil from the moment their eleven year old selves were sorted!

This is also partly JKRs fault, she didn't give many reasons to believe that Slytherin isn't "House Evil". I think the idea of a House for the ambitious and clever is great, but it's a total wasted opportunity in canon: Ambitious and clever people should realize that Civil War and Terrorism might hinder your ambitions (unless they are rape and murder).
