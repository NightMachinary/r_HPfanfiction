But perhaps their ambition was to be part of a revolution?

I always thought of the Slytherins as people who can see themself become great and try to be great through all means.

Joining Voldemort may not have been a good choise but at least they tried, most of the students that part of the brave Griffindors or the smart Ravenclaws are not known, at all, but every known deatheater have a high ranking position in the government, if they were not caught. ...Or a werewolf.

I lost track of what I was supposed to write...

What I am trying to conwey is that the best option for Slytherin was perhaps not to join Dumbledore, cause he is against what they wanted to acomplish in the first place.

The elation of them, the purebloods, in the government.
