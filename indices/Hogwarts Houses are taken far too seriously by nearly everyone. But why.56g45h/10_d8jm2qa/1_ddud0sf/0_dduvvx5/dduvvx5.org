  The elation of them, the purebloods, in the government.

[I assume you meant 'elevation'?]

Which is already status quo: The Purebloods are in total control of the government already. Destabilizing said government to put in a Tyrant isn't at all conducive to ambitious goals. Not to mention that the Terrorism also destabilizes the economy.

There is very little chance to become influential under Voldemort's rule, unless you totally abandon your personal goals (which would also be anti-ambition). A proper Slytherin who seeks power would want to become Minister for Magic and not one of Voldemort's lackeys. A proper Slytherin who wants to get rich would oppose Voldemort. A proper Slytherin who wants to become popular and prominent has absolutely no reason to support Voldemort, because most people don't like Dark Wizards.

It's really dumb for an ambitious person to be a Death Eater and I'm not even getting into the whole issue with possibly dying on a failed Death Eater raid (death is also pretty bad for your ambitions).
