I think they're taken so seriously for two reasons.

One would be how serious they are in the books. In the books, McGonagall describes them as family, and you never see Harry really having any friends outside of Gryffindor.

I think the second reason would be that fanfics started with the houses being serious, and got bigger and bigger due to copiers, reducing the ones where it's not that serious to few and far between.
