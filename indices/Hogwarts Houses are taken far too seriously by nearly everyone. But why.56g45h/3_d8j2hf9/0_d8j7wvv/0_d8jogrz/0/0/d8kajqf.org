Robes are different, not outdated. There was no period of time in the Muggle world where robes were commonly worn except by clergy.

Parchment remains a luxury good in the Muggle world.

Magical Quills that correct your spelling etc are rather more advanced than Muggle pens.

Sending letters by owl seems to be quicker and more direct than sending letters by Muggle post as an owl will find the recipient wherever they are.

In any case your whole idea of "advanced" seems to be strange. Clothes are just fashion. There's no such thing as advanced fashion, it's all just social trends. You seem to be defining "advanced" as "Muggle" which is patently circular.
