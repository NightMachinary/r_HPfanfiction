Don't quote me but a lot of fans see houses as an inherently magical/Hogwarts thing, instead of just the way many boarding schools manage room, board and sometimes class schedules. In reality it's just not that deep.

Personally I think Hogwarts Sorting is a ridiculous idea that's a millennium out of date.
