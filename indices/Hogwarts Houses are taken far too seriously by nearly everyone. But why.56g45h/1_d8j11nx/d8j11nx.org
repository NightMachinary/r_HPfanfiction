I think houses are taken too seriously because of how Slytherin students are portrayed in the books. Hufflepuffs are only thought of as duffers because of two lines said by Draco and Hagrid in PS.

People in general like to categorise things. Putting people into houses (boxes) makes it "easier" to sort out somebody's personality when that is not at all the case seeing as people are made up of all the houses characteristics.

Then there's house loyalty.
