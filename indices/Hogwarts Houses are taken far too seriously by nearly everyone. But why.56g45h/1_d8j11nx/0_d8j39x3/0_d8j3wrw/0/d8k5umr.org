I prefer to think of it that Helga scoffed at the other three, putting defining characteristics on their members. Helga just didn't give a fuck who or what you were, you're ALL welcome in her house. Who cares, Hogwarts is for everyone!

I like Helga. I like to think that she was anti-Sorting, and anti-segregation. I like to think that quote is her thinking, well, Godric's claiming the brave, Rowena the smart, Salazar the (pureblood) ambitious, and if I claim something else, like the empathetic, then there will be students who are averagely intelligent, and content with that, and will never quite belong to a house and will always feel left out and excluded from Hogwarts. So I won't put anything on my house, everyone is welcome at Hogwarts, so everyone is welcome in my house.

The hat even calls her 'Good'.
