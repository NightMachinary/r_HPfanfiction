We had a 'house' system in my school, lots of British schools do, even my nephews who are at 2 different schools both have houses. I was in the green house and that meant we had our lockers outside the classroom on the left one year then inside the classroom on the left in the next (we were 10-12) and that was it.

What happens though is you end up spending a portion of your day with these people and apart from the others and an incredible us vs them mentality builds. We even assigned personality traits to various houses that I'm sure were random, blue house was musical, green was academic, yellow was sporty and red was kind of useless (hufflepuff).

Not that it matters in the end as the only one I'm still friends with was from red house but if I'm ever talking about or bump into anyone from school then I will instantly remember what house they were in and the same goes for the others.

(We had houses again when 14-16 years old as well with separate 'study areas' and that was even more devisive. I ended up drifting apart from a best mate because his designated study area was a 2 minute walk away from mine. There were prank wars and a fair few fights between those houses.)

*TL;DR: Humans are pathetic, create an artificial divide and we will embrace it wholeheartedly.*
