Forget about Fudge. During book 7, Umbridge [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-Born_Registration_Commission][sent]] muggleborns to Azkaban for "stealing magic". It's in the middle of the North Sea, it's completely unheated, the prisoners are given the bare minimum of food and medical care, and to top it all off, the place is guarded by soul-eating monsters that inflict psychological torture on anyone nearby.

Azkaban is basically the wizard equivalent of a concentration camp, and Umbridge helped organize and carry out systemic genocide on behalf of Voldemort.
