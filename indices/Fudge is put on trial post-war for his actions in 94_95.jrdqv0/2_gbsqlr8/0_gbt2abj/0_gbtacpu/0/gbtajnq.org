Could be both tbh. The Nuremberg trials were when many heads of the Nazi regime were tried for war-crimes, Nurmengard is the prison where Grindelwald ended up - and he was basically Wizarding Hitler.

In this context, both would refer to the same thing (if you want to get really technical, Nuremberg refers to the trial, Nurmengard to the punishment), and I am solving this from now on by mentioning both.
