- General corruption charges.
- Enabling Dolores Umbridge to torture children. As the person who appointed her and gave her power in Hogwarts, he's partially responsible for the Blood Quill incidents and attempted use of an Unforgivable on a minor.
- Undue imprisonment as early as CoS, when he sends Hagrid to Azkaban purely because "the Ministry has to be seen doing something".
- Obstruction of due process on at least one count, namely by summarily executing Barty Crouch Junior as opposed to letting him be questioned. Could also count the events at the end of PoA here, though Severus Snape also carries a lot of blame there for giving him an excuse.
- Allowing a Dark Lord to rise unopposed, while /politically persecuting/ a centenarian and a minor.

There's not /quite/ enough to, as the OP said, Nurmengard/Nuremberg him (which isn't saying much - "he's not as bad as Literal (Wizarding) Hitler") - but definitely enough for a trial in the International Criminal Court (or Wizarding equivalent) for crimes against humanity/war crimes.
