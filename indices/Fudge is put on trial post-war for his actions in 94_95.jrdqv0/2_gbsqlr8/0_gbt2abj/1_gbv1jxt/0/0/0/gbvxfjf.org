  I'm pretty sure that's not true; at least I'm fairly certain treason or desertion are still punishable by summary execution without trial, or at least certainly were during ww1 and 2 era, when human rights were atleast something in the public knowledge.

Going to field this last one before I go to sleep, then probably edit in more in the morning. This is what the ICCPR of 1966 has to say about it:

#+begin_example
  Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No man shall be deprived of his life arbitrarily.

  [The death] penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court.
  â€” International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Articles 6.1 and 6.2[1]
#+end_example

Doesn't matter what was or wasn't legal during WW2, this one came after that and would apply. It's also one of those "full stop" articles - no exceptions were recorded.

Morning continuation:

  Didn't he sack her or am I misremembering?
#+end_quote

You're misremembering. She was still holding an office when the Death Eaters completely took over.

  They don't control the newspapers. At all. The News paper is a rag that prints whats popular, and at the time Fudge was popular and Harry was not. Ministry having any influence over the newspaper is fanon. Edit: Didn't they then shit on Fudge and the Ministry around the start of book 6?
#+end_quote

According to Wizarding World (which I know you consider entirely non-canon): "Ostensibly an independent news source, it has more than once been influenced by the Ministry (or ruling power) of the day to hush up certain stories."

  Can't recall if it's fanon or canon that Dumbledore personally made sure he would only get expelled instead of arrested and charged since he knew Hagrid was innocent.
#+end_quote

From my knowledge the books never actually tell the story of what actually happened - but Dumbledore's influence only goes so far. If there was enough there to actually convince people that the Acromantula was what killed Myrtle Warren (and there wouldn't have been - there would not have been any signs of poisoning, nor any wounds that match a spider bite), then Hagrid wouldn't have been allowed to become the Hogwarts gamekeeper.

  Her entire shtick is being a Ministry zealot
#+end_quote

Isn't her "I did what he ordered me to" defense (which, by the way, is also extended-canon - in the books she never has to field any questions about her conduct) a complete 180, then? She's shown as the kind who tries to not let her actions reflect badly on the Ministry, her throwing the Minister under the bus does not fit that.

#+begin_quote
  All we know from Canon is that the Minister of Magic can bring out a Dementor and apparently order execution's without being taken to court for it so...
#+end_quote

This is a series rooted in real-life to some extent, therefore we should be able to apply knowledge from real-life in these cases. Dictators IRL tend to give themselves all sorts of authority - which funnily enough doesn't make the use of those authorities any less of a crime against humanity in international views. The fact that it's carried over from a previous regime just means the Minister is equally guilty as his (dead) predecessor, if he used it.
