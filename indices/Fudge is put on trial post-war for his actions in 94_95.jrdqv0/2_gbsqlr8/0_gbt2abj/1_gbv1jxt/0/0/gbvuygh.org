  The Malfoys are all-but-shown to dole out bribes in Book 4 (which is confirmed in extended canon) - "donations to excellent causes" anyone? Yeah, being chummy with them is a heavy context clue to taking bribes at the very least.
#+end_quote

Nothing in text specifies Fudge got bribed. I don't consider anything outside of books canon (given JKR poop and other such nonsense I'm not sure anyone can blame me), and even if I did unless it was explicitly mentioned that Fudge was bribed it's still not a firm confirmation, let alone enough in-universe proof to argue he was bribed.

  Except the first time wasn't an arrest at all - Hagrid was expelled for the Acromantula during his third year (and hey, if a Jarvey was enough to get Newt Scamander expelled...), it's never mentioned whether the word of Tom Riddle was enough to get him charged with anything outright criminal. The fact that he's not in Azkaban and still working near children at the time of Book 1 is a heavy context clue that it didn't stick.

  Further, Your Honor, Hagrid had ample opportunity to open the Chamber again if he was in fact the perpetrator the first time - which records would show he wasn't convicted of (see also: He's still allowed to work there). Where's the motive for a hypothetical repeat performance, and why wouldn't he have done it again sooner? Say, the year before? There's plenty to throw Hagrid's guilt in doubt, same as there apparently was the first time (I'll say it again, he still works there being your major clue).

Can't recall if it's fanon or canon that Dumbledore personally made sure he would only get expelled instead of arrested and charged since he knew Hagrid was innocent. I'd say him working at Hogwarts is a healthy context clue of Dumbledore more or less being able to run Hogwarts as he pleases without the Ministry's say so until fifth year.

And the whole "well he didn't do it for a long time when he could have earlier" has literally never flown in court as a reason someone didn't do a crime. It's circumstantial evidence at absolutely best against the strong evidence that Hagrid was caught doing it last time this happened, punished, and let go with a slap on the wrist due to his young age.

  And yet Malfoy got a trial. Snape got a trial. A bunch of Death Eaters' trials were shown in Book 4 or mentioned in extended canon - Sirius Black was the only one who didn't get one the first time around.
#+end_quote

Which is why I said proper procedure is completely unclear in canon. Some arbitrarily got trials. Some didn't. My closest guess is towards the absolute finale of the war the public enemy types like Bellatrix and so on got a trial and the quieter ones didn't.

#+begin_quote
  On top of that, somehow I doubt that the head of the DMLE would have approved of summary execution without at least asking the question "How did you escape?", given he escaped from a max-security prison and whatever leak he used should definitely be fixed (both counts) - which takes clear priority over ending the threat of a single person, no matter who or where that person may be at the time.
#+end_quote

You can doubt it all you like, I don't know why in our complete absence of knowledge of magical law you would assume they have that power. All we know from Canon is that the Minister of Magic can bring out a Dementor and apparently order execution's without being taken to court for it so...

#+begin_quote
  Lastly, guess what? Even if it was the previous government's policy, the fact that that policy still stands just means you're guilty of committing the same crime as your predecessor. And yes, even in wartime, throwing someone in max-security prison without a trial is a crime against humanity, no matter how guilty they seem. So is summary execution for any reason, for that matter.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure that's not true; at least I'm fairly certain treason or desertion are still punishable by summary execution without trial, or at least certainly were during ww1 and 2 era, when human rights were atleast something in the public knowledge.

  We have his own word. The word of someone delusional enough to do anything to not have to accept that Voldemort is really back, in a desperate attempt to retain his public image - including pretending that he didn't see certain things or know how much of an evil bitch his undersecretary can be (speaking of which - he worked with her for far longer than shown, and doesn't know exactly what kind of person he's sending to Hogwarts? Pull the other one, it has bells on). He also remains chummy with her during Book 6, which is ample time for all of that to be out of the bag.
#+end_quote

We have the private words of Umbridge that she acted in his interest without his knowing (or is that movie canon/fanon again? Christ it's hard to keep track). Why would he ever see the evil side of Umbridge? Her entire shtick is being a Ministry zealot, he would probably only see her helping him out in every possible way. How do we know how long or closely they worked together anyway, besides the word of Umbridge?

Didn't he sack her or am I misremembering?

  The Ministry controls the Daily Prophet. The same Daily Prophet that, for the entire year, makes Dumbledore and Harry out to be criminally insane and dangerous. That qualifies.
#+end_quote

They don't control the newspapers. At all. The News paper is a rag that prints whats popular, and at the time Fudge was popular and Harry was not. Ministry having any influence over the newspaper is fanon. Edit: Didn't they then shit on Fudge and the Ministry around the start of book 6?

#+begin_quote
  because, as much as you rail on people for "the readers know this, the public doesn't", you're guilty of that too - a lot of those defenses aren't public knowledge either), there should be a trial.
#+end_quote

I'm speaking simultaneously out of universe to you that Fudge didn't do anything wrong beyond being something of a cunt and a bad politician (ya know, bad shit but not really take em to trial kind of evil), and also saying in universe that if this theoretical trial did happen nothing would come of it.
