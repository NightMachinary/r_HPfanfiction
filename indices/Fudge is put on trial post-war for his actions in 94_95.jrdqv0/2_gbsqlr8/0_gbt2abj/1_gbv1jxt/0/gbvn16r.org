  Do we have any text that supports this besides fanon? He was friendly ish with the malfoys, hardly evidence of outright bribery and corruption.
#+end_quote

The Malfoys are all-but-shown to dole out bribes in Book 4 (which is confirmed in extended canon) - "donations to excellent causes" anyone? Yeah, being chummy with them is a heavy context clue to taking bribes at the very least.

  Not to mention, arresting the previous (considered anyway) guilty suspect of a crime that appears to be repeating the exact same shtick basically 100% makes arresting Hagrid the obvious right decision.
#+end_quote

Except the first time wasn't an arrest at all - Hagrid was expelled for the Acromantula during his third year (and hey, if a Jarvey was enough to get Newt Scamander expelled...), it's never mentioned whether the word of Tom Riddle was enough to get him charged with anything outright criminal. The fact that he's /not in Azkaban/ and /still working near children/ at the time of Book 1 is a heavy context clue that it didn't stick.

Further, Your Honor, Hagrid had /ample/ opportunity to open the Chamber again if he was in fact the perpetrator the first time - which records would show he wasn't convicted of (see also: He's still allowed to work there). Where's the motive for a hypothetical repeat performance, and why wouldn't he have done it again sooner? Say, the year before? There's /plenty/ to throw Hagrid's guilt in doubt, same as there apparently was the first time (I'll say it again, /he still works there/ being your major clue).

  Kind of unclear whether its obstruction of justice seeing as how Sirius was sent to Azkaban without trial or questioning, seems to be just the general policy to sentence Death Eaters to death/Azkaban without much legal proceedings. Blame the Ministry in general, not Fudge in particular.
#+end_quote

And yet Malfoy got a trial. Snape got a trial. A /bunch/ of Death Eaters' trials were shown in Book 4 or mentioned in extended canon - Sirius Black was the only one who didn't get one the first time around.

On top of that, somehow I doubt that the head of the DMLE would have approved of summary execution without at least asking the question "How did you escape?", given he escaped from a max-security prison and whatever leak he used should definitely be fixed (both counts) - which takes clear priority over ending the threat of a single person, no matter who or where that person may be at the time.

Lastly, guess what? Even if it /was/ the previous government's policy, the fact that that policy still stands just means you're guilty of committing the same crime as your predecessor. And yes, even in wartime, throwing someone in max-security prison without a trial is a crime against humanity, no matter how guilty they seem. So is summary execution for /any/ reason, for that matter.

  We have strong context clues that Fudge knew nothing about Umbridges actions, not the dementors not the quill and certainly not about the unforgiveable
#+end_quote

We have his own word. The word of someone delusional enough to do /anything/ to not have to accept that Voldemort is really back, in a desperate attempt to retain his public image - including pretending that he didn't see certain things or know how much of an evil bitch /his undersecretary/ can be (speaking of which - he worked with her for far longer than shown, and /doesn't/ know exactly what kind of person he's sending to Hogwarts? Pull the other one, it has bells on). He also remains chummy with her during Book 6, which is ample time for all of that to be out of the bag.

  The most Fudge did was call them insane attention seekers, then try to judge them extra harshly during their trial. The second is political persecution, agreed, but it also won't hold up in literally any court. Harry had a second violation of magic around muggles, was clearly warned, being harsh could be justified even if we as the readers know that he's not doing it just for justices sake. How did he persecute Dumbledore besides calling him names? Politicians are allowed to do that.
#+end_quote

A single half-sentence from Wikipedia: "Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership".

The Ministry controls the Daily Prophet. The same Daily Prophet that, for the entire year, makes Dumbledore and Harry out to be criminally insane and dangerous. That qualifies.

PS. In most court cases, including this kind, the amount of charges is often /far/ more than what anyone could hope to have stick. If there's even due cause to /try/ him for stuff, and there is (because, as much as you rail on people for "the readers know this, the public doesn't", you're guilty of that too - a lot of those defenses aren't public knowledge either), there should be a trial.
