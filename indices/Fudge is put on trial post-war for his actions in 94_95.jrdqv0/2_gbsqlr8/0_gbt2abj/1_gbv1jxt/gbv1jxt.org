  General corruption charges.
#+end_quote

Do we have any text that supports this besides fanon? He was friendly ish with the malfoys, hardly evidence of outright bribery and corruption.

  Enabling Dolores Umbridge to torture children. As the person who appointed her and gave her power in Hogwarts, he's partially responsible for the Blood Quill incidents and attempted use of an Unforgivable on a minor.
#+end_quote

In the absolute smallest sense of the word responsibility, yes. We have strong context clues that Fudge knew nothing about Umbridges actions, not the dementors not the quill and certainly not about the unforgiveable. His "responsibility" would end the second he said "oh no now that I know all that fuck that bitch".

#+begin_quote
  Undue imprisonment as early as CoS, when he sends Hagrid to Azkaban purely because "the Ministry has to be seen doing something".
#+end_quote

Wasn't that the board of governors who control hogwarts demanding it from him? Not to mention, arresting the previous (considered anyway) guilty suspect of a crime that appears to be repeating the exact same shtick basically 100% makes arresting Hagrid the obvious right decision. We as readers (as well as Harry and Dumbledore) know fudge is wrong. Anyone with two braincells in their head in universe would agree with fudge.

#+begin_quote
  Obstruction of due process on at least one count, namely by summarily executing Barty Crouch Junior as opposed to letting him be questioned. Could also count the events at the end of PoA here, though Severus Snape also carries a lot of blame there for giving him an excuse.
#+end_quote

Kind of unclear whether its obstruction of justice seeing as how Sirius was sent to Azkaban without trial or questioning, seems to be just the general policy to sentence Death Eaters to death/Azkaban without much legal proceedings. Blame the Ministry in general, not Fudge in particular.

#+begin_quote
  Allowing a Dark Lord to rise unopposed, while politically persecuting a centenarian and a minor.
#+end_quote

The most Fudge did was call them insane attention seekers, then try to judge them extra harshly during their trial. The second is political persecution, agreed, but it also won't hold up in literally any court. Harry had a second violation of magic around muggles, was clearly warned, being harsh could be justified even if we as the readers know that he's not doing it just for justices sake. How did he persecute Dumbledore besides calling him names? Politicians are allowed to do that.

  Allowing a Dark Lord to rise unopposed
#+end_quote

He didn't know. Thats the being a cunt part.

#+begin_quote
  but definitely enough for a trial in the International Criminal Court (or Wizarding equivalent) for crimes against humanity/war crimes.
#+end_quote

It absolutely isn't. I don't like Fudge, neither as a character nor as a reader reading about said character. But like, war crimes? seriously? Maybe one charge of political persecution would stick. Fucking International Criminal Court? Are you drunk?

Said it much better than I could.
