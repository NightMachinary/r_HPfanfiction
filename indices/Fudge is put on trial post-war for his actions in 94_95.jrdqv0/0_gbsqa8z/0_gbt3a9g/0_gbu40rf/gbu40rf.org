- *CoS:* Sending someone to Azkaban without charge or trial
- *PoA:* Unleashing Dementors on a school full of children; Keeping them there even after they repeatedly attack at least one child; Refusing to investigate allegations of a man's innocence before trying to have him summarily executed
- *GoF:* Preventing any investigation of the abduction of two teenagers (and the murder of one and wounding/torture of the other) or the alleged return of a mass-murderer
