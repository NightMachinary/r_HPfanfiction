True. OotP is the Big One where everything comes to a head, but for every book where he's shown as being in power he's also shown as doing something that'd probably warrant a hearing - obstruction of due justice, undue imprisonment...

General corruption charges are also likely to stick - taking bribes and such. There's plenty of references to Lucius Malfoy bribing people left and right, Fudge probably took a few bribes from him.

I suspect the only reason he's not shown doing anything prosecutable in HBP is he's on his way out and no amount of corrupt dealings would keep him in power anymore.
