  No formal allegations were raised to the ministry by any students or teachers of the use of a blood quill.
#+end_quote

Given that the Ministry appointed her in the first place, it can be deemed /extremely/ likely that any such allegations would have been summarily thrown out and any supporters included in the smear-campaign and persecution via the Daily Prophet, which is an infamously Ministry-influenced news outlet.

  a credible allegation was made and sustained against Rubeus Hagrid by Hogwarts in 1942
#+end_quote

Nope. He was expelled for harboring an Acromantula, the charges surrounding the opening of the Chamber of Secrets didn't stick. See also, he's still allowed on Hogwarts grounds - even Albus Dumbledore could not have protected him from being barred from Hogwarts grounds (at a minimum) if it was proven that his Acromantula caused the death of Myrtle Warren.

  Fourthly, the Crouch affair. A confessed death eater who has escaped the law on many occasions, murdered multiple people, and able to mislead and manipulate multiple people including Dumbledore, with access to polyjuice potion, was being held in a building full of foreign dignitaries and children. The Minister for magic is given powers to act to protect the security of Britain in such a situation, and the minister acted legally, proportionately and swiftly.
#+end_quote

Summary execution is a crime against humanity in international court, /full stop/. He did not act "legally" - there is no built-in justification, no possible policy that somehow legalizes it. There can be no such authority given.

  Based on that information, and the failure of Hogwarts to maintain security in the previous year, that the minister authorised the use of Dementors, an act ratified by the Wizengamot. Once the individual was captured, the use of the dementors kiss was entirely lawful.
#+end_quote

Nope. Sorry, still not a justification for summary execution - again, /there straight up isn't one/. Hasn't been since 1977. Further, indictment without a trial is another crime - and just because the previous government /started/ it, the fact that Fudge's government did not rectify the lack of trial and instead jumped straight to "recapture and summarily execute" on his orders just makes it /worse/.

  The only evidence for whose return was given, was an eyewitness account by an underage child who we now know contained part of Voldemort's soul within his body, and who Voldemort himself could possess.
#+end_quote

This is not public knowledge, and I'd just /love/ to know how they'd have gotten that one (EDIT: especially before said possession ever happened). Furthermore, said underage child disappeared under unknown circumstances, alongside a fellow student he was known to be on somewhat familiar and not-unfriendly terms with, upon jointly grabbing the Triwizard Cup - only to return half-an-hour later, visibly grieving the heavy loss of that student, and making his claim. There was no cause there to claim any sort of delusion or accident at that time, thus Harry Potter's claim should have warranted investigation at the very least.

Especially in combination with the other events of that school-year - the summer before, the Dark Mark was conjured at the Quidditch World Cup. All /through/ that school year, a Polyjuiced Death Eater had heavy involvement in the Tournament happening at Hogwarts, disguised as the Defense teacher.\\
Given such an increase in Death Eater activity, the apparent return of Lord Voldemort (oh shut up, he's gone for good this time) fits the pattern enough to warrant taking the claim seriously.
