Won't regret it. Don't buy all the 'the 1st year is terrible;' its just closer to canon than the 2nd and 3rd year. Its got /everything/:

- Superpowered house-elves
- Terrifying werewolves
- Mentor lockhart
- Toymaking Death Eaters
- Bubonic Plague carrying Pettigrew
- Giant chaos snakes

Etcetera, etcetera...
