'Typical' had some negative connotations associated with the WBWL genre as a whole when this story was still being updated, which is why writers wanted to distance themselves from it as much as possible. It's a quality work.

That being said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is probably as typical as it gets. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's one of the fics that started popularizing the genre, iirc.
