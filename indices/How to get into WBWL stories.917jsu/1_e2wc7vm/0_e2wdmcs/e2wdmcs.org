In DPSW it hasn't been explained why the Potters abandoned Harry explicity. It's alluded that its been sold to the Potters by Dumbles as some form of master plan. The explanation for why Dumbles acts this way towards Harry is not actually that unbelievable as I dont want to provide spoilers but it does explain some of his actions and his ideas. However its unlikely the potters have an explanation as you said that will truly make sense or whatever.
