I'm new, but, wouldn't WBWL also imply a story in which there is no BWL because there was no Killing Curse directed at them to begin with?

EDIT: I just assumed What-Boy-Who-Lived and not Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived(EWE?), so my mistake, I guess. The genre needs a similaracronym to identify those types of stories, no?

Damn, I'm stupid, someone show me the light.
