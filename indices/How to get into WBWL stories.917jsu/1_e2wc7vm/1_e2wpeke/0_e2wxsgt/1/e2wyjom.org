Ok fair points but I think there is still a reasonable explanation for why not to visit: the risk of compromising the greatest protection Harry has: anonymity we know there are ways to detect magic and magical people and the last thing James or Lily wanted to do was lead a death eater to Harry. For example after Harry's first year he gets magically attacked at his home likely because his coming and going was being tracked.

And as for why not to run both James and Lily are fighters (and Jim is a national icon) and they are not about to abandon their home to their enemies without a fight. Could they have run: yes. Would it be logical: yes. Would it be the Gryffindor thing to do: no. Furthermore, James has a familial legacy tied to Britain that he would not give up.
