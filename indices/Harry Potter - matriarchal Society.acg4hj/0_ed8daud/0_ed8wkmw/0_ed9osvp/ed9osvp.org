It actually speaks a lot about what I find is wrong in the Firebird Trilogy. It doesn't immerse the reader. Harry Potter is a great series because it is easy to find characters to emphasise with. Robst allows for you to find joy in the easy victories of the characters. His style is weak and would never work as actual novels but as fanfiction, they are well-written guilty pleasure fics.

Firebird offers---at least for me---no branch to hols onto. Characters are difficult to emphasise with, the world, while is immensely creative, lacks any connection to my world. I mean I started the story but by midpoint, I was extremely put off by the neutered Dumbledore and the extreme opposite of the world we live in with no fixes to the situation.

In HP, Voldemort is a foe that seems undefeatable but even then, J.K manages to leave a tiny possibility of victory that has you believing.
