Exactly! I also think that, as fandom progresses, you have authors that are trully fanfiction authors- as in they simply wish to fullfill their own desires in relation to their favorite characters- and A.U writters, who basically just use an established book as a starting point. In this case, the end result has, more often than not, characters that share only a name with their originals and, or, even worse IMO, they are filled with a myriad of OC´s, which also does not help with being immersed in the story. ( my personal rule is that, before you add an OC, you should use an underdeveloped estalished supporting character; the audience already know that name in relation to the story, and creating a back story to someone who has just a couple of line in the original work is better than coming up with someone.)

I mean I LOVE a manipulative, evil Dumbledore and I think there is an open case of interpretation for his actions and innactions during the series; it is a twist in a character that was meant as a grandfather figure and it has some baring in canon, therefore I can accept such change in perspective easily, especially if well written and explained in the plot. Now, in Firebird , Dumbledore is just a cardboard supporting character that I was never able to identifiy as Dumbledore during his appearances- at least in book one- ; the rest of the characters inhabiting that world are simply- even Harry-...NOT appealing to me.

At the heart of the matter, Robst treats his characters with warmth and care; he REALLY wants Harry and Hermione to suceed and makes no bones about it. His writing might be not that great, but his fiction is filled with great moments and even Harry Crow, there is no filling chapter. Firebird? It is like the author does not see his characters as human beings- he just needs they to act in the way they do because we are supposed to believe that is what they would do in that society. and, what really annoyed me is that, in order to give us a plot twist, the author betrays his own idea a couple of times- come on, in a society where men are few, have multiple wives and get married off early on, especially in rich families, are we supposed to believe that Sirius Black went nuts because Lily Evans did not have sex with him?
