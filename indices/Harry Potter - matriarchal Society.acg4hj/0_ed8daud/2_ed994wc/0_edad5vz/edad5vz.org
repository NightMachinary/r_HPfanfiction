It's rather simple, really. It conjures up a world in which everything I believe is mutilated into almost non-existence. The characters are following rather stupid strings of thoughts in their reasonings, playing after the rules of their adversaries instead of using any means necessary to create a status quo they would want to live in. There is so much complaining in the story, how awful and unjust all this is, and yet, despite all the cries of despair, these protagonists accomplish nothing that would lessen the burden they supposedly have been given.

Then there is also the fact that I abhor soulbondery and underage sex and very generally speaking, the undermining of free will and its consequences. Firebird Trilogy offers a world of unfree will, but to explain that would take too much time just now and I am hungry. Toodles.
