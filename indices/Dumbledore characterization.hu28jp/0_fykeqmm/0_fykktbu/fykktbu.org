Are you saying my mistake was to say that Dumbledore believed in the prophecy or other authors'? I'm wondering why people portray him as evil. I know all his traits from canon. Dumbledore doesn't even need to have all the information. He can and has made mistakes. I want to know why the fanfics I've come across are content to cast him as a major antagonist up there with Voldemort when he's the equivalent of a boarding school principal with more on his plate than he should technically have and fucking up a lot as a result. He's not actively malicious but a lot of fics paint him with that brush..
