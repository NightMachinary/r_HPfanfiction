There is no point in only condemning him, nor in utterly excusing him.

So as for the first, it's entirely out-of-character for him to e.g. /force/ Harry to return to the Dursleys (instead, if Harry really didn't want to go -- a point which he never raises with Dumbledore, by the way --, he'd try to use incentives to convince him), but on the other hand, he /did/ dump baby Harry in a basket on the doorstep (that thing was old when Moses was young).

And like that, it's with most other issues. The /reason/ you see this often is actually why Dumbledore is a very well-written character; namely, the outcome of judging his actions is a matter of perspective, and many of the authors in question are of the age when Harry explodes in the office in OotP, and their FF is the equivalent of his rage -- a story about a male teen, by a male teen, using the perspective of a male teen.

So it's, in a certain way, very authentic, but of course Dumbledore as a character suffers for it, because the way he works isn't captured by /only/ that perspective.
