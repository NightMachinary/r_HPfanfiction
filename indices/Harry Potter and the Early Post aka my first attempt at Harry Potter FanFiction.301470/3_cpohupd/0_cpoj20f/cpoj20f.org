Thank you. Originally, as in yesterday, I wasn't planning on straying too too far from cannon but I realized, like 2 hours ago, that this kind of constrains me. But the base plot will mostly be canon, as in philosopher stone in first year, basilisk in second yadda yadda. They wont be discovering Pettigrew in the first year!
