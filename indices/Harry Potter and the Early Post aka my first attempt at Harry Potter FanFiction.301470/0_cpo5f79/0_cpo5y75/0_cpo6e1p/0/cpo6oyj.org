heres what i've got.

The evil and mainpulative dumbledore has been done and done and done to death and i dont believe i have the skill to do it effectively. I want him, like in the books, to be manipulative but not unmovable.

Also I'm going for a more sympathetic dursley family. like don't mess with us i wont mess with you.

The only inheritance I plan on is the potter vault.

I'm not into bashing. I'm going for a realistic feel to how i believe characters would act.

On relationships, I'm still going to have the golden trio but Hermione will be in ron's place as the best mate as I want her to meet harry first. ron will be more of a third wheel but still useful in certain circumstances.

One thing I'm debating on is whether or not Harryshould be in Gryffindor or ravenclaw
