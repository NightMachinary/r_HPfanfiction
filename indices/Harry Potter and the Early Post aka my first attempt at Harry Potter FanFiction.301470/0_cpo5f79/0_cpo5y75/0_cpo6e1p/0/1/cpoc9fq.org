I do like fics with Harry in other houses and actually prefer it for the degree of separation it offers from canon. Just keep in mind that you will have to limit interaction more to Gryffindor characters like Ron and will need to establish personalities for students in Ravenclaw unless you plan on turning Harry and Hermione into hermits.
