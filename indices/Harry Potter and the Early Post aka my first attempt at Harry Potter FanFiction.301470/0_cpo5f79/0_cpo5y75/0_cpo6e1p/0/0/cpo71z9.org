None of that has to do with actual plot though. What celestial events are going to come to pass over your characters? Are you going to stick to canon? Are you going to have the trio figure out things faster? Slower? Are there going to be new situations or villains?

The only way Harry would be in Ravenclaw is if Hermione is, and even then it's a stretch. There's no way Ron can be anything other than a Gryffindor, which means that if one or two of the others are Ravens, then there's no Trio.

Also I'm totally confused by what you're saying for the Dursleys. They abused Harry, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. So you're having them do what?
