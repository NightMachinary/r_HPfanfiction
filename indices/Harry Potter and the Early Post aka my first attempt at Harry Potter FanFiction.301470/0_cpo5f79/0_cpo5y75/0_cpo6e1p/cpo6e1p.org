It depends on what story you're trying to tell. Is this going to be a good Dumbledore or bad Dumbledore? Is Harry going to be fiercely independent from the Hogwarts crowd or incredibly grateful that they rescued him? Is Harry going to have to go back there every year anyway or are the Dursleys going to be prosecuted for child abuse? Is the Ministry going to get involved and if so, are they going to help Harry or try to use him? Are the goblins going to be involved? Is Harry going to have some inheritance?

It goes on and on really. The fact that you don't even know what to avoid tells me you don't know where it's going and you're going to wind up rehashing the same clichés that have already been done.

You really should come up with a plot before you even start writing, especially since you're starting with a cliché off the bat. You'll never get any interest unless you show how it will be better, or at the very least different, than the rest within the first two chapters. It's even worse because the first chapter is 100% "Here's the cliché jump off point" rather than having even the smallest hint of where it will go.

Now I'm not saying you should just dump it and stop writing, because just putting the words down will help you get to the point where you're writing really original stuff. Plus, even though it's not original, it is well written mechanically speaking. The flow was good and there were very little or no grammar or spelling issues that I noticed. Poor mechanics will bleed readers faster than bad plot, so you've already passed one hurdle.

I'm just saying I think you should take some time to come up with a plot, then maybe ask around for stories that fit that sort of plot so you know what not to do.
