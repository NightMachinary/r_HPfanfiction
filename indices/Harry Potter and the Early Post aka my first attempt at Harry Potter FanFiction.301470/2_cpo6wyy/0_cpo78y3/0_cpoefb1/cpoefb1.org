  I believe Dumbledore sent Hagrid because, whether he knew better or not, most believed Harry would surely know about the mgical world and probably only needed a friendly face.

Nah, it was a security measure. After the original deluge of letters failed to produce a response, and the address changed to a "hut in the middle of a lake" (or whatever that was), Dumbledore grew worried that Harry and the Dursleys have been abducted by Muggles.

So, he sent the minion whose skin could deflect small-arms fire, and who could wreak havoc without casting any spells, so there's a smaller chance of SoS being violated.

That's my headcanon, and I'm sticking to it!
