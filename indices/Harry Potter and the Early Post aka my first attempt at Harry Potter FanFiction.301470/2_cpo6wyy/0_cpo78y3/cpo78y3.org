Well the letter shows that Harry knows next to nothing about magic. I'm assuming they don't normally send the half-giant gameskeeper that isn't allowed to do magic to go get students that need to be shown and have questions answered.

Hagrid getting expelled, in my book at least, makes him a less than credible source.

I believe Dumbledore sent Hagrid because, whether he knew better or not, most believed Harry would surely know about the mgical world and probably only needed a friendly face.

But in my story they have, in writing, proof that Harry doesn't know anything so surely they'll send someone more qualified. Originally I wanted to send Flitwick but then I remembered what he looked like and how that would be counter intuitive.

I am now considering either Snape or McGonagall. Probably Snape as he has previous experience with Harry's aunt. But perhaps sending the deputy headmistress makes more sense.
