I suppose thats cultural thing. I`ve seen an idea somewhere: wizard world has "cult of power" or smth like that. "There is Chosen One, and he is the only one who can do anything against Grand Villain, and all others are just pawns, dust and rubbish".

So trying to make them see is, uh, not a good idea. You are basically saying "your culture is shit". Try to enter church and do an equivalent speech there. Even if you are logical and right, you will not be recieved well.
