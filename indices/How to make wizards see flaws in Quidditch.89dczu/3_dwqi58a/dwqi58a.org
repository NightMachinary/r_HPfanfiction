The pitch is 200 yards at most, booms can go 150 mph and they don't get tired. Chasers ought to be able to score at least once a minute, even accounting for the Keeper (50% blocks) and the opposite team (giving you 15 seconds per attack).

The seeker is a tie-breaker, he will win the game if the chasers are about equal. If the skill disparity is too large, he can do nothing (like Krum at the World cup). If one Chaser squad is better than the other, they will quickly drive up the score so that around 30 minutes in, the score difference will exceed 150 points.
