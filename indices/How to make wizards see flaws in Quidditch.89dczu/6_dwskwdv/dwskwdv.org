You can't. :) I hate Quidditch -- mostly because I find it boring as fuck. But even in the real world sports fans are not going to be swayed by something like "logic." There's no way a sport that has been popular with wizards for centuries is ever going to be changed by arguments such as that.

If you try to take a wizard and explain the flaws in Quidditch, he'll just insist you're missing the point.
