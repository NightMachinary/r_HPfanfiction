The Wizarding World is in love with the sport, so doing so is going to be nigh impossible. Have you ever tried to talk to someone about how their preferred sport is bad? Won't work.

Even if they acknowledge its flaws, they won't care, they enjoy it the way it is.

But.. well.. Hmm. I remember in linkffn(5782108), someone [[/spoiler][basically steals the snitch to try to show how stupid it is. The game is unending. It continues for hours on hours on hours, the chasers scoring endlessly and pointlessly, but I don't think we saw what came of it.]].

It could be possible that the snitch /can't/ be caught so quickly - or at least that it would be basically a miracle to do so.

The snitch may be precisely magicked so that it's just too fast or whatnot that early in the game. Maybe the snitch gets slower/more predictable as the game continues.
