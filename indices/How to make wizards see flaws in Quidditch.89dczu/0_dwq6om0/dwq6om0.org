We have very little evidence of what Pro level matches are like in canon. The one pro match we see the chasers are the ones that win the match. I still think the impact of being hit by iron wrapped in leather mean pro level beaters might be hugely influential. Sure at Hogwarts its seeker centric but Ron talks about a match that lasted a week. If in a week they couldn't create a 15 goal lead then neither team deserved to win.
