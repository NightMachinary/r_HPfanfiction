I remember one fic where the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw teams made a deal to rack up the points and lock slitherin out of the cup. The beaters played catch with the bludgers while the chasers scored points over and over uncontested. I think Harry was giving seeker types to the other seeker. This was a setting where the cup was determined mostly by total overall score. I think each team ended with a couple thousand.
