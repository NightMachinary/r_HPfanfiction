I completely agree which is why I only said his kid stuff diminishes some of it. Getting Buckbeak killed because it shows off how powerful his dad is and how he got one over on his half-breed teacher I can see if he's a kid. Trying to kill Harry in the RoR when he's after the diadem is a serious dick move.
