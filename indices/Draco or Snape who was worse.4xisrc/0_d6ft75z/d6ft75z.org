Snape was worse. He made Harry suffer through school, tried to kill Lupin and Black by dementor's kiss, slagged off Neville and Granger, and was generally shit. Not forgetting how he screwed Harry with occlumency training but had a hissy fit when Harry saw his memories. He was an adult and theoretically one of the good guys, should have known better.

Draco was a twat and deserved to die a slow horrible death but he was raised to be a twat and he genuinely believed he was doing the right thing. And he was a kid for some of it which diminishes his responsibility. (Did he torture Dobby? I can't recall.)
