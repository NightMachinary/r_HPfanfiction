SNAPE - no questions asked!

Snape should have been an adult and should have let go of his childish grudge years ago, the fact that he literally tortured Harry (those Occlumency-Lessons! Not to mention all the other awful things, like wanting to get Sirius caught or showing Harry that his dad was a bully (what an awful thing to do to an orphan IMHO - it would have hurt nobody if Harry continued to think that his dad was the paragon of virtue that he believed him to be!) etc. etc.) tells us what an awful human being he is. Despicable really!

Draco is an asshole, sure, but he's also a teenager and has been indoctrinated by his parents (and their friends and the children of their friends) from the day he was born! Sure he should have questioned it, but then again: So few religious people question faith if they've been indoctrinated as chidlren (that's why I am against this exact thing - I don't know how to stop it, but I am against filling young minds with religious drivel...let them decide if they want to believe, don't force it on them when they are too young to defend themselves...in a way that's mental-rape/brainwashing!), so maybe that's to be expected...still he should face punishment for his crimes and not get off scott free!
