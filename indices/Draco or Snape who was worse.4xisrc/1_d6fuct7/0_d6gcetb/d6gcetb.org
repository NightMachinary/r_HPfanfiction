Draco did do these things but he did them under the threat of torture or death if he failed to perform the task he was assigned by Voldemort. He never had a choice to be a Death Eater or not. Snape made that choice, and killed people willingly until the person he loved became the next target of his Master.

He spied on Dumbledore and immediately ran to Voldemort to tell him what he heard, regardless of the consequences for the people involved in the prophecy. He even tells Dumbledore that he has tried to ask Voldemort to spare Lily's life in exchange for her son's. If that's not despicable, I don't know what is.

He was also a bully who seemed to enjoy terrorizing his students, not to mention the way he treated Harry in particular, just because of his name and resemblance to his father.

And when he did all that, he was an adult, contrary to Draco in the books.
