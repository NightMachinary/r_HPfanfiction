Agreed. Snape is a terrible bitter person, who I'd sure as shit never send a christmas card to. But the things that made you truly hate him were ultimately done for a good purpose which makes them somewhat grayer.

Draco on the other hand, what was his most redeeming feature? Not being a complete coward once in his life? Not because of any implied change of character, but because he didn't have the guts to stand by his beliefs. He's a pathetic bully no more, no less.
