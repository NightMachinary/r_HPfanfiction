What do you mean, objectively? By what objective criteria? By what measure of "worse"?

Since you didn't specify, for me it's Draco. Snape is an awful person, but he's a, well, brave sort of awful person, the sort of awful person that doesn't back down from their awfulness. Draco is a coward, and for all he's praised (or excused, whatever) for not being able to kill Dumbledore point blank, he's a coward that nearly killed Katie Bell, he's a coward that nearly killed Ron, he's a coward that led Death Eaters right into the heart of Hogwarts, putting other children at risk because he was too squeamish to do the nasty himself. Seriously what the fuck was that.
