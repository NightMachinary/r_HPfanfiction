All just my opinion but...

1) Yes, while Harry is as lazy as Ron, he still comes across as being the smarter of the two. Ron, though of course not stupid, is the slowest of the trio nearly always.

2) Harry does find Hermione annoying (and yes, she is VERY studious unlike him...lol) but at the same time, they rarely argue or fight and get along for the most part, far better than Ron and Hermione who are constantly snipping at each other and get into serious fights far more often than Harry/Hermione or Ron/Harry do.

3) Hermione is very patronizing, this is one of her worst traits and rather aggravating to boot. Again though, this doesn't seem to get under Harry's skin that often as it does with Ron; Harry just accepts it as part of Hermione's personality and moves on without it letting it get to him the way it does Ron. Again, Harry and Hermione get along far more calmly and with far, far less annoyances.

4)

  Hermione needs a challenge

And she gets that with Harry, considering what he has to do and his..."fate". She gets it helping him out through the years, solving mysteries, helping him on his quest (she's the most loyal one of his friends)...intellectually she doesn't get a challenge (she doesn't get that from anyone unless you want to fan ship her with Snape or something...) but she gets a lot of adventure and physical/mental challenges just by being Harry's friend.
