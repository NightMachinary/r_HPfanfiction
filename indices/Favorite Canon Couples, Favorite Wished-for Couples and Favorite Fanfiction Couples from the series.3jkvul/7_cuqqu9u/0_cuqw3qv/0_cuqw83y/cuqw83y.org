A lot of it comes from shitty writers (#/cough/ Robst #/cough/) writing Harry/Hermione, and then using Bashing of Ron as a good reasoning for the Harmony. A lot of readers then included bashing in their own fics, simply because they couldn't think of a reasoning for Harmony to happen, and the chain of hating Ron (and R/Hr) keeps going.

Personally, I prefer Harmony of R/Hr, but that's because I think of the way the books were going for the first 5.

TL;DR: Shitty tropes and cliches made the ship seem unlikely, and having Harmony basically meant Bashing in your fic.
