I think Arthur/Molly or Lily/James are my favourite canon pairings. Mostly because all the others rubbed me the wrong way. Although I really liked Harry/Ginny as 6 and 7 were released, time and fanfiction have soured me on those two in canon - even though I just read a awesome HG fanfiction.

I kind of wanted Harry/Luna to happen. I though Luna was fantastic in OotP and was one of the best characters.

Fanon pairings, I'll read Harry/Any-Female-Character, no exceptions. My favourites are Harry/Fleur Hermione Luna or [female slytherin in Harry's year]. But I really like to search for odd pairings like Harry/Lavender.
