  Ron/Werewolf Lavender
#+end_quote

A girl who has the beast within. Could work. Canon Lavender gets described as a girly, giggly girl in canon. You could have the werewolf traits affect her and have her become a lot more savage (I'm thinking [[http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Aela_the_Huntress][Aela the Huntress]]) because of the werewolf bite. She has a hard time accepting this new her at first, but over time she learns to live with it. This puts her at odds with her old friends who still see her as a very giggly woman.

Could be a fun story about coming to terms with yourself!
