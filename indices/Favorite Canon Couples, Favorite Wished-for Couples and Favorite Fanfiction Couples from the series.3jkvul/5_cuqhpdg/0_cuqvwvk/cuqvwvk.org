I could see Hermione with Obi-wan Kenobi from Star Wars prequels. After all, he IS played by a very charming, very intelligent and a gentlemanly Ewan McGregor! After all, I already ship Padme with Obi-wan...and Padme /is/ highly intelligent, works in the government, a bit patronizing/bossy and she has brown hair and eyes.

Omg...I might ship Hermione/Obi-wan as a crossover pair...o.O
