Canon:\\
Arthur/Molly - they have a nice balance of loud and quiet, whimsical and responsible, and there is respect: when Molly is trying to keep the twins out of the Order, Arthur stops her and says that they've earned the right to make their own choices.

Wished-For:\\
I think the epilogue would have been better if all three of them ended up with different partners: Harry/Gabrielle or Harry/Luna; Ron/Werewolf Lavender; Hermione/[muggle funnyguy: a scientisty Ewan McGregor]. Their friendship remains equal and the people they chose to marry complement them and add to their lives. Also Ginny/Krum deserves a chance.

Fanfiction:\\
I look for Harry/Tonks but rare is the story that shows Harry being good for Tonks in the ways she could be good for him.

Crack pairing:\\
Never seen it but could be awesome if done with respect- Luna/Hagrid
