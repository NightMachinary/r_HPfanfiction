One is a hardworking genius surrounded by average people, the other is a jealous oaf who can't stand other people getting attention (yet refuses to work to achieve anything himself). I don't see how that equals to 'bitchiness' on a same level.

The only way I can see them come together is purely on hormones, followed with her then being too stubborn to admit she made a mistake and him not wanting to let his trophy woman go.

Then again, with him constantly tearing down her self worth for the entire duration of their boarding school experience, she might be too damaged to realize she's in a bad relationship and deserves someone better (being in a relationship with someone far less intelligent is VERY frustrating, even without Ron's personality being incompatible with hers in multiple ways).
