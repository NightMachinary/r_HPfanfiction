Thanks for the ad hominem, I'll tell my therapist [[/u/Almavet]] thinks I have serious issues, I'm sure that will help me greatly!

As for your point, I did point out why I liked those pairings. And both of them had actual reasons at the time for acting like such bastards towards her. Reasons that to me make the redeeming part more interesting and thus appealing to read. I wouldn't want her to end up with either of the men the way they /are/ in canon. Hence it being a fanfiction pairing. There is no way either of those would have worked without an additional book focused on working out those issues. Which is what fanfiction is for!
