Interesting that you say that after writing that your favorite pairs are Draco/Hermione and Snape/Hermione. It's not like both Snape and Draco continuously humiliate and mock her, isn't it? but I suppose in your mind it's just tsundere. Of course, Draco is much better than Ron - it's not like he's a jealous brat who can't stand other people getting attention, yet refuses to work to achieve anything himself.

Man, you have some serious issues.
