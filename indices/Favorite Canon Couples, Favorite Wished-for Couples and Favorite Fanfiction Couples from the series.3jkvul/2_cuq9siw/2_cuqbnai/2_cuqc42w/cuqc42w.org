As usual, the anti-R/Hr is a mask for one's hatred of Ron. What more to expect?

We always hear from anti-R/Hrs: that Ron can't stimulate Hermione intellectually, that he always tears her down, that he's emotionally abusive (and has the potential to physically do that too), yet we never hear of the flip side: can't Hermione loosen up? Hermione also tears Ron down sometimes? Hermione has actually sent birds to attack Ron, and she attacks him so badly that Harry has to use a Shield Charm to protect Ron. But no, of course, only Ron is to blame.

I'm not even that much of a R/Hr supporter, but I'm tired of the utter hypocrisy. I'd be more tolerant of people who dislike R/Hr if they didn't use that as a cover for their Ron bashing. It takes two to make a relationship work, you know.
