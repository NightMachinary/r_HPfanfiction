I agree with you! Look, I don't like Hermione/Ron, but I AM tried of people who say only Ron is the negative one in the relationship - they're equal offenders time and time again and constantly snipping at each other and fairly horribly sometimes! If you don't like them, /fine/ but don't act like Ron's the only one to blame.

And this is coming from me, a person that doesn't list Ron among their favorites.
