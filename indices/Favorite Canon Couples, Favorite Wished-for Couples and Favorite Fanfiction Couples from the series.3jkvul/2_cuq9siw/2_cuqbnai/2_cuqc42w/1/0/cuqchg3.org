You are using her "stubbornness" to further denigrate Ron. That's the thing. You're not considering why the relationship may or may not work. All you are doing is just using it as an excuse to +unjustifiably+ hate on Ron.

I understand that people think R/Hr wouldn't work, but a relationship goes two ways. You can't just put all the blame on one person. It's not like Hermione didn't have her issues with regard to Ron.
