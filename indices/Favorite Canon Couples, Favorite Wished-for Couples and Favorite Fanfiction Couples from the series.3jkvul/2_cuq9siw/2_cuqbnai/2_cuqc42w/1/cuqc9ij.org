I never said Hermione didn't have flaws, didn't I highlight her stubbornness in the very comment you're replying to? I do however strongly identify with her as she was very similar to me from what we've read, up until Rowling decided to make her marry Ron. Don't get me wrong, I've made some stupid choices in men too, but I consider her too intelligent to actually stay with that deceitful (he lies to her even in the epilogue, this is canon) oaf.

And yes I hate Ron, I disliked Ron since I was nine years old and read the first book. Each book has added reasons to that and he has never been redeemed in any meaningful way in my eyes.
