Ron does not constantly moan that nobody likes Hermione. He says /once/, when he was eleven years old, that "It's no wonder no one can stand her. She's a nightmare, honestly." When he sees that he made her cry, he immediately shows signs of regret, and just lacks the maturity to apologise.

Also, when does Ron ever mention disliking Hermione's lack of femininity? And I always saw the griping about her obsession with studying as good-natured, although that is up to interpretation.
