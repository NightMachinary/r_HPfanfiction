Hermione constantly nags on Ron's lack of unhealthy obsession with studying, him being a normal teenager, and basically him not meeting her standards. She's very much a magical version of the Dursleys in this way.

Ron constantly moans that nobody likes Hermione, dislikes her lack of feminity, and gripes about her obsession with studying.

Wtf was JK thinking?
