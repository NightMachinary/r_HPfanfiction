Canon: Harry/Ginny. They were literally written to be with one another, and I can't imagine either of them with anyone else. Ginny, maybe Draco, if the Weasleys were into the whole "Pureblood" thing, but that's not canon.

Wished-For: Cedric/Hermione. Ron accuses Hermione of liking Cedric in GOF. Imagine if she actually /had/ liked Cedric, or formed a relationship with Cedric instead of Viktor Krum. Oh, the tangled web of drama that would have ensued!

Fanfiction: Tom Riddle/Hermione. This is my guilty pleasure 'ship.
