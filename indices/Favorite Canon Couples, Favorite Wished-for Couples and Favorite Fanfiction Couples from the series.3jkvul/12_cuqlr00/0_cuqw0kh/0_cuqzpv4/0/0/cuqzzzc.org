I'd rather not, to be honest. I think Ginny's perfect for Harry. Even though I have these complaints about her, I still really liked her presence in canon. During the Christmas holidays in OotP, Ginny is the only one who actually gets Harry out of his funk. Harry really needs her forceful attitude at those moments.
