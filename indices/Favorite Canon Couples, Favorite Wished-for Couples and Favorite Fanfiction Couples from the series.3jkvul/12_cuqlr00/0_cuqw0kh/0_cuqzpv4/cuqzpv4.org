That was my problem with canon too. Problem is that there's a limited amount of pages JKR can write before it gets way too long for the publishers.

There are tons of wonderful characters that are way underused. Especially with Ginny I feel like she could have been so much more than just Harry's love interest. You get all these hints about how strong and great she is but it rarely gets actively used in the books. Include a Harry & Ginny vs Death Eaters fight scene somewhere, have her help solve one of the mysteries Harry tries to unravel sometime (what is Voldemort after in the DoM? What is up with Draco?), actively include her in the main storyline. It would have enriched the story a lot, I feel.
