Canon: Ron/Hermione and Remus/Tonks. Ron/Hermione I was rooting for from the beginning, and so the payoff was amazing. Remus/Tonks was something I thought my best friend was nuts for shipping after OotP and never thought would happen, and then it did happen and it was beautiful.

Wished for: Luna/Dean and Seamus/Lavender, but especially Luna/Dean. I adore the possibilities of that ship SO MUCH.

Fanfiction: Rose/Scorpius is pretty much all I read (or write) anymore. I love seeing these two characters, who we know pretty much /nothing/ about, taken in so many believable directions by fanfic authors.
