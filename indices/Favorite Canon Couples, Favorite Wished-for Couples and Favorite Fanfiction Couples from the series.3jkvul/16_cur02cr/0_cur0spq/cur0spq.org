I'll read the occasional Remus/Sirius though I'm not really into it...

But I just can't for the love of me see why people insist on this being canon. If anything, Sirius should have had feelings for JAMES considering how he was always closest to James and he never got over his death, and how he still remained incredibly fond of James years later. Not to mention, subtly pushing James' mannerisms/personality onto Harry who after all does look just like his father except for the eyes...
