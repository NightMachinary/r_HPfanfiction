/Canon:/ To be honest I don't very much like most of the pairings from canon, but I like Bill/Fleur. It seems well-written from my perspective.

/Wished-For:/ Remus/Sirius. The whole Tonks spanner-in-the-works seemed really out of character for both her and Remus (I *love* both of them as characters though), and I felt that R/S had a far larger amount of subtext.

/Fanfiction:/ Well, OP said it. Hermione/Bellatrix is a rare pairing, but I enjoy what few fics there are. R/S is great fun, as is very occasional non-Harmonian Harry/Hermione. And if you count the /Alexandra Quick/ series as technically Harry Potter, which it is, I ship Alex/Anna more than anything else in the world and will be severely disappointed if Inverarity sinks it.
