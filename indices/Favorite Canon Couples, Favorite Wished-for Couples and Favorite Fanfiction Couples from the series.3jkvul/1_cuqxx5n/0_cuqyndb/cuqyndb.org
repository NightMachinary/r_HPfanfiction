I REALLY liked Viktor/Hermione in the 4th book. Viktor's presented as this big-shot Quiddith player...but then it is revealed that he's quiet, uncomfortable in social interactions, nice and a lover of reading.

I thought he was really good with Hermione. I wouldn't have minded this being an actual cannon ending either - it would have been great to see how their long distance relationship played out. And he's a bit older than her too - something I've always felt was good for her.
