Yup. I actually think they're one of the better potential couples in the books, so it kind of kills me that they don't end up together.

There's not much. Most of the really good ones are more ficlets, too. This linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/474798]]) is about the best I've got, sadly. Sometimes it pops up as a well written side pairing though. I'd probably be a more obsessive shipper if more Viktor/Hermione fics existed, because it's kind of my OTP, but they're really just not plentiful.
