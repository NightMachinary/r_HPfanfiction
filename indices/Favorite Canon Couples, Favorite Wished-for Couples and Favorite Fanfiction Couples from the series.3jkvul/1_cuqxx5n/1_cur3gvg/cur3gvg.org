  Wished for: Viktor/Hermione is easily my most wished for. I think they suit pretty well (yes, he's into sports and she's not, but they respect each other, and he's much deeper than just his Quidditch).

Seconding this, and, also, him being "into sports" hasn't stopped her from marrying Ron. Furthermore, while most people know of him as the Quiddich seeker, notice that the Goblet chose him as the Durmstrang champion on his merits: he is one of the bravest and most talented and hard-working wizards in Durmstrang. (That said, JKR really should have looked up how a Bulgarian would or wouldn't mispronounce Hermione's name: it would be nothing like in the books.)

What good fic /is/ there for Krumione?
