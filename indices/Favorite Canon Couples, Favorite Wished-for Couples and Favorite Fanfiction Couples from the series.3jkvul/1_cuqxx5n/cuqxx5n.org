Canon: Lucius/Narcissa. I don't do fanfic that makes them dislike each other. I like Harry/Ginny, but don't love how it's presented in canon.

Wished for: Viktor/Hermione is easily my most wished for. I think they suit pretty well (yes, he's into sports and she's not, but they respect each other, and he's much deeper than just his Quidditch).

Fanfiction: I'll read pretty much anything if it's recommended to as well written, but I really have fun with Tom Riddle or Voldemort/Harry. I blame Athey.
