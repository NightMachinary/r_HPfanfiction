Canon: Lily/James. Just by what we've been told in canon, each person had to have matured quite a bit before having a romantic relationship, and they were only 21 when they died. We start the book with their deaths! It's tragic. We don't really know much of anything about their relationship, but we know about the individuals.

Wished for: I was a big fan of Harmony when I was younger. Now I think they're more like siblings, but this was prior to 6-7 being published. I also really really really wanted WolfStar to be canon, even if it was in the past.

Fanfiction: the only couples I typically go out of my way to look for are Hermione/Sirius, Hermione/Remus, and WolfStar. I'm picky about the first two- time travel shenanigans are preferred, or post war. I enjoy various rare pairs though.
