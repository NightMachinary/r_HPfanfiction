*Lily/James*: I honestly really liked linkffn(tears on the balcony by byebyebirdie), but I'll need to do a reread once the 3rd in the series is complete (last update a month ago). I recently read linkffn(love and other tragedies by fancyeyes) and loved it. You might find linkffn(key limes by cgner) cute. It's short.

*Harmony:* I actually don't have any on my favorites list, so I don't have any I can really recommend. Part of the problem is just the way a lot of them are written. They tend to start out OOC instead of developing that way. Maybe I just run into those too often.

*Wolfstar:* I have linkffn(Momentum by children of the shadows) on my favorites list but I honestly don't remember it. linkffn(3963147) was pretty good.

*Hermione/Sirius*: I'll always recommend linkffn(The Debt of Time by shayalonnie) and linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by maryroyale). I absolutely love them. Debt does feature some Remus/Hermione. Both are time travel.

*Hermione/Remus:* A standard is linkffn(the last marauder by resa aureus). linkffn(This Time Around by Disneydoll0424) doesn't seem to get recommended very often, but it's interesting at least. linkffn(overclocking by EuphoniumGurl0) is rather entertaining.
