Canon: Arthur/Molly, I'm glad neither of them died, i was really expecting one of them to bite the dust in the final battle.

Wished-For: Harry/Hermione. They will always be right for each other in my mind.

Fanfiction: Harry/Hermione or Harry/Tonks seem to be the stories with the most allure. I just cannot read Ron/Hermione stories, they seem to make me sick to my stomach.
