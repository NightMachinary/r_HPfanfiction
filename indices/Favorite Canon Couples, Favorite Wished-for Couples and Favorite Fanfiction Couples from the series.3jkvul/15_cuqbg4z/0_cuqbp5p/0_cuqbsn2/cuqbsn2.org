I didn't mean to say all lower class couples are annoying, I meant that they would be one of those stereotypical annoying lower class couples. As someone who grew up lower class I resent those people who give others a bad name, and I see both Ron and Lavender as such people. People who think that they should just be given everything /and/ think they're better than people who actually work for things.

For contrast, all of Ron's brothers grew up lower class, yet they all managed to turn out fine. He's the runt of the litter and it's mostly his own fault.
