  People who think that they should just be given everything and think they're better than people who actually work for things.

You edited this in after my last comment. Again, where are you getting this? When has Ron every shown he thinks he's better than anyone else? When has Lavender shown...anything really?

And again i'm not sure what stereotypes they're showing...do you really think a stereotype of lower class people is that they think they're better than everyone else?

  all of Ron's brothers grew up lower class, yet they all managed to turn out fine.
