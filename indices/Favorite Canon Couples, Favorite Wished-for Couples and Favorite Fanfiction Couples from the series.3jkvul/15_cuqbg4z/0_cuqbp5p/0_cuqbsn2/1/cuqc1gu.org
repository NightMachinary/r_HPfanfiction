Ron doesn't think that, he's acutely aware that he's poor in relation to someone like Harry or Draco, and knows that even people who don't come from magical families, like Hermione, are better off than him. He also knows, that out of all of his brothers, he's the least likely to be successful: he's not as adventurous and dashing as Bill, nor as hardy as Charlie, nor as smart as Percy, nor does he have a flair for business like Fred and George. It's one of his biggest insecurities that's hammered over and over again throughout the series. I don't know where this entitled bullshit comes from. Yeah, he's jealous of Harry's wealth, but he never takes advantage of him and often outright refuses whenever Harry offers to pay for him. Hardly the makings of a entitled bastard.
