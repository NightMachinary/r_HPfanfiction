I don't see either Harry or Ron becoming an Auror really, with the characters presented in canon. The problems with authority that especially Harry has make it rather unlikely (cops have to follow orders/rules). The only way I can see it happen is with a form of nepotism as a result of him being the greatest war hero after May 1998.

From what we've seen in the 7 books of how the wizarding world works as well as both Ron and Harry's characters, that is a far more likely route for them to auror office than hard work and proper conduct.

Also, since people seem to be really misunderstanding me: I do think Harry can work for things, and I do think he could get a proper carreer in something else, I just don't think he would function well as a member of a militarized police force.
