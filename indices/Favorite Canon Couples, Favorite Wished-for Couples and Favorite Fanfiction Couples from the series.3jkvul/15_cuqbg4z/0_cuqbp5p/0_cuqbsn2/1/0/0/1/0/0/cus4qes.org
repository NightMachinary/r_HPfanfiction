Yeah but one of my big problems with Harry, especially towards the end of the series, is that he doesn't really ever put in hard work>>>>Achievement.

Like yeah, he kills Voldemort. But it's not like he outdrew him, or found a clever way around his defenses. Instead the final duel is this incredibly anticlimactic moment where they cast simultaneous spells and Harry's wins because reasons.

My point, and I think OP's, being that once Harry isn't just gonna win because reasons how good is he actually at following orders, doing things by the book, respecting due process rights etc. Essentially, how good of a cop would he be?
