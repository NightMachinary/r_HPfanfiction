My suggestion for the debate threads in the survery was this pairing, and for a mod to emphasize that people shouldn't express their opinions in voting, as aside from unintentional slight at a group I've belonged to myself for most of my life so far, I've mostly tried to give reasons. Yet even outright insults towards me get upvoted while arguments where I do little but reference canon and explain my interpretation get down-voted, it feels rather hostile. It makes me think debate threads are not going to go over well in this sub.
