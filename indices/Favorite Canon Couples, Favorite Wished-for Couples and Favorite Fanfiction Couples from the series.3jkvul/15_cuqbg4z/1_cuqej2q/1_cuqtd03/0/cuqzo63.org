/Sigh/

I guess you're right, i mean, J.K tells us they both got 7 OWLs, unfortunately she never reveals Ron's grades where we do know Harry's. (1 O, 5 E's and 1 A.)

Again it comes down to how you personally interpret the cannon version of the books. I would right more but this seems like the kind of thing that will be discussed in the debating ring. :)

Feel free to slap me down with your logic and reason in there.
