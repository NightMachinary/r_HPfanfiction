Canon: Lupin/Tonks - I'm a sucker for a reluctant (older) man with a dark side.

Wished-for (way back when the books were still coming out): Ron-Lavender, a couple of typically annoying chavs, very realistic. Harry-Luna, Hermione-Bill, although I don't have a problem with Fleur-bill (like I do with most other canon pairings, I basically agree on OP's list of non-problematic pairings)

Dramione and Snamione are my favourite pairings in fanfiction, I like the idea of my favourite character redeeming an intelligent man with a troubled past.
