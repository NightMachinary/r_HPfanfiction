Canon: Lupin/Tonks because they're both my favorites and their love story is pretty interesting.

Wished for: Sirius/Lupin because Remus seriously gave me some gay vibes. Also, these two close friends have got to have some history.

Fanfiction: Hermione/Luna. I read, I write, I draw bad fanart. They have the potential to really get along, especially after the War.
