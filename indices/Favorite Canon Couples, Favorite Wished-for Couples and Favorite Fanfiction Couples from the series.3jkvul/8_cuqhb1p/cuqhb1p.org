Canon: Harry/Ginny: I really hate this in the movies, but love it in the books.

Wished for/fanfiction: (just because I find them to be basically the same category?) Sevmione all the way! They're such a marriage of true minds, and throughout the series, Snape is essentially the "story" and Hermione is constantly the one figuring out all of the hints and clues he drops, becoming the "reader". They are well matched in both interests and intelligence, and the age difference is hardly consequential (my parents are 20 yrs apart for goodness sake and they have a NORMAL lifespan)

For anyone who doesn't get this, I use the terms story/reader because of an excellent essay on the subject, PM for link!

Edit: just read the comments. WOW all of you need to reread the books and figure out that Ron isn't developed enough as a character for half the BS you're trying to argue about. And PLEASE stop throwing around the word abuse like it's candy, abuse is serious and not to be taken lightly, when it IS occurring. (which it isn't from Snape or Ron honestly. Snape is keeping his cover by making a few rude remarks and Ron just doesn't always think things through)
