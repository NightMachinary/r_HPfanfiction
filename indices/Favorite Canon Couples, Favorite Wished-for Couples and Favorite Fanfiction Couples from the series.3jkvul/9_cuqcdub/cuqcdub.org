*Canon* If I had to choose, then probably Arthur and Molly.

*Wished-for:* In OotP and HBP I wished for Harry/Luna. /Stop hunting Draco and get the girl, you prick!/

Pre-Horcrux-Hunt I kinda went along with Harry/Ginny, but never had strong feelings about it. During the Hunt it switched to Harry/Hermione. The Epilouge cemented that sentiment.

*Fanfiction:* I do have a weak-spot for Hermione/Bellatrix fics. I enjoy Harry / Hermione fics that are A) not romance focused or B) bash the living shit out of everything. I also like Harry /Tonks fics.

Oh, and out of curiosity OP, link me some of that Sirius /Bellatrix pls.
