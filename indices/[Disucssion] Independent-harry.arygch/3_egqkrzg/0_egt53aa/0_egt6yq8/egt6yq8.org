Here is my take on "Emperor":

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.
- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- This Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. He was quite bloodthirsty and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications a few times.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2024.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military environments. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of new circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Elicia, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.
- Astoria heads Harry's personal guard, while Daphne is a key official in the Order of the Phoenix.
- Voldemort is still around, has abandoned Death Eaters, and has built a much stronger power base in Russia.
- This fic seems abandoned though, after the author announced that the last story arc was basically done. Very disappointing.
