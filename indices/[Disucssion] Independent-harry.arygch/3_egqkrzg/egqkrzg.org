I like Harry leading his own faction, but not as a <16 years old with ridiculous power progression/wank.

In fact, a mature Harry running his own show has generated some of the best and most popular fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106): You have to admit that Harrymort is totally independent and does whatever he wants to.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry finally says "fuck it" and slaps down that incorrigible Ministry & Wizengamot. He puts both Kingsley and McGonagall in their places.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): When he returns, he has lots of fun running his indie operations behind the scene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): He manipulates people around him into cult-like following and pushes relentless for his own agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): He and Sirius are doing whatever they think is fun or right.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): He is totally the third faction and he will destroy the other two.
