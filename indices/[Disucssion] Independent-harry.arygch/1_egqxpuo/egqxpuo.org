Problem with "Independent!Harry" is that, at least in all the fics I've read is that he comes across as a child throwing a temper tantrum because not everything goes his way, and who thinks the way to being viewed as adult and worthy of respect is to talk in a really pompous way, and make threats whenever someone doesn't immediately bow down, worship him and make him the absolute center of their lives.

"Third side" or "grey Harry" usually just means "Harry goes around doing whatever he wants, refuses to cooperate with anyone, and acts like a total dick, and somehow that proves he's better than Dumbledore."

I mean, say what you will about Dumbledore, but at least he is POLITE.
