There were three sides in canon. Dumbledore was at odds with the Ministry almost the entire series starting from book two. Harry could create a fourth side, I suppose, but unless you're writing evil!Dumbledore there isn't really a need to. I've always liked the stories where the DA is expanded into more of a militia.

One thing he can't do is be neutral. Even if he wasn't looking to avenge his parents, he'd need to fight just to survive.

​

Still, there's something to be said for a Harry that doesn't do what's expected of him, which is where the indy!Harry genre really thrives. Harry shutting down Scrimgeour makes you want to pump your fist. Dumbledore even says "the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything." So many stories revolve around Harry being the chosen one and having to be the hero. Indy!Harry stories can provide a counterbalance, the plot that asks, 'what if Harry wasn't inclined to run headlong into danger?' He's a kid. It shouldn't be his responsibility. What would happen, how would it play out? It's an interesting diversion.
