I roll my eyes when there are factions at all in HP fanfic. "The Light" sounds ridiculous, especially when the worldbuilding starts adding more and more on, to the extent where there's "The Grey" faction, and Dumbledore is a Light Lord.

It's even worse when the author throws in strawman political positions for each faction, like The Dark being a pureblood frat full of pagans, while The Light is deep into the Muggle rights activism, even when it's dangerous to wizards. And Dumbledore is revealed to have sealed the Potters' will to keep Harry with the Dursleys... as a way to make him ignorant uneducated about his inheritance, and sympathetic to Muggles. Too bad it backfired, lmao.

When you see it pop up, you just know that all this worldbuilding has been added in to make the setting more /political/, so your indie shit-stirrer Lord Hadrian Potter-Black can step in and take charge, as you said, by creating a third side.
