The only way to make a proper Independent!Harry work, while he's Hogwarts age and without sticking an older mind into Harry's body, is for Harry to be the figurehead but not the leader.

He might well be helping call the shots - for example, if it's Sirius in charge, then he'll obviously try to incorporate Harry's goals - but he won't have final authority, because he's a teenager. Training him to become that leader provides plenty of fodder for the writer to work with.
