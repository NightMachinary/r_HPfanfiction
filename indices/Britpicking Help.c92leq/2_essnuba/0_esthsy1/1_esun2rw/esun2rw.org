No, it's the post-feminist creature, because authors claimed (and they were mostly right) that distinguishing women on pre-marriage and post-marriage is sexist. And as a Czech, where we still mostly do slečna/paní (Czech equivalents), it is also horrible bother: will you offend this lady to call her Miss (and she is just so proud to be married) or Mrs. (and she will kill you, because she is trying hide her age).
