One Britpicking (or perhaps '90spicking) point which bothers me lately: in 1990s nobody (at least in Europe) would call any woman “Ms.”, we were still pretty sticky to “Mrs.”, “Miss” duality. Especially with a stiff conservative Professor McGonagall it is absolutely impossible her calling Ginny Weasley as “Ms. Weasley”. It was “Miss Weasley” always.
