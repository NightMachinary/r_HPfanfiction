I haven't seen it after my google sleuthing.

If anyone wants to try again I can try to give what I remember the plot to be:

Harry has moved on from the Wizarding world taking a different name (Evans?) and moving out of England (to the US? New York?). The story opens in a hospital when Harry comes out of a surgery that intended to remove cancer from a little girl (I think). Harry heads home before collapsing.

Later on his day off, Harry and his girlfriend go on a date before returning to Harry's flat. Harry proposes to his girlfriend, but says that he wants to talk about something (his fame/origin) before she commits. She expresses the same desire because she wants to tell him that she is a witch before they marry.

The following day (maybe) they confess to each other. Harry's girlfriend (idk her name) confesses that she is a witch, Harry laughs and is partially relived, but it takes time for her to understand that he is also a wizard. When Harry reveals who he is she faints.

Soon it is revealed that the kid in surgery at the beginning has gone into remission and celebrations are had.

Later, Harry's GF invites him to dinner with her parents who take it better than their daughter. The story ends (I think) halfway through dinner (IIRC).
