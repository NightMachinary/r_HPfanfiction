You should change the tag for this post to "fic search", as you are looking for a particular fic.

"Discussion" tags are meant for talking with people about a topic, not hunting for a fic

Check the sidebar for more information on proper tagging for posts.

As far as this search, I'm interested but can't help. It doesn't sound familiar, sorry :/
