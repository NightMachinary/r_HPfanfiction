I finished this one once when I first started reading fics and remembered it being pretty decent. I went back to reread it six months ago and only made it about 50 chapters in. It's just too slow. And Robst has these little quirks about his writing style that drive me insane and show up in almost every chapter.

Examples:

1) Harry /was always/ going to ask Hermione to the Yule Ball.

2) /That/ Harry didn't giggle at Dan's unintended pun, /meant that/ he was finally starting to mature.
