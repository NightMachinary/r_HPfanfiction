  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  Severus died at the jaws of Nagini in May 1998, but instead of taking a well earned rest in the afterlife, he finds himself back in Cokeworth...in December 1975.Note: This is tagged as Snily, because it touches on their relationship (and well, you'll see) - but be warned that the prompt explicitly asked for them not to get together...
