Hagrid's a charity case with a hobby. I don't know if that counts. Umbridge was forced on them by the ministry. Don't know about Quirrel. Lockheart wouldn't have had even his NEWTs. Lupin would have had his NEWTs but no mastery. Moody was supposed to be a retired auror, plenty of credentials there. Snape would have had his NEWTs at most in defense.

So you're likely right. It's not necessary, but I imagine Dumbledore would snap up mastery-toting teachers whenever he could.
