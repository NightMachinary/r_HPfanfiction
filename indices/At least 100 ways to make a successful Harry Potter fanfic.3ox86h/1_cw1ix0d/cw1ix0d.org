12 - Make sure that Harry gains at least 2 animagus forms, preferably magical creatures that J.K. Rowling conveniently forgot to include in the Harry Potter universe. Some examples include Shadow Wolves, Royal Phoenixes, and any form of demon. Acceptable alternatives from canon include Basilisks, Dementors, and Nundu. Bonus points awarded for having Harry be the only multi-animagus and/or magical creature animagus in history.

13 - Although they may seem surly and hostile, Goblins are actually suckers for polite words and flowery language, but only when addressed by Harry Potter and his friends and allies.

14 - The more lordships the better, especially when they come with such perks as literal mountains of galleons, libraries full of rare and ancient books for Harry to joke about losing Hermione in but never set foot in himself, ancient and powerful weapons for Harry to forget about and ignore, deeds to houses/castles/islands that Harry will never see, binding mandatory Marriage Contracts involving witches Harry's age from all four of the Hogwarts houses as well as a long-forgotten contract with an ancestor of the Granger family.

15 - Even though your story isn't marked as a crossover fic, don't be bashful about +ripping off+ /borrowing/ creatures, spells, weapons, or side characters from your favorite anime, manga, comic books, fantasy novels, or movies.

16 - Remember when borrowing or inventing non-canon magic that any magic found outside of Magical Britain is at least twice as effective as any taught at Hogwarts, and since Magical Britain is controlled entirely by Pureblood Bigots,^{tm} nobody but Harry has ever even heard of it, therefore making it perfect for use in any and all future confrontations.

17 - Don't underestimate the capabilities of the Room of Requirement. In addition to creating rooms for clandestine dueling clubs and Wizarding Junk Drawers, it is also capable of things such as trans-dimensional portals; temporal manipulation, including time travel and time dilation; corporeal manifestations of Merlin, the Founders of Hogwarts, and even the sentient consciousness of Hogwarts herself; and literally any place that's ever existed anywhere. Ever.

18 - Always remember that teenagers by nature are hard-working and motivated individuals capable of committing themselves to daily training regimens that would make a Spetsnaz Commando weep like a little girl. Also, when coming up with a training regimen, remember your source material. Great Britain isn't known worldwide as "The Land of Guns 'n Ammo" for nothing.
