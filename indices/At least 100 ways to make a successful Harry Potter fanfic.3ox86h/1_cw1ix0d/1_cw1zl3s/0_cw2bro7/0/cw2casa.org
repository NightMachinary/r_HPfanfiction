It's funny, because there are other characters in HP that are similar to Hermione in her drive to learn. Snape with inventing, Neville with his plants, and Percy is the male equivalent of Hermione, plus or minus a few life experiences. Yet no one glorifies them or thinks every other child should be held to those standards. But for some reason, we all look at Hermione and think that Ron and Harry should be just like that. Which is crazy! Are any of us taking double the class load in college for fun/personal involvement? What about spending hours in the gym? Nope. Drives me nutso.
