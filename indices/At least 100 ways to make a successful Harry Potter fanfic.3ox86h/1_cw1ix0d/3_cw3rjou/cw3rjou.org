  12 - Make sure that Harry gains at least 2 animagus forms, preferably magical creatures that J.K. Rowling conveniently forgot to include in the Harry Potter universe. Some examples include Shadow Wolves, Royal Phoenixes, and any form of demon. Acceptable alternatives from canon include Basilisks, Dementors, and Nundu. Bonus points awarded for having Harry be the only multi-animagus and/or magical creature animagus in history.

You forgot that he should also make a harem of animagus females, and make puppies with them while in shadow wolf form...
