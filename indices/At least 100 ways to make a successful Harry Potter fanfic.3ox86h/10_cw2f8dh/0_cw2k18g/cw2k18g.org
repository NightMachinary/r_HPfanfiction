The amount of rape/attempted rape that happens in fanfiction is way too much... Being "evil" doesn't mean a character has to be a serial rapist. 90% of the time it's the whole Pureblood raping Muggleborn because... they can? Completely disregarding the whole fact that those same Pureblood's consider Muggleborns less than human...
