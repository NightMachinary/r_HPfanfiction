25. Nothing kindles a romance like the hero rescuing the heroine from thugs, bullies, kidnappers, and/or rapists in the nick of time.

25.1. Don't worry if you have to weaken the heroine to set it up.

25.2. If the hero isn't there to rescue her, that's OK: he can still take revenge on her behalf while she's recovering from her ordeal.
