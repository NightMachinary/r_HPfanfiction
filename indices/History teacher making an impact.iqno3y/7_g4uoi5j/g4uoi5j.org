I'm not going to call the bot to link the fic because it would be a reasonably large spoiler, but in the fic spoiler-hidden below, Chamber of Secrets goes quite differently and at the end of the year, a character sets Lockhart up to take over History and he does surprisingly well because he's actually very good at storytelling and making history engaging and accessible when he's not fucking it up by pretending he did it. I have high hopes for this to continue being a plot point, but the story is still in progress so we haven't had much time with him yet.
