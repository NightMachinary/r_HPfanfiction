[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Canon compliant until the end of DH, but Harry had it enough afterwards. What began as vigilante justice ended in a new dystopia run by the dark Trio.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): I would say all of them got pretty evil by the end, although Harry is still trying to moderating them to a certain degree. But he enjoys looting and war profiteering too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Not necessarily evil, but this Harry is manipulative as hell. Just read how he booted out his immediate boss should give you an idea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): He can be considered a benevolent tyrant. He brought peace, prosperity, and security to hundreds of millions of Muggles and Wizards. On the other hand, assassination, blackmail, genocide, sabotage, and torture are all among his policy tools.
