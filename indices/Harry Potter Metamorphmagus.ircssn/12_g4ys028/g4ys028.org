That's an interesting topic, but I don't think the ability to change forms, when coming later in life at least changes who you are, or at least your sexual preferences.

I know males who identify as females but are still attracted to females. And vice versa.

This reminds me of Alex Fierro, a child of Loki in the Magnus Chase and The Gods of Asgard series who can shapeshift in to almost anything and also changes genders. They also end up being the MCs love interest.

I imagine Harry would just see "himself"(I don't know what pronoun to use) as well, Harry.

I can see some people would have a problem with it.
