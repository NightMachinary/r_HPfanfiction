I envision that McGonagall would initially think this is some James Potter level pranking Harry is getting up to and would initially write it off as attention seeking.

However I can envision her losing her cool a little and either giving Harry a detention or making them stay behind after class. There, after a heart to heart, where McGonagall sees that Harry is just trying to discover themselves, she would flip to being understanding and on board.
