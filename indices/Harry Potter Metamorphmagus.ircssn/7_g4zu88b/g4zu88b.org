I looked for stuff like this back before I realized I was LGBTQ+

If any of this stuff exists, please point me towards it.

What's funny is that I have a female tiger (specifically a tigress) for my Pottermore patronus and my Pottermore wand had a unicorn hair core. I wasn't born female. Also, I hadn't realized I was LGBTQ+ until 2017. I was a Pottermore beta user.

My patronus is literally transgender, so I really want to read a compelling LGBTQ+ fic with this kind of thing. Long before 2019 I hadn't liked anything after the second task in GoF. If a fic exists that radically transforms the series along the lines of the prompt, I will read it. I'm all ears for any fanfic that does this.
