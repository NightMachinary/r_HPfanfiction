I had a really rough draft for a similar idea, but never actually developed much/if any of it. Nevertheless, feel free to take a read:

Harry is born as a Metamorphmagus, but is conditioned into suppressing it once his abuse at the Dursley household picks up. He doesn't remember much of it - if at all, and this period of time was between ages 3 and 6, with 6 being the moment where he no longer manifested any changes (regardless of emotional stimuli), though for the year and a bit before the power had already been mostly suppressed. 

During Harry's second year - ala Chamber of Secrets - when he, Hermione, and Ron take the polyjuice potion, the latent, repressed Metamorphmagus power is violently reactivated. This is largely due to how Polyjuice interacts with Metamorphmagus', which is to say /not very well/. It causes spasms, half-changes, and makes the user lose control of their Metamorphmagus ability. A variant on the Polyjuice potion is used to suppress Metamorphmagus powers, even, however the main brewed Polyjuice potion is highly reactive and highly damaging to a Metamorphmagus. Harry is no different, as the potion both reactivates, turns uncontrollable, and makes the effects of using the Metamorphmagus power more extreme. This causes him to - not exactly unexpectedly - end up having a violent, seizure-like episode. 

Before Dumbledore or any other staff member can try to fix the problem, numerous students see and are made aware of Harry's episode. This, along with the knowledge that a student has been petrified immediately after, causes Aurors to investigate. Dumbledore is (maybe momentarily?) stripped of his position and authority while the Ministry scrambles to find out what's causing the petrification events. This draws in several curse breakers, people who specialize in wards, those who specialize in exploring magical buildings, and monster hunters. 

Harry remains in a magically-induced coma throughout all of this while medi-witches work to first diagnose the problem and then wait for Harry's body to overcome close to seven years worth of neglect not using his Metamorphmagus ability. During this, Harry's horcrux is both found by specialists and is removed. S/He retains their Parselmouth ability.

At around April the team brought in identifies the Basilisk, finds a way into the Chamber of Secrets with the help of some research (Salazar was a Parselmouth, after all) and a book of phrases in Parselmouth, before promptly killing the Basilisk and retrieving Ginny - alongside the Horcrux, something they believe Dumbledore is aware of and is identified as purposefully hiding - and calling the case to a close.

On May 23rd, Harry wakes up in St. Mungos. 

Harry has reverted to what is known scholastically as the “malleable state”. It's an indistinct humanoid figure with single-tone grey skin, a mouth, two eyes, no nose, no ears, no genitals, and a distorted musculature that shifts and changes at random intervals. This state is what a Metamorphmagus ends up in when they have “episodes”, something that can be triggered either by extreme emotional duress, poison that specifically targets their shapeshifting abilities, or other maladies that conflict with their natural ability to change shape. 

Tonks - off screen at the moment - helps to guide Andromeda through getting Harry to first recreate his ears, which is done by telling him to focus on needing to hear and to ‘push'. Crude but effective, this leads to Harry regaining their ears, though they're so overwhelmed by the noise that Andromeda needs to create a one-way silencing charm so that Harry doesn't lapse back into the malleable state. 

Afterwards, Tonks fully enters the scene, introduces herself, and guides Harry through reverting back into what she describes as ‘his base state, of a sort'. This is done by following the same logic as his ears, though Tonks is there more physically to guide him and encourage him, even going so far as to enhance how loud her heartbeat is to soothe him through his anxiety about using the ability, something he doesn't understand but is so drugged out on potions that he babbles about it anyway. It's incredibly painful, like pulling knots out of hair just a thousand times worse, closer to a crucio, but Harry manages it and reverts to their original form -- their true original form. This prompts Andromeda to get really nervous, same with Tonks, because Harry's ‘true' form is definitely a girl.

Which. Y'know. Is maybe a problem, considering the whole boy-who-lived bit.
