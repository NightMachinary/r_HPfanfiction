Originally it meant what it said on the tin: yourself, inserted into the story of choice. Over time it's developed to be short hand meaning someone from this world, put into a fictional world of your choice.

SI/OC means that 'your' character is in a new person, while you can also have a 'Canon SI' where 'your' character goes into the body of a pre-existing character, such as Hermione.
