Tozette has also written [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8906032][a Lockhart SI oneshot]]; the main character wakes up in Gilderoy Lockhart's (beautiful, beautiful) body and promptly decides to do the reasonable thing and fake their own death. Complete, obviously, given that it's a oneshot and all.\\
Also, it's not quite a self-insert, given that the main character is not the author's avatar but rather a character from a different series, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]] fits the template of 'Character from another world wakes up in canon character's body' if you're only concerned with general premise. WIP but it's 221k so that won't be bothering you for a long while.
