[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3198890][good friends]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/anotherbuskitten/pseuds/anotherbuskitten][anotherbuskitten]] is one with Tom having a friendship with Hagrid before the whole chamber thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/932445][Green Apple]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tumblewaltz/pseuds/tumblewaltz][tumblewaltz]] is a genderswap that doesn't really change much with said swap. Essentially a Tom Riddle character study with the added cultural biases of being a girl in the WWII era.

I can't really think of any others like that without some form of time travel. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293][Realignment]] might be something you like just because the character who time travel is just an antagonist and not really a main character. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] is probably the most in depth exploration of a Tom Riddle that doesn't start out evil, but it's extremely time travel (and quite dark), although there are no romantic relationships.
