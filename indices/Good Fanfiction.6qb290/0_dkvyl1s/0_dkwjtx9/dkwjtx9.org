Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is among the best cliched to fucking hell stories ever written. It's actually a good read, unlike many of its brethren. The writing and plot is quite above average.

And then we have people like Sinyk. Shitty plots and even /more/ cliches, but a nearly unmatched command of the English language among fan-fiction writers.
