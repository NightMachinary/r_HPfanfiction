So I've just read the comment you linked below and honestly I kind of agree. I'm now on my, what, like 80th chapter, and I feel like I'm dragging this plot along instead of it captivating and dragging me in. The plot has become too intricate that while it is interesting, it's distracting at the same time. But I think I'll just finish it, just to say that "I've read the whole thing" before I criticize. Anyways, thanks for the heads up (tho I may be a bit too deep in for it to be heads up...)
