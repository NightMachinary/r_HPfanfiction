Makes sense, thanks for the link.

I was pretty satisfied with the way things ended in the third book (except for a certain plot point with Sirius, which I was annoyed about, but am leaving vague so that I don't spoil the person who made this post). I'll probably wait until the fourth book is done before I try to read it. I have plenty of things to read in the meantime.
