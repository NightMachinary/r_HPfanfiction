1 is fine, but a little dodgy. The author has found a following on one site and is now using it to indirectly advertise himself on another site.

2 is immoral and illegal(?). To charge others for writing fanfiction (which is based on someone else's intellectual property) is, in my opinion, the height of moral bankruptcy for a member of a fandom.
