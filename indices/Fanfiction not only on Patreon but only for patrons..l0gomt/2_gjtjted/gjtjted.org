Fanfiction, legally speaking, is in a bit of an odd territory. IP Law is so obnoxious and complicated (and varying across different countries) that lawyers are still arguing to this day about fanfic and it's been thirty+ years. In the US system (most fic sites are hosted there, so it's the most relevant), fic is justified under a couple pieces of fair use legislation that basically state reusing active-IP (ie. anything not in the public domain) is okay in certain specific contexts (education, parody, transformative works, etc) so long as it meets some certain criteria (not-plagiarised, non-commercial, not taking revenue/interest from the original work, that kind of thing).

But despite any legal arguments, fic generally continues to exist only at the whims and tolerance of the author and their publishers. Most of the bigger authors/publishers (which generally produce the stuff for the big fandoms) have enough resources to ruin pretty much any fanfic author with little effort and most who allow it generally have two rules - don't show it to them (authors pick up phrases and ideas from everywhere and they don't wanna steal from fans) and don't charge for it.

Technically speaking, there's a decent-ish legal argument that you can charge for fanfiction if you're sufficiently transformative (meaning coffeeshop AUs are actually the most marketable fanfiction :D), but for the most part it's simply "Don't charge and don't copy" and that's what keeps it going.

If people charging for fics start to get enough attention, I imagine a lot of authors will start cracking down simply to protect their IP (like Star Wars keeps doing with fan-games) and in all honesty I couldn't entirely blame them. I'd certainly be irritated if someone stole my work and fiddled with it a bit, then tried to sell it as theirs.

Personally, I like Eric Flint's approach. Essentially embrace the fandom of your work, then help them cultivate it into an extended universe. He releases bimonthly magazines with various fan-written short stories set in his universe - gets them edited and published and everything. Pretty cool, and definitely something I'd try for if I were ever a published author.
