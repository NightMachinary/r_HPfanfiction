While I haven't seen it used for fanfic purposes yet, I have seen it used for romhacks (basically mods of console games, from things like translations, to complete conversions), which bears some similarity. I don't like it, and I'm fairly sure it's not even legal. The moment you request money for something beyond some minor maintenance-related corner cases (shipping costs of fanzines or similar), your work isn't really a hobby project anymore IMO, and you're basically profiting from someone else's work. I also think it means it's no longer fair use, but I'm not really familiar enough with US law to say that with confidence.
