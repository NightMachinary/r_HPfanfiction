It's a fairly difficult question. I'm not fully familiar with how patreon works, it's not something I've looked into personally.

From what I've been informed, it's if you like the art of a person, and you pay them to encourage and support them. If you follow the lines of that argument, then by the technicalities of law, they are clear of any liabilities.

However if they charge for things as in " you need to pay to read this story. " In that case, they will be liable.

Also seeing that it's being made available for free in some period of time, a mere delay in availability, it's complete fine. Provided a court interprets Patreon as a private platform.

Basically, it's the person and their service they pay for, and that means it's clear with respect to IP law. If it's the item or product, then you'll be in trouble.

Although, it'll always change with the social, political views of country to country.
