To be honest, I don't really care about that. I'm not for it normally, but it's interesting when the fanfic author makes him look like a tool. Like if Harry was put into Slytherin, and Ron abhors anything Slytherin, wouldn't it be a bit different? I know that this fanfic isn't one of those, but it's just a fanfic.

On top of this I actually quit this fanfiction about 10 chapters in. It wasn't my cup of tea. Especially when the romances got a bit weird. Adding on to that:

The only fanfics to really stay far as hell away from, in my honest opinion, and as far as I'm concerned, is slash. I hate it. I wouldn't mind if Harry was just gay and that's all, and the rest of the story is good, but for f++ks sake, when people make it as graphic as possible, that's just disgusting. And no I'm not hating on gay people. Just the unnecessary, sexually graphic nature of some fanfics. Same when they make the straight romances as graphic as possible. That's pretty f++++d up. Just because you can write an awkward, and unnecessary sex scene doesn't make you a 'good author.' It's the rest of the story that counts. Of course, just my opinion.

[Though I should add that I think I dropped this fic because of the romance sections. Those were kind of weird. Just a heads up. But the reason as to why I even added the fic in the first place, to this list, while knowing this, is just because it was the only Lockart fanfic I found where he isn't a "babbling bumbling baffoon."]
