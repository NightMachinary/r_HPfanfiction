Yeah I get it. There are some really stupid plot devices in some of these stories that people use to move it forward. But I tend to be like, "hmmm, I'm going to pretend I didn't see that, or try to forget about it entirely." while I move on with the story. But if the story starts to weaken, then I usually lose interest.

The only one I've read all the way through was an elemental story that now seems to be sadly deleted. It had 100+ chapters and was one of the most badass stories I've read. It didn't focus majorly romance and focused more on building the characters. I'm glad I did read it when it was up though. It probably is one of the best ones I've ever read.

Though, "Oh god not again," another time-travel based one is actually pretty good. As for anything else, the only ones I can call to memory is "Delenda Est" (a unique time-travel one) and "The Rune Stone Path" (not a time-travel, but Harry is intelligent and really good at runes... but it's got one of those weird style romances [multi-partners], so I haven't read all of it yet, and will only do so if I find it to not be completely filled with that crap.). In fact, I haven't completed any of these stories yet. And I have yet to even start on Bungle in the Jungle.
