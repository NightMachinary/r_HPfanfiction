There's "Battles With Basilisks." It's a one-shot, but it's really good about turning Lockhart into the competent and powerful wizard he presents himself as, and STILL keeping him perfectly in character... he's brave, heroic, efficient and a good deal smarter than he let's on, but he's still callous, full of himself, and more concerned about his own fame and book sales than he is about actually being a good person.
