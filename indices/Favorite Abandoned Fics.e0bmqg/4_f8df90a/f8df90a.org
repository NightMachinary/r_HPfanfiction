Magical Relations is definitely on my list as well! As well as...

- The Tinkerer is easily my favourite abandoned fic. linkffn(12461030)

- Reign of the Serpent is so goddamn /unique/ I wish there was more (and really, there's a LOT there already). linkffn(9783012)

- Square One, the sequel to the Supernatural crossover Illusions of Grandeur. I love this Harry so. Freaking. Much. linkffn(8957424; 10451100)
