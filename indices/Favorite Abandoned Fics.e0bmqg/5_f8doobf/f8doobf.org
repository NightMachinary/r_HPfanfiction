- linkffn(When Harry Missed the Trick Step by Srikanth1808) ... it is one of those Sirius gets liberated and Madam Bones kicks many asses, but it seemed like keeping the story in style (no Lord Gryffindor anywhere),
- Both linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee) and “[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=9931566][Terms of Matrimony]]” by Galad Estel (it was taken down from FFnet, so I found just a copy in [[https://ff2ebook.com][ff2ebook.com]]) claim to be finished, but really I think they are just abandoned stories in disguise. The author setup very nice story, but he didn't have proper plot or will to write it down (and I am in exactly the same situation right now myself, so no looking down on them).
- linkffn(A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808), a sequel to linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) ... heroes read JKR books type of story, but a way better written and with an authentic plot.
- linkao3(The Wheel Is Come Full Circle by White_Squirrel) which promised to be better written “Hermione recovers the memory of her parents after the war” (and yes, there was a secret weapon how to find them in whole Australia in couple of minutes, no need for linkffn(Australia by MsBinns)-long search for them).
- And of course, a zillion of stories by Northumbrian:

  - linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian), but read linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) first, is probably the most painfully felt abandoned story;
  - linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian);
  - linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian) ... probably the least painful of these three, but still, what did Wilberforce Wylde do? I was so impatient with this story to be unfinished that I wrote my own sequel linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls: Christmas: Distraction by mcepl).
