I tend to avoid abandoned/hiatus'ed fics, but I have read some that are utterly fantastic and deeply hope that they'll be continued one day; however unlikely that may be.

One from back in the day I'd love to see revisited is linkffn(Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor)

And one I only read recently is linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty)
