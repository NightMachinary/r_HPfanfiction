I really love Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon which has a wonderfully unique method of time travel, and seeing Harry and Hermione overcome obstacles by just throwing themselves at them over and over until they get it right is so endearing. The fic is clearly labelled on the first page:

#+begin_quote
  Don't expect this story to ever be complete. It'll keep expanding indefinitely as long as I keep getting ideas
#+end_quote

But somehow that just makes me feel worse that it hasn't had an update in over 6 years
