linkao3(1573109) - slice of life-esque remus/oc fic, witty and funny

linkao3(589726) - snape meets a time travelling harry in his 6th year, very very good

linkffn(6306296) - the best snape-centric time travel fic in my opinion, he takes his newts 2 years early and works at an apothecary. it's snape/lily but i don't mind the pairing in this one

linkao3(3390668) - one of the best alternate dimension fics
