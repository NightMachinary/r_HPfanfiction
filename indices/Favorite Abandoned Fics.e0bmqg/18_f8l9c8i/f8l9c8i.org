Radaslab wrote a super-powered HP do-over which, to me, had a very interesting set-up. Future Harry sent back in time a magical 'hologram' to advise young Harry to avoid the complete destruction of humanity.

The first story Radaslab completed which takes place before Hogwarts, the second story has Harry just starting to attend. Unfortunately it was never finished, but I've always wondered what Radaslab's plan was for for finishing up this tale.

The first (completed) 'book' is linkffn(5178251) and the second (incomplete) 'book' is linkffn(5480014).
