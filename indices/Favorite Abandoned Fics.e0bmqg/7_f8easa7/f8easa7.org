[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) is one of the few fics I read early in my fandom days that still holds up. And while it's incomplete, the plot is more or less wrapped up by the last chapter, so it has a less jarring end than most abandoned fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] linkffn(3557725) is a trio fic that strikes an excellent balance of characterization and plot. I really would've liked to have seen where the storyline would've gone next.
