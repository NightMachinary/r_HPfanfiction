  Or Harry throws a violent temper tantrum, more violent than the one in OotP and Dumbledore actually resorts to magic to subdue him rather than trying to explain himself?

It wasn't a manipulative Dumbledore story, but I do recall reading a fic where, in response to Harry yelling at him, Dumbledore transfigured Harry into an ottoman. Then he put Ottoman!Harry in front of his chair, lit a pipe, and alternated between explaining why Harry was wrong and blowing smoke rings at him.
