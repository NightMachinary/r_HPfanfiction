Hi, sure

The game is played in Discord, in channels that are places. In several scenes at a time.

There are classes, and we will have quidditch matches too.

The House system is also important, beacuse the more points you get for your House... the more things you can buy, like skill improvements, wands, brooms, cauldrons...

We usually play daily, but people playing 3 or 4 times a week it's ok.

We didn't start yet... but i bet we will have quite active game. We had a server before, and it was played daily.

No overall plot, just a school year, but yes to events, like balls. And in the future... we probably will introduce some special stories. But ... not yet.
