Can you give more description as to how the game is played and about the server in general? What systems are there? Are there classes? How active on average does someone need to be? What are the rules and what is and is not allowed? Is there an overarching plot or just random rp between members? Are there events?

Just some more info would be helpful I think in getting people to want to check it out or click the link.
