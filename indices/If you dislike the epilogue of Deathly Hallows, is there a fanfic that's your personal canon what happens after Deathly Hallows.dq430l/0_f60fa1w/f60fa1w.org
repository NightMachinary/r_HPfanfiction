No. I dislike the epilogue for quite a few reasons, but in order to truly fix it, you'd have to rewrite the entirety of DH at least, HBP most likely as well.

There isn't really a singular thing where I would say "this is how it has to be". I dislike the Ron/Hermione romance, but removing that would hardly improve the mess which is called the seventh book. I dislike what was done to Tonks' character in books 6+7, but again, just changing that would not improve the overall feel of the finale. You would need to rewrite large parts of those tomes because, by the last chapter (excluding the epilogue), the damage has already been done. The epilogue was the final blow, but at that point, it was a mercy killing.

Which is honestly the reason I never got around to writing a post-war/next-gen fic. There is just so much wrong with DH that it is little more than a rotten foundation to build on. As entertaining as a Teddy&Delphi fic where they act like siblings would be, I feel like I would spend more time trying to "fix" HBP and DH through flashbacks, exposition and the like than actually writing about the next generation.

There are many fics which are, in my opinion, better than the epilogue, but that's not a high bar. "It could only happen to Harry" is a harem smutfic and still a better ending, despite its unbelievable premise. The one where Tonks tries to be a dark lady and ends up repeatedly saving the day is a cracky comedy and likewise is more satisfying than the mess which got us to "Albus Severus".
