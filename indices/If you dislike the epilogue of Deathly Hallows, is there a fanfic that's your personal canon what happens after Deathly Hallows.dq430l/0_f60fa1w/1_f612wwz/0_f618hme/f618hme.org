OotP is great IMO because it shows the true nature of the Ministry and Dumbledore's unwillingness to become a dictator even if he could so. Umbridge is a great antagonist who deserved more screen time in DH (and an appointment with the headman in the end). The darker tone certainly fits Voldemort's return.

But yeah, the Weasleys surviving 8/9 seems odd when everyone else is dying like flies. As Aurors, Tonks and Moody were certainly more combat capable than all Weasleys bar Bill (who should be equal to Tonks but still behind Moody).
