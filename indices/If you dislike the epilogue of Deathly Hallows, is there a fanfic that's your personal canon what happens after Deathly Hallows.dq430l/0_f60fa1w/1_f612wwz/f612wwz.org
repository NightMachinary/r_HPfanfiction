Everything after GoF tbh. Dumbledore was outsmarted in GoF, but he was just an idiot in OotP and HBP. Harry looked at a serpentine S inlaid with green stones and didn't connect it to Slytherin at all? Sirius being all mysterious about the mirror is hilarious in hindsight. Whole families were wiped out in the first war, Andromeda, Harry, Susan, Aberforth, etc. lost damn near everyone, but somehow 8/9 members of a family connected to Harry Potter managed to survive.
