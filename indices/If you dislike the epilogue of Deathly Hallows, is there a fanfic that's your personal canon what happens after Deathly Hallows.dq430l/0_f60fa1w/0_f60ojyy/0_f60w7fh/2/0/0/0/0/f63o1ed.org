OK, I get the Draco not conceiving Scorpius while in Azkaban (although, at least in some Czech prisons in some time periods, it was possible for prisoner and his wife to be let alone in his room, for exactly this reason --- after all this doesn't help anybody if the prisoner's marriage falls apart because of sexual frustration), so you are possibly right. My main point was that we really don't know much what happened after the war (and OK, if Draco was in Azkaban, he could still manage to have eleven-year Scorpius conceived in 2005 and be for seven years in a prison), we certainly know nothing what happened to Lucius or Narcissa (although, she probably was the least punished ...

Tonks parents? Yes, some warding charms apparently truly exists in the wizarding world, but they are not absolutely secure. Exactly Tonks' wards themselves were overcame and both of them were brutally tortured. Perhaps, the first attack was not done very well?

50% loss as catastrophic is for /military/ units. The Order was however not regular military. Consider losses of partisan units during The Second World War ... many of them were wiped out completely. Yes, it is a catastrophe, but they were group of volunteers fighting against organized military and whole Ministry, which was much closer to the reality of those resistance movements. And yes, obviously, JKR tried too hard to make her novels YA acceptable by keeping good guys (and gals) towards non-lethal guys. Real resistance movement would have to be more bloody.
