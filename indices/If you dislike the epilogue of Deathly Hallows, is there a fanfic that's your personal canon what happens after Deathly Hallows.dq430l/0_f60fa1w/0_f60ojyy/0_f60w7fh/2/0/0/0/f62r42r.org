There is evidence of Malfoy avoiding Justice other than the Pottermore article. Namely Draco's son existing and being at a Hogwarts age. If Draco is had spent a decade in prison, Scorpius would be 7 during the epilogue, not 11.

As for the Tonks home, it repels the entirety of Voldemort's forces, himself including, at the end of the 7 Potter episode. And this was possible without Nymphadora being abused there, so this proves that there were alternatives to the Dursleys when it comes to protection, especially since Voldemort had Harry's blood and the protection at Privet Drive only covering the house and little else. So Harry would be vulnerable as soon as he went to fetch something from the shops.

As for the Order's inefficiency, just look at the losses they suffered. Based on the picture Sirius shows Harry, at least 80% of the members die until Voldemort is finally defeated. Most militaries consider 50% casualties for a unit catastrophic.
