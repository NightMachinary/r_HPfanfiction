First of all, Pottermore is not canon for me (I know, it is for some, but we are talking here about books, don't we?), so:

1. I don't think there is any evidence that Malfoys were not punished, certainly there is nothing about Lucius Malfoy being spared, it is possible that even Draco in the Epilogue was there after spending ten years in Azkaban (I don't think there is any evidence contrary).

2. yes

3. yes

4. there is no evidence for “no denazification afterwards”

5. yes

6. it is a bit more complicated, I have tendency to agree somehow, but I think it is a bit more complicated; yes, Snape was a dick, and no I don't think whatever he felt towards Lily was love; yes, Dumbledore is highly problematic, but I don't think anybody should hate him with passion ... probably distrust him with the one, but hate is a very strong word,

7. I don't understand, what you refer to ... Tonks home and child abuse? Sorry, not getting it.

8. Not sure about Order being completely ineffective, we just don't know about much (there are many stories, which don't conflict canon, and they show plenty of action and effect Order made in the life of many). Yes, whole “saving Harry from the Privet Drive” was completely brain-dead (why in the world he was staying there for two weeks, just to get two more weeks of a secure house?), and of course all scenarios of “Harry under the Invisibility Cloak goes to a bus station and drives to London” are valid.

9. We just may not know about it ... The Trio in woods didn't have the best news available. Also, how much you know about the underground activity against the Nazi regime in Germany during the Second World War? There was really not much to talk about, die Weiße Rose movement is so famous, because it even existed, but comparing to it The Order of Phoenix was the paramount of effectivity.
