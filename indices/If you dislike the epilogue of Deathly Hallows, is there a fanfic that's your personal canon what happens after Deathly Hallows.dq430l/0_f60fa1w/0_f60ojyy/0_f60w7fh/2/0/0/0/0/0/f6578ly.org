And how would Malfoy find a wife while in prison? Tinder isn't exactly an option and if you are in for unforgivables, war crimes, torture and attempted murder, I doubt that they'd let him out to go on dates.

The canon line you refer to about the Tonks is rather inconclusive about what reallyhhappened and illogical since Edward, a Muggleborn, was left to go back home and not charged by Umbridge. And while the protection of all Order safe houses broke, that is another plot hole AND there is no telling if the chosen method would have disabled the protection at Privet Drive.

As for losses, well while partisan forces might have suffered catastrophic losses at times, against badly led forces even conscript units could do well. Simo HÃ¤yha, the most successful marksman in history who averaged 7-8 Soviets a day, was just a conscript. During the winter war, the Finnish managed a K:D of more than 10 because their opponents used the kind of stupid frontal assaults Voldemort ordered against Hogwarts. And they were a baldy outnumbered conscript force. I'd argue that you can compare the Order to that since quite a few members were fully trained Aurors (Moody, Tonks, Alice and Frank Longbottom) while others were combat capable as well (Sirius, James and Lily, Lupin, Dumbledore). The DA should be comparable to partisans, but the Order had too many professionals.
