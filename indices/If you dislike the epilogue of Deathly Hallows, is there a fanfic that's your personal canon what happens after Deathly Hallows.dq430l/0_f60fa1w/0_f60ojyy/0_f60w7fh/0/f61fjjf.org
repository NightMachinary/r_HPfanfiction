I agree on all of your points.

- Malfoy /could/ have been redeemed, but it would have had to happen before year six at the earliest, and preferably even earlier than that.

- The horcrux hunt was beyond stupid and handled so horribly. The amount of pointless angst that came about from the camping and lack of food was inane.

- With regards to the ministry after Voldemort's defeat, everyone knows that racism is solved by beating the final boss of racism /s

- HBP was arguably worse than DH, which really says something. It felt like JKR was trying to stretch her ideas thin in a desperate attempt to make her remaining ideas fill two more books

- While I dislike the standard manipulative Dumbledore portrayal, the way he's written in canon means that he's incompetent at best. A good, competent Dumbledore basically requires the entire story to be written from scratch. Snape... Snape was on the right side of the war, but he did it for selfish reasons and was still a terrible and petty person. Not to mention that making him act evil so "Voldemort would believe him" was insanely stupid. If Snape wanted to keep his cover, he should have /pretended/ to be loyal to Dumbledore so he could reasonably pretend that he had fooled Dumbledore. Did Voldemort actually believe that Dumbledore would believe a man who constantly bullied children had reformed? Maybe. Voldemort was pretty stupid in canon, after all.

- Gods, don't get me started on how fucked up it was that Harry /had/ to go to the Dursleys. Having Harry go there immediately after his parents died was the only time it was close to justified, but the fact that he had to /keep/ going back there was awful, especially after the events of books four and five. Sending him back to apathetic and abusive relatives after he just witnessed the death of people close to him was the worst thing they could have done, especially with how the just cut him off in the start of OotP. Not to mention that given how Tom Riddle turned out, you'd think Dumbledore would do something different the next time a student came to him and asked him to stay at Hogwarts instead of going back.
