Malfoy redemption is possible to the point where he carries out the attack on Katie or after a lengthy stay in prison. A romance with the trio is only possible if you make changes before year two.

For the Dursleys, Dumbledore's justification alone should be enough to get him behind bars. He says that Harry might have been underfed, but at least he wasn't pampered. How can you leave such a man near children?

I think Snape's action fooled no one, both sides knew that he was at least a double agent, the only question was whom he was ultimately loyal to. And his canon actions leave that one inconclusive.
