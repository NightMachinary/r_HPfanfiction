- Malfoy avoiding justice for his war crimes (according to Pottermore, even Lucius got off again)

- The absolute stupidity of the Horcrux hunt. There are a hundred times more Tescos than Death Eaters, nevermind other supermarket chains. There was no need to starve or be otherwise miserable. Also, see below

- No one leaving Britain. Apparating across the Channel or even taking the rowboat would be preferable to camping in the countryside and being summarily executed like Ted Tonks.

- The Ministry happily switching between genocide and cauldron bottom thickness. There was no apparent denazification afterwards. All was well.

- HBP only working due to everyone passing the idiot ball like a bong. Most notably, Ron and Hermione not believing that Draco, the guy who has been calling for racial purges since age 12, could work for Voldemort.

- The reception of certain characters, most notably Dumbledore and Snape. Dumbledore is incompetent throughout the series (most notably his useless lessons in HBP, his actions in OotP and his inability to deal with the plots of books 2 and 3), Snape a massive dick (a good deed does not wash away a bad one). Harry should be hating them with a burning passion. Yes, it is due to the chosen medium, but "this is a YA novel" should not stop Harry from dislinking Dumbledore for letting Malfoy attack and nearly kill two of his friends.

- The Tonks home repelling the entirety of Voldemort's forces without the need for child abuse. I don't mind that per se, but it should lead to a massive rift between Harry and (the memory of) Dumbledore.

- The Order being completely ineffective. No reckoning towards the Dursleys, the utterly braindead extraction plan and lack of resistance after Voldemort's takeover.

- No one else taking up arms against Voldemort. I mean, again I am fine with this element, but it paints a rather bleak picture of the morals of magical Britain. And yes, it would most likely have been futile, but that didn't stop any of the WW2 resistance groups.

And that's just the plot, not to mention narrative tone or the epilouge.
