  He fired at a mirror reflection of Harry.

There's a physics problem with that.

The curse rebounded, so I assume you're saying that the mirror reflected the curse, since it's green light. However, light travels in a straight line. If the mirrors were angled so that light came from Harry and reflected at the exact angle to show his reflection to Voldemort, then the killing curse would follow the exact same path, but in the opposite direction, and still end up hitting Harry
