I read a story where that thing did happen. the thing is no one really understood how lily did it. And the problem was that anyone who survived the KC was not stupid enough to let people know they had a way of surviving it. Pretty sure it was the same story where it was told that a muggle survived the Dementors kiss. Apparently Dementors don't suck your soul out. They just get so close that you become so depresses that you lose the will to live and commit mental and spiritual suicide. Then they just suck your soul once it leaves your body through the mouth. The muggle in question was a priest who found the idea of suicide so against his beliefs that he withstood the dementors aura long enough that they gave up and looked for other food.
