That is my preferred version of what actually had happened, because I'm quite turned off by all the passive sacrifices (by good guys) JKR is pushing in this series.

As for fics that has Lily putting up some dark and powerful rituals, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]] is a good example. Dumbledore later even modified it to destroy Voldemort Prime's soul without hunting down his other Horcruxes.
