I think Katie/Harry is an awesome pairing that is decently plausible. But, there's only like 100 stores on FFN that are even marked with them both being in the story, let alone a pairing. I've gone through them all, and unless some amazing story has come out in the last 2 months, I wouldn't quantify a single one of them as good.
