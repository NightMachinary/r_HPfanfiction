It's not the pairing, but the best Harry/Katie relationship I've read is in A Cadmean Victory. The pairing is Harry/Fleur, but there was a point where the author said he was split between continuing the Fleur pairing or moving the story to Harry/Katie, and it shows. Katie's character is just well done and fun, and even though Harry/Fleur is my second favorite pairing (after Harry/Tonks), I kept rooting for Katie in this fic because her character was freaking amazing. I'd recommend you read it even if it isn't exactly what you asked for.
