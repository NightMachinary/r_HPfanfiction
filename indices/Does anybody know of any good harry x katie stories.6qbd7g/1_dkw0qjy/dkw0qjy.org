Here's seven of them, not all of them are 60k plus. You're not going to have a lot of luck with such a specific request. Asking for such a rare pairing, that's 60k+, you're lucky if you find a decent oneshot with Harry/Katie.

I'm guessing you're reading DrizzleWizzle's series. I didn't really get into it, but if you find another good Harry/Katie story, make sure to leave a post with a link. I'd like to see a few more stories with them, and maybe others will too.
