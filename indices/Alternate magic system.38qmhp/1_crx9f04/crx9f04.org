[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source][Harry Potter and the Sun Source]] features a Harry with sufficient martial arts training that it's effectively magic. Jumping forty feet into the air to catch someone falling at terminal velocity and landing safely with them, using pressure points to make someone vomit or permanently paralyse their arms, that sort of thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope][The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]] imports a handful of magic systems practised by a tiny subset of mages each. Harry, for instance, has the Eyes of Misery, which is mostly lifted from Naruto. Another mage in the story has a facility with direct destruction not through any spells. Most of them are bloodline abilities.
