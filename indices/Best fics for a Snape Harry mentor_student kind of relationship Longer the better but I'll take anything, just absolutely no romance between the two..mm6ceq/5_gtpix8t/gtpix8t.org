Have you read linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)? It's fem!harry, mentor!snape, and slytherin!harry. It's one of my all-time favorite fics, but it's a crossover with Alanna the Lioness so it's super AU

Edit to add that there's pretty much no romance in the first few books of the series, it's just a small plot point in book 4
