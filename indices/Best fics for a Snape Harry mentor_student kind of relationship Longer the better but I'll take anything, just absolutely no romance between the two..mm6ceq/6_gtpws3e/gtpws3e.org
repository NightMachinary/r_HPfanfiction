I second the rec of The Pureblood Pretense, that's a great series.

If you don't mind outright guardian Snape (and self recs) I have a Slytherin female Harry series where she is adopted by Snape pretty early on. It's a completely gen series, no romance, and it starts in the first year.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

The Like None Other series also has a guardian Snape (though Gryffindor Harry) and starts in the sixth year. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]
