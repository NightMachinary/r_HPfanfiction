If you're ok with older fics that were started pre HBP, I recommend Harry Potter and the Enemy Within and its sequel, HP and the Chained Souls. They work together and develop a mutual trust and respect, but don't always get along. It's a natural sequel to OotP and one of the few that doesn't have to rewrite pre existing canon to make it work. There's little to no romance and absolutely no Harry/Snape. Linkffn(3417954)

The Pureblood Pretense and it's sequels are awesome, you should totally read those as well!
