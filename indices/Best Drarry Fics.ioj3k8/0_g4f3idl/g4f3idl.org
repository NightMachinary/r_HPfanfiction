Endrina has great Drarry fics. My favorite are linkao3(The secret language of plants) and linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum). I also loved linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run). I haven't reread this one in a while, so I don't know if it aged well, but I really enjoyed linkffn(Smoke and Mirrors by pcp). Finally, this one was an old fave of mine about post-Hogwarts life. It was written in early 2005 so before Half-Blood Prince was released. Linkffn(And So Life Goes On).

I hope you enjoy!

Edited to add: these fics are all complete.
