linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356) has Harry helping explain magic to Hermione's grandmother.

linkffn(Memorium by aesop) is a story about the consequences of obliviation in the muggle world.

linkffn(Nanoha Takamichi and the School of Magic by Ryvaken Lucius Tadrya) is a crossover with Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, and has Dumbledore "recruiting" Nanoha and Fate after they have a run-in with British obliviators.

linkffn(You're My Density by RobSt) has Hermione introducing magic to Harry, who had his magic bound and was obliviated after his trial for underage magic.

linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream) is a nice, if unfinished, cross with Sherlock and involves Sherlock and John being introduced to magic by Hermione.

For a humorous take on it, try linkffn(Who Needs Obliviators? by Drauchenfyre).
