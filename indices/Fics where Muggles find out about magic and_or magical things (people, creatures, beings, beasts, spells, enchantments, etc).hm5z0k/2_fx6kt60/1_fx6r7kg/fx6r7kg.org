Nice variety of fics - always fun when you can get a Robst AND a Bobmin rec in there. :D

Also, I googled it and that anime sounds utterly ridiculous - 'a nine year old girl gains magical powers from an interdimensional wizard in the form of a ferret' sounds like the greatest crack!fic ever. :D

Thanks for the recs!
