We do not know of which law was used for inheritance in HBP as it was Dumbledore who informed Harry without an official Will Reading with Harry present. And we know that the Ministry can have an influence over those matters with the Will Reading of Albus Dumbledore by the Minister himself. We also learn that there are enchantements to direct the inheritance of some entitlements in some families in HBP. For the Potter Family, we can only question why for a family that is supposed to be richer that the Weasleys, their Home is of the same class that those the Weasley Clan have as shell cottage for ex. We can only speculate that maybe the family did have a manor but lost it for war reasons ? And it is obvious that the house at Godric's Hollow has been seized for public purpose by the Ministry . But as it is a moot point we can only desolate that the Potter Heir is lacking a backbone where it would be good.
