Did they really though? Canonically, there was no real point in going after Harry until the time they actually did in book 7. His foothold on the government wasn't secure enough. An extra two months to secure the foothold and a guarantied time and place the main chunk of his actual enemies would be is a pretty tempting reason to not attack until they did.

Because let's be real, he had enough spies and moles in the ministry to get the address. How hard would it be to "buy" Harry from his abusive muggle relatives? Or just fiendfyre the block? Or wait for him to leave the house? The opportunity has been there since the end of book 4. And those guards were useless for anything besides an early warning system. That probably wouldn't work anyway if they were offed fast enough. Or Fletcher was on duty.

The whole "protections" on privet drive were one big plothole and chekov's gun.

Hell, JKR could have had Voldie and crew attack at the start of vacation and get repulsed by the protections. And then have canon go on as usual, saying Voldie and crew needed a few months to recover.

BOOM! Chekov's gun resolved and actually sounds interesting.
