Yeah, but this is only if we consider Harry caring about legalities. Unless we consider Dumbledore using an object to keep tabs on Harry all the time (fandom only) he frankly has no way of knowing for sure where Harry is, even if Mrs.. Figgs notices he's not there and tells him which we don't have any idea of how she would go about this. Dumbledore is not at his office at all times and has to many important jobs to be able to just drop everything to search for Harry when it's perfectly possible that he is just going to spend some days playing tourist at London or something of the kind, or even just going to a quadrich game without someone who would even thing of telling him.
