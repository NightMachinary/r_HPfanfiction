The Daily Prophet is not actually owned by the ministry, we can see it when they do reveal they Voldemort is back at the end of OotP instead of trying to ignore the event so Fudge can keep his job, so they could send the DMLE, but the prophet would give them problems. At HBP we also get told by Dumbledore that the trace can only say if a child uses magic without an adult nearby, we don't actually know if it can tell the place the child is at or how it works, in no moment we are told what exactly Dumbledore can or can't do with his position of Chef Warlock, so he could be anything from the true de facto leader of the magical world to only being able to offer council to the Wizengamont, that we also only know that preside over some trials. Dumbledore is actively trying to hide the prophecy, so no way would he let this information slip. And that is assuming he don't chose to just go to another country and seek asylum if the ministry try to force him to go back.
