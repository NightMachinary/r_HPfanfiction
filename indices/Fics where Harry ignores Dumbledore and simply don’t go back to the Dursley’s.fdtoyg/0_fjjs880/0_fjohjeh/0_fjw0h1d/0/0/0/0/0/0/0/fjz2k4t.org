Dumbledore knew perfectly of the abuse , he admits it himself in his office after Sirius died in OOTP. Dumbledore was in Favor of Second chance and of reconciliation between the Light and Dark when Voldemort body was destroyed. Dumbledore did know of Sirius innocence as caster of the fidelius and the blood protection was too important for Risking Sirius refusal as Primary Guardian of Harry. So he didn't stop Crouch when the Director of DMLE whisked him to Azkaban without due process. And he has know of what the prophecy really meant as in four year Dumbledore was triumphant that Voldemort used Harry blood. Dumbledore did plan everything from the very beginning as a true chess master.
