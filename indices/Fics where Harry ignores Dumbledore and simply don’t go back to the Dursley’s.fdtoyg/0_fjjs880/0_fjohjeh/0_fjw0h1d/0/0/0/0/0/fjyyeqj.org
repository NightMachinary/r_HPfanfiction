The Daily Prophet told of Voldemort return because Fudge himself admitted to himself his error and permitted it because he knows the he isn't a Minister for War time and knew basically that no matter what he would take the fall. And we can see by the slander that the Ministry has control of the Daily Prophet. In case National Security, that prophecy would not have to be revealed because Dumbledore is part of the Government, he doesn't need to justify the why, he just need to declare on his honor that it is important for national security or Wizarding Security.
