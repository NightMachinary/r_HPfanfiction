I was not speaking of them as Lords in the Wizengamot, as those seat are on selection by some members of the Ministry as the Minister himself who appears to have huge influence over the selection. The Department Heads of the Ministry are all purebloods . And of course there is the famous Sacred Twenty-Eight of Pureblood Directory. A lot of those that escaped prosecution are members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight so we can say that the public would be in hysteria if a great member of those 28 were sent to Azkaban. Yes it is only a private book but in a closed society it may very well be as important as those members of Wizengamot. I also wanted to say that Witanamot is a Council of nobles in the England of Old. Sirius reaction would not be important as he is in Azkaban and Dumbledore can very well organise his discovery by the aurors if he so much as breath incorrectly. Sirius is an escaped prisoner of Azkaban he may very well be considered as Wolf Head by Wizarding Britain and we do not listen to Azkaban prisoners. I do not speak of Alpha Beta and Omega as dynamics but as character personality, Remus has a submissive personality in canon as their is none of the backbone a werewolf is supposed to posses. And he could have sent a letter between Harry 7 years old to 11 years old. He could have inquired to Petunia how the orphaned son of his best friend was faring. No he listened to Dumbledore wishes to isolate Harry at the Dursleys and from the wizarding world. Please those so called protection of the Stone were all studied in first year, Dumbledore could have protected the stone with challenges that only aurors could have a chance of success. It is obvious it is a way to test Harry and see how he would react to a confrontation between him and his parents murderer. He wanted to see if Harry would be a Savior as the prophecy dictated or a coward or worse someone who would be enthralled by the Dark Lord power. It is obvious when Dumbledore tell them as soon as he stepped outside Hogwarts he had the sensation that his place was at Hogwarts a secret ward perhaps ? Does Hogwarts has some lesson in wizarding customs for the Muggleborns ? As Headmaster of Hogwarts it is he that decide of the Curriculum orientation. He doesn't need funding for wizarding customs at least.
