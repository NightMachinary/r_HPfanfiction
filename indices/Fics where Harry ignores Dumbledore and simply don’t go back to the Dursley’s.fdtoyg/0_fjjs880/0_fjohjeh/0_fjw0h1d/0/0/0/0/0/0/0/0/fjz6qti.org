Ok, all of this is fandom. If Dumbledore knew about Sirius he and Remus would probably be very at odds with Dumbledore. Yes, he is in favor of second chances (Draco) but he also knew Voldemort wasn't dead and that many of the DE would return to his service, so if he was really playing chess-master it would make more sense if he garantes they went to Azkaban, or at least the mos important ones like Lucius, that he didn't and Lucius managed to bribe his way out of prison proves that he is not the be all end all of politics at the ministry. Dumbledore only said that he was condemning Harry to ten dark and hard years, it could be him talking about him not knowing about magic or that he thought the Dursley's wouldn't truly love him but didn't think they would became outright abusive. An frankly the way lots of people make Dumbledore near Omniscient is kind of annoying, yes he could possibly know more than he normally would if he used legilimens indiscriminately as some stories show, but nowhere near the extension people try to make it, we don't know what would consist of Dark magic, if it's something inherently about the magic or only a legal restriction, neither do we know if Dumbledore had anyway of knowing what happens at Hogwarts using wards, so all of this is only fandom, for him to be able to manipulate the events from the very begging he would need to have this kind of information. The thing about being happy Voldemort used the blood can be explained with him suspecting the horcrux and wanting Harry to survive or even him just being happy Harry managed to escape Voldemort even without the blood protection. Manipulative Dumbledore is only suspected at cannon, it can bring some interesting points in fanfics if well written, but we have no way of confirming it in canon. Yes, it would answer lots of plot-holes, but JKR was trying to write a story about Harry's life, so many things are just waved and later, if someone asks, maybe given an excuse. The magical world is almost only the background of the adventure instead of being something made to have consistence, she is telling a story, not trying to become the next Tolkien or GRR Martin with in world-budding. This is something that seems to happen frequently with Dumbledore and lots of adults because they are characters that could easily solve many problems and she needs for further parts of the story but at the moment they need to be on the background, hence Mcgonagal dismissing their warnings at PS and lots of Dumbledore's actions. In the end it is an story first thought for kids and that in the end found much more success and a much more critical public than it was intended at the start
