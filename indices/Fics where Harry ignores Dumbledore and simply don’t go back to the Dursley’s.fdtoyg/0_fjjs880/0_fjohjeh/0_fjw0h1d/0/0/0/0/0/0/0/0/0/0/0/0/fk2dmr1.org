disprovedMost of this is actually fandom, yeah there were rich pureblood families among the DE, but it wasn't all of them, McNair and Greyback for example, and not all of them are in Voldemort's side, while we don't have an exact account of the Potters family wealth we know by Pottermore that they are at least wealth, and many others are show to at least oppose Voldemort, like the Bones and Longbottons, furthermore, in no moment was it said that the government has its base in a hereditary system, the whole Lord and Houses trope is fandom. The whole Alfa, Beta, Omega dynamics is even more fandom in the context that there is literally nothing cannon that comes even close of even suggesting such a thing and it being disproved in real world by scientists, Remus is a person, and thus functions and thinks like a person, if he discovered that Dumbledore was responsible for one of his best friends losing 12 years in hell-on-earth he would get angry, debt or no debt, and again, you are focusing on Remus and forgetting Sirius who would have the strongest reaction. Frankly I think the reason he never wrote to Harry is because JKR only created him at PoA, but for the sake of an argument he could very well decided not to send him letters because he was too young to read them before Hogwarts or because Petunia would get angry, or even because he didn't want to talk with him, Harry was 15 months when they could have last seem each other, not much time for them to bond that strongly, and he was friend with Harry's parents, not Harry himself, maybe he just had no reason to write, you can't expect every friend of James and Lily to decide to take a central role on Harry's life. Yeah, there is the mirror, but Harry has no idea of knowing it would be there, even if he decided to ignore Dumbledore's warning and seek it again. He literally had no way of knowing Quirel was possessed by Voldemort, and if he knew he could have killed him, the idea of making it a test don't make sense, what exactly would he even test. And we don't actually see Dumbledore's political moves, so he potentially could have helped the muggleborns.
