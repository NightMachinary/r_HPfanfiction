I have to agree at him not being innocent and focusing in the greater good, if nothing else the Fantastic Beasts proves this. But really, if we take out Quirell at PS Harry loses any motivation to go looking for the philosophers stone, unless you mean to say that Harry would steal it for himself without Quirel, which goes against his character. Yeah, Remus owns much to Dumbledore, but he also owns much to the marauders, with whom he is closer, beside having a powerful sense of justice, and even if Remus followed Dumbledore Sirius certainly wouldn't knowing Dumbledore willing let him rot in Azkaban. Your argument about him peaching about second chances is incompatible with his supposed actions in keeping Sirius in prison while he was innocent. The idea of Lucius-Oh-of-course-I-will-let-you-search-my-home-let-me-just-give-this-horcrux-to-the-daughter-of-a-political-opponent being one of the more acceptable DE is frankly laughable, if it weren't for his support Voldemort's second raise wouldn't have any close to the success it had. Prisons also only works to toughen the prisoners if it isn't a prison the implements mental torture in regular basis(take for example Al Capone after staying in Alcatraz) the DE wouldn't be toughened up, the majority would probably just die sooner or later, and even the ones who didn't would be very weakened, take Sirius for example and them consider that he got out before Voldemort's resurrection and was protected from the worst of it by his animagus form. Or Dumbledore is manipulative and has power over basically everything in England, but so grossly incompetent his attempts of using this power frankly wouldn't have worked, or he isn't manipulative and is just trying to make the best of the situations with the very realistic politics power levels he actually has.
