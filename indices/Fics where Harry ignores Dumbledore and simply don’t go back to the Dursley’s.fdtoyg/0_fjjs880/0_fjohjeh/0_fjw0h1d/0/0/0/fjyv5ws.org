Well We can formulate the hypothesis that the Trace can track under-age wizards but emit an alert when the conditions set by the law are triggered. And so the DMLE could simply consult their instruments to know where he is. The Daily Prophet is controlled by the Ministry, Dumbledore as Chier Warlock of the Wizengamot could simply order the home life of Harry Potter to be classified. This sort of information can be maintained under wraps. And we could emit the hypothesis that Harry Potter Home life is essential to a prophecy that have an influence over the security of the wizarding community. A Government can do many things in the name of national security. As the saying goes Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges.
