Yes I will agree with you on the plot points that everything seems to be forced like the adults general incompetence to avoid such events . McGonagall was right to dismiss them because the gauntlet of the Philosopher Stone was designed with a first year education , it was an obvious set up. I can only conclude that Dumbledore wanted to test Harry. It couldn't be a trap for Tom because it needed to be more believable and so very much more hardcore. You forgets that Remus basically owns very much to Dumbledore and so would never believe Albus to be so underhanded. Lucius Malfoy , DE he may be but he is the more acceptable of them all and one of the more likely candidates for redemption so Dumbledore wouldn't sentence him to Azkaban. And better to preach peace that harden them in Azkaban and create more problems when irrevocably they escape the prison. So I would argue that Dumbledore is not the epitome of innocence, he is a politician and a war tactician versed in the Greater Good.
