Again, this is assuming Dumbledore even has that kind of power over the government, we don't actually know for sure what Dumbledore can or can't do as part of the government, yes he was able to save Snape from Azkaban, but was unable to put all the Death Eaters in Azkaban or get Sirius declared innocent even with testimonies about it, again, he could be the dictator of the British magical world or he could be the guy who watches over the wizengamont to prevent them from killing each other in the middle of a meeting but who can't actually take any decisions. Yes, Fudge admits that Voldemort's back, but almost no one heard him, if he really was in control of the press it wouldn't matter, we also have no way of knowing if he resigned to escape the war, he would really only need to give the DMLE carte blanque, the minister is not actually necessarily someone good at combat or who even understands war strategy.

And all of this is assuming Dumbledore is the version who knows about Harry's home-life and do nothing, there is the possibility that he just don't know. The Dursley's were able to hide Harry's abuse from the neighbors for years, they could have made Mrs. Figgs think it wasn't so serious and Dumbledore would have no way of knowing unless he went personally to check, and he have an excuse for not doing so by how busy he is.
