Yes but only Dumbledore could remove Quirrel from the castle as he is a teacher. And you forget the incentive of the Mirror of Erised. Remus never visited Harry nor written any letters to him , for a link towards the marauders son it is fickle. Remus was basically the Omega with Sirius as Beta and James as Alpha in their group. He lost all and listened to Dumbledore as he is submissive in essence. And you forget that the wizarding Britain would have not survived if all of the DE were sent to Azkaban as their are basically the Heads ans heirs of very prominent old and rich families that are the fondation of the Ministry. The public would never accept that their superiors in the ladder are guilty. Dumbledore has never done anything to ease the Muggleborns into the wizarding way of life, he only worked towards smoothing the differences of the two worlds. Why all of this is never affirmed in the canon, it is so heavily hinted that you can't not see it.
