And again, for this to be effective it would need the DMLE being able to track him down, which not only is just fandom but also create lots of plot-holes. We know that the trace can't track him if there are magical adults around and this is not even considering that he could go to another country and thus putting all kinds of red-tape on any attempt of bringing him back. Then we also have problem of the daily prophet discovering about his abuse (the second book makes it clear that at least sometimes it became physical) and this would make Dumbledore and the ministry at least reluctant to press charges if they knew, or excuse him of any crime to get away if they didn't.
