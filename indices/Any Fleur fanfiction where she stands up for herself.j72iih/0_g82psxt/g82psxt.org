At beginning of HBP, none of them knew Fleur's real character. They and Molly all assumed she was some kind of dizzy airhead. Fleur herself didn't give up an exactly good impression (for us readers too). She put down Hogwarts, treated Ginny like a child, and kept calling Harry "leetle boy" and "silly boy". Harry himself was fuming.

I would say Fleur handled their animosity very gracefully in canon. Then during Astronomy Tower Battle, when she finally showed her true self, their attitude changed immediately. That's IMO the best way she could stand up for herself.
