#+begin_quote
  Sirius broke out of Azkaban a month before Harry's eleventh birthday. After finding Harry at the Dursely's he realized that Harry has social anxiety, so he became Harry's service dog. Keeping what he really is is harder than he thought it would be as Sirius accompanies Harry to Hogwarts. Especially when it becomes clear that Harry has a knack for getting into trouble.
