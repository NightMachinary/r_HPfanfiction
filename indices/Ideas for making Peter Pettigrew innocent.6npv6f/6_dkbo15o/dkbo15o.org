What if Peter wasn't guilty? What if someone was handed the password on a piece of paper and then dropped the paper from their pocket while looking for a key?

Peter stays a pet rat to watch over Harry at the Dursleys. This way the confrontation with Sirius could happen differently, or the same.

What if in Sirius' despair he accuses Peter of betraying the potters, and Peter has no clue what he's talking about? What if Sirius loses it and attacks Peter in a muggle area and one of the spells hits a gas pipe? Peter transforms and runs away from him but the damage is done. Sirius believes one thing, Peter doesn't know who the traitor was but Sirius just attacked him, and thus goes into hiding to protect this innocent baby who's left of his friends, and Remus is still adrift in the world being a lone wolf.
