If you're interested, I could recommend Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban.

It's one of the earliest and most influential Harry Potter fics out there, you'd be surprised how many other fanfics use the ideas it introduced. Dementors, Patroni, characters like Lupin and Sirius, unregistered animagi, Ministry corruption/incompetence, time travel, prophecies, the Knight Bus...

Actually, I find that a lot of people consider the various elements from the story canon when it comes to Harry Potter fanfiction. It's a good read, and I'd highly recommend it if you want more guilty Peter Pettigrew.
