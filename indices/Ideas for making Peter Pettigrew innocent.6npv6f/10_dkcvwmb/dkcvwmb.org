Here's the easiest way: Sirius Black betrayed the Potters.

Now it just becomes an exercise in deciding why Peter decided to live as a rat for over a decade. Here are some ideas:

- Paternity suit. He's going to wait 18 years (well, 17 in the WW, I guess) until he resurfaces.
- He has inoperable cancer in a part of his body that rats don't have.
- Rat sex is crazy good.
- He's kind of a shitty wizard and couldn't work the spell to transform back.
