Possibly because even despite the end of the war, he was afraid of being targeted for assassination again?

Or maybe he was just embarrassed/heartbroken/whatever-the-right-word-is at not being able to warn James and Lily in time, and was too afraid to seek out Lupin/Dumbledore etc to tell them what happened?

Or perhaps, as a surprisingly large number of fanfics seem to do, he suspected that if he showed up miraculously alive with a (unwilling) Dark Mark on his arm, people would accuse him of blowing up the muggles and wilfully betraying James & Lily?
