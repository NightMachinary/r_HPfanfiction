I can never remember if Peter is marked or not, but I do suspect that the dark mark would have additional qualities beyond being a sort of ugly tattooed pager for evil.

I like Peter best when he is explored beyond cartoonish cowardice. How did he, someone who is looked down on as not being very powerful or brave, get noticed by Voldemort? Was it just the company he kept? I wonder if Snape had anything to do with it - he knew who Peter's friends were and he totally fucking hated them all. Using Peter to get to them probably wouldn't be that hard. I am not saying this makes Peter innocent, but I wonder how he was manipulated (if he was).
