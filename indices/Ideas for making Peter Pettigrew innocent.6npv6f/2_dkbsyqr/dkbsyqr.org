I always thought he blew up the street by hitting a gas line, or he led Sirius somewhere he'd previously set up with explosives.

As a rat owner, I dislike how he's portrayed as being a stereotypical cowardly, traitorous rat. Rats are loyal, and brave.

I want to write one where his time spent as a rat changes him in a good way, and he's a good, loyal pet. We only saw one glimpse of this, when he bit Goyle. I suppose cowardly Peter was too afraid to draw attention to himself by being a cool pet, which is why he pretended to sleep all the time. I'd like to write one where joining the Death Eaters was a mistake he repented of, like Snape, but he never had the chance/courage to turn back. Then after outed in book three, he doesn't run back to Voldemort.

I have written one where Peter joined the Death Eaters because he believed they would win anyway, and he wanted to earn protection for his friends, and that he asked for James to be spared like Snape asked for Lily. (Voldemort lied)
