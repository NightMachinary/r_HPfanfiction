For point 3, I'd like to state that, as we know, desperation can, at times, increase the power of spells (see super-Patronus near the end of PoA for one example). While normally Peter may be unable to cast such a spell, he believes that Sirius has come to kill him; his plight might have inadvertently overpowered the spell.

I've also seen a couple fics where, during the scuffle, a spell hit a gas main, which naturally caused an explosion. So while it's not /wrong/ to say that a single spell killed 12 muggles, it didn't do so /directly/.
