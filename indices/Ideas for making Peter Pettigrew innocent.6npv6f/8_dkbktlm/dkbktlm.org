linkffn(6008512) A butterfly effect has one of my favorite readings for Sirius tracking down Peter. I don't want to copy and paste it verbatim, but it starts in the chapter from here: Sirius threw himself down an alley

It actually is similar to (one of) your suggestion, he was captured and mind read to learn of the fidelus, then tortured until he broke and told. I rally do recommend reading that passage, it is just beautifully done.
