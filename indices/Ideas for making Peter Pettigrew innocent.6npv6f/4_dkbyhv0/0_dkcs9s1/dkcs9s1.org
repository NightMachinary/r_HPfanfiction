That reminds me, I did think of an idea once where Peter's finger was cut off during his torture, and maybe he was later Imperius'd to blow up the street and frame Sirius.

If for whatever reason the Imperius failed at that moment (because right after doing a horrible thing is the best time, dramatically speaking), he might have left the finger behind to try and clue people in to the truth, but everyone mistook it for him being vaporized instead.
