Rather than Sneak for snake what if stake.

Tom Riddle stared at the stake in the back of the dead vampire. He plucked the rowan wooden stake from the creature. The vampire slowly turned to ash while Tom inspected the stake.

Surprisingly, that gypsy prophet was correct. A wooden stake may keep him alive. Perhaps there is something to Divination. Luckily, his wandless magic is more than enough to levitate the thing from his bag and hit the blood sucker that pinned him when he was caught off gaurd.

Going to Albania to get Rowena's Diadem to make a horcrux seemed counter intuitive if you get killed by vampires to get it. It's best to play safe.

What is worse than being killed by a vampire is to be turned into one. vampires have no soul therefore in the event he does survive the initial bite all his effort to get immortality will be traded for a defective one. What's the sense of being immortal when you have a lot of condition keep on living. In his opinion, vampirism is not a true immortality but an Affliction not to mention a filthy half breed.

Tom turned to the poor local tour guide that fainted after pissing their pants. The filthy squib knew this area is infested but lead him here. Probably as an offering for the filthy halfbreed.

" This dirt tried to sacrifice him to false immortal. Well then, I'll sacrifice him for a true immortal, Me." Tom monologued.

--------------

As Tom traveled back to England with he wondered where he should hide his horcrux. Not that anyone will figure out what those are. Honestly this stake is the only deliberate horcrux.

"I do have that stupid Diadem spider that dropped down the ceiling when i was transfering soul. All my horcruxes are turning into nonsensical things. Honestly, why is a quiditch ring in a girls toilets. If I knew how hard to Steer a soul I would have moved the diary closer before it flew into the bloody thing. Then there's the dairy bottle beside my stupid father when he died. The No. 1 Mom mug near Hephzibah, a random bucket, now a stake" Tom pursed his lips, incredibly annoyed. "At least its not a random person."

Years laters....

"Harry Potter, I can now touch you ...... Wait! Is that-" Voldemort pulled back another errant soul piece has latched on a thing he didn't want it to latch. 'bloody hell!'

Horcruxes: dairy, ring(quidditch), Diadem(spider), mug, bucket, stake.
