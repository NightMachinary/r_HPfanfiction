Hm. Jean was made canon by JKR in the 7th book or so, but she said in an interview a few years earlier that it was Jane. I tend to go with the earlier one, and besides, "Jane" feels a bit more normal and less unique than Jean, even though both are common names. I just think it serves to humanise Hermione more.
