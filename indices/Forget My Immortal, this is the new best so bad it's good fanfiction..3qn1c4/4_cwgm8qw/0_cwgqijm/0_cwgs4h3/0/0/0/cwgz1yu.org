Harry quickly thumbed through his copy of /Wanderings with Werewolves/ until he found the picture that Lavender mentioned. As the color drained from his face, he wordlessly passed the open book over to Ron, calmly removed and folded his glasses, and slammed his head into his desk with a resounding crack. Fortunately for him, he narrowly avoided the attention of his classmates by Draco Malfoy loudly protesting being 'volunteered' to play the part of the werewolf in Lockhart's reenactment.

"Let go of me! Don't you know who I am? You wait until my father hears of this, then we'll see who's left wearing the leash!"

Miles away in his personal study, Lucius Malfoy had to stop polishing his cane long enough to remove his ascot and undo the top two buttons of his shirt, which had suddenly become uncomfortably tight for some reason.

After watching his best mate flop bonelessly to the floor, Ron visibly steeled himself before slowly turning to stare at the picture in front of him. /Why does he keep taking his shirt off?/ he wondered to himself.

Several seconds passed before Ron's eyes lit up with realization. "So this is why Percy loves this book so much! I've always wondered..." Noticing Dean trying to peer over his shoulder, Ron obligingly moved to give him a better view.

Dean took one look at the picture and reared back in shock.

"Get it now, mate?" Ron said. "There's no way that ponce could've beat this guy in a wrestling match, no matter how much mud he said there was! If you ask me, I figure we're dealing with some kinda succubus or something."

"Incubus," Hermione muttered absently before turning to the drooling blonde next to her. "Who knew that pelvic thrusting could be so useful against a werewolf!"

"It certainly seemed effective," Lavender replied as she watched a disheveled and shaking Draco Malfoy return to his seat. "I wonder if it'll be on the O.W.L.?"

Meanwhile, as he lay unconscious and bleeding on the floor, Harry Potter found himself in the middle of a very peculiar dream that would later have him wondering if he might actually love Hedwig a little /too/ much.
