As Lockhart continued regaling the class with his battle against the Wagga Wagga Werewolf, Ron shook himself out of his shock and leaned over to an equally horrified looking Harry.

"Mate," he whispered, "now it could be I'm just seeing things, but from here I could swear it looks like..."

"He is," Harry interrupted. "I see it too. I'm waiting until his back is turned so I can hopefully make it out of the room and get help."

Ron nodded. "Good idea, you're faster than I am. If he notices anything I'll try and hold him off, maybe give some the others a chance to escape too."

Harry shot Ron a startled look. "Are you sure? There's no shame in running, you know. Just because you're a Gryffindor doesn't mean you have to sacrifice yourself like that."

Ron's eyes narrowed as he watched the defense professor begin acting out his climactic showdown with the fearsome werewolf who apparently spoke in a high, feminine shriek. "I know that, mate. But what kind of Gryffindor would I be if I left the rest of our friends to be taught by a man wearing that much body glitter?"
