She's not really that insane - that idea emerged mostly after Helena Bonham Carter's exaggerated portrayal in the films. Canon Bellatrix doesn't sing, jump up and down or run on the tables. She knows perfectly well what's going on around her. She's a bit unhinged and has serious anger issues, but besides that, she appears quite sane.

Whatever you like CC or not it is a known canon fact that she has hots for Voldy. It is clearly shown in the Deathly Hallows book, where she "longs for his closeness", "speaks as if to a lover", looks at him with "worshipful fascination", pants whenever he's nearby... Yeah, it's pretty blatant. It's a lot less obvious in the films where for some reason she seems very flirtatious in general - which, may I add, is completely different from book Bellatrix's behaviour.

As for the Blacks, I don't recall them being particularly insane. Not more than other pure-blood families (sans the Weasleys). The Gaunts are much more freaky than the Black family.
