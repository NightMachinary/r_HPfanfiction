1) As other said before, she had a little of issue but "insanity" (as in the legal term) was not among them.

2) I'm not even sure we can call this "flirtatious". You can "sense" her adoration for Voldemort (like in the way she looked at him, or how she was talking in his presence), but yet she always stayed extremely respectfull, calling him "My Lord" and keeping some distance. The only time she fails is after Voldemort kills Harry when she calls to him "/as if he was a lover/". On this point their relation is totally one of Master/ Servant than true lover (even if admitting CC existed).

3) I don't really know where the "black familly madness" comes from (probably Walburga portrait, plus Bellatrix and to a lesser extent Sirius). But the house elf heads was never really comented in Canon, we know Sirius had a profond distate for it (like the rest of the house), that Hermione consider it barbaric, and that Kreature, as the elves serving the Black before him, consider it as the highest honor.

In the end I don't think the Black family was really "mad", extremely bigoted yes, maybe some issues from inbreding (they did seem to die young), but not mad. Most of them (Narcissa, Andromeda or even Regulus) seemed fine, and the only 3 that could be presented as crazy are Bellatrix, Sirius and Walburga. 2 of them have the excuse of years in Azkaban, and Walburga was only one person, and could have been different when she was alive (not to mention the theories about the Horcruxe corrupting the house).
