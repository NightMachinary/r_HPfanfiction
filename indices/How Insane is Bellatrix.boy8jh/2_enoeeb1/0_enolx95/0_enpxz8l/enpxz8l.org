I think it's the same for most of the "loyal" Death Eater that went to Azkaban for him, Barty Crouch also gave a similar vibe. Honnestly, it is just that line of Bellatrix calling to his master "/as if he was a lover"/ the blure the line a little in her case. But even if she had some "feelings" for him, doesn't change that she is a fanatic and him a cult leader.
