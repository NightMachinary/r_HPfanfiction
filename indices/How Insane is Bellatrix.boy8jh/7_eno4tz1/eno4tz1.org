1. Before or after Azkaban? And what do you mean by insane? Somebody who tortures two other human beings to insanity (and once more Hermione, not to insanity, Dobby stops her, but enough, so that we have no doubts) is plenty insane for me.
2. I don't think there is any clear innuendo or something, but yes she is hitting (in the chapter 1 of DH and then in the end in the Forbidden Forest) on Moldieshort quite hard.
3. Probably none. Both her and Sirius were a bit mad ... but that doesn't have to be a family trait. Twelve or fourteen years in Azkaban does it for you just fine.
