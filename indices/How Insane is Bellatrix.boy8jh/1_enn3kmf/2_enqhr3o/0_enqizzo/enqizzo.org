That's not mental illness though, is it? It's a personality disorder. And, bluntly, the level of subordination to Voldemort and the hot-blooded behaviour she displays both /aren't/ psychopath traits. Antisocial Personality Disorder /might/ work, but again, there's that adherence to a goal external to herself. You could make the argument that measured against the culture in which she was raised, she's perfectly mentally healthy with a socially-conforming personality. It's just that that culture is morally obnoxious and a /fine/ argument for heavy-handed cultural imperialism on the William Henry Sleeman model.

(My own headcanon is that she's the one Death Eater who really was enthralled in some way. That personality she displays is /not/ natural, especially coming from a family that produced a refined society lady (and loving, if not healthily nurturing, mother) and a teenage rebel who eloped with her schooldays sweetheart.)
