She's not legally insane: she fully understands the nature and quality of her actions.

She doesn't come off as mentally ill much, either; gleefully murderous, cheerfully violent, bigoted even by the prevailing standards of bigotry and fanatically devoted to Voldemort. You /might/ make a case for a touch of hypomania when she's got the prospect of a fight in front of her, but that could just be an attempt to /provoke/ her opponent to get a fight going. (The desire to get in a fight could also be suicidal ideation, something like the warrior-culture ideal of seeking a beautiful death. Which makes it /entirely/ appropriate that she gets surprise-ganked by a maternally outraged housewife.)

She's entirely rational, just reasoning from absurd premises to morally objectionable conclusions.
