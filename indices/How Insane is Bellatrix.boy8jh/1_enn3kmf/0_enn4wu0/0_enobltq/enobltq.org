Canon don't really show the effects of Azkaban on wizards though. We never really saw "how" the wizards where before Azkaban (except limited scenes like the Lestranges and Crouch trial), so we can't really judge how it changed them.

Yet, all the Wizards we saw that went into Azkaban were at least functional once inside. They look like shit, but they all seem to do the job.

Also Sirius said himself that the knowledge he was innocent helped him cope with the prison, since it was not an happy thought and Dementor couldn't take it away. Make me wonder if the adoration of the Death Eater for Voldemort, and the belief that they are cleaning the world didn't help them.
