Yes!! Thank you, this is the quality answer/analysis I was looking for. Even distinguishing between legal sanity and mental ilness... you've brought a single tear to my eye.

But yeah, agreed. All her cutesy taunts and sneers come across as more calculated to provoke than just someone ranting and raving.

Thanks for the thought-provoking response.
