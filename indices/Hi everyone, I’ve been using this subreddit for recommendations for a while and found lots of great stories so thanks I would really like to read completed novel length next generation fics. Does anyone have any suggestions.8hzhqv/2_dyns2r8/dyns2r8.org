One that I'm reading right now is "Pieces: A Story Cycle" by Realmer06.

Each chapter is a character profile of one of the next generation kids. Although you could call it a collection of stories instead of a novel, it's quite well-written and I enjoy how the stories build on each other. It's almost complete, the last chapter was posted a few days ago and we are only waiting for the epilogue.
