I figured, but that was the common one.

On AQ. I loathed the first fic, I really did. The heroine was unlikeable, the supporting characters were stupid or useless, and the teachers were among the most unhelpful individuals ever to grace a page.

But.

The second and third fics are about as good as writing gets. Very different from, but as good as, Rowling's work. The characters are interesting, the plot gripping, the mood dark and uncertain. I only have one other thing where I like it so much I can't bear to experience it all (pushing daisies - I've got three episodes left and I can't bear to watch them . . .) But yeah. It really is that good, and I was dead set against reading it and really did not like the first fic. Hope that helps.
