linkffn(Questions and Answers) is... just great. It isn't technically completed but between this main story and all of the shorts and one-shots attached to it, it may as well be, and it is still updating (albeit quite slowly). I basically consider it canon.

+1 for Hogwarts Houses Divided, another favourite.

Another one that I enjoy: linkffn(Ignite), but it gets a liittle bogged down with too much arcane detail at times. Features the next-gen kids as basically students on a gap year getting in way too deep on everything they look at.
