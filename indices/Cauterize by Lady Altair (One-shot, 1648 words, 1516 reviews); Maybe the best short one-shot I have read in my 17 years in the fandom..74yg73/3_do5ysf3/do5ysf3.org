  The popularity aspect of the collection was a masterfully constructed aspect of the "muted crowd." It really brought the whole piece together. I wonder, why did you decide to ignore Ron and Hermione? I think that in itself made me realize that I don't like this story. This work feels shallow, because it's just a portion of tale, drawing emotion from the story - but the story itself lacks depth.

  My world view just looks different than this, not better, but just more. I took a course on holocaust literature, and this just seems unsophisticated in comparison. I remember waking up to go to school and seeing 9/11 happen. This feels petulant in comparison.

  That all being said, I want to praise you for being able to draw out those comparisons. While not really living up as the sixth best fanfiction, I do believe that people can find something special here if they are looking for it. I thank you for sharing this with us.

This has to be one of the dumbest reviews I've ever read
