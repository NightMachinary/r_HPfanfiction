Yes, it's the only fic I've seen that I think deserves the number of reviews it has and one of the very few that really is of publishable quality.

The only trouble is, it makes me feel hopelessly inadequate as a writer and puts me off even trying. One of these days I'll analyse it to see just what she does that works so well.
