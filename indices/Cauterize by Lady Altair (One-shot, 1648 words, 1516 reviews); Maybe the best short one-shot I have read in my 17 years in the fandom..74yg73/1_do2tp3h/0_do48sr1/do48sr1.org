Hi! Thanks for your kind words about something I wrote such a long time ago - makes me want to go back to my computer and find some time to write!

Don't feel discouraged or inadequate - I remember specifically the heavy cloud of doubt I felt before posting Cauterize. I was sitting in a dorm room thinking 'who the hell wants to read my weird fanon daydream where Charlie and Lavender end up getting married?' before finally just saying 'fuck it, who cares' and uploading it. I had no idea I'd be here almost ten years later, still getting a few emails daily about people favoriting and reviewing.

I think every person who writes feels insecure about what they write - I know I've read other authors with other styles and felt that hopeless 'why do I even bother' feeling. Don't give up!
