You know, the way it's written, I think it could work as a picture book.

If you look closely, every segment, in between line breaks, presents something that could easily be illustrated as a still scene. 17 pages, starting from when Dennis picks up the camera, ending when he puts it down...maybe 2 pages for Draco's bit seeing as it's longer.
