This is probably not what you're looking for because this story is essentially a crossover with Sherlock, but I think you'll be interested anyways.

I made a recommendation post awhile ago for my favorite Sherlock and HP crossover that has both excellent writing and execution. I'll just quote myself here:

  Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

  Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle â€˜aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

  Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.
