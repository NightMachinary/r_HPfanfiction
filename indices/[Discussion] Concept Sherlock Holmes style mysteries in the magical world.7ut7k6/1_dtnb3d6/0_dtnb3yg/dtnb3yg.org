  When Scotland Yard is stumped by the murder of Amelia Bones Sherlock Holmes investigates the seemingly impossible locked room mystery. His conclusion? "They teleported." Seven months later they bump into a trio of teens in a London cafe and John Watson discovers that his friend was perfectly serious. They are now in the thick of the strangest case of the great detective's career.
