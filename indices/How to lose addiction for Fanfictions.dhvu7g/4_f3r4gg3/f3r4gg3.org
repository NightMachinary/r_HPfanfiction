This was me too. I still go through periods where I put off my studies because I'm reading fanfiction, and honestly I can't remember the last time read an actual book. I find it's best to avoid starting new ones, so I start rereading ones I've read before. That way I can actually break away, because the thrill of needing to know what happens is lessened.
