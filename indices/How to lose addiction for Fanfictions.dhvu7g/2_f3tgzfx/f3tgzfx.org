I slowed down the past few months but I used to be about the same. Constantly reading new fanfics and didn't really do much else.

Back in highschool I'd check out 2-3 books on Friday and finish reading them all by Monday. Part of that was because I didn't have anything else to do but the other part was because it let me escape the stress of my life for a few hours and get lost in someone else's life.

Fanfiction only adds to this even more. The Harry Potter universe is an almost limitless world of untapped potential. If you can think of it there's probably a Harry Potter fanfic about it out there. We're all basically familiar with the general world of HP so there's less "Wait who is Amelia Bones?" that you might get reading other books because we all have a good idea of who the characters are and what the world is like. We don't have to rebuild a whole new world in our head with new characters each time we start a new story, that makes it easy to read. And it's fun, taking the same familiar world and people we already know and changing it in some way to bring another new story about.

The problem is that this form of escape is addicting, especially when life is stressful. Forget worrying about studying for finals, I want to see what Slytherin Harry does about Ron's blatant house prejudice. I'll go to sleep after 1 more chapter, wait that's a cliffhanger, I'll just read another chapter. It's an easy way to get trapped.

I don't think the problem you have is necessarily with fanfiction itself, but more you need a healthy way to relieve stress. */Reading countless fanfics is a symptom, not the disease./* It's hard being in college or having a job, and sometimes even spending time with friends is emotionally draining and stressful. What you need to either find an alternative way to relieve stress or a way to balance fanfics with your day to day life.

Setting yourself a strict time when you *will* go to sleep will help some. Drawing up a schedule and saying "I'm allowed to read fanfics from X time to Y time each day" will give you something to look forwards to every day without taking up all your free time the way it is now.
