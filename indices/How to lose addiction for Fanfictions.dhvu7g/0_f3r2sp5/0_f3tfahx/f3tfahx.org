I second this. I will get into FF and it utterly consumes me for a few months, then I find something else to read that I have to binge, but it isn't quite as /voluminous/ as fanfiction, so I can't just commit my whole waking life to it. As you pointed out, reading some higher quality published works really changes your tolerance for poorly written stories.
