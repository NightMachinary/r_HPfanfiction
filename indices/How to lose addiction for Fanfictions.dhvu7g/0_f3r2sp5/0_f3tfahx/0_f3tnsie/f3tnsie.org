You'd be surprised at some of the bad quality published stories out there. Apocalypse themed authors have some very bad habits..some as bad or worse than ff authors. At least ff doesn't have an obsession with spending ten pages describing their military arsenal.

I also now don't waste my time on the ...not so great fanfics. Used to be that I felt the need to finish them, even if they weren't great.
