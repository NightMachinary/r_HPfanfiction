I had this many years ago and dropped entirely out of the FF scene (in a manner of speaking) for over a decade except for re-reading my favorite FF series every once in a blue moon.\\
I found my way out by starting a website where I reviewed Apocalyptic themed books...forced me to read other things besides HP fanfiction. Plus, gave me a new reading obsession for a few years in there.

I've just recently returned to FF in the past few months and I have found that my tolerance for "bad" fanfiction is ....non-existent now, so I'm not finding as many stories I want to invest my time in.

Try picking a new genre of books that isn't in the FF world.
