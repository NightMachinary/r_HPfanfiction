I took 1 day off FF (which was incredibly hard), then a few days later 2 days (ect.) I also put limits on my phone so it'd tell me to stop after a certain amount of time. I also blocked the ff websites and apps I used for it. Then I disconnected my phone from the internet and downloaded some games like Tetris and solitaire and watched YouTube videos so I had something else to distract myself with. I also found putting on podcasts particularly helpful since I could put a podcast on while I was reading and then I'd start listening to the podcast and stop reading. Good luck!
