To my mind, an addiction is anything impacts your quality of life. Based on your description, for you, fanfiction certainly qualifies. There was a time that I was where you are now.

As for how you fight it; you fight it like any other addiction. First, you stop cold turkey. Cut yourself off, block the sites, find people to keep you accountable. Don't read any fanfiction for at least 30 days. If you find that it's impossible to read other things without reading fanfiction ten minutes later, avoid other reading for that time too. Purge your system.

Then, when you've stopped reaching for your phone or computer every moment, stop and take a look at your life. Decide how much time you reasonably want to spend reading, if any. If the answer is, "This relaxes me; I want to allow up to an hour a day," then good for you. If the answer is, "Never again," then that's okay too. Make the right choice for you, and take your time doing it. Think about other goals in life - are you trying to learn something new or start a new habit that would be more fulfilling? Devote time to that. You can always come back to fanfiction later - it isn't going anywhere.

The real key is to make a resolution and stick to it. Notice the signs if you start to "cheat" on yourself. If you find that you cannot read in moderation, then the only option is total abstinence. Don't mess around with addiction. It's like alcohol - some people can drink socially and be fine. Some can drink but have to watch themselves. And some people simply cannot touch a bottle without ruining their life. Know which kind you are, and do not let yourself cross a line. Don't lie to yourself that you can fix it later - stop early. Do not push your self control.

If you'd like to direct message, I would be happy to help in any way I can.

Good luck.
