This sounds like the real answer, honestly. None of us are experts or know OP personally so we can't say /definitively/, but it does sound like at least one important criterion for addiction is being met (negatively impacting daily functioning). I would second a recommendation for OP to seek out some addiction-related communities and depending on the severity/how much you need to fix this, to seek out professional help.

People can get addicted to anything, depending on the person and circumstances. Substance abuse is what we hear most about just because of how our bodies work, but just because something is not physically ingested doesn't mean your brain can't begin psychologically reinforcing those same reward/pleasure center pathways in a dysfunctional, addictive way.
