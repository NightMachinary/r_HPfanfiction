Have you thought that maybe you're asking the wrong people? If this is actually an addiction, then you might be better off on a subreddit for people dealing with addictions rather than one of people who indulge in said addiction, regardless of whether or not they're actually addicted to it. Edit: Just to be clear, I don't know how well traditional addiction therapy (or whatever) will help with something like this.
