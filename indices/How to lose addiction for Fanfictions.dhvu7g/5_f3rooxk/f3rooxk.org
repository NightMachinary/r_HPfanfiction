I wouldn't call what I have an addiction since I do other things and it rarely delays my sleep, but I found that after reading a really good /actual/ book written by a /real/ author that I realized how crappy most fanfiction is. I still read fanfiction, but I rarely read the crappy variety anymore and don't follow as many new fanfiction. I also now do other things more often.
