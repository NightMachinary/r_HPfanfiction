Okay wowww. Reading the post and all the comments made me realise I have a problem. Now that I think about it fanfiction was and is an escape for me the minute I get anxious, stressed, bored or uncomfortable (pretty much all the time) I would read fanfics even if that means ignoring everyone around me when in a social setting or just to procrastinate.

It's 3:29am here and I have 3 different HP fanfictions that I'm alternating between whenever something I don't like happens in one of the stories I switch to one of the other two.

I always thought it was my phone that was my crutch and that reading fanfictions was just a better way of spending time.

I'm gonna work on this dependency and try reducing the number of fanfics that I read and find another method that's better to deal with my anxiety and need to escape from reality instead of just blocking everything out and becoming dependent on reading, I don't want to call it addiction cause it makes it sound worse.

Also just realised I haven't read an actual legit book like a hard copy for a while now (not counting schoo issued ones used for assignments) I should do that I miss turning the pages and the smell of new books.

Sorry if that didn't make sense im too tired to properly proof check
