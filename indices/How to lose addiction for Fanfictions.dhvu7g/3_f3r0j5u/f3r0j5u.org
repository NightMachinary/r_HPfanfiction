I went through a period in college where (I guess partly because I had to read so much for school) I stopped reading anything but fanfiction, too.

I recommend taking a break from reading entirely for a while, except the studying you have to do for school. Start to think about what you're getting from those stories (for me, I wanted that perfect unattainable romance, so I just kept reading it over and over) and once you identify that, try to find a way for it to fit into your real life. I didn't magically fall in love at that point in my life or anything, but I did learn a lot about how to love myself.

That year, I also listened to Hamilton for the first time, so sometimes a distraction and some distance from your obsession can help you resurface in the real world, too. I also think it would be good for you in more ways than one to try some meditation, either guided meditations online or a meditative yoga class or whatever works for you.
