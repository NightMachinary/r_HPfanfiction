I know what you mean. I went through a phase when I was a student where I was just reading and reading late at night until I didn't realize I had fallen asleep. And then when I woke up I would be in a daze the whole day (from not sleeping right). I realized it was getting bad when I couldn't remember the details of the stories I was reading anymore, which was so unlike when you read an actual book and the details just stick to you. FF was a means of escape for me due to the stresses of school.

What I did was everytime I would finish a story, I would stop and write a "review" about it and post it on my then active Tumblr page. This made me realize how much trash I was reading.

It's been years so I guess, having to deal with real life (work) also forced me to take a good look at what the heck I was doing and decide if I wanted to fix my life or not. I have now significantly lessened the amount of time reading fanfics but I admit that there are just some days where I strongly feel the urge to just go back to my old habits. At least now, I'm better at identifying what triggered me to escape once again and address it.
