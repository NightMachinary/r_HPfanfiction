But Dumbledore didn't believe in the prophecy. He explicitly says this in HBP. He tells Harry he's free to turn his back on the prophecy and that the only reason it even matters at all is because Voldemort thinks so.

Furthermore, he also tells Harry that he can stay dead in DH. If the prophecy was absolutely true, only Harry would be able to finish Voldemort off. But Dumbledore seems perfectly fine with Harry choosing to stay dead.
