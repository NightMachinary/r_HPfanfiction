Definitely messed up, yes. I /would/ call him supremely arrogant and a megalomaniac at the very least.

What I don't get is how low standards some people have regarding good and evil. Or how deluded some people are that they will listen to what is told to them but not /think/ about what they're seeing. Both of this is very applicable to Dumbledore in both canon and fanfiction. For example, I've lost count of the number of stories where Dumbledore has been accessory to child abuse, involved in throwing innocent people in prison or had kept silent when he has proof of innocence and still I'm being told in the story that he's /not/ evil. Just because he wants to defeat Voldemort doesn't make him a good person; his intentions don't make him a good person, if his actions are categorically evil, he's evil no matter what his intentions are.
