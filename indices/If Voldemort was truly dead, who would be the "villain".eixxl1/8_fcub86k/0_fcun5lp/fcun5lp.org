  stuck in the Victorian era. Gave three positions of extreme authority to one person because he defeated one bad guy. Who he knew personally. The same place where its citizens blindly believe a newspaper, no matter how outrageous the contents are.

Honestly you could say more than half of this about a lot of countries today. America included. The President of the US has a fuck load of executive powers they can use. Trump could literally decide to end the world today. And half the world wouldn't even be surprised.

And don't even get me started on the wild shit people believe in because the news or the internet. If anything, Rowling made that part /very/ realistic.

Side note, people didn't know Dumbledore knew Grindelwald personally.
