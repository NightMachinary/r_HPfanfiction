Ummmmm... you did read the canon books, right?

Wizarding Britain: stuck in the Victorian era, has Fudge leading it. Gave three positions of extreme authority to one person because he defeated one bad guy. Who he knew personally. The same place where its citizens blindly believe a newspaper, no matter how outrageous the contents are.

Dumbledore. An actual Evil with a capital E plotting Dumbledore. He made all of those bad decisions in canon because of a self-fulfilling prophecy. What makes you think he would stop because everybody else believes Voldemort to be dead?
