Lucius is the prime candidate. Still believes in blood supremacy, doesn't have the martial might of Voldemort but is maybe even better at uniting the wizarding world towards his vision, given how successful he is at influencing Fudge and the board of governors.

This is a bit more political of a story, catching Lucius in lies and showing people what his real goals are and that Lucius doesn't really have their best interests at heart, while also avoiding plausibly deniable assassination attempts rather than pitched battles.
