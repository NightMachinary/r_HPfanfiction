It depends on the story you want to tell. Within Britain, Malfoy is the most obvious one - it wouldn't take much to have him be a more politically focused Voldemort (with less raw power), and I could certainly see him using both the more malleable death eaters (taking control of them/making his own organization) and the more fanatical (spinning them off/encouraging attacks to give him more political power).

There are other options, of course. You could take certain magical creature factions, and make them start to rise up/agitate more directly. Without Voldemort, for instance, maybe Fenrir Greyback is doing his own thing. Maybe it's Vampires or hags, or all of them - the second class citizens that Magical Britain ignores/hurts.

There's always the option of taking someone or a group from outside the UK, as well. The magical world is woefully underdeveloped - and concocting a volatile geopolitical situation would not be too difficult to put in place for a major magical war/conflict. Same with spillover conflicts - if Britain is stable in this universe, perhaps another nearby one /isn't/, and that could affect the UK directly or indirectly.

A final option that I can think of is some sort of secretive society could provide for a useful villain figure. Maybe it's one dedicated just to their own power, and some of the artifacts left behind by Slytherin/the Founders, Merlin, and Voldemort appeal to them for their power - and they start to move on destabilizing Britain to give them an opening to seize them. Maybe you want to play up a more demonic or eldritch flair that we don't see in standard HP - and make them want to summon an evil demonic entity.

In your case, I think I would lean towards either Malfoy or a group targeting artifacts. You want a bad guy who will come after Harry or Hogwarts, and not be /too/ strong, I'd guess - and both of those would have the desire to do so.
