I don't think it would have remained disorganized. At the end of the day, the real antagonist of the series is the culture itself. The culture of the wizarding world lends itself to creating division within itself. Using classifications such as muggleborn, half-blood, pureblood is within itself divisive. This type of environment will have a demagogue rising up that consolidates this type of mentality to the determinant of the rest of population.

I think the best way to explore this concept is by incorporating political intrigue with the rise of a new leader that consolidates this type of feeling.
