Yeah, my favorite option is Rookwood as well. He has the most potential to be truly dangerous since he was an Unspeakable. Malfoy has money, but c'mon... he lost against dobby when he foolishly tried to Avada Kedavra Harry in Hogwarts (also points out that he isn't that smart and rather emotional - easy to trigger). Malfoy does have some potential due to his connections, but that won't keep him long in power since that type of situation calls for betrayal/corruption. He will never be able to control an organization of dangerous psychos only with money alone - you need to have personal power too.\\
Rookwood should be able to use his knowledge that he gathered in his time as Unspeakable to enhance his strength with rituals/blood-magic/ and who knows what. He also seems more ruthless since he went to Azkaban for his crimes instead of acting like a cowardly victim who was forced against his will. People like this are more dangerous since they are not dependant on their environment (social connections/family/ etc).

My second favorite for a villain would be Fenrir Greyback. He was a stupid brute in the books, but still extremely dangerous. Hive him the brain of Hannibal Lecter or so and magical Britain will drown in blood. That guy is a savage, a psycho and a nefarious sadist, and dreams about a world that is ruled by werewolves. Greyback is the only one besides Voldy who has an agenda. He wants to turn as many people as possible into werewolves and form some kind of army of vicious beasts.
