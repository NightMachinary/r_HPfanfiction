Umbridge, Fudge, Malfoy, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and of course *Barty Crouch Jr* can all be made into credible enemies.

Let's just assume that Barty Sr lost control of Jr at beginning of Year 4, he killed Sr, escaped, and tried to avenge his fallen Dark Lord. He then busted his comrades from Azkaban, and together they could wreck some serious havocs.
