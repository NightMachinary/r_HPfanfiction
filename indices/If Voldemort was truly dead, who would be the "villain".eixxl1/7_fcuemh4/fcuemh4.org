Well... I think Harry deep-down is just a good person, even with a bad upbringing he still had a lot of "moral fibre" in him that makes him avoid antagonism or hurtful behaviour. I don't like the idea of him "snapping" in the way you describe. Most Dark Harry stories tend to oversimplify the deterioration of his character and it irritates me. And if Harry is the Boy Who Lived then wouldn't his parents be dead still? Unless you change that too.

Anyway, there's lots of options for opponents to naturally occur without Voldemort.

1. Lucius Malfoy (or some other smart former-Death Eater), pulls the strings behind the Ministry to cause problems. His motivations being a sociopathic need control / megalomania / greed / sense of superiority and so forth.

2. The Ministry of Magic itself as the villian. Even without someone behind the scenes pulling the strings, the Ministry makes mistakes, or takes a course of action, or implements policy that causes problems and sets them in opposition to Harry and his friends.

3. The Death Eaters in Azkaban are broken out or escape (or are they released early?), what actions do they take on society/Harry/Dumbledore/the Ministry when they have their chance for revenge?

4. Grindelwald follower resurgence / Grindelwald returns?

5. Rogue Auror or Department of Mysteries employee etc. Rogue killer/serial killer sort of thing

6. Dumbledore turns against the Ministry for whatever reason

7. Basilisk loose from Chamber of Secrets

8. Some new self-proclaimed Dark Lord etc. You'd have to invent him/her yourself. What does the Order do? What does the Ministry do? What happens at Hogwarts? What happens in the TriWizard tournament? etc etc.
