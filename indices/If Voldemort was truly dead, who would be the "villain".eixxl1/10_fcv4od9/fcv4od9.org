Follow World history and pick a character that best falls in line with the "evil" faction. In a way WWI and WWII are both Great Wizarding Wars. The Pureblood elites targeting muggles and muggleborns. I know Grindlewald was more against the Statute of Secrecy and muggles but his supporters obviously felt they were the superior class.

You could write Wizarding Britain at civil war against a move towards a "safe" regime which is actually a move toward a totalitarian state by the Ministry. I think it would offer great dynamic for former Deatheaters to align with Phoenix members because their common enemy is the Ministry itself. People who were once allies would become enemies.

Honestly, use history as your guide. It would provide a lot of source material.
