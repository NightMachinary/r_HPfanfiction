I'm not sure what your question is. The villain or source of conflict can be anything the author wants- from real people to monsters to concepts and ideas. Your only limit is your imagination.

- Mental health like depression, anxiety, etc. Harry can deal with his time with the Dursleys. Even worse if Voldemort is truly dead and he didn't need the protection so there was no point in his suffering.
- Corrupt government/ politicians- Just because Voldemort is dead doesn't mean the pureblood ideology is dead. (Stalin and Hitler have been dead for over 50 years and yet there are still imbeciles that believe in their ideology.) So you can focus on Harry fighting the ideology of blood purists and the laws that discriminate. Mind you, some people will consider fics that focus on politics a bit dull.
- Bring back the old villain *cough* Rise of Skywalker *cough*. Just have Grindelwald escape the prison. Or have a horcrux and come back to life.
- Or you can always go for even older stories. Frankenstein, Dracula (just got a tv series BTW), The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Monk, etc. Or even older- you can go biblical with demons and stuff like Supernatural. Or even /more/ older- Egyptian mummies (fun movie from the late '90s), Greek mythology is full of various beasties (not to mention Zeus having sex with everything with a pulse). Say Harry meets Bill and decides to become a curse breaker. Visits some ancient tomb, unearths an evil long forgotten and feels responsible about defeating it. Kind of like Indiana Jones and Lara Croft.
- Or you can have Harry be an auror and investigate murders. Though I'm not sure what novelty one can bring to that genre. Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle pretty much nailed it.
- I suppose you can always throw him in some sort of a "forbidden" and tragic relationship and create as much conflict as you want between Harry and his love interest and the love interest's parents. But that's just boring.
