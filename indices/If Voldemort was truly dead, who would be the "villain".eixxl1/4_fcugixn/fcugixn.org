I think it would still be Death Eaters, but not necessarily under that name. The thing is, the hatred of muggleborns/halfbloods and things like muggle baiting existed waaaay before Voldemort. He's just a guy taking advantage of an already available base of followers. Without their leader the Death Eaters as an organization may have fallen apart, but with all that resentment and bigotry, it was really only a matter of time before they as either individuals or small group start going for the hate crimes again. Especially if Harry wasn't used as a symbol of Voldemort's defeat. Without the propaganda figure of the powerful boy-who-lived I doubt so many of the death eaters would have gone underground. I don't know if any one would ever take Voldemort's place as a leader again, but I don't think it really matters. Someone like Malfoy in a position of power can cause a lot more damage by making laws that limit muggleborn's quality of life than by attacking them one at a time. At the same time, eventually events like the world cup would become more frequent as the hate group grew in confidence and there would probably be a lot more lone actions than there was when Voldemort had the reins. In a way they would be more dangerous disorganized and attacking or sabotaging muggles/muggleborns/blood traitors/etc.. because the only way to really take down a leaderless hate group is to catch every member and to kill their ideology before the next generation embraces it.
