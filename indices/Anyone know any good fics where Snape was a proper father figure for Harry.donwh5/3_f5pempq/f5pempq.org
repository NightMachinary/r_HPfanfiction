My favourite "Snape is Harry's dad" fics:

Blood Magic by Gateway Girl - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911]]

A Very Slytherin Harry series by geoffaree - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019/chapters/1078847]]

A new place to stay by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1008166/chapters/1999790]]

And of course, the "Like None Other" series by AspenInThe Sunlight, which is extremely long. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

These should keep you busy for the next year or so if you read them all.

If you are new to the genre, I would recommend "Blood Magic" or "Digging for the Bones" as places to start.
