I don't remember the fic titles but there is one where Snape goes back in time to retrieve Harry from the Dursleys and go live with him in Australia. The second is one where Harry must go live with Snape after during the summer before 5th year and Snape discover Harry was abused. I think Harry ends up with a Basilisk later too but I may mix fics.

If someone has the titles of those two share away.
