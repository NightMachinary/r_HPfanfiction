The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][Secret Language of Plants]] series on AO3 is quite good, imo. Basically, Snape sees how Petunia and Vernon are treating baby Harry, kidnaps him without telling anyone because that isn't the type of thing Dumbledore would allow, and then brings him to Remus Lupin for safe hiding, and the two of them raise him. It's a completed series too, over 370k.
