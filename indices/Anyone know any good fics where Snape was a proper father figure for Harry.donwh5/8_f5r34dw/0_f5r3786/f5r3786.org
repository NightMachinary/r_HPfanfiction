I will be messaging you on [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-10-30%2022:15:01%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time][*2019-10-30 22:15:01 UTC*]] to remind you of [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/donwh5/anyone_know_any_good_fics_where_snape_was_a/f5r34dw/][*this link*]]

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
