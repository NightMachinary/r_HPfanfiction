Haven't actually gotten to it yet... I honestly try to avoid stories, well written or not, where characters have different parents unless there's a good reason for the change. Part of what makes Harry Harry is that, genetically speaking, he is the son of Lily and James. I'm reading one right now that's really good and it was revealed a few chapters in that Lily went to Snape because James was impotent. This fic is an exception to my rule because of that.
