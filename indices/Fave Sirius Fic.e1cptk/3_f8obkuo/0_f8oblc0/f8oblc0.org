  There are a few things Sirius really didn't count on for Christmas of 1979. The extreme sexual confusion is one of them; Remus Lupin is approximately seventy-eight of the rest.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
