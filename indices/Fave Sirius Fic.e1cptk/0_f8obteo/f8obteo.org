Any evidence to substantiate this or are we just making wild claims with zero evidence? Because in this case- Fred is alive. And FFS I'm tired of links to mobile sites. Personally I like "Dead Sirius"- Sirius returns as a ghost and torments the Order. I particularly like the Longbottoms' battle cry. On a more serious note (I ain't even sorry) "A Marauder's Plan" and "Heart and Soul" have a more mature and serious Sirius.
