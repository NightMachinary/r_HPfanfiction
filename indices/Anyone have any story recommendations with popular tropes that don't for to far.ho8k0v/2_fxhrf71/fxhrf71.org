linkffn(what's a little death between friends?; The lesser sadness; Honour thy blood; A step to the right; Lessons from another) a few of these are either abandoned or the authors just haven't had the time to get to them for a while

I highly recommend the lesser sadness as it has the most epic duels between Harry and Voldemort like dumbledore v Voldemort in ootp level

A step to the right has a unique spin on family magic and wldbf does lordships really well.

Lessons from another is my favourite harry is thrown I to another dimension fic, simply because of the reactions of the characters to how their lives could have been
