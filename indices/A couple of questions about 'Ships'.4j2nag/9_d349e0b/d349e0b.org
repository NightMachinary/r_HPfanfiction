Kinda late to the discussion (as always, for some reason when it comes to the interesting discussions I somehow miss out on them...), but here's my reasoning: the Harmony ship views itself as direct competition to the canon ships, even though both are fanon ships, so of course they will be more militant, and also why you have a bigger proportion of the Harry/Hermione shippers being completely delusional and bigheaded. You won't have this problem with ships such as Ginny/Luna (which is my second favourite Ginny-ship) or Seamus/Dean (something happened there I'm sure), even though both are also just as fanon as Harmony. Ships that have no threat whatsoever against the canonical "order" are by definition more peaceful.

Which is why the vast majority of the Weasley bashing (especially Ginny and Ron, since they are the direct threat to the Harmony ship) is done by Harmonians.

It's been a problem for more than 10 years, since HBP came out, and while the number of H/Hr shippers has gradually decreased over time (at least in the book fandom, the movies is something else), the Harmonians have only become more desperate to prove that their ship is the only true one. Which explains why they completely misinterpret JKR's words from the Wonderland interview, which further fueled the delusion. In their view, JKR did not say "In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit [compared to Ron and Hermione]", instead it's "Harry and Hermione MUST be together, Ginny and Ron can just fuck off".
