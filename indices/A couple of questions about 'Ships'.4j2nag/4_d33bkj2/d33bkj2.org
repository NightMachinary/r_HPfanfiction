There are very very vocal anti-Harmonians out there, who will argue until they are blue in the face that the ship is impossible. And there is a middle ground who see it as possible but not inevitable, and there is the fanatic shipper who believes they are perfect for each other.

When somebody says "HHR Shippers are not liked" they are saying THEY don't like them or they know people who don't like them. Like everything it is subjective and most likely a vocal minority.

I'm an HHr Shipper, but I also stick mainly to Harems because I love all the girls somewhat equally. Mostly it isn't that Harmonians "hate" Ron, they hate anyone but Harry getting the main heroine of the series. They wanted their perfect cliche couple instead of the cliche "they argue because they like each other".

Just like what you like and if you debate your reasons for why HHr are a good ship, make sure you keep it friendly and don't insult the intelligence of anyone who is debating back with you. Anyone who assumes you are an idiot and treats you as such because you prefer HHr should be ignored (including your friend, or friends friend's). Don't tell them that to their face, just drop the subject if you feel attacked.
