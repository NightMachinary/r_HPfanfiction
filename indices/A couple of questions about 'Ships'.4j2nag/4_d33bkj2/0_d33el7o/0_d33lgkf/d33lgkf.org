There are so many bad ones... and I'm even including my own in that... linkffn(searching for the power) is mine, includes more realistic relationships and characters instead of basically not mattering which girl is in the scene with Harry. It has huge HHr but is also RonMione until like chapter 20. I didn't even really bash anybody...

linkffn(love has no age) was pretty good, and the story I started writing on part time

so many bad harems though...easier to recommend single shipping stories for basically any female than to recommend a good harem..
