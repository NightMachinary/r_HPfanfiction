I am also a HHr shipper, but feel absolutely no need to attack or degrade other ships (I imagine much like most other reasonable people). I've always shipped this pairing because it was the one that made the most sense to me, something about it I found easier to relate to.

To be honest I really couldn't care whether someone ships the fucking Whomping Willow with Harry's Nimbus 2000, that's an outlandish opinion but they are entitled to it. I suppose I've never really understood why some people can't just respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The fact that someone else ships Hermione and Voldemort has absolutely no bearing on myself. At least I don't think it does...

I'll read pretty much any pairing, I've read stories pairing Harry with pretty much every other significant canon/fanon character. If someone writes well enough that the chosen relationship works in that piece of writing it's all good. It's not offensive that Harry and Hermione aren't together, or whatever "OTP" someone prefers. The fact that you ship some pairing should not be a defining characteristic of yourself as an individual.

For example, personally I tend to AVOID harems; because I've simply not read many harem stories that I've enjoyed. However the fact that you like harem fics does not suddenly mean that we are sworn enemies and I'll be declaring a blood feud between our families.

Basically as you've said, if asked I would identify as an HHr shipper. I wouldn't identify myself as part of a group of people who hate Romione or any other pairing. Likewise if my preference for a particular pairing offends you, I couldn't give a fuck.

(Any harem fics you'd recommend to someone wary of them?)
