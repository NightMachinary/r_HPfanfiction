  Heron shippers, as some pathetic attempt to be degrading. I can't think of any other group of people in the HP fanbase that has done that.

I wasn't there, so I'm probably missing some context: why is that degrading? I, for one, wish that the fandom had a concise verbal shortcut to refer to the canon pairing, and "Heron" has a nice ring to it (unless you hate birds). It also has a nice demonym version:

- Harmony -> Harmonian
- Dramione -> Dramionist/Dramionite
- Drarry -> Drarrian
- Heron -> Hero
