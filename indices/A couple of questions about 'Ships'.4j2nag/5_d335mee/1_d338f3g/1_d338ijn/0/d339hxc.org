I like "Heron" better. I haven't seen "Romione" used much, and, IMO, it's neither here nor there, because it tries to merge on two similar, but different consonants (Ron + mione), making it too tempting to pronounce it "Ronione" (or "Romeone" because the first five letters are one letter away from "Romeo"), whereas "Heron" merges on a common consonant and is a word.
