Well, first of all anyone who supports a certain pairing shouldn't degrade other pairings. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who like HHr but don't hate R/Hr with such immaturity. I certainly don't. HHr is something that I wished had occurred. Does that mean I hate R/Hr? No, not at all. I think R/Hr is great as well. I'm truly sorry now that because of those twats (as you so rightly put it) a lot of people hate HHr Shippers and the Ship itself. And Jesus, I'm not trying to tell you 'we're not all like that'. I don't even know who 'we' is lol. If so many Harmonians are really that bad, I'll just be content with calling myself 'An individual who likes HHr and minds his own damn business when it comes to other Ships'. I like the ring of that.
