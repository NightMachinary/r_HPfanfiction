Everyone knows the worst pairings all [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zccxa/if_people_can_requests_smut_fics_between_harry/][involve the Giant Squid]], surely? Jokes aside, I think the main reason you dislike Harmonians is that there are relatively many of them, so the shit that everyone does is so much more widespread and louder as well. I've found much more seriously stupid shit from Harmonions, but every OTP has something like that - there's just generally fairly few hardcore Dean/Luna shippers.
