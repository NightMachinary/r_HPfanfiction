Typically very devout HHr shippers are seen to exclude all other ships, that nothing could possibly be as good as HHr, personally I like three or four ships. Also because many HHr stories demonize other characters and put hermione on a pedestal. She is not perfect and she fought with Harry sometimes just like Ron did but they tend to gloss over those. She also occasionally becomes what we call a "Mary Sue" you can google the term for a more exact definition, but essentially it means she solves all the problems in the plot, and it seems like nothing is a challenge to her. Basically HHr shippers, typically, elevate their ship at the expense of others at a much higher rate than other shippers. IMO anyway, correct me if I'm wrong anywhere here.
