I don't think that situation is sexist. It's not like Harry, and other characters, don't get rescued by females.

I'm saying she loses her nerves in stressful, confusing situations. This is only one example of it. Now, I've only read one story where Hermione was raped, and it was a long time ago, so I can't say this for all the stories featuring it, but it certainly could be a situation that causes her to freeze. Like with the troll. Like many rape victims experience. There's nothing unrealistic about a guy with lesser magical skill saving her, and the situation I quoted had both pre-warning and an inept opponent.
