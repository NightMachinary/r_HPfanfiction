  I don't think that situation is sexist. It's not like Harry, and other characters, don't get rescued by females.

*TL;DR:* Context --- in-story, in the fandom, and in the broader society --- matters, and in context, yes, the situation is sexist.

In this particular pattern, it's not just a rescue of a character who happens to be female by a character who happens to be male, taking place in a vacuum. It's a rescue of the /female romantic lead/ by the /male romantic lead/ from a /sexual assault/ attempted by /a rival romantic suitor (or stranger)/ that's contrived /to facilitate the central romance/. How often does /that/ script get flipped?

Then, there are also fandom-specific aspects of the scenario: in particular, with Ron and WBWL!Neville, making them the attempted rapists degrades and bashes their characters in order to make the romantic protagonist --- Harry --- look better. (Now that I think about it, Viktor Krum also gets a lot of that.) Sexism can be against men, too.

On the matter of capability, it's important to remember that ultimately, anything that happens to the characters is /author's decision and responsibility/. In other words, we can speculate until we're blue in the face just what a canon-consistent Hermione could or couldn't and would or wouldn't do in a hypothetical situation that she'd never encountered in canon, but, ultimately, what matter is that /the author chose to put her into this scenario and then chose to have her be unable to defend herself/, typically /in order to facilitate a plot where she gets rescued by her OTP/. In other words, the author /chose/ to take away a female character's competence and agency in order to facilitate a romantic relationship, in a way that practically never happens to male characters. Tell me that's not sexist.

Ineptness of antagonists enters the situation in a related way: it usually means that they are utterly helpless before Harry, and are utterly unable to outsmart him or put him in a situation where he is helpless before them, yet seem to be far more successful when it's Hermione they're after.

And, the last bit, about Wandless Magic, is another trope you see in these sort of fics a lot: Harry discovers some amazing new branch of magic that gives him massive powerups, or just an ability to not be helpless if disarmed. Hermione, despite having never seen an area of magic she didn't want to study (She even gave Divination a chance.) somehow never takes advantage. Wandless Magic is a particularly popular one. Sometimes, no specific reason is given; and sometimes, there's some extrinsic factor like needing a minimal amount of some inborn "magical power" or "magical core" to do it. Either way, it's /the author choosing/ to empower the male romantic protagonist while disempowering (in relative terms) the female romantic protagonist, in a way that ends up facilitating the rescue romance plot.

  Now, I've only read one story where Hermione was raped
#+end_quote

I haven't read many either --- because I usually spot signs of a bad Harmony fic early on and stop reading --- but usually, her Designated Love Interest rescues her before the crime is completed and then visits righteous vengeance upon +the fool who dared to tried to rob him of his prize+ the bad guy. (For that matter, it can be general peril. Most of the argument still applies.)

  I'm saying she loses her nerves in stressful, confusing situations. This is only one example of it.

You picked a particularly extreme example. Frankly, I'm not sure how /anyone/ of the trio would have done in her place. Ditto being /locked/ in a room with a troll. (Harry and Ron were entering the situation, rather than having it forced on them, so they got a bonus to Emotional Fortitude roll, where Hermione got a penalty.)
