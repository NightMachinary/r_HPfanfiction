So, basically, what you're saying is that if Hermione loses her nerve when she is

1. suddenly accosted by
2. someone who is an innocent victim
3. of the person she is impersonating,
4. who is the same person who had tortured her a few weeks prior, and
5. whose wand she would have had to use to hex the above-mentioned innocent victim, and
6. all without having won that wand's loyalty,

that's canon behavior. I don't see what it has to do with the sexist and all too common fanfic trope that I had outlined.
