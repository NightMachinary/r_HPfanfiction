HHr shippers tend to be ... avid. The most vocal ones (not "most" of them) are also very defensive about it.

I think part of the reason for that defensiveness is that both Harry and Hermione are shipped with so many other characters that (some) fans of HHr feel as if they have to aggressively defend their choice from detractors.

But the vast majority are quietly enjoying the pairing, and the wild-eyed furor of diehards seems to have mellowed in general.

Either that or I'm really great at ignoring it.
