It's hard to explain. I really like the idea of HHr. Maybe it has to do with personal feelings/experiences. But I'm not against other pairings. I simply just don't read them. And I accept other people's choices of pairings, whatever they may be.

I really hope you are right that the vast majority enjoy HHr quietly. Cheers.
