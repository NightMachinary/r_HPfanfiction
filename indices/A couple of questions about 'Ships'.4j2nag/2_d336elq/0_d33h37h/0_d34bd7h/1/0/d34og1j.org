Getting into the semantics of often vs some seems rather petty, especially when scanning down I see other people saying often too. I'm sorry if I've offended you, I agree that it's a minor issue and I think you've read far more passion into my suggestion than I intended. I actually personally don't mind Harry/Hermione stories, I just don't personally write them.
