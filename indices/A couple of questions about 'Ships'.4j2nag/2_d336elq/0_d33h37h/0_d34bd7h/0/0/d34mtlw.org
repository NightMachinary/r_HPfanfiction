It's not just "a few vocal people".

Harmonian bashing and ignoring canon is well documented in the fandom, and if you're going to equate that to a few other random shippers doing that, then you're wrong.

The point is, the H/Hr ship is definitely more prone to bash because it poses a threat to the major canon couples, and it has the merit of being somewhat more realistic than others, which is why people will... advocate more strongly for it. The only other ship which has shown nearly as much militancy is Snape/Lily, because even JKR said that it could have happened had Snape not been canon!Snape.
