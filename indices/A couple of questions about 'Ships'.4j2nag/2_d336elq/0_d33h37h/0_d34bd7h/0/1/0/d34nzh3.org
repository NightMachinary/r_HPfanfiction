No, you made no mention of quantity, only of frequency. I'm not going to try to invalidate your personal experiences, but you need to provide references of H/Hr fans *often* suggesting canon should have been different or taking the subject far more seriously than anyone else. Otherwise, you're just making blanket statements about a group of people.
