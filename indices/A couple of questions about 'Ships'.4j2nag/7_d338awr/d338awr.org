too make it short and sweet, H/Hr shippers aren't liked not because they support a canonically unrealistic pairing(put your guns down Harmonies, my OTP is H/Hr) but because on how they view their ship as essentially a "gary/mary sue-ish" ship. a pairing so perfect and impeccable that people will degrade to insufferable behavior to defend it.

With that said though, i hope you don't feel discourage in liking your ship. this is a really helpful and awesome sub(at least from my experience) where any fan of the HP fandom is welcomed with i myself starting out as a H/Hr shipper. just don't try to force your opinions down our throats.
