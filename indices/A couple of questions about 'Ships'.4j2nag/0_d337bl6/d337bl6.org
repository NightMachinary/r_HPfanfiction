There's a sort of difference between liking particular ships and being a "shipper", as it were.

Shippers have a particular passion for their ideal "ship", often referring to it as their OTP, which stands for One True Pairing. They tend to regularly imply not just that they like the ship, but that ship is somehow correct, ideal, or necessary in fic.

HHr shippers are often disliked because of the way some of them (mis)characterize Ron in order to facilitate the ship; others dislike them because they ship different ships; other people may simply not like HHr and therefore dislike the people who ship it.

Shipping culture is a whole ball of convoluted nonsense. I'd advise reading what you like and doing your best to ignore the ridiculousness behind the ships.
