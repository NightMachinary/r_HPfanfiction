A light dusting of pink glitter drifted across the parchment pressed against the desk, and got stuck in the wet ink. Hermione Granger took a deep breath and looked up to find Lavender Brown grinning back at her. "Lavender," Hermione said with hard-found patience, "I am working."

"You can keep working," said Lavender as she tucked a folded parchment under the edge of Hermione's desk blotter. "Just a little office spirit for Valentine's Day!"

Hermione pushed back her chair and sighed. "Lavender, this is where we work. It's not the Gryffindor dorm, it's not the social pages of the Daily Prophet, it's just another boring Ministry office where I calculate tax rates and you...." She frowned a bit. "Lavender, what exactly do you do?"

Lavender giggled. "Silly, you know I'm Percy's secretary! And I'm also in charge of Ministry Morale! He said it's a very important part of my job and I should spend part of every day going around to see whether people are happy!"

Hermione shook her head. Percy could be quite Slytherin when he tried, and she had to give him credit - this was a fabulous way to get Lavender out of his office for half the day while she went around and gossiped under cover of improving everyone's attitude. Hermione plucked the folded parchment from her blotter and held it up. "Is this a morale project?"

"Yes," Lavender said happily. "It's a Secret Valentine - you get someone's name, someone else gets yours, and you send little notes or gifts for the next two weeks until Valentine's Day."

Hermione sighed and let the parchment drop without opening it.

"Hermione," Lavender said, a somewhat serious expression crossing her face, "I worked hard on the pairings. I didn't match you up with Ron or any of his mates, all right? It isn't a matchmaker thing." Her brow wrinkled. "Well, for some people it is. But you and Ron had that bad break-up and I think you should just have some fun rather than moping around on Valentine's Day."

"Thank you," Hermione said, surprised by Lavender's reaction. "I was planning to spend it with romance novels and treacle tart."

"You still can! Just, at work you've got to send a few notes and maybe some candy." Lavender leaned in conspiratorially. "It's also an attempt to boost the candymaker businesses. Percy said there had to be an economic angle to the project." Lavender did a frighteningly-good imitation of Percy saying this, and both she and Hermione dissolved in laughter.

"All right," Hermione said after she stopped giggling. She picked up the parchment again. "I'll do it." She opened the flap and saw Percy's name. "Well, that's one way to keep it completely professional."

Lavender looked nervous. "He's married, Hermione. I know you'll keep it proper, and he's Ron's brother, and I could have given you Harry but -"

"It's all right, Lavender." Hermione smiled. "It's actually easier this way. Thank you."

Lavender slipped behind Hermione's desk and gave her a quick hug, then bounced away, followed by a trail of glitter. Hermione tucked the parchment away again and returned to her calculations.

Granger:

Have some candy. You're looking thin. Still getting over Weasley?

Your Secret Valentine

Hermione rolled her eyes and opened the packet, then frowned a bit. These weren't the sort of candies that the tea-trolley carried, nor the kiosk in the lobby. Her Valentine had clearly gone outside to buy something for her. She bit into one of the truffles, gently cinnamon-scented, and smiled to herself.

"Oi, Granger. Meeting." Gregory Goyle poked his head into her office. "Sneaking chocs midday?"

"Secret Valentine," Hermione said, swallowing quickly and coming around her desk. "Snarky note but lovely chocs."

Goyle chuckled. "Mine sent me a squished bun from the trolley."

"That's not good for morale," Hermione said.

"Better than one half-eaten," Goyle said cheerfully as they entered the weekly status meeting.

Granger:

Heard you complaining about office supplies in the lunch line. Have some of those Magi-Clips you like so much.

Your Secret Valentine
