After a few moments, they slowly broke the kiss. Greg leaned his forehead against hers and kissed her cheek. "I've been wanting to do that for a while."

"Oh?" Hermione smiled, kissing the bridge of his nose and nestling a bit closer.

"S'nicer than I thought it would be," he said, hoisting her up to sit on the counter. "Except you're a bit shorter than I'd planned for, or I'm taller or something. Anyway, you're better up here."

"Better for what?" Hermione breathed her words softly against his skin as she trailed soft kisses along his jawline.

"Better for this," he said hoarsely, and leaned in to kiss her again as his hands slid under the edge of her jumper and up across the bare skin beneath.

Hermione wriggled at his touch, arching against the rough skin of his hands as she kissed him with enthusiasm. He caressed her stomach and back for a little while, trading kisses and nips with her as his hands wandered, until he pulled back long enough to tug her jumper off over her head. She undid his shirt buttons, scratching her nails through the crisp curls on his chest while he unhooked her brassiere and muttered mild curses at the hooks. Eventually he succeeded in unfastening and removing the bra, tossing it aside. He slid his hands up to capture her breasts and leaned in to kiss her again.

Someone was making little mewling sounds. Hermione, busy tracing the muscles under Greg's skin, wondered who it might be, until Greg pulled back and chuckled. "Like that, do you?" He ran his finger across her thigh, just along the hem of her skirt, until she shivered and leaned into him again.

"I do," she whispered. "Kiss me again, will you?"

He bent to her, one arm wrapped securely around her waist and the other hand moving up under her skirt hem. She wriggled at his touch, slightly ticklish against the soft skin, and felt his laugh reverberate between their chests pressed tightly together. He flattened his hand and slid his palm more deliberately up her thigh until his fingertips reached the edge of her knickers, and stopped. Hermione lifted one leg and wrapped it around his waist, pulling her arms from his neck and moving them to his belt buckle.

"Hermione," Greg said uncertainly, "are you sure?"

She undid his buckle and the first few buttons of his trousers, then looked up at him. "Yes," she said softly. "Are you?"

"Yes," he said, kissing her softly. She felt his fingers work under the elastic leg-band of her knickers, teasing the soft curls, and moaned quietly at the sensation. He smiled against her lips and reached for the waistband, tugging her knickers down. She raised one hip, then the other, to let him pull the wisp of fabric free. Her knickers soon followed her bra into parts unknown. Hermione wondered where she'd find them in the morning, but was brought back to the moment by Greg's lips on her neck and his hands on her thighs, pushing her skirt up. She slid closer to the edge of the countertop so that she could lift her other leg to his waist as well.

"If you're going to stop me, Granger, best do it now," he said hoarsely.

"I'm not going to stop you," she whispered. "Touch me again."

"Hermione...."

She reached for his hand, resting on her leg, and moved it herself. "Touch me, Greg," she said softly. "Please."

He groaned as she placed his fingers on top of her labia. When she removed her hand and drew his head down so she could kiss him again, he pushed in just a bit and began to stroke her gently, circling the tiny bundle of nerves and dipping shallowly inside her with each pass. She clung to him, making soft noises again as he grew bolder with his touches.

"Like that?" His voice was soft in her ear as he nuzzled her hairline. "You're so wet, Hermione, so soft and open. I can't believe you're letting me touch you like this."

"Yes," she murmured. "Just like that." She arched against him as he found the right angle and began to rub her clit with more pressure. "Greg - please -" She reached for his other hand and drew it closer as well, placing his fingertips at her opening. "Inside me...."

Greg grinned at her as he slipped one finger into her, then another. As he concentrated on his hands, Hermione tugged and pushed his trousers and pants over his hips. She bit her lip slightly as his cock sprang free from the fabric; he was hard already, the tip glistening with fluid. She reached down and wrapped her hand around him, stroking in time with his movement. Though he groaned at her touch, he kept his pace steady and soon, she was writhing against him as she chased the growing tightness that hovered just out of reach.

"More, please," she whimpered in his ear. He kissed her again, adding a third finger to the others already buried inside her. She pushed against his hand, her grip on his cock faltering as he brought her to the brink. Her head fell back as she concentrated on the pinpoints of sensation between her legs.

"So beautiful, Hermione," Greg muttered. "Just let go...."

His words, combined with the steady attention of his hands, tipped her into a moment of heightened stillness and then over the edge into rhythmic pulses, clenching around his fingers as she whined softly. When the last shocks had died away, Greg slowly pulled his fingers from her and reached down to unwrap her hand from his cock. "A bit tight there at the end," he said.

"Sorry," she said ruefully. "It crept up on me."

"Not a problem," he said lightly, stroking across her cleft one last time and then pulling his hand away. "Was that...."

"That was very good," she said, opening her eyes slowly and smiling at him. "Your turn."

His expression was uncertain. "You don't have to."

"I want to," she said, pulling him closer and wriggling to the very edge of the countertop. "I think you're just tall enough for this."

He laughed and shuffled a bit closer. "Worth a try." As Hermione wrapped her arms around him and kissed him slowly, Greg pressed against her, moving slowly into the soft wet folds. She hooked her ankles together again in the small of his back, drawing him as close as she could. "God, Hermione," he whispered as he began to stroke into her.

Hermione smoothed her hands over his back, dropping tiny kisses over his shoulders and upper chest as he moved into her. She felt a few aftershocks from her own orgasm and gasped, clenching around him. He gasped in return and drove in harder.

"Not going to last long," he said hoarsely.

"It's all right," she whispered, teasing his nipple with her fingernails as he moaned. She bent down and flicked her tongue across the pebbled skin under her fingers. Greg moaned again and eased her back down onto the countertop as best he could, driving harder into her. "Let it come," she whispered, almost chanting to his rhythm, echoing his own words to her, "let it go, don't hold back."

Greg's breath caught raggedly as he slid in and out of her. He pressed sloppy kisses to her breasts and stomach, his thrusts speeding up as he went. Hermione tangled her fingers in his hair and continued whispering to him, his answering groans encouraging her to keep talking. Just as his hips started to jerk out of pace, Hermione leaned up just enough to lick his earlobe and speak softly. "Come for me, Greg. Now."

Greg's breath caught short at her words and he went still atop her, the pulsing of his cock inside her the only motion Hermione could sense. After a moment, he slumped atop her and sighed deeply.

"All right?" She brushed his curly fringe away from his forehead, where it had been pasted down with light sweat.

"Yeah," he said as he struggled to stand again. "Better than, actually. Sorry it was so frantic - I rather had more of a seduction in mind than a quick kitchen shag."

Hermione laughed as she hopped down off the counter and tugged her skirt back into place. "I'd never actually done it like this before, without the planning and whatnot."

Having located his shirt, Greg laughed as he slipped it back on. "Oh, there was planning. It just didn't quite work out. Hadn't intended on you kissing me so soon."

"Me kiss you?" Hermione turned away from the wine bottle she was finally uncorking, mouth open. "You kissed me!"

Greg shrugged. "A little of both, maybe." He accepted the glass she handed to him. "Does this mean you're not throwing me out right away?"

Hermione sipped from her own glass, then picked up her clothes. "Not right away," she said. "It would be a pity to waste all that planning. Is there anything I should know, so I don't mess up the strategy?"

Greg frowned a bit, but when he saw the twinkle in her eyes, he relaxed and laughed. "Go put on a shirt, will you? You're distracting me without one."

"Maybe that's part of my plan," she said with a grin. "Let me go change. You can discuss your plots with Crookshanks." She took a few steps toward the other room, then turned back and came closer to him again. "You could stay for a while," she said quietly. "If you wanted."

Greg bent to kiss the top of her head. "I'd like that," he said. "It fits in with my dastardly plans."

"Merlin, Greg," she laughed. "Dastardly? Lavender will be mortified to hear that you've gone outside the parameters of the Secret Valentine program. I'm fairly sure she didn't intend anything of the sort."

Greg pushed her gently toward the doorway. "Go put on a shirt, Granger. You can let me deal with Lavender if you like."

Hermione grinned and headed for her bedroom, but turned at the door. "She won't care. She's all about results - she'll just want to know if your morale was boosted by the experiment. I know mine was." She winked at Greg. "Repeatedly, if we're both lucky and things go according to plan." She raced for her room and her stash of lacy underthings, making a mental note to apologize to Lavender in the morning.
