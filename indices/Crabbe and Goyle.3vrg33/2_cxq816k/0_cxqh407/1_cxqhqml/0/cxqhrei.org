Hermione pounced on the cello-bag of clips and immediately attached them to all her priority documents, where they slid into place near spelling and mathematical errors. She shoved aside a brief pang of guilt - her Secret Valentine notes to Percy had all been correct and formal, with small boxes of Bertie Bott's attached. Luckily, Percy loved Every-Flavour Beans; he liked to sort them into piles and predict the taste, though nobody was sure whether he actually ate any. Hermione was oddly touched that her secret valentine had paid an equal amount of attention to discover her hidden passion for magical office supplies.

Hermione:

You're growing out your hair? It keeps falling in your face. Pretty, but must be annoying. (Like Lockhart.)

Yr. Valentine

"Oooh, Hermione, what is it?" Lavender leaned over the back of Hermione's chair and poked at the wrapped gift.

Hermione opened the bag to find a delicate hairclip with a small dragonfly attached, charmed to wave its wings gently. She pulled the ordinary elastic from her hair and slid the hairclip into place, astonished to find that it was charmed to catch all the loose bits and hold them securely. She twisted to look up at Lavender. "Who's my Valentine, Lavender?"

Lavender smiled brightly. "I can't tell you, but I didn't think it would turn out like this. Your Valentine's really paying attention!" She leaned down to whisper. "It's not anyone married or really old, though. Not like Percy."

"That's something to be thankful for," Hermione said, turning back to the note as Lavender dashed away to watch other people open notes and gifts.

Hermione:

Noticed you wearing the clip. Looks nice on you. It's only a few days til Valentine's Day so I'd best ask while it's still anonymous. Will you have dinner with me that night? You can tell Brown. If not, no harm, and I'll ask her not to tell you who I am.

Valentine

Hermione immediately headed for Percy's office, brushing past Gregory Goyle in the hall.

"In a hurry?" He grinned at her. "You look determined."

"Have you seen Lavender?"

"She's there. Arguing with Weasley about which direction to file things. Who knew there was a choice?" He fell into step with her.

"These things are important to him," Hermione said. "Everything has to be exactly as it's supposed to be."

"Always thought of you like that," Goyle said, shrugging a bit. "Lined up and perfect right angles and whatnot. But you're not, are you. I mean, you dumped Ron, and he was the obvious choice for you."

Hermione stopped and turned to Goyle, looking up at him in surprise. "What on earth do you mean?"

His smile was a bit crooked, but warm. "I think the War knocked a lot out of all of us, Granger. For me, it was the idea that I couldn't do anything without being told what it was. For you, maybe it was that you have to do what's expected of you all the time." He shrugged. "Sort of the same thing, really." He went off down the hall, whistling.

Hermione watched him go, then whirled and marched into Lavender's office. "I wasn't going to, but now I am." Lavender giggled and bounced in her chair just a bit.

Percy stared at her. "What are you on about, Hermione?"

"Lavender knows." Hermione gave Percy a brilliant smile. "It's a morale booster."

DiPaolo's behind Knockturn. 7 o'clock.

The small card was attached to a bouquet of white tulips and vividly blue iris. The delivery elf hung around clearing its throat until Hermione dug into her purse and handed over a Galleon.

"So pretty!" Lavender stuck her head in the door. "Are you really going?"

"Yes," Hermione said firmly, then bit her lip. "Is it a bad idea?"

"No. Your Valentine's not - well, he's not someone you'd have looked at in school, but he's turned out well. Don't worry, Hermione." Lavender smiled encouragingly. "It's only dinner. You'll be fine."

At five minutes to seven, Hermione hurried down Knockturn and turned onto the short street that held several restaurants. She'd changed her clothes several times, uncharacteristically nervous, but finally settled on a green sweater and a black jersey skirt with her favorite boots so she'd not have to wear tights. She slowed as she reached the bright red awning over DiPaolo's entrance, unwrapping her long scarf as she walked. In her distraction, she walked directly into Goyle, who'd approached from the other direction. "Oh! Sorry, Goyle. I wasn't paying attention."

"Not a problem. And it's Greg, you know. Since we're colleagues and all." Goyle smiled almost shyly, helping her unwind the last length from her neck.

"What are you doing here?" Hermione returned his smile, wondering if Goyle also had a date. "I didn't know you were seeing anyone. Big Valentine's plans?"

"I'm not. Not since the War." He smiled a bit wryly. "My plans didn't go much beyond this particular moment."

Hermione stared at him as she tried to puzzle his meaning, then felt her mouth drop open just a bit. "You're my Valentine?"

He nodded, shoving his hands into his pockets. "You can tell me to push off if you want. I know I'm not exactly the sort of prize a smart Gryffindor girl expects."

"Oh, hush." She smiled at him. "It's just dinner, right?"

"Right." Goyle opened the door and gestured her through. "Just dinner."

More than two hours later, they left the restaurant. Hermione was startled to realize that they'd been there so long - the conversation had ranged from Ministry gossip to Hogwarts memories, with detours to books and political scandals and other peoples' children. When Greg imitated Draco holding his first child as if it were an angry Bludger, Hermione nearly snorted wine through her nose.

They stood on the pavement in front of the restaurant as she wrapped her scarf around her neck. When it tangled in her hair, Greg moved closer and helped her wind it in place.

"Do you live near, or may I see you to the Floo?" He smiled a bit shyly, though the general effect was blunted by the trace of whipped cream still on his cheek from their dessert.

She reached up to wipe it away. "I'm just on Diagon Alley, actually. I used to live in a flat on top of Wizarding Wheezes, but - well, that turned into an uncomfortable situation, so I moved down a few buildings. You?"

"Only a couple of streets over. It's my uncle's place but he's been overseas since before the War." He shoved his hands in his pockets. "I could walk you home, or just say good night here."

Hermione tucked her hand into the crook of his elbow and smiled. "I'd like the company."

They made their way back toward Knockturn and then up to Diagon, looking in shop windows and falling back into the easy conversation they'd shared over dinner. Hermione was surprised at how personable Greg actually was, though whether he'd developed the skill since the War or whether he'd merely been stifled by Draco in their Hogwarts years wasn't quite clear. Not that it mattered, she reminded herself. She hated it when people expected her to be the same girl she'd been nearly a decade before, so holding Greg Goyle to that standard was quite unfair.

Between her inner musings and their window-shopping, it seemed like the walk home was much shorter than usual. At her doorstep, she fumbled for her wand and opened the general wards, then turned to her companion. Greg smiled and reached to brush her hair back into the dragonfly clip, which moved to capture the stray strands. She returned the smile and, almost without thinking, opened her mouth. "Would you like to come up? I could make coffee, or I think I've got some wine, or...." Her voice trailed away.

His eyes lit. "I'd like that," he said, stepping up into the vestibule behind her.

They climbed the two flights to her floor, where he stood politely aside while she opened her personal wards and turned the doorknob, letting him pass into the flat ahead of her. Not for the first time, Hermione was glad for her regular housecleaning routines. Though she rarely had impromptu visitors, it was good not to be embarrassed by clutter when they did arrive. As Greg helped her remove her coat and scarf and shrugged out of his own, Crookshanks wandered past with a haughty sniff. He came to investigate Greg's trouser cuffs while Hermione pulled off her boots, but appeared to find nothing out of order. He meowed twice and left the room, tail held high, as both Hermione and Greg laughed. "I think you passed," she said. "He'd have caught you with his claws otherwise."

Greg chuckled and followed her into the small kitchenette. "We had Kneazles at home. They've got opinions, that's for certain." He leaned against the wall, watching as Hermione took down a wine bottle and opened it, then reached up for two glasses on the top shelf.

"I can't quite -" she said in frustration.

"Let me," Greg said, pushing away from the wall and leaning over her to grasp the glasses and put them on the counter. As he bent slightly to put them down, Hermione turned just a bit. Though she hadn't meant to, her lips brushed his cheek and they both jumped, startled.

"I -"

"Hermione -"

They stared at each other for a moment, caught in uncertainty, until Greg nodded once. "Right, it's worth a try," he said softly, and leaned in to press his lips against hers. Hermione found her arms twining around his neck, though she was sure she hadn't directed them to do so, and suddenly noticed his arms around her waist. She felt the tentative flick of his tongue across her lips and opened to him, letting her tongue slide against his as she sank into the embrace.
