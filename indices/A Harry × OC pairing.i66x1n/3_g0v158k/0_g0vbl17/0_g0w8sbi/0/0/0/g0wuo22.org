I try to keep the nr of fics I'm simultaneously reading to a minimum simply because I keep confusing them. At one point, I was following about 10 at oncw but I ended up so confused I just abandoned all of them for a while. Thus, during quarantine, I'm binging complete works, usually about a 100k+ fic a day + a short crack fic or two. Right now I'm reading You Were Always There and it's a sequel fic so after I finish allnof the parts, I'll move onto The Other Path. What are you currently reading?
