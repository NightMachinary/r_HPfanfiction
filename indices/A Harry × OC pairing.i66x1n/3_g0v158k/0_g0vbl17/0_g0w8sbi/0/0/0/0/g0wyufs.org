I'm currently binging the completed Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run.

For the ones in progress I've got

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament

Rebirth of a Dark Lord

New Blood

Loose Canon - this one also has a lot of OC pairings

Harry Potter the First Nemea Leonthrope

Apex

Rebirth in a Magical World

The Twisted Path

A Discordant Note

The odds were never in my favour

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

Basilisk-born

The Serpents Loss

And a whole lot I'm waiting to come out of haitus.
