This is one of my favorites because it is all 7 years and they are pretty quick reads but filled with information and everything a fic should be. Whenever I'm suggesting someone to start reading HP fan fictions, I tell them to start with this one.

Also the pairing builds like an actual relationship should be with problems and errors that occur as a teenager. But it's still Harry Potter which means it's a relationship that probably wouldn't happen if he wasn't who he is.
