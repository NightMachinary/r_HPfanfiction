Harry Potter and The Other Path by Fez8745

Hard to describe without giving too much away. Harry runs away from the Dursleys and lives the years up to Hogwarts homeless on the streets of London. Enters Hogwarts with a totally different mindset as canon. He's adventurous, confident, a trickster, daring, and a lot more hidden below the surface.

The summers between school he goes on little adventures around Europe mostly.

There is an early pairing with Susan Bones, but it really is just a stop on the way to the pairing with the OC.

Lot of other OCs and many many twists.
