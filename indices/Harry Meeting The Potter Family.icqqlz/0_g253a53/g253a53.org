An interesting twist on the time travel trope, Harry ends up back in time and takes a stand against the Voldemort's Knights of Walpurgis/Death Eaters, which deviates the past (and present) from canon. He meets the older generations of Potters first, and they never really know who he is, but it's super good. I've read it a few times. It also presents an interesting view of Bellatrix and the Black sisters (and the Blacks as a whole).
