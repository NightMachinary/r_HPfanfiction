I think my favourite is linkffn(extradition escape) but I also really like linkao3(evitative) and linkao3(hermione granger hogwarts crammer for delinquents on the run)

I know two of those are drarry (although only at the end in Evitative) and I'm not really the biggest drarry fan but they just felt well written. I'm not a fan of romance fics but they seemed to do it well and didn't focus on the romance too much.
