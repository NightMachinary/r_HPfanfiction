I have a whole list of fanfics that are my favourite and I enjoyed a /lot/. But if I narrow it down, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] by /Tsume Yuki/ is the very first Harry Potter fanfiction I've ever read and I keep going back to it because I love it so much. Harry is Master of Death and gets reborn all over the centuries in no particular order but one notable time he is Sirius' and Regulus' older brother and he'd raise hell for them. Complete. Gen.

And pretty much all HP work of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell/works?fandom_id=136512][LullabyKnell]] because she's my favourite author. Her worldbuilding and writing is pure bliss.

Lastly, I just have to link this one because it's golden. BAMF Lily Evans Potter!
