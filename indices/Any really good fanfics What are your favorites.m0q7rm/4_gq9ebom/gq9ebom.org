My favourites are probably (Sorry but most of these are probably Drarry)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23636362/chapters/56728846][Oxytocin]]

Hogwarts Eight Year, complete fluff and had my heart aching throughout the whole thing, in a good way though.

It's just how can you not like it? Its magic is interesting and the story is good as well.

Have to admit there are only 12 chapters but its not dropped. And it has a lot of potential.

Sorry if you dont like Drarry,

Have a night day!
