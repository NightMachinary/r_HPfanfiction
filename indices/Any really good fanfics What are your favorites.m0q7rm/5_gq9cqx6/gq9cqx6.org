My favorites keep changing depending on where my head is at. Right now my all time favorite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]]. Like many folks I am having a pretty bad time during the quarantine and lockdowns. So this fic about Harry getting through the pandemic really resonated with me. It's written really well, the story is original, great characterizations. Like you said, the entire story is just perfect for me right now.
