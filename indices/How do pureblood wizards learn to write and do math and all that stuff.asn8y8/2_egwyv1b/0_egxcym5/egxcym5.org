Public schools are meant to prepare kids for a wide range of career /options./

Many kids, like you, end up in careers that don't use most of the knowledge they gained from school, but the point of their education was to give them background in a wide enough range of subjects so that they can /choose/ from many different career options that use that knowledge.

The alternative would be specialized trade schools that only give kids enough knowledge to pursue a specific path preassigned to them. Certainly, that would be less wasteful for those kids who prefer that career path, but it also ruins social mobility for the ones who would prefer to make a more educated decision about their career path when they are older.
