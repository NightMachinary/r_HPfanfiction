It depends on the type of job that you want to use, later in life; but in all honesty I use very little math irl. I also use very little history, I use very little science and everything else.

Honestly, the stuff we learn in school; half of it we don't really need. (Heck, maybe even more than half we don't need).

I use very simple math, I'm really good at writing, but a lot of that is from writing stories on my own.

Your parents can always teach you, or failing that; then you can get personal tutors that are experts in their respectful fields.

I absolutely hated learning when I went to school, being confined to learn just certain things derailed me from being interested at all. If we had more freedom with the learning, it would have been more interesting to me.
