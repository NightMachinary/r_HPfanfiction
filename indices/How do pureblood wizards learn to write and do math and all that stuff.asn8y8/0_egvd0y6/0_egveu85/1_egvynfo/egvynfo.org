What do they need it for? I used maths a lot to get my engineering degree and for work but what does a wizard care about stresses and loads when they can just charm something to be unbreakable? We use maths to describe the world around us because its constant. Magic changes everything, the so casually change the world around them that they really don't need maths. They're not dumb, its just the equivalent of you learning about the diplomatic relationships between the Greek City states in the era 1000-2000BC. Its just irrelevant to you.
