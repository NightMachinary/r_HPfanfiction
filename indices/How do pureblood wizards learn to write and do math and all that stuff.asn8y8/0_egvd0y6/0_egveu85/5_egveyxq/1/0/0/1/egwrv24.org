The Statue of Secrecy wasn't enacted until the late 1600s. That a children's book, a popular gathering of fairy tales, was published in the native language is nothing new. In fact several such works were published in the Muggle world in their native languages. But academic work was different, it was almost exclusively done in Latin, so that a person from Germany, Italy or France could easily read what was published in England. So your argument falls flat.
