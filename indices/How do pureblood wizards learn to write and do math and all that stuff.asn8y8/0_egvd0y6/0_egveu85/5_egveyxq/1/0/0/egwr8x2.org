That "ergo" doesn't really follow. You're reaching a conclusion about the norms of magical society from a fact about Muggle society.

In actual fact, Tales of the Beedle the Bard, published in the 1400s, was written in runes (and thus presumably was written in either Norse or Anglo-Saxon or a similar language). So the "lingua franca" of medieval magical (northern) Europe appears to be something Germanic, not Latin.
