The Statute of Secrecy isn't really relevant to the discussion. It's well established that the statute put into law that which was already well established socially: the division of magical and Muggle societies. For example, magical Britain had a separate government from at least the 1200s.

In any event, if you're saying that Anglo-Saxon and the use of runes was the native language in magical England in the 1400s, you're already admitting that magical and Muggle England had different languages at the time. In Muggle England, Anglo-Saxon runes stopped being used around the 600s and Anglo-Saxon (thereafter in a Latinate script) stopped being used as a literary language after 1066. So Anglo-Saxon runes continued to exist as a living language in general use in magical England for around 700 years after they fell out of general use in Muggle England.
