Firstly, you're rather sneakily shifting goal posts. No one said anything about the "language of the elite". We were talking about the language of spellbooks, not the language of "the elite". Indeed, there's no evidence at all that magical elite would have a different language to the others. It's a small community which has possessed universal education for centuries, where the elite attend the same school as everyone else. It's highly unlikely that there is any linguistic divide within the wizarding community in Britain.

Secondly, "best evidence" applies here, I think. When it comes to the language used in medieval wizarding Britain, we have an example of a book which we know to have been widely circulated, read, and popular enough to become a cultural touchstone. A four-word school motto does not displace that evidence. Many Muggle schools have mottos in Latin; that doesn't say anything about the language in use in the Muggle world. Trying to present a school motto as in some sense good evidence of the language in use, either every day language or the language of literature, is rather grasping at straws.

That book is the only evidence of wizarding medieval literature we have. Combined with the fact that Hogwarts teaches runes like Muggle schools teach Latin, I think it's very strong evidence that runes are to British wizards as Latin is to British Muggles. And if people really consider that a book does not evidence the common language or the language of literature, then the alternative is simply "we don't know", not "it must be Latin". There's no real evidence of Latin use at all, and the above two items of evidence at the very least serve to rebut any presumption that you can infer language at use in the medieval wizarding world based on language in the Muggle world.
