You're making too many suppositions. You infer that because a book of fairy tales was published in the magical England in the 1400s that : 1) It was the language of the academia 2) That just because it was popular language, it was everyday language among the elite

Very daring statements to make. Remember that even Hogwarts motto is in Latin, shouldn't it be in runes as you try to present? If runes or a Germanic language were the most common language of the academics who wrote books and definitely went to Hogwarts, why isn't the Hogwarts motto (established after year 1000 at least) in that language?
