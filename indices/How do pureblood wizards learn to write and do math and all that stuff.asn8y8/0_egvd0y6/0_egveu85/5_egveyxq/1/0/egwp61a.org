Just on a whim, but most books written before the 18th century were written in Latin. Ergo, most old spellbooks would be written in Latin as well, you would have to know Latin, which was the lingua Franca for 1600 years at least, in order to read them. Do you think they wrote books in Olde English? Pffft... Of course they did it in Latin. Everybody in Europe did.
