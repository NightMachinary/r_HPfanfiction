Understanding Latin would be helpful for recognizing the probable intent of an unknown spell in battle or other circumstances.

Even in the real world, knowing Latin is helpful for learning uncommon words that have Latin roots, for intuitively recognizing uncommon medical terms, botanical terms, etc. Understanding Latin roots cuts down on the amount of required memorization, so I imagine it would be helpful for remembering new spells as well.
