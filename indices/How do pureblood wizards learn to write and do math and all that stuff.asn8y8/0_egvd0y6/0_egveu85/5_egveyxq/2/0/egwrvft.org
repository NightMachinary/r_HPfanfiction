  They have to have an English class somewhere because they write essays for most classes.

I mean, it's not like English classes in Muggle schools teach you how to write essays. English class is spent analysing literature, no? Or at least it was when I was at secondary school. It doesn't teach you stuff like grammar or punctuation etc.

You learn how to write essays by writing essays. There's no better practise than doing it. You generally learn more about essay writing in classes like history than you do in English.

Hogwarts has plenty of classes where you write essays and get practice at essay writing. It doesn't need an "essay writing" class.

(As for biology, there's no evidence that it's required to perform transfiguration etc. Indeed, given that students are transfiguring animals as early as second year, frankly there's no possible way that understanding the physical/biological features of the object is a requirement for transfiguration. Twelve-year-olds simply cannot have a complete or even deep understanding of an animal's biology. All signs point to the knowledge required to perform transfiguration being knowledge of the magic at play, not of the biology of the target.)
