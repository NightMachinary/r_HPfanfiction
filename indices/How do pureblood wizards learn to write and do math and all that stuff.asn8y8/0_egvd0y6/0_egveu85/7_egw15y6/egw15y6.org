I always assumed that off-screen/off-page the students are taking classes that cover this stuff in addition to the magic stuff while at Hogwarts, or at least reading, writing and basic mathematics. Prior to Hogwarts, I assume home-schooling or private tutoring. I mean, obviously they can /read and write/ by the time they get to Hogwarts.
