IRL private tutoring can be the best education imaginable. For example, John von Neumann was taught by his governess and received tutoring in English, French, German and Italian until the age of ten.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Early_life_and_education][However, von Neumann was a genius who could by the age of six could divide eight-digit numbers in his head and also converse in ancient Greek]].

Apparently the whole pre-Soviet Hungarian system was this way. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Early_life_and_education]["Children did not begin formal schooling in Hungary until they were ten years of age"]].

Edit: I misunderstood your statement. I assumed that you meant that they would be incredibly stupid because they'd received bad early education
