I don't know about you, but most of the maths (trigonometry, calculus) I learned in school I never used afterwards. The only really useful mathematics was statistics, but the higher level stuff is only applicable to reading scientific or academic literature.

So I don't think the average pureblood is stupid if they can't interpret a confidence interval. And wizards have their own version of math class, Arithmancy at Hogwarts. If they took that as an elective, and self-studied or had tutoring in the summer, they wouldn't be that far off. Not PISA-exam quality, but does wizarding society need much more than standard literacy?
