Very arguable. We don't actually know much about magic theory and how the subjects are taught, so it could well be all rote memorization for all we know.

Type matters too. You don't develop verbal intelligence through math exercises, and you don't develop spatial intelligence through essays. I'd also argue that essays aren't gonna improve much from grade school levels without a dedicated language and literature class to expose kiddies to different registers and forms of writing.
