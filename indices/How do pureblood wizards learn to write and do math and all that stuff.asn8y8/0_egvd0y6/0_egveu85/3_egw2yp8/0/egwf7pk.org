Even mathematicians forget it. It fades into the background and becomes obvious.

You don't remember the mid point theorem, nor do you use it.

Notice for example that this isn't only true for half the length of the sides but for any fraction of the length of the sides. In a way it can be seen as a consequence of the fact that scaling things doesn't really affect angles.

The theorems you remember are foundational theorems, things like the Pythagorean theorem or the sum of angles theorem.
