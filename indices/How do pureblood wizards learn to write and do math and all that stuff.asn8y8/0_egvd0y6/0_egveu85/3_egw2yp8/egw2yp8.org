Quick, define the mid-point theorem.

It states that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is always parallel to third side and half its length.

If you're unable to remember, the mid-point theorem is taught in high school mathematics - trigonometry.

High school mathematics may be useful to someone who makes use of it later in his life, like a mathematician, physicist, engineer or whatever. Nearly everyone else forgets it - that does not make them stupid.
