  Or that Zelretch is involved in it (stupid question, of course he is)
#+end_quote

Kind of a stupid question, indeed! On a more serious note and without spoling too much, no, Harry does not become Zelretch, and the man himself appears around the middle of the story, when the nasuverse crossover kicks into full gear.

On a different note, do you happen to have a list of the HP x Nasuverse crossovers that you have enjoyed? I'm now craving for more, but I lack the will to crawl through the whole section to find some good ones.
