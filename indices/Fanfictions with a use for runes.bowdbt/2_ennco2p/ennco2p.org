Runes play a big role in /Wizard of the Kaleidoscope/ linkffn(6995114) and the way they work is very fleshed out, although they don't come in play in the first few chapters (around the 10th, iirc).

Be warned however that the fic is a crossover (Mostly HP, with a bit of Naruto and a liberal use of Nasuverse concepts and characters) so that might be what you're looking for. The different magical systems and concepts are well meshed together and I liked the story a lot for this, but that may be due to my being ridiculously fan of the Nasuverse.
