Czech group of fanfiction writers (in Czech language, of course) centered around [[http://budec.net/]] developed theory, that something similar to runes (more graphical than text) is an Old Slavic Magic. It is based on the fact that the Czech word „čáry“ means in the same time sorcery and lines (like what you produce while drawing). What probably even authors around this server don't know, is that there actually was an ancient Slavonic system (pre-Christian, so a way before Glagolitic and even longer before Cyrillic alphabet) of something (it has never been deciphered) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Christian_Slavic_writing][чръты и рѣзы]] (strokes and incisions), which could very well be foundation of such magic.
