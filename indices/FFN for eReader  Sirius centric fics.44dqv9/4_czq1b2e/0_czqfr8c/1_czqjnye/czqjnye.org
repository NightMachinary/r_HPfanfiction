Well, that /particular/ site is a writing challenge site, not an archive, and those fics are considered to be rough drafts. So text selection and copying is deliberately disabled so the authors can control the distribution of "substandard/unfinished" works. Which is their right. (also, challenge site means those fics will be taken down in March to prep for the next round, so don't put off reading).

(Hint: that GrabMyBooks extension from my first post? Works here. Not the Android app, but the browser extension - I haven't tried the app. I have ebooks on my Kindle of both of those stories.)

On the bright side, the authors are pretty good about posting the links to the finished works on the Past Projects page. And many do get finished. And you can always check out the individual blogs from their profiles (Jilly has got some excellent crossovers in other fandoms). I have found the writers who participate there are pretty high quality.
