Ooh, thanks for the recs, those look right up my alley! Also, another site that doesn't allow copy-paste? I wish site-owners would think more about accessibility when they do things like that, as it messes with my ability to adjust the text into a size and colour I can read :/

As for a rec/favourite list of my own, I used to, but sadly 90% of the stuff on it is no longer available on the internet as far as I can find. Of the ~150-200 fics that remain, what's listed in the post above is the cream of the crop. The rest are slash (which for some reason seems to be looked down upon here?), fics of mediocre quality that were trope namers or originators, and about a quarter of them the English translation of them is lost or never existed. I'm working on trying to track stuff down, and I'm making a new list!

That said, I've got a few pieces I especially like of more recent material:

linkffn(Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewellyn) is SUPER long, actively updated, and a massive, sprawling crossover that starts out HP/Marvel and just grows and grows and grows. I'm addicted, even though [[/spoiler][the author put Sirius on a bus and he's not come back yet, but Regulus is there]] and that's one of my favourite characters.

linkffn(Long Live the Queen by offsides) is another WIP I'm following with regular updates.

If you're interested in my slash (mostly Wolfstar) recs, let me know!
