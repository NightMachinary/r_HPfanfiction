Your list of likes is very similar to mine. Do you have a rec list or favorites list somewhere?

Also, since you're open to slash, I know of 2 to try. Unfortunately, they are currently unfinished. However, they are from the 2015 NaNo challenge, so there's still a chance. They're both on a challenge site that requires signup to view.

[[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/?p=29401][Sometimes Goodbye Is a Second Chance]] by toasterpop Summary: Sirius Black had never really expected to survive to the end of the war. At most, Sirius had hoped to give his godson, Harry, what help, protection, and support he could for whatever time he had remaining. So getting killed by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn't that big of a surprise. What happened after Sirius fell through the Veil? Now that was a surprise...

[[http://www.keiramarcos.com/roughtrade/?p=28932][Slytherin Black]] by Jilly James Summary: Since passing through the veil, Sirius has spent six years in limbo; because the veil is not death, not unless Death herself wills it. And for some reason, she didn't send Sirius on to the afterlife. So he waits and watches the living. For six years he watches and seethes over the injustices done to his godson. Then Death offers him a deal; he can travel back in time eighteen years and change the past, but in exchange, Sirius must promise that the Hallows will never be united under one master. He must ensure that there is never again a Master of Death. Sirius takes Death up on her offer and arrives back in 1984 determined to ensure that Harry has the life he was meant to have. He'll do whatever he has to in order to insure that the world is a better place for his godson. He tried the Gryffindor approach the first time around... this time, he's going to try it the Slytherin way.
