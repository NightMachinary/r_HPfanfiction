RE, the ereader stuff:

1)search the sub, and youll find a few other posts like it, at least one of which has a decent tutorial on how to use a program called "Calibre" to save epub files. If you have an ereader app on your tablet, it will work almost exactly like a "real" ereader

2) The ffnbot is supposed to work for pms now, so if you want you can pm yourself a call in order to get the epub download link.
