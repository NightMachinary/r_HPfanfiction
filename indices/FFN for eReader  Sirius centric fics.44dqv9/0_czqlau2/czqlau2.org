1) Bot seems to be working fine. Sometimes, connection issues on either side (but usually Reddit's) leads to some replies not getting posted; call =ffnbot!refresh= if you need the bot to go over your comment again.

2) Bot works with PMs now. You can PM your requests to the bot.

3) I recommend using Calibre and FanFicFare together to download fics in bulk, instead of the bot.
