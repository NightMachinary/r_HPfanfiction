Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

When Death Eater/Nazi parallels increase and Minister Fudge tries appeasement politics, Death Eater sympathizers in the Ministry gain power, muggleborns get killed for 'resisting arrest' and kicked out of Hogwarts by Umbridge, Hermione and the other muggleborns decide to fight back.

The war turns into a complicated mess between Hermione's guerilla resistance group, Dumbledore's Order, the Ministry, the Death Eaters, Draco's group of Slytherins, and more groups.
