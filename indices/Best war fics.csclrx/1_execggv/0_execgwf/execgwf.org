  After Voldemort is defeated, the Muggle government with a relatively new Prime Minister decides to deal with the many terrorist activities from the two previous wizarding wars. They have some muggle born wizards and witches on their service. There will be no tolerance for aggressive actions on the part of witches and wizards against muggles. EWE. Ignores Cursed Child. Many OCs.
