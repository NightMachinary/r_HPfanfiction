  Anyways I wanted to ask about two fics I read on there like 2-3 years ago but I can't find in their search engines. They were both apocalyptic stories. One was a next gen about Rose, Scorpius, and an evil (or grey) Albus. Rose was the main character and she brought her brother back from the dead.
