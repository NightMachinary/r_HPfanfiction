linkffn(The One He Feared) is good but short (AKA abandoned, but not in the middle of a story arc)

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) is good but abandoned :(

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) maybe counts? He's not "super powerful" by any means, but circumstances force him to become very dangerous and feared, and it's through creative use of magic instead of "magical core OVER 9000" bollocks.
