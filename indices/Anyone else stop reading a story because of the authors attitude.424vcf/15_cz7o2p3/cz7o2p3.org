Yes, and I won't to say who because they're a really popular author and their fics are very well written, I won't deny that, and I don't think my own personal opinions on them should influence anyone else. But after being on the same forum as them for many years I was extremely uncomfortable with a lot of their views and unfortunately it's meant that I can never really enjoy their fics, which is a shame.
