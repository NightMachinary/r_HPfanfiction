"By now, people should really know better than to go 'if you think you can do better, do it'. Because I just take that as a challenge, and challenges are meant to be accepted. To clear some of the foul air floating around the recent chapters of his fic, I am one of people - if not THE person - who tore apart a half-dozen major holes in Lightning among the Stars by Leonineus. He was then dumb enough to post screenshots of our private conversations to a fiction group we were both a member of, at which point I degraded him further for being a whiny bitch about it and then others tossed in their two cents. He threw up his hands and told me to do better if I could before taking his lengthy sulk. So I am." That's the A/N of his lighting among the stars rewrite and no matter how badly the other author reacted, reading this made him come across as just a douche, and it's like that for all of his rewrites. I've got nothing against his writing but I wouldn't want anything to do with a guy like that in real life.
