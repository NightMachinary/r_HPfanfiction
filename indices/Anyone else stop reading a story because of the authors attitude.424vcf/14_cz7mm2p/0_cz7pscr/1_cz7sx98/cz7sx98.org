Yeah, his A/N's list him as JoeHundredaire which I assume is a name he uses on other sites or something.

But, I think there's a lot more to that story IIRC since the author he's referring to in the A/N had some sort of fustercluck rant on their profile that started the whole thing. It's also a story that the original author abandoned and I've read a bunch different people's attempts to finished and seen a even more that I just... couldn't care about anymore. Grain of salt, that's all me trying to piece things together from the various references in the rewrites as it all predates my time with fanfiction.

As [[/u/Krististrasza]] said, Joe at least had the ability to make the story actually go /somewhere./ I agree with him about the premise not being a terribly productive one, but I enjoyed his version of the story the most out of all the attempts I've read.
