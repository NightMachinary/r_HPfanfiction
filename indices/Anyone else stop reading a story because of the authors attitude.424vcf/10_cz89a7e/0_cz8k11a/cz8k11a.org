but can't that be interesting? harry potter is a great vehicle to explore God/Death/Love/Sacrifice and if that isn't religion? And isn't that one of the canon themes without ever getting any dialogue?

I can't remember Harry trying an exorcism on his little bit of Riddle and have always wanted to write that particular bit. Could be all Richard Burton and snuffing candles and stuff.
