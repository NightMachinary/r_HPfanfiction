Honestly, it was a pretty engaging story, all pretentiousness aside. It had an exciting plot, and it was the first story to introduce me to the concept of "rationalfics" which I have to admit, are leagues better than the vast majority of fanfics I've read which are basically just shallow excuses for writers to pair up their favorite couples. It's actually spoiled a lot of otherwise decent fics for me personally, because now I can't read a fic without automatically pointing out all the blatantly stupid things a character does.

What I didn't like about MoR was how the author changed big parts of canon for his own benefit. A proper rational fic should be able to work around canon and use it to tell a good story, not distort it.
