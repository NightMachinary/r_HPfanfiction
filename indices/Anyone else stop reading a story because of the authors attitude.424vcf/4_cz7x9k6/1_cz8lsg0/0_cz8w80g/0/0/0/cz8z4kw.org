Considering the point of his story was to show how stupid all the main characters are, that would, at best, be extremely difficult, and most likely impossible. Especially since he also used the story as a way to showcase his actual methods of rationality from his blog (hence the name of the story) in a "real life" situation to show how they apply to actual complex characters. With his motivations, coming off as haughty to the general HP fanfic fan is inevitable, but he's not trying to appeal to the general fan, which is why he doesn't bother toning it down. He probably thinks (and rightly so IMO) that anyone who's going to stop reading his fic because they don't like their favorite characters being bashed/ wanted some non-canon pairing that didn't happen/ hate the fact that Dumbledore isn't portrayed as a manipulative evil bastard/ or Harry acting pompous because he's smart, has already missed the entire point of the fic, and it's not worth diluting or changing the core elements of the story to bring them back.

Seriously, if you get past the haughtiness, it's a really cool story with a lot of depth, and you learn a lot about other people and yourself too. I know I sound like a fanboy, but as someone who constantly searches for the truth in my life, I found this to be a completely mind-opening fic, once I understood why the haughtiness was there.

Edit: If you really want to know why people like this story so much, I suggest you head over to [[/r/hpmor]] and ask them. Despite their almost obsessive following of the series, they'd be happy, and more importantly much more able than me, to give that question the answer it deserves.
