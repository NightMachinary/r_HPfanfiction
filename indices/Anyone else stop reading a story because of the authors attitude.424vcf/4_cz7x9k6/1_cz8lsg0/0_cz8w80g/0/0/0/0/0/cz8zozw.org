XD you don't have to say anything. But if you want to know why people like HPMOR, you should go ask [[/r/HPMOR]]. I know I sound like a convert when I say this, but all the same I don't think there's any rational reason to dislike HPMOR (not that I'm saying disliking it is wrong ofc) once you understand what it's all about. I think you should visit the sub and give it another chance IMO. Maybe nothing will come of it, but maybe it's possible you'll find it a completely different read from before. I hope you do! I really love this fic :)

P.S. Funny little fact: all the people who dislike HPMOR because they think the MC is too arrogant are actually, very ironically, falling prey to the exact same bias that the MC and author is trying to warn them against. They take any attack on their favorite characters and fanfic tropes as an attack on themselves and what they like, because they don't realize there's actually a difference. This is why so many people dislike HPMOR, because in their heads, by calling their favorite characters stupid, the author is indirectly calling them stupid (even though that's not what's happening at all!) and they vent their anger on the fic. It's one of the things the author talks about in the story as it goes on. Just one example of something interesting you can learn ;)
