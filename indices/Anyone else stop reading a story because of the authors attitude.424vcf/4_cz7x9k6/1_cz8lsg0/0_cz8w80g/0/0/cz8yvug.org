True, the main reason why I like Mcgonagall is (as shallow as it seems), her actress, who plays magnificently.

Other than that, I can respect the author's need to "uncompromise" (IMO that's how the good differentiate itself from the rabble), but I feel it could have been done differently, less... haughty.
