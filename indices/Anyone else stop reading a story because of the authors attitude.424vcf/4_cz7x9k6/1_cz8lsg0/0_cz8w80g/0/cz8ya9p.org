Haha, can't argue with you on that one. He really needs to learn how to tone it down. Then again, I think he wrote that fic with a very specific purpose- and audience- in mind rather than just trying to appeal to the widest amount of people, so that's probably why his writing style sounds so pedantic. It's because a lot of people do really stupid things all the time, for no good reason. Like how Mcgonagall punishes students for breaking the rules regardless of why they were doing it in the first place (remember the dragon egg in PS?), and his only purpose with that story is to point out shit like that. So if you have a MC that literally exists to point out the stupid shit people do and show them a more rational way...yeah, he's gonna be pretty pedantic. I get if that's not your cup of tea though, I didn't particularly love it either. But there is a good reason for it, just like there is for everything in that author's fics.
