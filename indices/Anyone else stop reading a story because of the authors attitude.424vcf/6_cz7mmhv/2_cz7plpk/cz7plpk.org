I love the guys books and the show but it's quite obvious he was never the most popular guy and is very much a neck beard. Just watch some of his interviews, especially from when the show first came out. He was creepy, he's toned it down slightly since then (probably at the suggestion of PR execs) but go back and watch him moderating the Comic Con panels and joking about the nudity and sex scenes. It's uncomfortable.
