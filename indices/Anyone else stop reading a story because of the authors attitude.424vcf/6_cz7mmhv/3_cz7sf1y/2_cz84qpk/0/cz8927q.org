For me this is very different from just having a Patreon. There's a big difference between "I make this shit because I enjoy it and if y'all wanna kick a few bucks my way that's cool" and "You plebs aren't getting shit unless you cough up the cash."

I don't know how it would actually stand up from a legal perspective, but for me it's no different than, say, someone who does cover songs on Youtube having a Patreon/getting a cut of ad revenue.
