I think you might mean Patrick Rothfuss, The Name of the Wind author. -edit-ex. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/3u9ml3/im_patrick_rothfuss_word_doer_charity_maker_and/][1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/40x92m/was_patrick_rothfuss_wrong_to_insinuate_his_more/][2]]. There was a stink up about something exactly like that a little while ago. I'm happy to be corrected (ie source), but I have seen several instances of Sanderson avoiding controversy. It would be out of character (from what I've seen), and very coincidental to Rothfuss' Q&A, to act like you said.
