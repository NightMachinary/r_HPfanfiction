The main problem I had with the whole situation is that the word "racist" was thrown around on both sides like the other was suddenly lynching each other on the basis of a single opinion. You're racist for ever thinking she was white, you're racist for thinking she could be black or should be black, you're racist for thinking one description or portrayal is the only true way. All over some stupid bullshit.
