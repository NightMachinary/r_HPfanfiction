Other than the comment itself being said as fact, what annoyed me was that so many fans just took it as gospel. Of course you'd think you could trust the authors word, but some reasoning should surely come in. Anyway it took me /maybe/ a couple hours (while reading comments/doing other stuff) to come up with several quotes which are decent proof otherwise. This of course is in addition to the obvious collective knowledge, as you mentioned.
