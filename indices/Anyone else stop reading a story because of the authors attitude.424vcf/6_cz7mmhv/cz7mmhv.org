Yeah, all the time, both fanfiction and original fiction. If you read an author, you want to believe he or she has something valuable to say. If the author comes off as someone with whom you wouldn't wish to have a conversation, it's hard to imagine the prose being much different. There's so much to read, why waste your time?

The author you mention is among the worst for this; having crossed paths with him and his merry band of sycophants on a popular forum, I have zero desire to ever read anything he writes.

Another story [[/spoiler][MoR]] was like that for me as well, where the author, his attitude, and his antics convinced me he had little to say that I wished to hear.

In original fiction writing, Bret Easton Ellis is unreadable, partly because what he writes is vile (if literary), partly because he goes to such trouble to make his persona that of an unrepentant shithead.

It's heresy, I know, but George R. R. Martin is another I no longer read, largely because of an unpleasant interaction with the guy in real life some years back. (He lives a few miles from me and wasn't always super-ultra-mega-famous.)
