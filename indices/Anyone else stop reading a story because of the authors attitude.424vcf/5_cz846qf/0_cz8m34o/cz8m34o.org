  I also get annoyed with authors who constantly put down their own work. Like "I hate this chapter, I suck, my writing sucks, etc." Essentially begging people to bolster their fragile precious self esteem.

I've never /written/ an A/N like that myself, but whenever I go back to older writing I always feel like it's crap - sometimes it just takes a few days to set it. In that case, I can see some people putting up a 'I think this is bad compared to the best fanfics, the sort of thing I'd like to write like instead' as a way to signal to other readers from the same community, for lack of a better word, that the author can also see the flaws.

I suppose some of it might also be an attempt to distinguish themselves from writers who post notes like 'This is a great story with no flaws' or 'Please don't tell me this story isn't perfect, that's flaming'.

A lot of it is probably ego stroking, though. I just don't think that's true in all cases (maybe between half and three-quarters, at a guess?)
