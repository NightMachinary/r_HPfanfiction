The only time I've ever put an A/N in the middle of the chapter was when I discovered in the middle of posting a chapter that FFN was stripping out strikethrough and other formatting things and I had to put up an explanation of which combinations of Bold, Italics, and Underlined meant who's handwriting. (The original version on a forum site used different colors for each person which obviously didn't translate)

... do people seriously put 'normal' A/N's in the middle of a story?
