It usually goes like this:

#+begin_quote
  Jhon then told Juleit [lame pun that any five year old with minimum knowledge of the backstory/lore would have thought of] (A/N: LOL! ;) [something about how they are funny, if you can't acknowledge this you have a serious problem])
#+end_quote

.

If you see something like that, FLEE!!!

For the monkeys writing this cannot be bothered by learning how to spell names as simple as John and Juliet, they use of "lol", in capslock and the obvious demand for attention and recognition (and let's not talk about incorrect punctuation and the breaking rhythm).
