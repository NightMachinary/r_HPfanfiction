I've stopped reading stories if an author puts an authors note in the middle of a chapter, usually it's a bad author to begin with but that stuff is just unforgivable. I have no problem with notes at the beginning or end if they're talking about the story, I'm guilty of that myself but I try to keep the note to three or four lines at most and instead just answer questions reviewers send in individually.
