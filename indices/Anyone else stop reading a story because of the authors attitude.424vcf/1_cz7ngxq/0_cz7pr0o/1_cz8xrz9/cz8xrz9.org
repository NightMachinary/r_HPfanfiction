Regarding inline annotations, David Foster Wallace used extensive end notes in /Infinite Jest/, dozens of pages of them, in fact. They comprised an entire meta-text and meta-story riding along the main narrative (itself a postmodern deconstruction of the novel form).

I'm of the opinion that unless an author is David Foster Wallace, he/she shouldn't bother with inline annotations.
