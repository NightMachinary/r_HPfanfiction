There are a few things that an author can do that might make me give up on a story.

I cannot stand review whores ("I won't update until I get x number of reviews") - no. Don't do that. It's pathetic and immature. I lose respect for you as an author when you do that. Asking politely for constructive reviews is fine, holding the fic hostage is not.

Mid-story author notes - if you need to further explain something, write it into the story. Tacking on an author note to say "BTW, in this story, So-and-so didn't die" is lazy.

Snobby, preachy, unnecessarily-detailed or oversharing author notes. I remember one note on a smut-fic where the author wrote something along the lines of "everything sexual written in this is fic is either something I've done or watched in real life". Like, what? Too much information.

Also aggressive "dont like, dont read' notes. Warning me that a story includes Mpreg is great; implying that I'm wrong, unimaginative or a homophobe for not wanting to read is a dick move. Even if the warning is for something I'm happy to read, I'm not going to support someone who insults people for their preferences. Even just snotty remarks like "turn around and walk away if you don't like it" gets my hackles up.

There are hundreds of thousands of HP fics to choose from (millions including other fandoms), so unless that story is good enough that I can ignore the bullshit, I'm happy to move on to the next story.

This comment got long - apparently I needed to vent!
