Yeah. If there's an author's footnote that annoys me, there's a good chance i stop reading.

Think of: "wow! 2000 words? I spoil you guys LOL!"

Or "like it? dislike it? fav & review pls!"

And who could forget footnotes that are longer than the chapter itself, with all those reviewers typing there:

"penisman6969: cool story bro.

mylittlepony420: wow, I like this. Nice job!

yomama1550fat: can't wait for the next chapter!"

The best is if there just isn't a footnote at all. You break all immersion if you make such an obnoxious footnote, so any interest I would have had in the story pretty much vanishes then.
