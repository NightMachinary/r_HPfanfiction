Oh gosh yes. I engage in a lot of review trading or review tags where I'll read something of theirs and give concrit and they'll read something of mine and give concrit. There's been a couple cases where I find the author is just doing it to bump up their review count and barely reads other people's work in response. Or the author is expecting nothing but praise and gets confrontational when you do make suggestions or point out things they can improve. There's been one author who went nuts and started sending messages me in all caps saying I was nothing but a flamer. Needless to say they were blocked and I haven't bothered to look at their work since. I feel the need to point out that I don't leave unsolicited concrit, only people who engage in these types of trades or request it. So for people to get upset or super defensive rubs me the wrong way in these situations and I'll stop engaging with them.
