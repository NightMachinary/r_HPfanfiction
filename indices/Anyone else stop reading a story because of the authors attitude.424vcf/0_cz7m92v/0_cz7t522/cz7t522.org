I've stopped reviewing things all together *(EDIT: I mean on FFN)* since I started writing because I've discovered I'm a terrible reviewer (By the horrifying way of having it done to me and realizing I was guilty of the same things). All I ever have to say is either a variation of "I liked this! More Please!" or "I think there's supposed to be a comma between X and Y in sentence Z."

Which makes me wonder how one would go about becoming a better reviewer, since I imagine it would involve feedback, and I don't know how you'd arrange for someone to review your reviews.
