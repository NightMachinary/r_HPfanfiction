...Probably. As [[/u/vardso]] 's linked "test" references, I think a lot of authors immediately go "BUT WHY DID YOU LIKE IT!?" So I try to restrain myself from reviewing if ALL I have to say is "i liked it" (since, really, thats what fav/following a story already tells them) and instead reserve reviewing for when I can say "I really liked the part where... Because..."

I also think its a side effect of the way FFN is setup, (And I probably ought to have specified that I was referring specifically to FFN) where the reviews are somewhat non-interactive (at least in my experience, it's VERY possible i'm missing something.)

I originally started writing over on Spacebattles and having a forum setup where a 'review' is another post that I can reply to and other 'reviewers/readers' can comment on (or not, and just click the button that goes directly to the next story post) is somewhat different than the way that FFN's system of having reviews just sort of be there. I've struck up PM conversations with reviewers before and it's fun, but... there's no way (that I can find) to make that conversation include anyone else that would happen to be interested in what that reviewer said.
