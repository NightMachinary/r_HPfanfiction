I haven't stopped reading a story, but I've stopped submitting reviews to one or two people.

I used to submit a few corrections along with my thoughts on the chapter. Most authors would be quite grateful, but one replied essentially telling me to eff off and talk to his beta. Another took everything I wrote as a criticism no matter how nice I tried to be. Solution? No more reviews for you two.
