I sometimes do this after encountering a few fics written by really disagreeable rude folks.

Also maybe it's because of so many experiences with people who let their personal opinion of a character effect what treatment that character gets, I have a hard time reading a fic if I know the author really hates a character I like. Because then I'm never sure if, when they do something bad or something happens to them I'm never sure if it was for the story or the author expressing hatred of them.

Like it's one thing to not like them or like them as much. But if someone's all like "I resent this character's very existence" , I won't touch it. Even if it is very well recced.
