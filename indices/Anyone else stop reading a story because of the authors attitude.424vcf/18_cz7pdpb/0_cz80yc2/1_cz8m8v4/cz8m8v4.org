I agree with OP, they can take however long they want, no matter what schedule they set, as long as they just post a story update and not a "Sorry guys, I've been suuuuper busy and doing stuff and [lots of updates on their life] and also [more updates on their life] and so on and so forth, anyway here's 200 words of story after 1000 words of stuff nobody cares about". Even typing that out made me irrationally angry.

Someone says they'll post every Friday, then doesn't post for 6 months? Fine. I'll read the update, maybe review, and wait for the next chapter. Someone says they'll post every 12th of the month, and is two days late, with a paragraph about how they had big exams, car broke down, cat pissed on their computer and broke it? I'm unfollowing it.

It might seem a slightly weird line to draw, but I read fanfiction to learn about someone's fictional universe which contains interesting, exciting or otherwise fun/pleasant/stimulating to read, not to hear about the sort of crap facebook is ideal for.
