Haha, I feel called out because of my comment about James in the other thread now.

But no, I don't think it would. Well, maybe about Cormac McLagen of Flint, because without quidditch, they simply wouldn't have a reason to appear in the books at all. But most sporty characters are positive and don't even fall under 'jock' stereotype: Harry, all the Weasleys, Cedric, Cho. I love Oliver Wood, and you cannot go more sporty than Oliver.

If anything, I would add more sport in the Wizarding World. They all follow quidditch, but only seven people from each house play. If I were a witch, I wouldn't want to play quidditch competitively or even for a house team (I'm attached to my limbs too much), but I would love flying and play just for fun occasionally.
