I really liked With Strength of Steel Wings. It threw me off a little bit with the whole, "Suddenly, Harry got /another/ superpower that makes him the /ultimate/ badass!", but it's still a good story.

It's like that show, Bleach, or DragonBall Z. I haven't watched them in years, but almost every other episode there'd be a situation where the main character nearly dies, but manages to reach /deep inside/ and find the power of love/hate/life/death/heaven/hell/angels/demons etc.
