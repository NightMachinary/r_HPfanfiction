Something that only partially fits your criteria is the Sacrifices Arc series by Lightning on the Wave, found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][here]]. It's basically a rework of the HP series, with Harry being the brother to the Boy-Who-Lived, Connor Potter. It's a complete 7-book series (about 6 times the length of the original books) which starts out very similar to canon, but by the 3rd book is nothing like it.

It's very well written, and it depicts the magical society in-depth, with more info to the pureblood society than I've seen in any other fic. Harry is powerful, albeit not almighty, he makes mistakes and often has to learn from them. The only put-off might be that it's a Drarry slash. If that doesn't bother you, might wanna give it a try.

The link to the first one in the series is here linkffn(2580283)
