So I narrowed it down to 1 out of a possible 235 fics after weeding out the most recent ones from the past few years... it's been awhile since I read this one. And then I was randomly opening fics and searching for one word. Yeah, it's gotta a pretty memorable scene in it.

The original link was a mugglenet link... which apparently no longer has fan fiction?! So if this one doesn't work, PM me and I'll figure something out.

Enjoy!
