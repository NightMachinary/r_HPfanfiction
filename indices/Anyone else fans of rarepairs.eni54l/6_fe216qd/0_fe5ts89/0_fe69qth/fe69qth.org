Most of the pairings (including the first two you requested) were side pairings in separate stories and in spite of me double checking my bookmarks, I can't seem to find them (nor remember their names). It was really just a couple paragraphs dedicated to each one, but I remember thinking "wow, that'd be interesting if somebody expanded it more."

That said, I remember enjoying the Chudley fic /This calls for a Toast so Pour the Champagne/, but at the time it wasn't complete so I've not read it to completion yet.
