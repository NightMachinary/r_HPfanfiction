Dean Thomas/Hermione Granger is one I'd like to see more of. I can see them getting together during Hogwarts as Dean is outside the Golden Trio, but still close enough to be aware of everything that's going on. In my head I see them running across each other randomly outside of school, visiting a museum in London then starting a conversation. That said, I think I've only found one fic that had them shipped during school, all the others were post-Hogwarts fics.

Cedric/Tonks, Snape/Tonks, Colin/Pansy, Blaise/Pansy, Neville/Pansy, Cho/Dudley and Cho/Lee Jordan probably round out all the rarepairs I've ran across at some point in time, enjoyed, and wish I could see more of.
