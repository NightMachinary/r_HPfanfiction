Apologies if I don't do the linking thing right...

linkao3(59264) "Best Kept Secret" - This is probably my favorite. Post-Hogwarts where they run into each other professionally and shenanigans ensue. It gets smutty so fyi if that's a problem!

linka03(71012) "As Savage as Love" - *very dark* and features Death Eater Marcus, so if that does not intrigue you, skip this one!!!

linkffn(5109606) - "Detained" - I ADORE this one and it is unfinished, which is utterly heartbreaking because it is an amazing story and is really well written! Begins at Hogwarts and continues after they both graduate. Worth reading even though it's not finished. Marcus is not evil but he's not a boy scout either. Excellent!

Enjoy!
