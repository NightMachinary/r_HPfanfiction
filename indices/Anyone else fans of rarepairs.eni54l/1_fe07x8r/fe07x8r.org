Uhhh Katie Bell/Marcus Flint is one of my guilty pleasures. There's not a ton of fics out there but I swear I've read them all! Usually the characterization is Katie is Marcus' morality pet, and most of the time Katie is pureblood so they know each other outside of school from those circles (I don't remember Katie's blood status in canon). Sometimes Marcus is secretly anti-Voldy but his family is all up in the Death Eaters so being with her is like an escape for him.

I have never heard of Luna/Theodore but I ship Luna with everyone so why not! I am also intrigued by George/Padma, that sounds like a good time.
