  turning up to his ex-boyfriends wedding without a partner on his arm is something oliver wood refuses to do. which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't painfully single when the invitation to percy weasley's wedding dropped on his kitchen table one monday morning. with three months to find a love to take as his plus one, oliver seeks out the first person he can find who will agree to fake-date him for an evening. it's just pure coincidence that the person ends up being hawaiian shirt wearing, bar-tending marcus flint.

  When he received a letter inviting him to try out for England's National Quidditch team, Oliver had no idea that accepting the invitation would force him to confront his feelings for Marcus Flint, something that he would much rather forget about - after all, there is Quidditch to be played.
