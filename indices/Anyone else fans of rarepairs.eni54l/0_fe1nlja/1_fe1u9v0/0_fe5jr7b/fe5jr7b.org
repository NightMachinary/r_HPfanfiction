These are some that I've bookmarked.

Linkao3(14291154) I liked that one. Oliver and Katie are besties and Percy was kinda an ass for some time. Marcus is just precious in this.

Linkao3(20568335) A longer fic. After-Hogwarts and we get a lot about Quidditch.

Linkao3(5025334) This fic got me into the pairing. Very sweet and really funny. The whole series is great. All of them are little soulmate fics with different pairings. I highly rec this one.
