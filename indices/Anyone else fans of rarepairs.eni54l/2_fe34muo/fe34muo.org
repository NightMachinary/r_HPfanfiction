I am also a fan of rarepairs that have a reasonable rationale for happening. Not really sure why; maybe it's a way to make sense of how people grow up and evolve through fiction. Maybe because I'm not the person people have expected me to be. But whatever the explanation, it finds its way into my writing and reading.
