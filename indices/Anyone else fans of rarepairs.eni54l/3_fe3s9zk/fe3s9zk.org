I dig Hermione/Tonks. Sadly, there isn't much written with that ship, but it boils down to Tonks bringing out Hermione's fun side. The foil thing is a theme as well because Hermione was generally more mature for her age and Tonks acts silly and isn't ashamed of that ("the ability to behave myself"). It would be a similar dynamic to what you see in a lot of Fleur fics, but I simply find Tonks more likeable since she was friendly towards the cast when Fleur was not.

There was a very promising fic (Dignity in Fear) which had a superb depiction of emotions but was ruined when the author inserting her own opinions on LGTB solidarity. Hermione completely forgets about Harry after the DoM but tolerates a lot of shit from Lupin (but he's allowed to be a dick, he's gay and lost his crush. What about Harry? Who gives a fuck?). I wish I was exaggerating. The author even PMed me to tell me that she had no interest in writing straight characters, even if that meant excluding most of the canon cast.
