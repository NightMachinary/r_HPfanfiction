it's been a couple of years since i read them, but off the top of my head:

- war paint by provocative_envy

- nightmare by provocative_envy (she used to write a lot of them and they're all really good)

- daddy dearest by immortalobsession (v dark, a gothic victorian magical au)

- avada kedavra anonymous by speechwriter (crack!af)

there's a lot that i've heard of that are supposedly very good but haven't gotten round to reading. [[https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/mrsren96.tumblr.com/post/171127619531/tomione-fic-rec-list/amp][here]] is a link for some more recs

tomiones are usually very au. they can be very dark or they can be just a fun little au that downplay the darker parts of tom riddle. it might not be your thing and that's okay if it's not! we all have different things that float our boat
