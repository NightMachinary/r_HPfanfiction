user provocative_envy on ao3 almost exclusively writes odd pairings like this. her writing is pretty good so you might want to check her out if you haven't already. off the top of my head, she's written luna lovegood/cormac mclaggen, harry/pansy, marcus flint/cho chang and loads more.

i personally really like marcus flint/oliver wood. i'm not sure how rare that is, but yep. my guilty pleasure for grey fics is hermione granger/tom riddle (yes, i know it's Wrong, but the character explorations are /so/ fascinating).

edit: i don't know who's downvoting me for my comment for whatever reason, but if it's because i mentioned tomione, grow up. people read problematic pairings, it's not the end of the world
