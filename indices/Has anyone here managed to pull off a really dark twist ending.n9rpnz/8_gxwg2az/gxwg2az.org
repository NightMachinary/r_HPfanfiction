Remember one pre-HBP as it was still Harry/Cho where they had a kid. At some point the kid is abducted and the Golden Trio goes searching for him. Turns out it was Voldemort (who was believed to be dead). He kills Hermione and forces Harry to kill Ron (under the threat of killing his son) so that they could use different wands in order to avoid Priori Incantatem. The story ends with a fair duel in which Voldemort says "third time's a charm" and kills Harry, proceeds to kill his son and then the story ends on a cliffhanger implying a third war is about to start.
