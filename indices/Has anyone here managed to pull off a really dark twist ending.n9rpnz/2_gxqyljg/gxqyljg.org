I'm trying to remember the name of the fic, but it was Harry/Voldemort (time travel, Harry came back) and Harry teamed up with the Dark Lord to overthrow the ministry, kill Dumbledore, and take control of Wizarding Britain. The reason he agreed to team up with Voldemort was to get equal rights for creatures, including dark ones like Werewolves and Vampires, and he needed the man power and reputation that Voldemort had in his organization make it happen.

At the height of the battle when they had won everything and Voldemort turned to celebrate with him, Harry killed him. He knew that no one would follow the new regime with Voldemort as its leader. Voldemort truly did come to love Harry in the fic, so it was quite the betrayal. Up until that point it seemed like they would get their...happy?...ending, but the author wrote it really well so that it was a reasonable twist.
