Ugh, fairy magic destroys all tech in world, all muggles return to primitive life where they belong, all Muslim countries nuked, harry and co are immortal, harry has hundred druid wives, Harry gets an interdimensional Ginn lamp that lets him 'tend' to his harem in parallel, fairies take over the planet, Dumbledore and Snape are in living hell of human experimentation with their horcrux immortality.
