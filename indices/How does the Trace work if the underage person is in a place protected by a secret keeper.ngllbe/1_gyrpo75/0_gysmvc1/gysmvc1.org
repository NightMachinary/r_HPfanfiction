What do you mean? Maybe the name was not yet invented but the idea that casting spells outside of Hogwarts for underage could lead to expulsion is introduced in book 1 and the concept of trace is introduced in chapter 2 of book 2. If anything, I believe JK was too rigid in her approach and that's why Tom murdering his parents and altering the memory of his uncle seems forced: like there's no known underage wizard in the area yet the trace gets activated.
