Yeah, your approach is "What system would it be logical to set up, assuming magic can set up any system you imagine?"

Whereas my approach is to simply look at all the pieces of canon and see if it is possible to articulate a consistent system that reconciles all the textual evidence. The fact that the Trace is on people is stated clearly in the text. Once that's in place, the idea that they don't know whose Trace detects the magic is necessary to make sense of the Tom Riddle killing his family episode.

The system depicted in canon might be bad, in the sense that you wouldn't create a system like that if you had the freedom to create any system you liked, but it is at least possible to find an interpretation where it is /consistent/.

From that, I think we have to conclude that the Ministry doesn't have the freedom to make any system they can imagine, but rather tracking magic is an area of magic which is relatively undeveloped and the Ministry is attempting to make a tracking system with very limited tools.
