My theory is that the reason Dumbledore gave him permission is because he was giving permissions to do so in his role of Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwamp.

Tonks, in my theory has clearance to cast spells in a Muggle area because of her role as an Auror. Especially if she's near someone who the Ministry has accused of being delusional and insane (or had got clearance from the Head Auror or DMLE Head who believed Harry, or could have been hoodwinked into believing that Tonks was going to 'investigate' the Patronus usage, just like Shack was feeding 'information' about the location of Sirius)
