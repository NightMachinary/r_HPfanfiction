Honestly, my guess was always that Dumbledore's titles don't mean anything, other that of the Headmaster. The Ministry easily removes them when they butt heads so my best guess is that they are honorary titles. It's the Headmaster title that the Ministry has to pass a bunch of laws and even then struggles to remove until the DA is discovered. I would believe that the Headmaster still has some autonomy over the students rights considering he also represents Harry at the hearing.
