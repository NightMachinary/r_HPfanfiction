I don't actually recall Harry casting magic but Dumbledore specifically gives him permission to do so if necessary in that instance. The inconsistency is more glaring in the Death Eater chase in DH when obviously a bunch of spells are cast including by Harry. Later Harry wonders how the Ministry didn't try to expel him for his infraction and the explanation is that the Ministry is staying silent on the topic because they're worried it may cause panic if it's found out that Harry was attacked by Voldemort. But now the question is? Would they even know it was Harry in the first place since earlier it's stated that the Trace only tells you the location and the Ministry just assumes who the culprit is based on people living at that address.

Another inconsistency appears when the Advanced Guard comes to Privet Drive in OotP. Harry is under the threat of expulsion for performing underage magic yet the Order freely performs magic thus activating Harry's trace in the process and making him look like he is just casting magic around. Or maybe Tonks had clearance to pick him up.
