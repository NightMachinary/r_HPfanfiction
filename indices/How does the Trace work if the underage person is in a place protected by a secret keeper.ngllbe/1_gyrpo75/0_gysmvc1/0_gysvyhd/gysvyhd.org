Nah, like I said, what's introduced is the idea that there is a way to detect underage magic, and the most natural explanation is a location-based spell, not a spell on the person (or the wand, for that matter).

And hence, no owls for Harry when Hagrid gets him from Hut-on-the-Rock in PS (Dudley with pigtail and the charmed boat) and Hermione experiments with magic (spell hadn't been set up yet), when they visit Sluggy (Dumbledore and Slughorn repairing the house), and, for that matter, when Tom visits his relatives -- why did you think the Trace (or whatever way to detect magic) activated then? Tom got away, and the bodies of his grandparents were found by Muggles the next day, not by wizards.
