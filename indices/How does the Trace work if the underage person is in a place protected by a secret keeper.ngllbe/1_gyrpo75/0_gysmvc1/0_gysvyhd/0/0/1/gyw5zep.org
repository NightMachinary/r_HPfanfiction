A; that's not completely true and B; there may be legal ways around that.

Dumbledore isn't just the Headmaster of Hogwarts (more on that in a sec). He's also the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, although he was briefly suspended during OotP. Fanon, and nothing in canon seems to disprove this, seems to agree that CW is something like the Lord Chancellor of the House of Lords, in that it gives Dumbledore a good deal of authority of his own. There's no reason the CW wouldn't be able to, in essence, issue a temporary waiver to the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery (even if such waiver was merely a verbal acknowledgement). Also, even as Headmaster, he might have the authority to issue a waiver on educational grounds ("Harry, do you fancy some extra credit DADA work? Good lad.").
