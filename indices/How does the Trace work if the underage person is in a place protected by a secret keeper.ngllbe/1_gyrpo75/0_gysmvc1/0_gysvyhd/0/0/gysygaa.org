And Dumbledore can do that how? He's a headmaster, not the Ministry.

But regardless, my point is not that you can't contrive of a special explanation for every individual instance where Harry doesn't get an owl. My point is that the very fact that you have to do so means the Trace is a bad concept. It's hammering the square peg into the round hole: a good concept needs just one general explanation covering everything, and little or no special ones.
