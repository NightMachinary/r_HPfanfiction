#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't think you do, or this sentence makes no sense ("it" is introduced, yes, but what is "it"?). But then again, I don't really care enough to argue either. I wouldn't know how to make it clearer anyway. The relevant part is this:

#+begin_quote
  and prior to DH, it was a location-based spell, and not on the person
#+end_quote
