Dumbledore may have his hands tied in front of the Ministry (without using force)... that much we're told in the books. But he still gets some authority as a headmaster and I would assume that if he says he will permit it, it means that he will permit it without legal consequences for Harry breaking the law.

As for the trace... I'm not saying it's not inconsistent. In fact I specifically mentioned some inconsistencies I've noticed and I apologize if English might not be your first language but I don't know how else I could be clearer. However I disagree that the Trace was a retcon. In fact it was invented early on with some strict rules and JK, instead of adjusting it as the plot needed, just stuck to it as it was designed originally and found explanations that don't hold much water.
