Well, yes. What you call "inconsistent" I call the reason why it's a retcon. It's not inconsistent (in an out-of-book explanation) if you assume it didn't exist until DH, and prior to DH, it was a location-based spell, and not on the person. The evidence prior to DH neatly fits with that, so it's an 1:6 thing.

IMO, if assuming something was added later solves basically all confusions and problems, then that's what I'll do. YMMV, I guess.
