The legal implications of trace are actually stated that they only become effective after they become students at Hogwarts. I explained that Dumbledore specifically allowed Harry to use magic if necessary when they went to Slughorn. In Tom's case I'm confused as I said in my comment above. The trace should have gotten activated (and Dumbledore says it should have) yet an adult wizard got blamed for the crime. JK just says that the Ministry was happy they got someone that eagerly confessed, but seriously? No suspicion about the fact that the trace got activated? At least to confirm that there was a magical child in vicinity.
