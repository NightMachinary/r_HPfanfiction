The Trace is a nonsensical idea that retconned how underage magic detection works in and for DH. So if you can't make sense of it, that's baked into its creation.

Here's how I would answer the question /without/ Trace: There is no blanket spell that picks up magic anywhere, there's only monitor spells installed at a location. One such spell covered Privet Drive. Such a spell would not be around Grimmauld Place, so the question doesn't arise. This explains how Harry can do and be around magic during the holidays (Hagrid's magic before first year, Grimmauld Place, Slughorn's hideout, ...) and not get whacked with an owl.

/With/ the Trace you have to come up with some reason why sometimes they ignore what they pick up and sometimes they don't. As this includes your example, the first thing to note is that they /factually/ ignore the magic being done around Harry (he doesn't get any other/more owls). As for the reason -- in this case, I'd probably argue they don't pick it up in the first place, due to the spells hiding Grimmauld Place. Not necessarily (just) the Fidelius, even.

It's a lot harder to explain if Harry's Trace supposedly should have picked up magic in random Muggle locations where no hiding spells possibly could have been.
