Yeah. My view is the "Trace" started as a valid idea that quickly turned detrimental to Muggleborns. I mean, not having magic seen by non-magicals? Makes sense.

I figure there are magical spells that 'sense' magic in areas around Muggleborn homes to detect magic that are likely placed when people go to Hogwarts.

This fits with how Hermione apparently practiced magic a lot pre-Hogwarts, but never got into trouble. Which is rather unlikely with how anti-muggleborn the Ministry is, if they detected her.
