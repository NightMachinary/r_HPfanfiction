I don't think they'd follow up any magic that's done in a more magical area, and I think London has enough magical inhabitants and visitors that the Ministry wouldn't care. So Grimmauld Pl is fine.

If you put the location in a completely muggle village somewhere, I'd imagine they'd send someone to check, they wouldn't be able to find the person responsible for the magic, and they'd leave. If this happens a lot they'd maybe start wondering what's up and try to investigate it more, or they'd assume there's a magical animal or rock or something that's causing a disturbance, who knows. Or your protag could put up an enchantment in the area that makes any Ministry worker forget they didn't find the cause of the magic or something like that.

If you put the location in an area with just one other known wizard or witch, they will be thought to be responsible for the magic, not your guy underneath the fidelius charm, and if they too are underage they'll get the angry letter.
