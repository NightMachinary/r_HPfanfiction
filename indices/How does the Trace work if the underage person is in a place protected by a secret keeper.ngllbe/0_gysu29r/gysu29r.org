From what we see in canon, the information the Ministry receives from the Trace is:

1. What spell was cast, and

2. In what location.

The Ministry does not receive:

1. Who cast the spell; or

2. Whose Trace detected the spell.

As regards enforcement, the Ministry appears to operate on several assumptions:

1. Where magic is cast in a location where adult wizards are known to reside, it is assumed that adult wizards cast it.

2. The Ministry assumes pre-Hogwarts magic is accidental and does not investigate it.

3. When Ministry officials are present in a location, magic cast in that location is assumed to be cast by the Ministry officials rather than children.

The Ministry then enforces underage magic regulations by cross-referencing the information from the Trace against the locations where underage wizards are known to reside without any adult wizards in the same area.

In the case of the Fidelius, I suspect the location would be concealed. So the Trace would still work, but the only information the Ministry would receive is that a spell has been cast, without a location attached. So - completely useless.
