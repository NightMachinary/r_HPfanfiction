The closest I can think of for number 2 is that some pureblood families have "family magic", as in: they create (and hoard) a lot of strong spells and rituals that you can't just pick up from a book in Hogwarts. This doesn't make them "stronger", they just have access to better stuff.

Other than that, maybe some talents like being a metamorph or a seer makes pureblood lines stronger?

  Alternatively, whats your best interpretation of pureblood dogma that makes it technically correct?

They have a point that muggleborns don't understand, and sometimes even refuse to understand, their culture. I mean, someone like Hermione doesn't pull her punches when she insults anyone who owns a house elf and calls them slavers. And how many others (even us) have joked that quidditch doesn't make sense and is a poorly thought out sport? A pureblood looks at that and sees an outsider insulting his tradition and national sport.
