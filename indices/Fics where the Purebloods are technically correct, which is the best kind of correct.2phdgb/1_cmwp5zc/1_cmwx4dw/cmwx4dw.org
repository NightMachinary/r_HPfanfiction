For family magic, I like to think magic is somewhat sentient. So families that use the same magic over multiple generations would be "blessed" by magic to be better in that field of magic. Then that magic would then mutate into a family magic/trait.

So, if the metamorph talent was a Black trait, then maybe the Blacks were very good at transfiguration for so long that it mutated into the metamorph trait.

I also like to think that by inbreeding, the talent will disappear because the magic that could be used for the talent is instead being used to fix deformities/diseases caused by inbreeding. So Tonks, being the daughter of a muggleborn and a pureblood, would have the Black metmorph trait. Harry probably had a minor metamorph trait in him because he was able to grow his hair back using accidental magic. He was also the grandson of a Black so it would make sense.
