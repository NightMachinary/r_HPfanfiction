  The slavery point is odd... I can't for the life of me recall if its canon or fanon that the elves need to leech magic out of the wizard they're bonded to in order to live.

There is, as far as I know, no canon evidence that House-Elves /need/ wizards for anything at all. We know of two freed elves: Dobby, who does OK, considering the culture he came from; and Winky, who descends into depression and alcoholism, but, her elf-nature aside, she got unjustly fired from a job that she's had all her life, /betrayed/ by a family she loved, and almost all her peers have nothing but contempt for her --- and they aren't hiding it. How well would a typical human do under those circumstances? However, neither of them appear to be magically diminished in any way.

We do know that elf ownership is magically enforced: when Harry orders Kreacher to shut up in the beginning of HBP (or was it end of OotP?), Kreacher begins to /suffocate/. From Dobby and Kreacher, we also know that House-Elves can /want/ to change their ownership state or owner and can take steps and opportunities to advance that goal.

So, they are beings with sapience, self-awareness, consciousness, as well as free will and wants, who have, at least as far as canon evidence is concerned, bondage imposed on them magically, and reinforced through culture developed over centuries of said bondage. So, yes, they are enslaved people or, at the very least, any elf that serves an owner that he or she does not want to serve is certainly an enslaved person. Canon examples include Dobby (who wants to be free) and Kreacher (who wants to serve Narcissa or Bellatrix, rather than Sirius or Harry).

That said, there are some fanfics, or at least fan-speculation, that postulate that they are some kind of bound demon/imp/gremlin race that tried to conquer wizardkind and paid the price, and, if freed, they would eventually devolve back to teleporting, telekinetic terrors that they are. That might be something the purebloods are right about. However, there is no canon evidence of it, that I know of.

(Also, possible headcanon: the reason Hermione suspended her campaign to free House-Elves is that she found out about their true nature, but she didn't have the heart to tell Harry what Dobby was really about (or to admit that she was wrong), and their true nature probably wouldn't resurface until several generations without the cultural conditioning anyway, so no harm done...)

  The culture one is a fair point, in that it explains why the purebloods are against muggleborns without ceding that the muggleborns aren't perfectly justified in their scoffing at pureblood 'culture'
#+end_quote

Agreed. It's a good example of it being understandable, without being justified or right.
