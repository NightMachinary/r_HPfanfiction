I am not necessarily defending Hermione here: it was most certainly not one of her finer moments [1]. A possible extension to the above headcanon is that Hermione read all about the mechanisms for freeing house-elves and the magic involved, but she hasn't though to talk to some to understand the culture that resulted. That seems like a very Hermione error to make.

At the same time, I don't think that we should fall into cultural relativism, either: that it's another culture is a weak argument, especially when membership in said culture is almost always coerced, and even when it's not, trying to leave it leads to ostracism at best; and when this culture is a product of millennia of magical slavery, a particularly insidious form given the self-punishment compulsion that seems to accompany it. Could offering the house-elves an opportunity, that they don't have to take, to free themselves have been the least bad option?

Ultimately, we do not know what an elf born and raised free would actually desire. (It may well be something horrible, which is why they are all enslaved.)

[1] On the other hand, it puts a lie to the fanon notion that Hermione is particularly obedient to authority: she went against /every/ authority in the society, universal ridicule, and with her few friends being indifferent at best, in order to follow the dictates of her conscience.
