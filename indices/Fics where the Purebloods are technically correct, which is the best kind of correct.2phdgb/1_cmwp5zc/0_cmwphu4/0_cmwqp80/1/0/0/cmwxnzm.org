That works. An elf's owner deliberately freeing an elf is not just giving him or her clothes, he or she is also ordering him or her to take them. Similarly, when clothes are given for a specific purpose, an elf may have other orders regarding them.

That would actually make Hermione's strategy make sense. Every piece of clothing left by her (a student of Hogwarts, the elves' "owner"), especially with intent to free elves, that a house-elf finds is an /opportunity/ for the house-elf to choose to be free, even if she can't order them to accept it. So, maybe she got the mechanics of freeing the the house-elves. Her problem was their culture: they not only did not choose to take this opportunity, they considered it an insult.
