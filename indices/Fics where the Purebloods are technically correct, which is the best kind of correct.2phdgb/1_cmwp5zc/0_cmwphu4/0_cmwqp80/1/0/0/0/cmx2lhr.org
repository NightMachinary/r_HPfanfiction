To be honest though her intentions were good, you could accuse Hermione of being a bit of a 'white feminist' - automatically assuming her culture and her position on another culture's 'suffering' is right without (ironically enough for Hermione) properly doing her research.

I like Hermione, but I do thing her problem-solving skills are off in this one. She wants to free the house-elves on principle without taking into account that they appear to actually desire to work and that not working sends them into depression. Although to be fair it's probably exacerbated by the fact that Ron and others around her continually say things like 'they like being enslaved' - word choice is key when what he really means is they like keeping busy.
