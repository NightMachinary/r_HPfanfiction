Oh absolutely, thought experiment and consider the options, I didn't mean to appear as if I was arguing with what you said, just expanding.

EDIT: I have just thought as well; the characters we see in Harry Potter are in a postwar context where there appears to be peace but truly there's a lot of polarisation. The house-elves at Hogwarts seem to be largely happy; whereas elves like Dobby who served a Death Eater family seem to be more under duress and torn between morals and duties. Perhaps Hermione is just not taking Dobby's context into consideration when applying her logic - Dobby is x, therefore all house-elves are x. Put that way, it almost seems as if Hermione is being a bit racist by taking Dobby as a spokesperson for his 'race', when he is one elf who was basically magical Britain's version of the butler for the Mafia and the nanny for their kids; other elves seem in general blindly loyal to their masters, and I'm not sure I remember any house-elf but Dobby doing the self-punishing.
