Do we know this? It runs completely against all descriptions of Hermoine's character that she doesn't attempt to research elves - Hermoine researches everything, and canon doesn't ever have a pureblood wizard knowledgeably contradicting her positions.

Further, Hermoine founds SPEW in 4th year - the year right after she's spent lots of time researching (the apparent lack of) creature rights for Buckbeak's trial and then dealt with the prejudice the magical world has against werewolves.

Actually, looking it up, the first thing Hermoine says when she introduces SPEW is:

  “I've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now.”

Which is exactly what you'd expect of Hermoine.
