Now imagine a House Elf actively ordered to do it's level best bar none to "solve" a problem, a problem that might happen to be /you/. When you're done gibbering and regain your composure, ask yourself what the odds are that no one, in the history of ever, thought of that?

Even if 'common sense' says not to so so among purebloods who grew up knowing what house elves were before they were defeated (which we can't say for sure happened) history is rife with people making poor decisions in the face of a bad situation. Letting your bound house elf regain some experience with mischief is a tomorrow problem, your rival doing X Y and Z are today problems, the bloody bugger.

Edit: or maybe they did... hmmm... Harry never does ask /why/ life was so bad for elves under Voldemort's first reign of terror... maybe someone did send their elf to solve the problem, and Voldemort survived... which isn't hard to imagine given the steps he took even early on.

That could be an interesting fic... Hermione starts freeing elves... and wizards start vanishing without a trace.
