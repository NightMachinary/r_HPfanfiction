  That said, there are some fanfics, or at least fan-speculation, that postulate that they are some kind of bound demon/imp/gremlin race that tried to conquer wizardkind and paid the price, and, if freed, they would eventually devolve back to teleporting, telekinetic terrors that they are.

Whoever says they need to be freed for this to happen has never read book 2. That was Dobby when he was being /helpful/. Canon house elves are, or ought to be, terrifying to wizardkind. It only takes one witch or wizard looking over at their enthusiastic minion and lamenting that no one will rid them of this one turbulent priest... I'm surprised house elves are banned by the Wizarding Geneva conventions.
