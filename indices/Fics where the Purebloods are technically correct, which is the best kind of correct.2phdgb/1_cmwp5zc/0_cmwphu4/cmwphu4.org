Oh... I knew I was forgetting something(s). Though the only metamorphmagus we can confirm in canon is a halfblood. I have read a few fics where this is a Black family trait that crops up occasionally. Secret family recipe spells is an obvious one that I should have remembered, and indisputably valid.

The slavery point is odd... I can't for the life of me recall if its canon or fanon that the elves need to leech magic out of the wizard they're bonded to in order to live. If they do, then calling it a symbiotic relationship between lazy wizard and starving elf is fair. If it isn't... then elves are technically slaves. I just can't recall which of the many interactions between Dobby and THE GREAT HARRY POTTER SIRS GRANGEY is canon at the moment.

The culture one is a fair point, in that it explains why the purebloods are against muggleborns without ceding that the muggleborns aren't perfectly justified in their scoffing at pureblood 'culture' since lets face it, Quidditch is a very nonsensical sport, written to be a narrative device / foreshadowing rather than a well designed game. Not that any real life sport sounds any better if you word the description with the intent of being off putting. See Robin Williams describe golf for instance. "18 <BLEEPING> times"
