Based on the 'pain develops power' idea, some immortal survivor of the old Earth (Harry, Voldemort, Herpo the Foul) stumbles over the Necromonger culture and realizes that they're channeling the magic that most wizards lost connection with when they left Earth behind. Quest ensues. Bodies accumulate. Sentences shorten.
