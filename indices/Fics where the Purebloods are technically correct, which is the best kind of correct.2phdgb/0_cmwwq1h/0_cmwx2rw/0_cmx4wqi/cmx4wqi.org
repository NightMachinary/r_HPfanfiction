Also works for DBZ crossovers.

The "baby being born" with vague powers part of the prophecy wasn't what scared him. There's a good reason why Voldemort is afraid of anyone who's survived fighting him as many as three times, and that just reminded him how dangerous that could be in the long run.

Gotta wonder: when Voldemort bumps into Harry while trying to steal the Stone (after the third time the kid survives an attack from him, remember? [baby AK, broom attack, unicorn luncheon]), and given how he grew up being punched all the time (at least) by his cousin...what's the scouter say about the kid's power level?

Still, Voldemort is a combat machine. Looks like it's time for Harry to go to +space+ Atlantis to train under 100 times Earth's normal magical field.

Wait, why does Hermione (the unusually powerful "muggle-born") have a tail again? Is it really from that magical cat potion thing earlier in the year?
