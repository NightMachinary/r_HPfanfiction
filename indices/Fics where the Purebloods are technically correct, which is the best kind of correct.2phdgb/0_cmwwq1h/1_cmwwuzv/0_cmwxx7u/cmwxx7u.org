It works as a fanfic premise, but I'm pretty sure it's disconfirmed by canon: if magical power is a thing (which I don't quite agree with in the first place), Hermione is at the very least second most powerful in her cohort year, probably the first. (That depends on headcanon regarding the Patronus Charm.)

Also, when Arianna Dumbledore was assaulted why was it Albus who gained Power rather than her?
