Albus Dumbledore just cares so much about what other people feel. He's a super great guy to everyone and can't stand to see them suffer because it breaks his soft heart every time.

... actually, I think the main reason he acts like he cares is because he knows that deep down he doesn't and that is not a good thing. Grindelwald and their dreams of ruling over muggles, resenting his family for needing to take care of his sister, knowing Harry was treated badly by the Dursleys and sending him there despite it, Snape (too many to examples to enumerate here), Sirius (see Snape), and so on. He understands that he needs to be better and really tries. It's an artificial conscience, but it is a lot better than none.
