Magical power grows through adversity. To an infant, being near magic is painful. At first they didn't realize it, but pureblood families are essentially torturing their children from birth. It's worse when they live in heavily warded houses, like the Malfoys. Once you can use a wand, you've got enough internal strength that ambient magic doesn't hurt.

Harry Potter had blood wards and a magical scar to provide magical adversity, even stronger than most purebloods experience, guaranteeing him strength no matter what. Being locked in a cupboard and beaten repeatedly strengthened him further. Neville had some similar experiences in his childhood, and Ron had his brothers to provide trouble. Hermione had a somewhat lonely but non-abusive childhood far from magic, so she is unfortunately weak.

The reason Voldemort uses the Cruciatus Curse on his own followers is to make them more powerful. It's not a fast process, but it does work.
