I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.
