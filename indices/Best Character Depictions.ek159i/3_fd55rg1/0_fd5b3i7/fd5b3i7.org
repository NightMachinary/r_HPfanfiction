To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Harry/Ginny. The pairing is extremely subtle, and without a keen eye for clues, will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's self-sacrificial outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Bible, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this pairing, to realise that it's not just romantic- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Harry/Ginny truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the phrase "monster in his chest", which itself is a cryptic reference to Dan O'Bannon's Alien. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as JKR's genius wit unfolds itself on their pages. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚
