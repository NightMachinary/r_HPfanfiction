all i can add is that there hasn't been one fic i've read in the millions and millions of words hundreds-thousands of fics (think i've been reading fanfics for 17 years - with a few years gap in late teens) that has written an accurate to Rowling characterisation ginny/harry story that pics up on the subtle aspects of the relationship from cannon. tbh i've only read two reddit posts where people picked up on the subtleties of the relationship so i don't expect to ever find a fanfic hitting this point.
