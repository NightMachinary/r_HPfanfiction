  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.
