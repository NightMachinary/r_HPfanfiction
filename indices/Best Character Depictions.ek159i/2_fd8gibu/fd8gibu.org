Here are my recommendations, although just because they match my head canon does not of course mean they match that of others.

There are a couple of fics from Hermione's POV that IMHO have depicted her character perfectly. They are: linkao3(Coven by Naidhe) linkao3 (Manacled by SenLinYu)

Coven is a WIP.

Also this one of both Hermione and Remus ( his POV) linkao3(Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow by TheDivineComedian)
