Forgot to add why as requested by the OP. I see Hermione as desperately smart as well as desperately lonely - and therefore clinging to her friendship with Harry and Ron even though they don't really have much in common. Both the Hermione POV fics that I listed show Hermione growing apart from the boys, and that is a character arc that makes sense to me. She is also more likely, IMHO, as she grows up to question Dumbledore's precepts, because she has such an inquiring mind that the blind faith that she displays in canon wouldn't persist into adulthood. Both 'Coven' and 'Manacled' depict this growing disillusionment. I know there are a lot of Hermione haters on this forum, and, to pre-empt the inevitable responses, I really don't care what you think of her, what I've described above is my head canon. You don't have to share it.

For the Remus story, the author says that they wrote 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' to make sense of the mess that is Remus' character in DH, and I think the fic succeeds in that.
