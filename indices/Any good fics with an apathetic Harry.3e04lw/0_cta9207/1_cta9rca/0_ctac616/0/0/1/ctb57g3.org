  When Petunia had to allow her hated nephew into her home, she'd expected troubles to arise sooner or later. Nothing though could have prepared her for the reality of what was to come. The boy sleeping under her roof, eating her food, wasting her money, was no normal child, oh no. It was an evil little demon hiding beneath innocent features. My take on sociopath!Harry.
