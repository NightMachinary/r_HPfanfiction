The fic that sprang to mind when I saw the thread was linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by leadvone). Dumbledore is concerned about young Harry's skills and attempts to frame him so he can be sent to Azkaban.

It's a bit of a divisive fic, but I like it well enough for you what it is.
