I know right. Imagine being student of Jogwarts abd hearing about HP killing a professor, saving some, killing big ass snake and protecting school, driving dementirs away, winning a deadly tournament against 3 year older kids, leading a revolutionary army so much so that whole ministry targets you, and killing the darkest lord with du disarm spell!

Unbelievable!

Of Its not than why does Haryy sometime using at an incompetent adult surprise you? After all in canon Harry had to do all these things only because adults were incompetent.

Is it really this hard to believe that a kid who can drive 100 dementoos away could be taken seriously?
