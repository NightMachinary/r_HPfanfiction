Honestly, in a super Harry story, it would make sense that Dumbledore would be frightened of his power and want to reign him in and control him. You have someone who seems ready to abuse their power even more than Voldemort, and Dumbledore has now seen two young men with great power grow up and plunge Europe into war and chaos. How could he NOT try and prevent another disaster like this?

A story like this told from Dumbledore's perspective, where he is a tragic hero figure, would be excellent. You could go one of two ways: where Dumbledore succeeds but is villainized by everyone but Harry, who allows Dumbledore to be villainized as ultimately what Dumbledore wanted was for Harry to be on the straight and narrow, and if that takes him being remembered poorly, he would accept it. Dumbledore died knowing he succeeded, and views his life as well spent.

The other is that Dumbledore fails, and Harry ends up as the Dark Lord's successor. Dumbledore is remembered well and used as a rallying cry against the new Dark Lord, but had to die knowing that he allowed three Dark Lords to rise in his day and that ultimately his life was a failure.
