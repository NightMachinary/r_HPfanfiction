Third way. In the end, we find that dumbledore never died, that he was partial successful, that he curbed the war, but it was still successful. Instead of a dark lord, we have a gray lord. Instead of a dictatorship we have paradise. And have the story end with dumbledore writing "all it cost was my relationship with one of the greatest men i had ever known. " then have dumbledore put the quill down, stand up and be directed out of the room as if he was a prisoner.
