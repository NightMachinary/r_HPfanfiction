An oldie but a goodie. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1242&chapno=1]] This is Ron-centric story about love potions and the OWLs; it was written forever ago. As long as you are not too concerned with canon compliance, this is completely worth reading. It's one of my all time favorites!
