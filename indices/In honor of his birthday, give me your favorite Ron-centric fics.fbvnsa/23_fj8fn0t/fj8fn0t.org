ok so I don't know the name so please if you can identify it do so. it is distinct on ffn the to identify it is a story based of a harmony time-travel ship that harry or Hermione attack on before entering platform 9 3/4 for first year in the story I am suggesting this incident causes a good different ron to take his younger selfs place(younger ron's soul left not merged i think), the story follows rons choices but he has problems stemming from what bad future ron did to harry and Hermione. and though I would recommend the first story also that one bashes ron.
