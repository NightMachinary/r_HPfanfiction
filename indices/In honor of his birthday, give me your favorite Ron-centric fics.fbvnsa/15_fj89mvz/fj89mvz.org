Linkffn (I've Had Enough) on ff.net is a story where Ron and Harry run away together when they're really young. From what I remember it focused heavily on Ron and his family, and showed him as a brave, selfless, an empathetic person. Also some family drama with the Weaslys and Ron trying to come to terms with some issues. A good read, its just a shame it was never finished.
