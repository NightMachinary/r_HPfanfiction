Agreed but the thing is kids are dumb. They do argue about the same thing multiple l. Siblings often hash out the same arguments quite a few times before they're done. But it does get annoying regardless of believability. Third year is better than second as people start to grow up somewhat and resolve their issues.

That said everyone does curse far to frequently in the fic, your right. I cursed a lot growing up but I've got nothing on them lol.
