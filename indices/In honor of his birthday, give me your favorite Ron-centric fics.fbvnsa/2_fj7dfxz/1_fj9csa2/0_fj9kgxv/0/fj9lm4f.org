Knowing it's happening is fine but having to reading about it repeatedly is the problem. Even in cannon the trio have the same arguments over and over about Brooms or Rats or Draco or House Elves or Krum. But Rowling knew to summarize several months worth of arguments into a short paragraph and only actually wrote the individual argument scenes out when new information came to light and they had something different to discuss.

In Fate it feels like the briefest mention of Hermione has Daphne and Ron going at it again for another chapter.

And to me it's not the cursing so much as every swear being "shite" . Regardless of who's talking.
