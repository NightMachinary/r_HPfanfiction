Since no one has mentioned this monster yet I'll add linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) . Definitely a huge fic and one that evolves Ron in a unique way. It's slow paced which can be a major turn off for some readers and has him as a Slytherin. Currently one of a few fics that I'm actively interested in.
