Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12632781/1/]]) Powerful Ron with a power he doesnt know how to use. Incredibly well written. Incomplete but the author will be updating.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]). PeggySue Ron that died in the Hogwarts Battle coming back to first year. 

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]). AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.
