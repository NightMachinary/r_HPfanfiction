Anything by Queen Nightingale (her work is poetry, but mostly one-shots) Linkffn(An Unexpected Attraction by NJRM) - sort of long/draggy, but I remember liking it Linkffn(Buried Treasure and Transmogrify)\\
Linkffn(A Burnt Marshmellow by drwatsonn) - Remus/OC, a lot of Marauder though Linkffn(Fog and Fire by MaMaquillerie) - not Jily-centric, but has Jily and I like how they're written
