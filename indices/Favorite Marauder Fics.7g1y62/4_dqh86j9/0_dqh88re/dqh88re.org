  Sherlock proposes to John. The evening entails of a triple murder, Lestrade can't keep a secret, fondue fights at Angelo's and a punch up on Waterloo Bridge. Nothing can ever be simple for our boys, can it? Humour/Fluff. Part 2: now with Mummy's reaction!

  She was a pureblood supremacist trapped inside a wall of ice, and he was an inquisitive wizard with a soft heart of chocolate. They were never meant to cross paths, and yet, despite all the odds, they do. Will she be able to uphold the duty she swore to her family and its legacy? Or will she surrender everything, including her soul, for the unlikeliest of creatures? (RL/OC)

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.

  Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first...at least that's what she thought.
