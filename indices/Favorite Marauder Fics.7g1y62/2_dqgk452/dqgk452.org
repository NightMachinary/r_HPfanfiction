There is a Marauders' era [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/73d3wd/best_marauderera_fics_wiki/][section]] in the list of frequent recommendation.

I really enjoyed linkffn(Not Fade Away) despite its abandonment. Slide's depiction of muggleborn-pureblood relations captured the casual 'blood-ism', both at Hogwarts and outside, along with the systemic bigotry in a manner that I find tremendously realistic in both its depth and breadth.

Both canon and original characters were well written. The familiar characters were characterized similar enough to the stereotypical to feel familiar but distinct enough to stand out.
