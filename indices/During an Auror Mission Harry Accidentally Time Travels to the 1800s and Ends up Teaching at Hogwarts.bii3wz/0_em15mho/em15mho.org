Yeah, wow. When I read the title I was thinking "Why the 1800's? Nothing happens during that time". And I completely forgot that Dumbledore was alive then. I've seen fics where Harry mentor's himself, or teaches Voldemort as a kid, or teaches his parents; but never Dumbledore. That could be fun.

I just looked it up right now. Dumbledore was born in 1881, so he would have started in 91 or 92. I guess it still counts as the 1800's if it's in the last decade.
