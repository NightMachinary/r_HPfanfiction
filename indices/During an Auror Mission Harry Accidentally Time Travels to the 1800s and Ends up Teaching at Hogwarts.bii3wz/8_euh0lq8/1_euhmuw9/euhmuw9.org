That's a really cool fic except that if indeed Harry time-travelled he really wouldn't be into Dumbledore. In fact this whole thing is disturbing. He was a student in his school with many years of difference and then his headmaster with also quite some years of difference and despite JKR's way of doing things recently, Harry really isn't gay. But except this tiny detail it was a great fic. It's surprising Harry didn't do more to help Ariana sooner.

Finally I would have loved to see a showdown Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore where Dumbledore loses but in the end Harry saves the day and vanquishes him (a bit like Harry was saved in the Ministry by Dumbledore).
