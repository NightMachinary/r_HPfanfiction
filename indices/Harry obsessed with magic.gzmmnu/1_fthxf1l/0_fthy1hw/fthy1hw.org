Snippet:

“Very well, Mister Potter,” Professor Snape said in his classroom Tuesday after dinner. “You will be recreating your scrubbing bubbles potion tonight. Proceed.” And Professor Snape sat down and watched Harry work with fixed and focused attention, and it was right up there with some of Harry's worst nightmares. Especially since he could feel Voldemort's attention as a cool, scaly sensation in his head. Harry was in the midst of grinding his myrtle leaves when Professor Snape said, “What are you doing?” “Grinding myrtle leaves, Professor.” “Those are fresh.” “The recipe doesn't specify.” “No one with any sense would grind fresh myrtle leaves, Potter. Fresh leaves are not crushed before adding them to a potion.” “This is what I did, Professor.” Professor Snape's nostils flared, but he gestured Harry to proceed. Harry continued his brewing, trying to tune out everything but his potion, including the increased pain in his scar. Finally, his potion gleaming a pale yellow, he tapped the side of the cauldron three times with his wand, focusing his magic on movement, activity, cleaning, cheer. “What was that?” Professor Snape asked sharply. “I tapped the side of the cauldron three times. The instructions do say-“ “That was not tapping. That was broad swishes of your wand, as if you were charming.” Professor Snape scowled at him. Harry looked blankly back, and checked his potion. It had turned the appropriate milky-pearly white the directions indicated was finished. “Bottle it, and we will see if the effect has been replicated.” Harry did as he was told, ignoring his audience, and shortly was pouring a stream of white soapsuds back out of its glass flask. It blinked open green eyes and blew bubbles at him with a birdlike chirp. “You are making me very angry, Potter,” Professor Snape said, staring at it blankly.
