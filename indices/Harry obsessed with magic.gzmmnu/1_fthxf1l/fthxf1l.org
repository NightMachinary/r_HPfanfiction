[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629?view_full_work=true][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]]

I have been recommending this one left and right. I just love the dynamic between Harry and Snape, how Snape is still an asshole and didn't turn into some super protective righteous vanguard for Harry like the mentor Snape trope often turns into. Voldemort is great as well as a snarky geek who is still, ultimately, a bad guy.

Harry experiments a lot with potions, creating candies such as calming chocolates, blood replenishing cherry bombs, concentration mints. Accidentally creates semi sentient cleaning... Blob. Writes a paper on it. Author throws in dashes of potion ingredients and ancient runes for these recipes.

Very satisfying character development and ending, everyone is still basically the same only Harry just loves Potions to death so hes a lot more willing to grow a thick skin around Snape.
