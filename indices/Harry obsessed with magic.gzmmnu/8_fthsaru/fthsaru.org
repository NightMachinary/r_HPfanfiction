It always infuriates me in fanfiction where Harry only cares about Quidditch and puts the bare minimum amount of effort in. Like, dude, you have the power to fucking warp reality. You are at a SCHOOL for MAGIC with SPELL BOOKS available to read whenever you like!!! If I was at Hogwarts, I would never leave the library. Except to find somewhere quiet and practice magic, because fuck yeah I'd take every chance I can to learn new spells. It's MAGIC.
