Would you feel the same if you grew up in a house that hated even the word magic? Where you never really read into it too much? He cant read a harry potter book. Hes thrown into a world hes been conditioned to hate. Hes probably confused as all fuck. Especially because hes 11. 11 year olds dont have the capacity to think "Holy shit this is awesome let me learn this" because its a school about it. They have to do magic homework. I personally in his situation wouldnt be very fascinated. Ofcourse I would do the exact same thing as you but this is all circumstantial.
