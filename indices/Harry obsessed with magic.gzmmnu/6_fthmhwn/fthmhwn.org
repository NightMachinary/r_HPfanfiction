[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]

first in a series of around 600k words, total. pretty AU, good story overall. goes pretty in depth into Blood Magic, also has necromancy, soul magic, thread magic, and stone magic, among others, mentioned.

Fair warning, it has little to do with most of the Harry Potter characters, other than Harry and occasionally Alastor Moody, and is set mostly outside of magical britain.

while there are hints of slash among some of the secondary characters, nothing is explicit.

also has a rather large emphasis on different magical races, vampires being the most prominent, other than demons (who invade the world in the latter part of the series).

story is also abandoned at this point.
