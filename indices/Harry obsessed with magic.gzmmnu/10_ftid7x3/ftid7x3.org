In The Life He Leads by GeneralStarfox, Harry is really interested in Northern magic, iirc. It's a fanon creation, but he does geek on it a lot and compare it quite thoroughly to "normal" magic. The fic is quite long but I think the author thought of abandoning it a while ago. So maybe we'll never have the rest.
