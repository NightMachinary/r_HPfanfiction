There was one, I think called "Geek of Magic" that I really loved. Basically, Harry is like an idiot savant, incredible at magic but so consumed with learning it he is abnormal.

It features a really likeable Ron (who has to do things like get Harry to class, have him eat, etc) and a Luna that encourages his mania. So fun, though I don't believe it was finished.
