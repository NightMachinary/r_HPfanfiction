Blindness is a good fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

Another good fanfic I like is Barefoot. It's incomplete though. So read it at the risk of your own frustration. Harry is not geeky. But super smart. It's also unbelievable and funny. Just a decent read.

Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not.
