I would love to read a fic where Draco realises early (3 year or earlier, preferably before he called her a mudblood) that the whole pureblood dogma is bullshit because the best student is a muggleborn. I don't expect "I love muggles" on a baseball cap, but some acceptance at least. This is the only way I see Draco/Hermione happening. Where he defends Hermione if Ron is a prat (as usual) or if some other Slytherins talk shit about her. Because he stopped seeing her as the mudblood and sees her as the awesome, loyal witch she is.

This story could include some hilarious scenes with Draco and the Grangers.
