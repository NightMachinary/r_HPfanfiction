He is not an anti hero in these, but these 2 fics are good:

linkffn(Exile) Draco is sentenced to live with out magic for a while so he ends up running off to the muggle world. Has some entertaining moments of what it's like for a wizard that has no clue about muggle culture having to figure everything out.

linkffn(The malfoy case) Draco/Astoria fic that follows Draco's trial after the war. Has some good writing and provides a realistic version of events post war.
