Try Blindness, or any number of fics like that - there're a bunch of fics about how the basilisk venom does stuff to him, the dementors have unforeseen consequences etc - have a stroll through the top 100 HP fanfics on ffn and you'll find quite a few, in a way Basiliskborn might also qualify? It all depends on interpretation tbh, but Blindness is probably the best example
