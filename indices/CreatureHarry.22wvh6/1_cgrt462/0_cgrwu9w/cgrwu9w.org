So its a Basilisk!Harry, and slash with an OC (OC is really well done so no worries there, and author calls it pre-slash because although they have feelings for one another, they're not physical about it.). The story is well written and paced, I think you'd enjoy it.

There's a sequel too, but which isn't finished.
