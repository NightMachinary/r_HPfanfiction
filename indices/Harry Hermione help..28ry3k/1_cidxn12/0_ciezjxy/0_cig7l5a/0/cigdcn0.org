Judging from the story summaries I've seen potion accidents?

What's always confused me about it most is /why/ that "plot" was used in the first place. Stories exist to explain (Thor and Thunder), reinforce or retell an underlying mythos (Good/Evil wins, Bildungsroman), or to entertain (Shallow aren't we, wish-fulfillment, Crackfic)

One or two I could see as an experiment. New perspectives and fresh insights can be found in subverting typical forms.

But there are so damn many of them! The only thing I can come up with is sexual -- either gratification or an exploration of gender, homosexuality, and/or pregnancy. It permits the author to maintain a male/masculine character and still integrate female/feminine "traits", physiologies, and gender roles.

Although frankly if that's what the author is attempting, they should go read Eugenides' /Middlesex/ among other works.
