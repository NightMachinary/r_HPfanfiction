I've had a lot of trouble finding GOOD fics where Harry is some kind of half-blood creature or infected with lycanthropy/vampirism, and those that have at least okay writing are abandoned pretty much always. I'd love to see Harry is a _____ done well - unfortunately like you've said, the only completed ones I've found are crack.
