That's the beauty of fanfiction :)) So that you can write/read what you would have like to happen instead.. or change whatever you want to be able to enjoy it to your liking. Everybody will have different opinions about this and about everything really. And the good news is, there is enough fanfiction to satisfy most opinions.

Personally, i really like the stories where they show Harry actively tranining and/or learning so he would better be able to defeat Voldemort.

There's this amazing writer who sadly has stopped and vanished since a long time.. but she has written two particular stories which i adore, for this exact reason. One story starts after the end of the fifth year, and the other after the start of the sixth year. And they both show Harry actively invovled.
