I really feel what you wrote. I agree largely with the things you say. I feel like you would grow up with a sense of anger, especially since you don't fully understand what happened to your parents. In year 1 you learn more about it, and this would anger me more and would make me want revenge in some way. At the end of year 1 you find out there are still threats to your live. This would be the point were the need for power would feel more urgent, as i now know that there are still people out there who want to hurt me.
