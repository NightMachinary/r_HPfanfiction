  Hide my true feelings at a much earlier age, which probably leads to some kind of natural occlumency
#+end_quote

I disagree. That would mean pretty much every orphan/slytherin would know occlumency. That is not the case.

#+begin_quote
  Able to perceive threat instinctively
#+end_quote

Not really. You wouldn't develop Spidey Senses. At most you'd be able to recognise the attributes of a person that could mean you harm.

#+begin_quote
  Defensive and excellent self preservation skill
#+end_quote

Or meek and submissive due to massive abuse. Depends on the personallity.

#+begin_quote
  Ruthless and vindictive, and will resort to violence to protect my interests
#+end_quote

Again, it could lead to the exact opposite.

#+begin_quote
  Hunger for powers and abilities to determine my own fate
#+end_quote

Agreed.

#+begin_quote
  Strong hate against arrogant, entitled, privileged, and spoiled assholes
#+end_quote

So, Strong Hate against....James Potter, Sirius Black, Snape(technically not entitled or privileged), and pretty much everyone at Hogwarts. Everyone is entitled, spoiled, priviledged compared to Harry. And many were also Assholes during Book 2, 4, 5, 6.

#+begin_quote
  Did they leave me more than the gold in Gringotts?
#+end_quote

Seeing your massive vault of gold, I doubt that question would arrise.

#+begin_quote
  Why did I end up with my horrible Muggle relatives? Who put me there?
#+end_quote

Fair. Although Hagrid answers that, IIRC

#+begin_quote
  How could I defeat him as a baby?
#+end_quote

I doubt you could answer the "defeat" part. Alt

#+begin_quote
  Who was this Voldemort?
#+end_quote

Fair

#+begin_quote
  What is that killing curse?
#+end_quote

I mean....it's kinda in the name, isn't it?

#+begin_quote
  Who were Voldemort's supporters? Are any still around?
#+end_quote

Fair

#+begin_quote
  Who are the important people in magical world? Who could be friendly to me and help me? Who could be my enemies and dangerous to me?
#+end_quote

Fair, although the last bits would be difficult to judge for an 11 year old.

#+begin_quote
  That Draco Malfoy seems to be an arrogant shithead just like Dudley.
#+end_quote

""My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. "

Although Harry was reminded of Dudley, all in all, in this conversation, Draco seems like a normal kid.

#+begin_quote
  Some books speculate that his family was following that Voldemort. So, if Voldemort's people are all like that, then they are my Enemies.
#+end_quote

Consider that false accusations are a big thing. It is entirely possible to assume that he was mind controlled as he claimed. Certainly Voldemort would have no issue doing that. Also, only Dumbledore's side(for the lack of better word) thought he was bad. Everyone else bought the Imperius excuse, IIRC. So, I'm not sure if the books would speculate about that.

#+begin_quote
  Could I ask him directly?
#+end_quote

Somehow I doubt that you would feel the need to ask a well documented massmurderer about your parents death. That seems to be heavily ignoring emotions.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, what powers could a wizard have? Can I learn them? How long do I need to learn them?
#+end_quote

Fair.

#+begin_quote
  I would definitely feel furious at how I was being treated at the Dursleys. Right there, I would swear to become so powerful one day that I would exact terrible revenge upon anyone who had led me to my current circumstances
#+end_quote

Logical. Would you follow through if Dumbledore explained why he did it?

#+begin_quote
  I would swear to totally break that arrogant asshole Draco Malfoy
#+end_quote

"I met this boy who I thought was a bit entitled. I swear I am going to fucking destroy him"

Wow. No words.

#+begin_quote
  I would swear to destroy this Voldemort if he was still alive and everyone who had followed him
#+end_quote

What about those who possibly were forced to serve hin under the Imperius?

#+begin_quote
  and beating up would be bullies.
#+end_quote

I don't think you would have thar power yet.
