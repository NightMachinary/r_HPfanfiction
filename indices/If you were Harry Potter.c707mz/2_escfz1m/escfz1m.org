Canon Harry was already throwing around Unforgivables in Book 7. He even crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall. Only because the series is written for children, did JKR not let her teen heroes kill. But she's mightily proud of Molly killing Bellatrix, so I don't think she's that much a pacifist herself.

Of course, JKR desperately wanted to write a wizard Jesus analogy in which innocence and passive sacrifice won the day. Maybe it's not such a bad message for our already very edgy kids, but I'm beyond the stage at which fairytales are still enjoyable for me.

As to how I would have done in his place, I have to admit I'm nowhere near as brave as him. The Hat would likely sort me into either Ravenclaw or Slytherin. However, knowing that children of my Enemies were mostly in Slytherin, I would have fought tooth and nail to avoid that house.

Growing up in abusive household like the Dursleys should affect my personality in significant ways:

- Able to perceive threat instinctively
- Defensive and excellent self preservation skill
- Hide my true feelings at a much earlier age, which probably leads to some kind of natural occlumency
- Ruthless and vindictive, and will resort to violence to protect my interests
- Strong hate against arrogant, entitled, privileged, and spoiled assholes (Dudley and Draco)
- Hunger for powers and abilities to determine my own fate

When the magical world opened up to this alternate me, I would pour over books purchased in Diagon Alley. I think even as an 11 years old, I should be able to come up with these basic questions:

- Who were my parents? Where are their friends? Did they leave me more than the gold in Gringotts?
- Why did I end up with my horrible Muggle relatives? Who put me there?
- Who was this Voldemort? How could I defeat him as a baby? What is that killing curse?
- Who were Voldemort's supporters? Are any still around?
- Who are the important people in magical world?
- Who could be friendly to me and help me? Who could be my enemies and dangerous to me?
- That Draco Malfoy seems to be an arrogant shithead just like Dudley. Some books speculate that his family was following that Voldemort. So, if Voldemort's people are all like that, then they are my Enemies.
- My parents were supposed to have been betrayed by their best friend Sirius Black according to “Rise and Fall of the Dark Art”. Who is this Sirius Black? Why did he betray my parents? Could I ask him directly?
- Finally, what powers could a wizard have? Can I learn them? How long do I need to learn them?

Compare to how I was received like a hero in Diagon Alley, I would definitely feel furious at how I was being treated at the Dursleys. Right there, I would swear to become so powerful one day that I would exact terrible revenge upon anyone who had led me to my current circumstances. I would swear to destroy this Voldemort if he was still alive and everyone who had followed him. I would swear to totally break that arrogant asshole Draco Malfoy. And I would swear to tear the Dursleys limb from limb one day.

But for now, I'm only a weak 11 year old boy with no power, apart from being able to talk to snakes, stealing food from grocery stores, and beating up would be bullies. For the time being, I have to stay low, find people who could help me, and learn as much magic as possible.
