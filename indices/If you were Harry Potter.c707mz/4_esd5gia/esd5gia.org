Genuinely meaning for someone to die is a lot easier to imagine than actually to do so. Even though I've seen active combat and have killed people I have never wanted to do so. I couldn't pull an Ava. That isn't to say I wouldn't have put belatrix down, but there's easier ways to end a life. Causing pain though... That's an option.

I would have been more like Hermione. You've stumbled upon an entire world! Right underneath your nose! A world that with some mental alacrity you can make yourself into an animal and shape reality as you want it!

No amount of bullish behavior would have dulled my fascination with potions, (although i would have skipped class and just learn on my own with Shape as my teacher) and charms and transmorgification would have been a genuine pleasure!

I wouldn't have ever turned in any homework, but i never did that in school growing up either. Waste of time. Either i knew the subject or i didn't and learned my own way, not by writing inches or a word count of a subject.

And well, imperio is an interesting charm that has a definite place in the BDSM circles... Ahem.
