Eh in a kill or be killed situation you rely on like 90% instinct/training. If you're trained to disarm, you're going to go with what you know, not fumble with something you dont and let's face it, he was a high school kid facing down a terrorist with no training.

Moody was right there for the training but noooo. Lol

Once they're down, well, then it's decision time. If they are a threat like belatrix was, a simple cutting curse is enough. Which I think was how Molly put her down? I haven't read it in years and fanfic clouds my memory.
