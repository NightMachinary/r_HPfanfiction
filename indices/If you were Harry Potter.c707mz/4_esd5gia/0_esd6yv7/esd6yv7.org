  Genuinely meaning for someone to die is a lot easier to imagine than actually to do so. Even though I've seen active combat and have killed people I have never wanted to do so. I couldn't pull an Ava. That isn't to say I wouldn't have put belatrix down, but there's easier ways to end a life. Causing pain though... That's an option.

First of all, respect for your service, atleast i asume that you were/are in the military, which i really respect. I'm speculating what i would do, i have no clue if i would actually be capable of killing. I just assume that in a kill or be killed situation i would be able to make the rational decision.

  No amount of bullish behavior would have dulled my fascination with potions, (although i would have skipped class and just learn on my own with Shape as my teacher) and charms and transmorgification would have been a genuine pleasure!

I kind of feel the same way, the world is so interesting. Especially for someone like Harry, who didnt know about magic untill he turned 11. I would be especially interested in DADA and charms.

  And well, imperio is an interesting charm that has a definite place in the BDSM circles... Ahem.
