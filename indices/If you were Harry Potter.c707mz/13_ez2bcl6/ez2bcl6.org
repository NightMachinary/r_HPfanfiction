Hm...question is: Do I show up there with what I know now or does the plot of HP get erased from my memory?

Let us say I get to keep all my knowledge:

- you bet I would learn more magic than canon Harry from healing spells, to illusions, dark-arts (I would mean them, too!), rituals, wandless casting (and silent casting) and everything else that seems remotely usefull...especially enchanting (I mean look the Marauder's Map, I doubt you can't make a ton of usefull things, like say an invisibility ring or something like that (carrying the cloak around isn't always practical!))

- I'd try to learn everything the ministry bans (because most is probably pretty powerful/usefull stuff...look at the AK, painless, breaks any defense (unless you place and object between it and yourself or you dodge!), so usefull - but forbidden, even if self-defense? Fuck that!)

- I'd learn magic from other cultures (if possible I'd go there during the summer! I mean forging a document saying that you are allowed to fly by yourself isn't hard and neither is forging a passport, if you have magic that is!)

- I'd become an animagus (and I would NOT register with the leaky sieve (the MoM)...otherwise the DEs and Tom would learn of my form...yeah, wasting an advantage like that? Sorry, nope!)

- I'd look into becoming an metamorphmagus (rituals, blood-transfusions etc. whatever it takes, that talent is too usefull to not have it!)

- I would look into leaving Britain (maybe even before the TWT!)...and I would think very hard about coming back (I might let Voldemort have Britain, they kind of deserve it for their pureblood crap!)

- I would try to befriend Fleur (I'd probably be interested in her romantically, but I don't know if that would work - but friendship would be pretty good, too!)

- I would not end up in Gryffindor (sorry Dumbledore, either Ravenclaw or Slytherin!)

- I would not befriend (Mo-)Ron, I simply do not like him and I wouldn't trust him (abandons Harry twice...yeah, how about: NO! Go to hell RW!)

- I would befriend Hermione (if possible from the start, but I'd confront that troll if I had to and I'd be prepared!)

- I'd find more friends (from all the houses if possible), especially the interesting ones like Susan Bones (having a connection to Amelia sounds usefull!)

- I'd get myself a gun (Trolls and other non-casters can be killed with one, so why waste magic on them?) or several and maybe some mercenaries?

- I'd buy myself a magical tent ASAP...why sleep in a dorm if you can put up your own magical tent (in the dorm, so that teachers can't forbid it!) and have basically a small house for yourself, especially since you can work and learn in there in peace and have a training room, a lounge, a potions-lab etc. :)

- I would like to get my hands on the following items: Pensieve, time-turner, foe-glass, probity probe, secrecy-sensor (detecting lies sounds usefull), sneakoscope, omni-occulars (spying tool...I'd love one with a mike attached), two-way mirrors (several pairs), magical trunk (like the one Moody has), flying carpet (for the lulz, but also as a kind of tactical combat plattform...the people not flying it can attack and they can't easily be hit as those things aren't slow), vanishing cabinet (leave Hogwarts whenever you want to? Yes, please!), sorcerer's stone (I would not destroy the one in the mirror, I'd get it earlier so Voldemort doesn't get it and return it to the Flamels with the request for a meeting...maybe I can get my own from them?)

- I would not let Snape abuse me (I'd write to the Prophet if I have to, in order to muzzle that asshole or get rid of him!)

- I would abuse the cloak of invisibility (restricted section, but also other things!)

- I would put Draco down early (not lethally, but he'd stop attacking me or else!)

- I wouldn't be Dumbledore's sacrificial pet, who is un-aware of what big D is doing!

- I'd try to get my hands on the Black Library!

- I would try to get the horcruxes out of the way early (I'd use the resurrection stone to learn from the greatest of Wizards!)

- I'd also use the Room of Requirement as much as possible

- I would stay in a second tent during the summer (nope, I am not going back to the Dursleys (they can rot in hell for all I care, but killing them isn't worth it!)...putting the tent and some muggle-reppeling wards in a public park would probably work well :) )

- I would sue the people using my name without paying royalties!

- I'd use my fame for free stuff ;)

- I'd sue the Prophet for the smear campaign (if I was still there, I would probably leave before that point in time...at the latest after the TWT!)

- I'd clear Sirius if possible (if not: I'd ask him to ask for asylum somewhere else and I'd join him there!)

- I'd tear Remus Lupin a new one...bloody self-righteous coward! Stayed away for over a decade and then thinks he can slink away as soon as the going gets tough? Gimme a break!

- I probably wouldn't write essays ("Sorry, this is a waste of time and the grade I get isn't usefull either! Only the OWLS and NEWTS count for anything and I will be prepared! Hell, grade my practical double if you need two grades!")

- etc. etc.

=> "Some of these skills take years to learn!"

I have years, especially if I don't slack off as much as canon Harry does and especially if I leave after the TWT (at the latest...with Sirius after second year) and live under a fake name (so that Voldemort doesn't easily track me down!)

Killing? I doubt that killing in a true "It is you or me"-Situation is actually hard...yes, I am speculating, but I doubt that if someone starts shooting me and I have a gun that I would freeze (I know that this can happen and that soldiers train for this and some still freeze, but somehow I doubt I am in that category, I value my own life too much!)

=> "Some of these skills aren't all that usefull"

Well because nobody uses them really...there were (sadly!) no animagi-spies etc. (despite that being a usefull function for an animagus that is not registered!)
