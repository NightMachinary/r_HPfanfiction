  but in the books Harry is described as a pretty studious guy ( not like hermione), but he likes to read and learn.
#+end_quote

I can't really recal that. Can you cite it? I mean, the only two times I've seen him reading and learning was in Book 4 for the tournament and book 5 for the DA.

#+begin_quote
  Dark magic included, since Harry has plenty negative memories.
#+end_quote

How is that relavant? As far as we know, only unforgivables are fueled by "hate"

#+begin_quote
  . I would have used the unforgivable curses way more. As stated in the books "you have to mean it", now if both my parents and my Godfather were brutally murdered, you better believe i mean those curses.
#+end_quote

He used Imperius plenty of times during the Heist and he did use Cruciatus(successfully) when a death eater spat at Mcgonagall

#+begin_quote
  I obviously would have spent a lot of time perfecting those curses, since i would plan on using them.
#+end_quote

If you are not increadibly careful....boom! Azkaban. Also, you realise that to practice Cruciatus, you would have to activly mean for someone to suffer and continuesly cast it at them?

#+begin_quote
  I would have avada kedavrad left, right and center.
#+end_quote

No you wouldn't. It sounds really cool and easy to kill people but really it's fairly hard. That is due to our natural empathy and due to years and years of conditioning by society. Sure, maybe you could use it in a moment of blind rage, but other than that, I can't see you killing people left and right. Unless you are a trained Army personel or a sociopath. Also, in HP universe, Murder fractures your soul, so that is another thing to watch out for.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like killing guys like wormtail, bellatrix, lucius Malfoy and other death eaters would be a wise decision.
#+end_quote

Maybe it would be. Maybe not. The books are from Harry's perspective. It is possible that they had good reasons for doing what they did. Anyway, could you actually murder someone? And later not kill yourself in guilt? Our brains work in interesting ways, and the societal conditioning would make you feel increadibly guilty. And, hey! After you do that, you get to go to Azkaban. The only times when you were legally allowed(Pre-Voldemort taking over the Ministry) to use Unforgivables was during 1981 (at the height of First Wizarding War) and only by Aurors. If I were you and I felt that Death Eaters needed to die, I wouldn't use the unforgivables.

  Bellatrix kills Sirius and after Harry refused to kill her
#+end_quote

He doesn't refuse to. He never even thinks of it.

" “Come out, come out, little Harry!” she called in her mock-baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. “What did you come af- ter me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!” “I am!” shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry's seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room. “Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?” Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “Crucio!” "

Nothing is ever said about death.

  and is a danger to other students and teachers during the battle of Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Not that much of a danger. I don't believe she actually killed anyone and a old housewife easily took her down

#+begin_quote
  Magic detection,

  flying without a broom,
#+end_quote

Both of these are increadibly rare and hard to Master skills. The first one only Dumbledore knows as for the second, only Voldemort(the creator of the spell), and Snape who was taught it by Voldemort. Also, Magic detection doesn't seem very uselful. After all, it was only useful in canon once.

  becoming an animagus.
#+end_quote

It takes a long time to learn and it's pretty much useless. You can't pick your form, so if you got a slug....deal with it. Furthermore, you can't even do magic in that form. Only a few forms would be of any use and it's not really worth wasting your time on what amounts to a lottery

Anyway, my list:

1. Learn a bunch of useful magic. Doesn't have to be rare. If I master Genimo Gurse, I never have to worry about food again. I have one sandwith? Now, I have a million sandwitches. Definatly Transfiguration. Useful for fighting, food, making homes, furniture, ect. Potions is God-Tier magic. I mean...potion that prevents lying? Potion that makes you change shapes? Potion that can make you know how to do anything you want regardless if you have the required skill? (The Luck Potion). Definatly Potions. Charms are useful too. Waterbreathing charm, for example, removes pressure.

2. Try and find a method of immortality.

3. Screw with Muggles.
