  I think it is in the PS btw.

"Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. "I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley." "

Here he is more excited to learn for revenge, so maybe?

And this:

"His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night"

But that's the only time it is ever brought up and he shows no more interest in reading.

#+begin_quote
  In the movies he is portrayed as a little more lazy
#+end_quote

He is lazy. In preperation for his Triwizard tasks he spent most of his time doing nothing and put in bare minimum of training around a week or two until the task is due.

#+begin_quote
  He is just like Hermione
#+end_quote

Not really. She likes to learn for the sake of learning. Harry learns only when absolutely needed.

#+begin_quote
  You're right, i swear i read that Dark magic takes dark thoughts
#+end_quote

It's common fanon trope. Likely came from Star Wars.

#+begin_quote
  but apparently it only takes hate, skill and you have to mean it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, pretty much

#+begin_quote
  Avada Kedavra just seems like the most effective one.
#+end_quote

It is increadibly effective but it is also super hard to cast due to you needing to "mean it" and due to "magical prowess"

" "Avada Kedavra's a curse that *needs a powerful bit of magic behind it* - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."

-"Professor" Moody, Goblet of Fire page 141

#+begin_quote
  Harry succesfully casted it in The deathly Hallows, without actually practicing it.
#+end_quote

Technically, his attack on Belatrix could count as practise. Either way, didn't you mentiob practisinf unforgivables?

#+begin_quote
  So i honestly don't really know what it takes to perfect that spell ( since it obviously doesn't seem to include practicing on humans or animals ), but whatever it takes, i would do that.
#+end_quote

Why? Why Cruciatus of all things?

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't kill her, i would've
#+end_quote

I misunderstood you then.

#+begin_quote
  I figured that, just wanted to throw these in there cause they do seem usefull.
#+end_quote

The flight one does seem useful....but, why not use increadibly fast brooms/portkeys/apparation/floo/magical carpets/ect? Not only unsupported flight commonly is assumed to be impossible, you'd be wasting many years for something not all that needed. Apparation for one, seems way more useful.

#+begin_quote
  As for your list, the first point is actually super usefull. A lot of the things you mentioned could be used both in and outside battle.
#+end_quote

Thanks.

#+begin_quote
  As for the second point, the resurection stone
#+end_quote

It doesn't ressurect. It only summons spirits of the dead. Not really useful. As far as I know the only canon methods are Horcruxes and Philosopher's/Sorcerer's stone

#+begin_quote
  d yes, screwing with muggles would be fun, especially with the invisibility cloak.
#+end_quote

Yup
