  I can't really recal that. Can you cite it? I mean, the only two times I've seen him reading and learning was in Book 4 for the tournament and book 5 for the DA.
#+end_quote

I can't remember the exact lines. But its mentioned a few times how Harry really liked his new school books, and likes to read them. In the movies he is portrayed as a little more lazy if you ask me, whereas in the books he does actually like to study. He is just like Hermione. I think it is in the PS btw.

  How is that relavant? As far as we know, only unforgivables are fueled by "hate"
#+end_quote

You're right, i swear i read that Dark magic takes dark thoughts, but apparently it only takes hate, skill and you have to mean it.

  He used Imperius plenty of times during the Heist and he did use Cruciatus(successfully) when a death eater spat at Mcgonagall
#+end_quote

I know he uses the Imperius curse during the heist and he uses the Crusiatus curse twice, im specifically talking about the death curse, though i realize i could use other spells for that aswell, Avada Kedavra just seems like the most effective one.

  If you are not increadibly careful....boom! Azkaban. Also, you realise that to practice Cruciatus, you would have to activly mean for someone to suffer and continuesly cast it at them?
#+end_quote

Harry succesfully casted it in The deathly Hallows, without actually practicing it. So i honestly don't really know what it takes to perfect that spell ( since it obviously doesn't seem to include practicing on humans or animals ), but whatever it takes, i would do that.

  He doesn't refuse to. He never even thinks of it.

Harry doesn't kill her, i would've. She killed Sirius and i know she is a bad person.

  Both of these are increadibly rare and hard to Master skills. The first one only Dumbledore knows as for the second, only Voldemort(the creator of the spell), and Snape who was taught it by Voldemort. Also, Magic detection doesn't seem very uselful. After all, it was only useful in canon once.

I figured that, just wanted to throw these in there cause they do seem usefull.

As for your list, the first point is actually super usefull. A lot of the things you mentioned could be used both in and outside battle.

As for the second point, the resurection stone and Horcruxes are basically the way to go, don't think there is any other way.

And yes, screwing with muggles would be fun, especially with the invisibility cloak.
