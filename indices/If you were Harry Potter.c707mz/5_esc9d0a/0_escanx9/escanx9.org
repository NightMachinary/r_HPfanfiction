But the canon has also made it clear that Avada Kedavra will not harm one's soul if used for euthanasia. Therefore, using it for self defense and protection of innocent civilians should be fine too.

On the other hand, confunding a house-elf to poison her master is considered cold blooded murder. Voldemort even used this act to split his soul to make a Horcrux.

Intent, not the means, is the most important factor in determining soul damages.
