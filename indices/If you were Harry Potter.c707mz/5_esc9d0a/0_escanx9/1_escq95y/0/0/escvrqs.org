That too. it's magical one-and-done. And it's painless and quick for the person you're using it on. It's actually really messed up that the quickest and most painless way to kill somebody with magic is the most illegal spell...i mean like do they WANT to push everyone to sadism with entrail curses and stuff instead?

also canon harry is fine with torturing someone over spitting on someone's face, but OH NO I WON'T KILL THAT'S TOO TERRIBLE FOR ME TO CONTEMPLATE, I'M NOT LIKE VOLDEMORT! Fuck that, you're JUST like Voldemort for pettily torturing someone over something as nonharmful as SPITTING at somebody. JK Rowling sucks in her attempts at being moral. it's just all screwy, honestly.
