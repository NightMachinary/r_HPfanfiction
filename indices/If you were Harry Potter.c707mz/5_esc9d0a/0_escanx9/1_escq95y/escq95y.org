yeah, just like people who use a gun to kill someone who breaks into their home in real life. nobody goes off on them for being "Just as bad as the home invader who ALSO used a gun against you!" i think it's ridiculous to condemn any wizard or witch for using whatever spell they have to in a self defense situation, as long as it isn't plain obviously immoral like torture curses. because obviously if someone invades your home that doesn't give you the right to tie them up and spend a few hours beating them with a hammer. someone even got arrested for that exact thing, after he kept torturing a guy he found sexually assaulting some kid.

using the killing curse is probably the MOST moral curse you could use, since it is equatable to a gunshot wound to the head, which will mostly kill you instantly! i'd use the killing curse over a blasting or cutting curse in a self defense scenario! the wizarding world has some real skewed perspectives on stuff, and that's also bleeding into the fandom - clearly, as evidenced above.
