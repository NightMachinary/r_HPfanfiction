I'll try to keep it short :

Dark Magic : killing and using Dark Magic hurt your soul and corrupt the mind. There is no point to win the war if in the end you became just as bad as the Death Eater you replaced. It's even more true with the Unforgivables since you need to "mean it".\\
You can't use the Cruciatus just because you need to extract informations, you need to seek your victim suffering, to like it, to take pleasure in his screams. You also can't end the suffering of a friend with the Killing Curse, you need to hate your opponent and to really want him dead for the spell to work.\\
The only spell that can be somewhat excused is the Imperius, since you only need to overcome your victim mind to use it, and it doesn't ask you to be up to no good to be used.It is not to say you can't kill Death Eater (though the Imperius Curse create a moral dilema since except for the most well known one, you can't never know if you are killing a true Death Eater or a controlled puppet), but never with the Unforgivables, and if possible without any Dark Magic.

For the over skills : most of these skills take years, if not decades of work, and would be useless in 99% of the cases:

- It took years for the Marauder to become Animagus, and unless you plan to keep company to a Werewolf, turning into a stag is pretty much assured to be useless.
- Voldemort, someone who has decades of experience on Harry and supposed to be more talented, is the only character able to fly without a broom, and it's implied he invented the spell, or at least rediscovered it. So ok it's pretty impressive, but what's the point of it since in 99% of the cases, you can either break you fall with a spell like Arresto Momentum, or use a broom?
- We only see Dumbledore detect magic, once again it's implied that it's a skill who take years or experience to be learnt, and Dumbledore use it exactly one time.

It's not that these skill sucks, but Harry win the 2nd war before his 18 birthday, and had his life at risk at least once a year since he was 11. Harry could never focus on a long term project just for a skill "that may be usefull", he always has to focus on things that will definitevely be usefull in short time, like the Patronus Charm when there was dementors nearby.
