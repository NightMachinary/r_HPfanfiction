I figured those skills would be hard to learn, but the Marauders did it in their school years, so i figured Harry could learn too, and that might actually be usefull. The other skills i already figured would require years of training and/or talent, and you're probably right, they would not be that usefull.

As for the Unforgivable Curses they seem to be described kind of unclear. Since its said that Aurors could use the unforgivable curses during the war, and it didn't seem to corrupt them. I also think it will corrupt your mind if you keep repeatedly using them, i would only plan on using them a handfull of times, And i don't think i would've consider my mind corupting while i'm trying to survive and protect my friends. If someone killed my parents or assisted in it, i would definitely 'mean it' when i use the death curse. I feel like there are a few moments in the books where my thought and feelings would be so sinister, that i would be capable of using all the unforgivable curses. Harry obviously can't use them because of his character, i'm saying that i would've used them if i was in his shoes.
