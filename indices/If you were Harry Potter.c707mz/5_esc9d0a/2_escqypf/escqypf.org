My headcanon on dark magic is it relies on negative emotions and after casting you feel numb to that emotion. So casting a dark spell with anger makes you feel less anger in you. A tolerance would be built making it require more dark spells to get the same effect over time. So the “corrupting” part would be people wanting to feel that and associating dark magic cast on others with people with feeling really good. I never really liked “dark magic hurts the soul/corrupts it” because wizards made these spells. Why would they want to make these to corrupt themselves? Dark magic is illegal/restricted whatever because many people would “lose themselves” to the feeling. The point of self flight I think is that you no longer need anything to fly. If you can't apparate but can fly such as snape in hogwarts that's a big advantage to have. Aresto momentum stops you from going down fast doesn't let you go up and around. Depending on your career field I could see magic detection more useful. WE SEE dumbledore use it one time. How often is dumbledore in canon doing anything that would require it. Half the time it's in hogwarts.

If your life is under threat every year wouldn't you want to start learning to defend yourself?
