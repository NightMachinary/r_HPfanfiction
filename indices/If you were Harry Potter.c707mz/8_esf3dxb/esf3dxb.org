Rowling confirmed a lot of crap that is not in books and as such not canon.

Yes I would go to America and just live a long life without problems with Voldemort or his people.

Whatever accomplishments you mentioned do not help what was portrayed or mentioned in the books as such many of the teachers would find themselves sacked if anyone actually cared enough to be a decent headmaster or school administrator.

Hogwarts wont be the only library in the would with huge amount of books and again whatever know.edge it contains is not enough to risk my life for.
