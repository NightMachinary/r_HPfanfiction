I don't think I'd be as normal as Harry is.

I'd probably be angrier (like mentioned here already) and more confused about my identity. I'd probably struggle with a lot of questions: Who am I? Why me? What is expected of me? What do I want? I'd probably struggle with feeling isolated from my classmates because I went through something not many could relate to. And I'm the center of attention every year (good or bad but mostly bad).

On that note, I'd probably talk to kids who'd been affected by the last war more too. If only to feel like “Damn, I wasn't the only one that ordeal screwed.” Neville comes to mind.

I know Harry had his moments but for a kid who was going through all that he was, I'd say he was extremely well.

I suppose it was just his personality. If you really want to twist and analyze you could argue that him obsessing over Quidditch and not trying so hard to confront the past is a defense mechanism. He just wants to feel normal, why would he run after the things that make him different?

I would not. I'd probably get swept away with it to the point of unhealthy obsession and chill out a little only after several dramatic incidents.

Also, more than anything, the thing that has bothered me the most is how much of his history Harry learns from other people. I would find out absolutely everything I could as soon I set my foot in Hogwarts. I would look through old news papers, all the school records, talk to teachers, trace back my ancestry, anything I could.

So basically what Tom Riddle did, now that I think about it. It's only natural for a child to want to know about his parents. I think most people would do this.
