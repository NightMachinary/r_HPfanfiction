I'd study as much Dark Magic as possible, even if simply out of principle. I'd never take morality lessons about souls and afterlifes from whats an essentially Medieval society. The dreaded dark arts are probably just social taboos and Ministry banned spells and rituals. Powerful and maybe dangerous, but I would never believe that there is actually some kind of intrinsic evil in them that makes your soul go rotten and turns you insane. I imagine I would lean quite heavily on Transfiguration when it comes to combat.

I also subscribe to what [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] said, it sounds like a good plan.
