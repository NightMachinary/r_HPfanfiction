If I were Harry, I would get an arsenal of potions for every occasion and focus on learning everyday spells, easy-to-perform curses and healing charms. Hogwarts students learn Accio in their 4th year, I very much doubt I would be able to learn any advanced magic easily. Becoming animagus takes years, and most forms are useless anyway. Magic detection would probably take decades. People gripe about stunners and disarming spells, but it's what I would do if I were in a fight with an adult Dark Wizard. Something reliable I wouldn't screw up that would take an opponent out of the fight in one blow.

Thinking a teenager can easily kill Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix or even Wormtail is silly. Not even because killing is not as easy as it seems if you aren't a complete psychopath. But those are adult wizards who have so much more experience with magic and violence, and you haven't even learnt Aguamenti yet.

Definitely no duels, battles, flashy dark curses. Magic wand is not a sword, there's absolutely no reason to ever engage in face-to-face combat if you can avoid it. If I absolutely had to try to kill somebody, it would be poison, some magical explosive I would deliver under Polyjuice in advance, or, in the worst-case scenario, a surprise attack when the opponent least expects it.

But most probably, I would terrorise the Dursleys into submission with some potions / magical trinkets and attempt to transfer to another school as far from Britain as possible sooner rather than later.
