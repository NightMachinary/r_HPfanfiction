  Where does it say its free?
#+end_quote

One, how do you think Orphans like say....Tom Riddle paid for it? Or poor families like Weasleys? Another thing, no payment for Hogwarts is mentioned. Also, Orphans are given money for their school supplies.

" “That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but ---” "

Furthermore, Rowling has confirmed that it is free([[https://mobile.twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824]])

  But we both know it is not the best or even a good school.

It is a good school. It has many highly qualified teachers "Snape was one of Slughorn's ex-pupils and while he attended Hogwarts he proved to be very talented in the art of potion-making. Professor Snape was a ruthless disciplinarian, with little patience for foolishness, yet effective in his job and well respected by other professors. His deep understanding of potion brewing, as shown by his expert concoction of Wolfsbane Potion.Severus was made a member of the Slug Clubpresumably because of his talent at potion-making". He was also good enough to modify and improve potion recipes. Minerva "During her seventh year, she was appointed Head Girl. After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor. Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's resistance through spying Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial information on their activities. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrowfrom 1997 until 1998.". Dumbledore needs no introduction. Filius "He also protected the students from the Carrows in the 1997-1998 school year.After completing his Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests in his seventh year, Flitwick graduated from Hogwarts and then proceeded to become a Master Duellist and earned the title of "Duelling Champion" at some point,and has a shelf full of trophies to prove it. It is also likely Flitwick studied further into magic, becoming an accomplished wizard, masterful in spells, charms, and defensive magic, and even possibly earning the title of "Doctor", and becoming a fully-fledged and educated sorcerer before beginning his teaching career back at Hogwarts sometime in or before the early 1970s."

I gave you the acomplishments of just a few of Hogwarts staff. What else makes the school great? Well it doesn't discriminate against Orphans or Muggleborns unlike say Durmstrang. In Hogwarts everyone was more or less equal, in Durmstrang, just because Krum was famous he had more power (""Back to the ship, then," he was saying. "Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?" Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. "Professor, Ivood like some vine," said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully."I wasn't offering it to you, Poliakoff," snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. "I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy "). Hogwarts also has huge libaries filled with some of the most rare and darkest of topics like Horcruxes.

  As for the knowledge, I would just use the library found in any other school.

And would it be better than Hogwarts'? It is described as "The Hogwarts Library is located off of a corridor on the first-floor of Hogwarts Castleand contains tens of thousands of books on thousands of shelves. " also for the restricted section "These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advance DADA.Books in this section may be rare, valuable, and/or considered inappropriate for younger students, thus why it is restricted.The Restricted Section used to have books about Horcruxes, including Secrets of the Darkest Art."

To summarise, it has a huge library full of many rare and or dangerous books.

  The Room of Requirements is not enough to risk myself.

So the best option would be flee to US or Europe or Asia so the Dark Lord would have an easier time killing you? Gotcha.
