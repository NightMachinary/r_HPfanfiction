  The puplic treatment after the graveyard could have been enough
#+end_quote

How is it different than in any other school? Just because you switch schools doesn't mean that the new students will treat you like a god. You do stupid ship, so they treat you accordingly. Harry not only illegaly entered a tournament(in their eyes), but after it in hopes of more fame said that Voldemort returned, such thing being impossible as per common knowledge. For comparison, imagine I was a jew whose family barely survived Hitler. Now Imagine I came up and in front of a huge crowd announced that Hitler returned. I also could not provide any evidence to prove this impossobility. Would you believe me that Hitler has returned? Of course not.

  but that stupid thing would have driven me over the edge

Why so? Even if you run away from it, Voldemort will still chase you. Might as well stay in the best school protected by Dumbledore and abuse the libary for knowledge.

  Especially if his upbringing was really as bad as Fanon thinks it to be.

It was increadibly bad. Petunia displayed abuse(trying to hit him with a frying pan that he casually dodged implying that it was not a one time occurance), Dudley and his friends liked to beat him up (Harry Hunting), he was living in a cupboard and was locked in there as a punishment for long periods of time(Zoo incident), he was definatly starved during the second year and....the fourth,IIRC(could be fifth). He was verbally and emotionally abused. Dudley hit him with a new stick upon Vernon's command(shortly before Harry got his letter). Marge's dog tried to bite Harry and she didn't care and verbally and emotionally abused him. She went so far as to mock his dead parents.

  He should have had self preservation and fled the land as fast as humanly possible.

Wouldn't have helped much
