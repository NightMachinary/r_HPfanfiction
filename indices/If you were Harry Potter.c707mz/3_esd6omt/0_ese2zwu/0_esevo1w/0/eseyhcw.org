To clarify: With public treatment I meant the smear campaign by the daily prophet. Not (only) what the kids in school said. As for the other things: it's a post as to what I would have done in his place. So I answered. I would have lived a life as fulfilled as possible with all the money I would have had. Why suffer and probably still die if I could have run and make the best of it - even if just for a short while? With the phrophesy out I would have known that Voldemort would always try to kill me. As I can't stomach killing someone else that the best course of action.
