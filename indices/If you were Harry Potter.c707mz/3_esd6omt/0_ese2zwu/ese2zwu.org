Exactly. At most I would have stayed till I heard the prophecy and than I would have noped out. The puplic treatment after the graveyard could have been enough but that stupid thing would have driven me over the edge - especially if I had taken divination like Harry. It's unbelievable Harry stayed. Especially if his upbringing was really as bad as Fanon thinks it to be. He should have had self preservation and fled the land as fast as humanly possible. Let the lunatics fight it out between each other and have a nice life as long as still possible.
