  Harry never goes to the Durseleys. He is rescued by McGonagall who takes him to a friend of his father's. There he is raised as their son with their daughter. Harry will have an understanding of magic and won't be fooled. He will grow up being smart and calm and will not be manipulated. Harry/Angelina/Alicia/Katie. Possible harem, maybe not with poking at certain characters.
