"Ah wait here a moment Harry."

With that Voldemort popped out of the department and returned with a stack of books and two different cards

"Here you go, I've rented out a copy your minions and you, The evil overlords list of dos and donts, the law of evilness and the diabolical scheming planing book from the evil dark lords library"

"The what?!"

Voldemort ignored him "I also got you a library card for said library and your temporary villain license. Here you go remember to turn the books in late, Hormeas Mora doesn't really grasp time anyway and has probably already read the books so he won't care."

"Who?!" The books were shoved into Harry's arms and Voldemort brought two fingers up to his mouth and let out a shrill whistle

"Alright death eaters we are impeding Lord Potter's diabolical plans, that goes against the Dark Lord code!"

A random death eater looked at the dark lord "umm but..."

He was then executed for his ignorance "Well the departments all yours Harry, remember to read up on those books, the proper dark lord licensing test is on the first, show up fashionably late, you just need to flash the provisional license and say Voldemort is your sponsor and you should be good to go." With that Voldemort disappeared with his followers leaving Harry and his "followers" confused and a bit disgruntled, well except Hermione who was eyeing Harry's new books like a dog eyes a steak.
