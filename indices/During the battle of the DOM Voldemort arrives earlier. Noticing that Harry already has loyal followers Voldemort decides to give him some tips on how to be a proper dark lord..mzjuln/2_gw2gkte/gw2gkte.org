Over the decades many people asked Albus Dumbledore why the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump would sideline his political influence to focus on teaching- to which the old man would smile with a quirk of his whiskers and answer that he enjoyed nothing more than to have a hand in shaping the brightest minds of the next generation.

Everyone thought that Tom Riddle wanted to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts because he loved the Dark Arts, and when he took the name Voldemort they thought he wanted nothing more than the power and influence of a Dark Lord. What they never considered was that these two men had more in common than power and blood status.
