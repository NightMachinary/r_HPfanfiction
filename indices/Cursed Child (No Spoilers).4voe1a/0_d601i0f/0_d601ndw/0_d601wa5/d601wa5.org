That's fine and all, but the story would be indistinguishable from a thousand other time travel fics that have time turner accidents or whatever. I mean, I wrote a fic 5 years ago where Harry uses a time turner combined with a ritual to travel back to the 1940's to kill a 15 year old Tom Riddle and stop the nonsense before it even begins. And it's not like I can claim I came up with the idea, since it's been around forever.
