  and wizards DID invent trains (the hogwarts express have Always Been There.)

What? Then how do Muggles have hundreds of trains around? Did someone related/married to a wizard/witch see it, decide to copy it and then replicate it non-magically all over the world? Or are the Obliviators not doing their jobs?

Wizards STOLE the Hogwarts Express from Muggles, just like they steal useful Muggle inventions for their own use (camera, radio, cars, Knight bus, lifts, etc).
