Well, yes and no. Yes, Rowling sucks with maths and dates. But no, that isn't actually a problem with the timeline, because /the HP world is not our world/. It's amazing how frequently that is overlooked in the fandom.

Little Whinging isn't a real place, nor are Ottery St. Catchpole or Godric's Hollow. The Brockdale Bridge that Death Eaters destroyed in 1996 doesn't exist. The British Prime Ministers are not the real Prime Ministers (the one we interact with was preceded by a male Prime Minister, whereas in real life John Major was preceded by Thatcher). Etc.
