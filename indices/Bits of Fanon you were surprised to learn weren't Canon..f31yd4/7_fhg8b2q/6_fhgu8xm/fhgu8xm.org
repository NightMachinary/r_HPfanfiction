You combined two discussions together: WHAT is the canon, and what is IN the canon. I (and I suspect many other fans) don't consider the Cursed Child to be the canon, so no Petunia lives! And I am very selective about what JKR wrote on Pottermore/Twitter. And time turners are simple and there are no time paradoxes.
