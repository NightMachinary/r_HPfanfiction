I don't know what's canon, and what's fanon, anymore. i've given up trying to keep it straight. After all, apparently in Canon you CAN use a time turner to change history, according to Cursed Child. Also, Truth Potion is NOT used in court, you CAN'T block the killing curse, even with a solid object, Soul Jars CAN possess people (even though they Can't get sucked up by Dementors), The US Wizarding World is divided into four parts, two of which are still nomadic, and wizards DID invent trains (the hogwarts express have Always Been There.)

EDIT: scratch All of that. Apparently I'm completely wrong. Except for in that I don't know what's canon and what's fanon, anymore.
