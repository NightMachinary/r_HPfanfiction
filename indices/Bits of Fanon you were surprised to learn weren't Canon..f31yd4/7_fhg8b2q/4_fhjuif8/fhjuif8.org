In POA Hermione tells Harry about all sorts of horrible things that can happen if you mess with time. What we see play out in POA (and especially in the movie) is usually interpreted as a stable time loop. If that was true, Hermione's warnings are meaningless. Conclusion? Nothing horrible happens in POA because Hermione isn't an idiot (and Harry realises he saw himself).

CC is entirely consistent with Hermione's canonical warnings and the general message of the books about the nature of fate (it's your choices). (And also, although I'm against word of God stuff as a rule, why Rowling felt it was necessary to destroy the time turners.)
