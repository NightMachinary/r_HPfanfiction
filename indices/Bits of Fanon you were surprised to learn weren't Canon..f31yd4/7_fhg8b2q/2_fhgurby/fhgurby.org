Somewhat appropriate that in a thread about people being confused about canon, your examples of canon are almost all wrong.

#+begin_quote
  you CAN use a time turner to change history, according to Cursed Child.
#+end_quote

Has been canon since PoA, when Hermione warned Harry that they had to be careful not to change the past. Closed loop time travel is Ministry recommended best practice, not the only type of time travel possible.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Truth Potion is NOT used in court
#+end_quote

This one is indeed canon, though I'm not sure that there's much confusion about it in the fandom.

#+begin_quote
  you CAN'T block the killing curse, even with a solid object
#+end_quote

Not canon; see Dumbledore vs. Voldemort in OotP.

#+begin_quote
  Soul Jars CAN possess people (even though they Can't get sucked up by Dementors)
#+end_quote

Correct that this is canon, but the use of the word "soul jar" rather than "horcrux" is not (and is rather telling - see my post about deliberate ignorance elsewhere in the thread).

#+begin_quote
  The US Wizarding World is divided into four parts, two of which are still nomadic
#+end_quote

This may have passed me by, but: source? Was not in Fantastic Beasts 1 or 2.

#+begin_quote
  and wizards DID invent trains (the hogwarts express have Always Been There.)
#+end_quote

Not canon.
