To be honest, I couldn't remember how to ‘spell' horcrux, and I thought writing Phylactory would be even worse. I was just to lazy to google it. Been in the Worm fandom for a while, first time back to HP in a month. It's a strange word. Cut me ‘some' slack.

Also, I thought all that ‘was' canon, thank you for correcting me. You did see at the top that I said I had no idea what was and wasn't, yes? I ‘thought' all that was, but maybe not. Now I'm even more confused about the whole thing.
