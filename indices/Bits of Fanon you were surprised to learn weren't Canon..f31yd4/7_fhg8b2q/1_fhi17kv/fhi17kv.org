The "killing curse cannot be blocked by a solid object" actually directly contradicts OotP too, since in the Department of Mysteries Dumbledore animates a statue to throw itself in front of Harry, taking a killing curse meant for him at the expense of destroying the statues. So solid objects can block the killing curse, it's just that those objects tend to explode when doing so.
