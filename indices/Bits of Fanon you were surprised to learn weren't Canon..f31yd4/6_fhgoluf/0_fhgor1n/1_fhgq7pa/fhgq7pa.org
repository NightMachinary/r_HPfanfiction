I mean, it is one of those things that when taking things into context regarding the Wizarding World, it's one of those things that you would easily consider a part of it despite the idea never being explicitly stated.

1. Wizarding world is traditional, and definitely clings to things that the muggles have since moved on from.

   1. old wealthy families would likely cling to tradition even more so.

2. An old tradition, admittedly that no longer seems to have any actual importance here in the US, was that you would name someone that held your ideals, that you trusted, and yet wasn't a family member as the godparent to your child so that if something happened to you you could be certain that the child would be "raised right" because the godparent would be the one the child goes to.\\

   1. Narcissa directly refers to Snape as "Lucius's old friend".
   2. Narcissa trusts Snape enough to risk death when she goes to ask Snape to assist Draco. Perhaps she only went to him because he was in a position to help; but that's an awfully large risk for someone that you don't have other, more personal reasons to trust them. Being Draco's favorite teacher is not enough to overcome the fact that most of the rest of the inner circle did not trust Snape in regards to his loyalty to Voldemort.
