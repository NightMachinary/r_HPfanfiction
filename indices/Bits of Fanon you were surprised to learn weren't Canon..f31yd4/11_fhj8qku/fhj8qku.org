I first read the books when I was in third or fourth grade and I remember I once tried to watch a scene from the movie on YouTube. I accidentally watched this fan made music video of Chamber of Secrets where Ginny's Lucius's daughter and she gets pregnant by Harry and there was a lyric that went “Daddy please don't, we're gonna get married”

And that video thoroughly confused me bc I thought it was from the movie. As you can tell by how I still remember it, it really fucked me up for a while
