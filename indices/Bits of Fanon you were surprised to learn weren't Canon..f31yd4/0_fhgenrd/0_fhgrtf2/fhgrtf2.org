The Wizengamot always confused me- is it a legislative or judicial body? IRL these things are normally kept [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#United_Kingdom][separate]]. For example in the UK it's:

- Parliament -- legislature
- Prime Minister, Cabinet, Government Departments and Civil Service -- executive
- Courts -- judiciary

While in fics you have the Wizengamot convicting criminals in one chapter and voting on laws the next.
