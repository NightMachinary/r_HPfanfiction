If we're talking purely in terms of book canon (so no Pottermore or anything like that) Judicial, I think.

We know Arthur, who is nominally a civil servant or a bureaucrat, wrote an important law... which suggests wizarding society has no legislature as we would understand it.

This is then consistent with "the Minister for Magic" which is the head of the bureaucracy of the Ministry. This terminology is always very consistent and it positions the Ministry as effectively just part of Britain's wider government (I actually read a fic once, don't remember which, that took this to its logical extreme, i.e. that the Minister is theoretically just a minister same as the Home Secretary or the Chancellor).

It also seems, to me, that there is no electoral process whatsoever and that, instead, the Minister is simply chosen as a consequence of office politics. This also explains why the Death Eaters and the Order exist... they're not political parties but instead secret societies that spend their time infiltrating the bureaucracy. Given the blatant Nazi allegory, this really rather suggests an absence of political parties. And given Dumbledore's tendency to use agents, if there were elections it seems fairly self evident there would have been a candidate everyone knows is Dumbledore's candidate. Wizarding society really only seems to make sense if it's a whole bunch of people responding to informal mechanisms. Once everyone thinks everyone is losing confidence in Fudge, everyone would be looking for someone else because there's no formal mechanism (such as an election) to see if people have actually lost confidence in Fudge.

(I don't think Rowling designed it deliberately like this... it's just that the system looks an awful lot like an aristocracy, i.e. personal status and political status are 100% equivalent. Back in the day France didn't go to war with England but instead of the King of France and the King of England were personally at war. It's all very schoolyard, right? Doesn't that sound a lot like Draco vs Harry, so why not also apply it to Dumbledore vs Voldemort? This personal = political is, incidentally, why Magna Carta reads like a contract, not a law. It is a contract.)

Whether or not there's taxation in the wizarding world is an interesting question. Reading the books leaves me with an impression that Lucius Malfoy funds the Ministry pretty much on his own (which, frankly, explains a lot about what happens in the books).
