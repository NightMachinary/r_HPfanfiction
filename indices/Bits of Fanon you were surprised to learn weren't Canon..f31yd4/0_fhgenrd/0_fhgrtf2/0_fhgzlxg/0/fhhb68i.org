That is probably an Early Installment Weirdness, like the use of 'mediwizards' in GOF instead of 'Healers'.

I remember a fic that has Harry talking about the Council of Magical Law because he saw it in the Pensieve and then the other characters ask him how does he know about it since it was only a short-lived assemblage for the aftermath of the first war.
