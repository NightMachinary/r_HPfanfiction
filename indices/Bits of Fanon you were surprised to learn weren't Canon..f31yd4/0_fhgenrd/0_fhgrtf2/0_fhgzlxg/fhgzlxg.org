  The Wizengamot always confused me- is it a legislative or judicial body?
#+end_quote

In short, yes.

To fully explain, according to the only canon [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin][article]] (if you consider J.K. Rowling's Pottermore writings as canon) that references the Wizengamot says that it acts as both the court and parliament.

However, there is another judicial body called "The Council of Magical Law," referenced in /Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/, Chapter 30 "The Pensieve." Unfortunately, there seems to be even less known about this council than the Wizengamot.
