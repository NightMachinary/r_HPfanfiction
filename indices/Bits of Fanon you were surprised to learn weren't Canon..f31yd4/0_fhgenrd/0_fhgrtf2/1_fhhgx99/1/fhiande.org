Huh. It always bothered me in the OotP movie when Fudge pronounced it "wiz-zen-aga-mot" instead of "wiz-zen-gam-mut" (which I felt was more accurate). Now that you've taught me about the Witenagemot, I wonder if the actor was pronouncing it that way on purpose to make the comparison more apparent.

I'm still not giving Michael Gambon a pass for pronouncing Beauxbatons "bo-bat-tins", though.
