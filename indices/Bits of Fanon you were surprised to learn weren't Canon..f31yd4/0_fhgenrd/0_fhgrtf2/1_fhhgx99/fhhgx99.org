It's both - and actually, IRL having them be separate is more of a modern thing.

In the case of the Wizengamot, I believe it's at least partly influence by an actual anglo-saxon institution, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][Witen-agemot]] from the ~7th-11th century. At least the names are strangely similar. The RL assembly was a council of nobles that had some sorts of legislative power (ie, they might meet with the king and promulgate laws together), gave advice to the rulers, had some choice over succession, etc - but like any such council of nobles, its actual powers and influence was never quite fixed and would wax/wane over time.

This reinforces to me that the Wizengamot could very easily be a (partly) hereditary body - it's ancient, has its name from an explicit council of nobles, and the WW doesn't really modernize all that quickly. At the same time, I think that it's also clearly not entirely hereditary - and that the Minister seems to have a decent chunk of control over its members. So my headcanon on the subject is that some families have hereditary seats, while the Minister can nominate others to take part in the Wizengamot.

I could also picture the HP one as a bit like the French parlements of the Ancien Regime with some increased legislatural power on the side.
