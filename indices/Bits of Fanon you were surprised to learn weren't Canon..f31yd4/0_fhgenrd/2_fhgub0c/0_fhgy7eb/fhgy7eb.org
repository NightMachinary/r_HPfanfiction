It's never directly stated in the books, but the Wizengamot is a legislative body. According to [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin][this]] article on the Order of Merlin, one of its functions is a parliament. This is the only piece of canon evidence that references the Wizengamot as a parliament.
