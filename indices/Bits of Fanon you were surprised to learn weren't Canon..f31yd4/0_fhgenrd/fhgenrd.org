Basically any fanon with the Wizengamot is not supported by canon. Most of them claim things about pureblood heads of their house have a seat and are a lord of some kind. There's no evidence in canon for this. To be fair, there's also not a lot of evidence regarding how wizards and witches are appointed to the Wizengamot in the first place.
