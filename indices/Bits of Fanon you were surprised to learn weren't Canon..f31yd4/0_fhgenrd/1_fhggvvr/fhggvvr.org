Well I'd say it's pretty straight forward how they are appointed. They obviously have to see who can poke the Umbrage with a stick without her noticing, this most likely why she is so pink. the minister of magic is elected by a contest to see who is the best at transfiguration, this would also explain Umbrage as she is most likely a failed attempt of turning a toad into a human. Malfoy obviously rigged the votes as there is no way Fudge could be good at anything.
