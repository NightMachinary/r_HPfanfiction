I think there's reasonably clear evidence against the whole "lord" thing because ultimately it all comes down to the "noble and most ancient house of Black". This is a family which is presented as being completely up its own arse about pure blood stuff... as in to an unusual extent. And sure maybe you can argue that most of the reason we get that presentation is because our observer is Harry and a lot of the information comes from Sirius. But the reality is that the books take a very strong line against pure blood ideology and the only other family we meet who take things as seriously as the Blacks are basically exiles from wizarding society as a whole (i.e. the Gaunts). Conclusion? They call themselves a "noble and most ancient house" to make themselves feel good... no different to the "Peverell coat of arms".

I mean... there are no wizarding princes.
