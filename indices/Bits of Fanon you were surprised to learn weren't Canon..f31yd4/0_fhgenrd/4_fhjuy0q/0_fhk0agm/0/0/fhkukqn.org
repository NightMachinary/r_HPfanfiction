Well, the 'lord' aspect doesn't fully rely on the Black family and how they style themselves. It's more an offshoot of the pureblood culture - that is, we know that there's a bunch of Purebloods who view themselves as superior to those who aren't as such, and those ancient families can be quite wealthy (eg - the Malfoys) and aristocratic. Combine that with them being the majority of the WW historically, and institutions/power seems like they'd be arranged around them.

Throw in that a lot of the time, the WW seems to be somewhat backwards in how they're politically organized... it's not hard to imagine that there's a holdover from medieval/aristocratic institutions, particularly since the UK actually does have a house of parliament still called 'House of Lords'.

It's obviously not stated in canon either way - but I think it's reasonable to see the whole lord thing extended to most of the purebloods. After all, we know basically nothing about the political organization of the WW.
