I think its less not knowing Canon, and more that once Canon started to include Fantastic Beasts, Cursed Child, and whatever the hell JKR decided to tweet about for the day that 'Canon' became a worthless thing. With how many stupid and nonsensical things have become 'canon' recently it feels like there's really no point in mentioning Canon for any reason or using Canon to drive an argument.
