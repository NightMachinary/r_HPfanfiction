There's a certain trend within parts of the fanfic community (and which is present in this thread) of apparent /pride/ in poor knowledge of canon as opposed to fanon. It utterly baffles me.

Harry Potter is not The Brothers Karamazov; it's children's/YA literature. It's not hard to understand, and extremely easy to re-read parts if you're confused about something. The cause of ignorance can only be a matter of choice: the conscious decision not to remedy that ignorance.

Which is fine. People don't have a duty to maintain their knowledge of Harry Potter. But being /proud/ of that ignorance? Deliberate ignorance is never a good look in my books.
