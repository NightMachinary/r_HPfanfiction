Sometimes deliberate ignorance is what we need when we are facing an author like JKR, whatever she tweets and state is canon just because she's bored most of it just doesn't make sense. Especially with Cursed Child characters are extremely OOC, Harry is a perfect example of it.As for fantastic beast I guess it's acceptable but the Crimes of Grindlewald ending is extremely confusing. So that's why we do that.
