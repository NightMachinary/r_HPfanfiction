Unfortunately it doesn't matter if you reject the writings of JKR outside of her books because its her world and she can damn well say what is and isn't canon. And we can all go fuck are selves. Shes the creator anything she adds to the HPverse thus is canon. No matter how much we all wish cursed child stayed a fanfiction. That's just kinda how creative license works.
