Death of an Author is an interesting concept, at this point though it doesn't matter what we peons want when shes the one making money off everything she does in regard to her IP. As long as shes writing its canon. Granted we are all free to accept and deny any of her canon ideas, with clever ideas like Headcanon and fanon, but as much as we want some ofnher rather ridicoulos ideas to not be canon, anything she says is canon is so. We can all continue to pretend like things don't exist but at the end of the day none of our opinions matter as long as shes making money, tis a sad concept really.

Also does the concept of death of an author really apply here? as shes not done with her work, sure once its out in the world if you subscribe to Barthes' ideas then yeah she don't mean shit but it is still her IP regardless the concept in my opinion seems moot in modern media and lit, at least that's how i feel, also i apologize if this seems like a rant im rather stoned.
