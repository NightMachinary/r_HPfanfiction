Sure, but when she published the second book, that also become canon, right? You don't see it as existing in a separate space from the first book, they're both part of the same canon? Because then the same applies to not only all the other books, but also the Cursed Child and Fantastic Beasts, and even things like her articles on Pottermore. They're all published writings in the same canon, therefore they're all canon.

Basically, if you want to talk about the idea of canon at all, you've got to leave aside Death of the Author at least to an extent.
