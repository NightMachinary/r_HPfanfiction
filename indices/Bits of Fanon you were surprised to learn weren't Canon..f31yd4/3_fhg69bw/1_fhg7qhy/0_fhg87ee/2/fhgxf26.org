Muggle Repelling are, even if not directly in name. For example, from the outside Hogwarts appears to be a run down old shack (I think) and Muggles get a bad feeling about it and get the urge to go away. At least, if you consider Pottermore canon.

Also, for Notice-Me-Not, the biggest canon example is Harry not noticing The Leaky Cauldron (that's in London) until Hagrid points it out to him. Since he's a wizard he wouldn't be affected by a Muggle Repelling Charm, so it should be a different charm, which I think is one of the main inspirations for the fanon "NMN Charm."
