  He already succeeded in doing so by slowly creating a martyr(Harry).

This is only true if you believe there's some alternative means of extracting the Horcrux, which Dumbledore can assume is not the case because of the basilisk venom incident.

Dumbledore doesn't create a martyr, but instead tricks a self-sacrificing and (in some ways) pessimistic young man into a situation which Dumbeldore believes the "martyr" will survive. There's absolutely no reason to believe that Harry couldn't have burnt himself and Voldemort to a crisp via Fiendfyre.

Was Harry self-sacrificing prior to Dumbledore's (Hogwarts based) interference? Probably, yes. Look at the flying lesson. All Harry wants to do at this stage is have nothing to do with the Dursleys... he puts that on the line right then. At this point, either everything is all Dumbledore and we have no basis to know what Harry would be like, or we have to accept Dumbledore did not create Harry's personality.

  Not to mention that Dumbledore used Harry as a fucking bait for Voldemort which could've harmed other students in the school.

I have no idea what you're referring to and its pretty much your entire point.

Also, wizarding society clearly suffers from Blue and Orange Morality... no-one blinks an eye when Dumbledore says entering a corridor in a school will lead to a painful death. Sure, Ron complains about Fluffy when they meet him, but look at all the lethal things they engage with in Herbology.
