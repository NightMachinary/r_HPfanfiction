  Three first years managed to beat everything.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Because Voldemort only got by Fluffy because Hagrid was drunk. A devil's snare was used to assassinate a patient in St Mungos (which requires high level herbology). We have no idea how difficult the chess set is (can you beat Magnus Carlsen? I think not. But maybe Ron could) and the logic puzzle was designed to defeat wizards (as opposed to muggle raised individuals). The Mirror was only defeated /because/ Harry was there.

Maybe these protections are a lot better than you think? The only reason to believe they're bad is by deciding they're bad /a priori/ or doing what most fanfics do and concluding it's possible to fly over the chess set. Based on canon? They're actually very good (even if it raises the interesting question... is Fluffy immune to magic?).

  there would an age restriction line outside the door
#+end_quote

Well, yes, it would be a good idea to set the line so only people at least as old as Dumbledore could get through. As a generic protection? All it does is limit who can get down there to help.

  a simple Wingardium Leviosa can knock out a troll just in case you don't remember there was a troll as an obstacle.
#+end_quote

Literally the one obstacle we know was put in not to be an obstacle.

  I would bet that at least Fred and George would've went there first thing in the morning the next day after Dumbledore's announcement of staying clear from the third corridor of third floor.
#+end_quote

And since they didn't claim the stone and weren't hurt your point is what exactly?

#+begin_quote
  Magic itself is dangerous too if we are going with your logic
#+end_quote

Er, no. That's the opposite of my point. I'm saying what wizards consider "too dangerous" has no resemblance to what we do.

  It's a form of Manipulation
#+end_quote

Oh no manipulation, it must be utilitarianism!

Learn what you're trying to demonstrate. The presence of manipulation isn't it.
