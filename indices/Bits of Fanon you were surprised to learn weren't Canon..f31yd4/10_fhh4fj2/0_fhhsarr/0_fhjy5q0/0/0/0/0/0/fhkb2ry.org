  Oh no manipulation, it must be utilitarianism!
#+end_quote

Utilitarianism:  A family of consequentialist ethical theories that promotes actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals.

Yes it's true that Dumbledore cares about his well-being, now wouldn't that include him checking up to Harry regularly at the Dursleys to make sure he's fine? I'll leave you to that.

#+begin_quote
  And since they didn't claim the stone and weren't hurt your point is what exactly?
#+end_quote

It's a group of teenagers , do you expect them to actually listen to what Dumbledore said? no

#+begin_quote
  As a generic protection? All it does is limit who can get down there to help.
#+end_quote

No it doesn't, I mean you don't expect a student to go down and help a situation that really shouldn't be handled by them, let alone three 11-12 year old kids.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. Because Voldemort only got by Fluffy because Hagrid was drunk.
#+end_quote

Quirrel just needed to look into Care of Magical Creatures section for that piece of information, or read about Orpheus about that.

  We have no idea how difficult the chess set
#+end_quote

There's no saying what sort of enchantments are on the chess at, if the transfigured chess pieces can blow each other into rubble so easily then any second year up can blow it up with a simple bombarda.

If that doesn't work we still can't judge on Ron's chess skills too much because other than a few Gryffindor students he didn't play chess with anyone else. It's easy to learn what other's moves are if you are actually into chess.

  A devil's snare was used to assassinate a patient in St Mungos (which requires high level herbology).
#+end_quote

It was taught in //first year// herbology class everyone knows how to defeat it

#+begin_quote
  logic puzzle was designed to defeat wizards (as opposed to muggle raised individuals)
#+end_quote

All potions and wine have distinct smells, if that doesn't work then transfigure an animal to test put what's in the bottles, and since Quirrel already got over the fire and there still potion left it's safe to assume it's self refilling, so even after you test out all of them you will still have some left.

Besides if they went down with a Ravenclaw student the logic puzzles wouldn't be a problem.

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror was only defeated because Harry was there.
#+end_quote

The Mirror was a smart contraption that is actually the only smart thing to trap Voldemort in. But other than that the others are quite easy.

#+begin_quote
  Literally the one obstacle we know was put in not to be an obstacle.
#+end_quote

That was only because Quirrel already knocked it out. If he hadn't and the troll regained consciousness it would've been the situation I mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  Er, no. That's the opposite of my point. I'm saying what wizards consider "too dangerous" has no resemblance to what we do.
#+end_quote

What they consider dangerous is mixed with bigotry, religious stuff, politics and corruption. Buckbeak is not dangerous at all yet they still decided to "kill" him because Lucius Malfoy ordered them to do so, he is also one of the major factors why corruption is rooted deep in the ministry. Thestrals are another sample of it, they are completely harmless yet because of beliefs and fear they rule it as what they call "dangerous" creatures. While some of their categories may be correct such as dragons.

What they see as dangerous most of the time are dangerous but if used correctly it isn't, a knife itself is completely harmless but the way a person use it determines how "dangerous" it is. It's like a strong repulse can cause blunt trauma if strong enough, and those are fatal, yet they still teach it in charms.
