  Yes, because paternalism means actually looking after someone's best interests? No it doesn't and you know it. It means acting in what you think is someone's best interest. Which, in this case, means putting Harry where he's safe, i.e. the Dursleys. Which, in this case, means making sure Harry doesn't grow up a celebrity, i.e. separating Harry from the magical world (which also has the effect of making him even safer).
#+end_quote

And how are you going to prove that Harry was safe? There wasn't much of a description other than Harry being locked in every single summer by the Dursleys and the dementor attack outside the wards which should have worked because his life was being threatened by it. And if you mean the Dursley's are a safe place to put Harry in then what is it with the emotional and occasional physical abuse then? As for not growing up arrogant simply place him with someone he knew wouldn't spoil Harry too much and discipline him when he should be? Hell even at Neville's too, he could stay there, or the Tonks. People believe Voldemort is dead so safety wouldn't be too much of an issue. Or he could live in Hogwarts which I quote , “Is the safest place in earth other than Gringotts.” McGonagall can raise him right, he can even get some training too!

  Which is demonstrating what?
#+end_quote

Students either purposefully or on accident stumble upon that corridor like the golden trio + Neville in Philosophers stone they could've been killed, even Snape couldn't handle a Cerberus without getting a bloody mangled leg.

#+begin_quote
  Magic doesn't work like that and we're never shown it working like this. Consider, for example, a Horcrux. We know they can be damaged by Basilisk venom, therefore Acromantula Venom must work too! wut
#+end_quote

no one truly knows how and that would be JKR's fault, she didn't explain thorough enough, to her it's just convient that the chess set is there and most people's first instinct to do so is to play through it, while the others would've tried to find alternatives.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, this is my point. You need Ron to be objectively poor at chess for the trap to fail. You can't know this, you admit you can't know this, and yet act like you do know this.
#+end_quote

It's either this or McGonagall preset the chess to make the easiest move whenever the other player made theirs. It's kind of like those games on a tablet where you can set difficulty and McGonagall set it to easy.

#+begin_quote
  Nope. Hermione mentions Sprout. Harry says it's in herbology but he didn't recognise it. And our other bit of evidence is that it got into St Mungos... including after being seen by people who were nearly killed by it.
#+end_quote

Which basically indicates that it was taught in first year, both Harry and Hermione pays attention in class but can only vaguely remember Sprout mentioning it due to the stress of the situation. Most people panic when they are “strangled” by devil's snare and forget about what they were taught about it.

#+begin_quote
  Hell, it may even be the case that only First Years are likely to recognise it... that's a more reasonable explanation of the evidence than "everyone knows how to defeat it" which isn't actually the same as "everyone knows how to escape it".
#+end_quote

Actually you are half right about this. Knowing how to defeat it in turn you escape it. But I did also mention up there people panic so I'll give you half credit for this.

#+begin_quote
  The only way you can trial and error that system and be sure, is by imperioing other people (since conjuring humans seems impossible). And that is, of course, assuming it refills in any fashion (which it probably does since three people get there... although possibly Dumbledore had his own personal supply).
#+end_quote

Are you actually serious about this, conjuring humans? I meant conjuring animals not humans don't jump into conclusions. It's one of the five games law of transfiguration you CAN'T CONJURE OR TRANSFIGURÉ HUMANS. First years learn to transfigure cauldron to cats, which basically can work on anything after you master the spell.

#+begin_quote
  You sure? They answer riddles not logic puzzles.
#+end_quote

As a Ravenclaw I can tell you most answers are just logical answers or technical answers, so Riddles and logic puzzles are similar to quite an extent.

#+begin_quote
  Your answer? Assume that Ron's bad at chess (having no evidence for this), that a plant used to assassinate a wizard later on is actually not a big deal, that Fluffy is an easily researched question (despite Voldemort's having to resort to tricking Hagrid... Voldemort! well known wizarding genius) and that there are a whole bunch of loopholes to a logic puzzle (and, hey, we do know Barty Crouch jr is good at lateral thinking so maybe Voldemort was too). The point is... the only reason you have to believe these assumptions is the conclusion you want these assumptions to demonstrate. That's a terrible argument.
#+end_quote

Hermione said so herself wizards don't use logic. We're here originally debating about Dumbledore's competence, but now here we are arguing about things that JKR did a horrible job at writing it clear about. Voldemort is too proud and his pride was his eventual downfall, he didn't bother asking Quirrell to research, but rather resorting to drastic ways to get the information, Quirrell also could've just wen town to Hagrid's hut and lure him into telling him, but stupidity ensued and hence getting Hagrid drunk.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, precisely. We're meant to believe that Buckbeak isn't dangerous. If a dog attacked a child at a school... even if the child was being stupid... we'd destroy it. Really not sure what you think you're saying here.
#+end_quote

While a dog might be alive creatures too, it's entirely different from a Hippogriff as Hippogriffs fully understands what a human says and is extremely prideful, they attack, like humans when they are insulted. Buckbeak's execution was also due to corruption of course, without hearing testimony from other witnesses but Draco Malfoy's.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, hell, Sirius tried to murder Snape when he was a teenager and no-one cares particularly... it's not even Snape's worst memory. Judging anything in it by the standards of the real world is clearly completely insane.
#+end_quote

If anything, I'd rather you not start another sub-branch argument out of something that we don't know much about other than from Snape's perspective of the day's event. So let's leave it there.
