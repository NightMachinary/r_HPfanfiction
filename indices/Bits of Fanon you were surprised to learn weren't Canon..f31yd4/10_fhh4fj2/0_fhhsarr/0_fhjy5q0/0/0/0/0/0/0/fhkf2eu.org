  now wouldn't that include him checking up to Harry regularly at the Dursleys to make sure he's fine? I'll leave you to that.
#+end_quote

Yes, because paternalism means actually looking after someone's best interests? No it doesn't and you know it. It means acting in what you think is someone's best interest. Which, in this case, means putting Harry where he's safe, i.e. the Dursleys. Which, in this case, means making sure Harry doesn't grow up a celebrity, i.e. separating Harry from the magical world (which also has the effect of making him even safer).

It's a pathetically easy case.

  It's a group of teenagers , do you expect them to actually listen to what Dumbledore said? no
#+end_quote

Which is demonstrating what?

#+begin_quote
  Quirrel just needed to look into Care of Magical Creatures section for that piece of information, or read about Orpheus about that.
#+end_quote

And, yet, he didn't. No-one recognised this incredibly recognisable mythical creature... in a culture that routinely draws on classical mythology. Hey, it's as if this is not information available in the universe of Harry Potter.

  if the transfigured chess pieces can blow each other into rubble so easily then any second year up can blow it up with a simple bombarda.
#+end_quote

Magic doesn't work like that and we're never shown it working like this. Consider, for example, a Horcrux. We know they can be damaged by Basilisk venom, therefore Acromantula Venom must work too! wut

#+begin_quote
  If that doesn't work we still can't judge on Ron's chess skills
#+end_quote

Yes, this is my point. You need Ron to be objectively poor at chess for the trap to fail. You can't know this, you admit you can't know this, and yet act like you do know this.

Good work.

#+begin_quote
  It was taught in first year herbology class everyone knows how to defeat it
#+end_quote

Nope. Hermione mentions Sprout. Harry says it's in herbology but he didn't recognise it. And our other bit of evidence is that it got into St Mungos... including after being seen by people who were nearly killed by it.

Hell, it may even be the case that only First Years are likely to recognise it... that's a more reasonable explanation of the evidence than "everyone knows how to defeat it" which isn't actually the same as "everyone knows how to escape it".

#+begin_quote
  it's safe to assume it's self refilling
#+end_quote

hahahaha

oh, wait, ur serious

wtf

How is is safe to assume it's refilling? I mean, sure, maybe you can dance in and out of the room with a trial and error method. Maybe it works like that. But we also don't know if you can actually trial and error using conjured animals... nor, indeed, is it the case that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

The only way you can trial and error that system and be sure, is by imperioing other people (since conjuring humans seems impossible). And that is, of course, assuming it refills in any fashion (which it probably does since three people get there... although possibly Dumbledore had his own personal supply).

#+begin_quote
  Besides if they went down with a Ravenclaw student the logic puzzles wouldn't be a problem.
#+end_quote

You sure? They answer riddles not logic puzzles.

#+begin_quote
  That was only because Quirrel already knocked it out.
#+end_quote

No, it's because Quirrel (the guy trying to break in) was responsible for one of the layers of defence. It's a bad defence because the person who chose it doesn't want it to be a good one.

#+begin_quote
  But other than that the others are quite easy.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, of course they're easy if you presuppose that they're easy. But if you take them at face value, it's hard to conclude that they are easy. /Of course/ they're easy... Harry and his friends get through them. Er, no, maybe there's something special about Harry and his friends. How do you tell which interpretation is correct?

Your answer? Assume that Ron's bad at chess (having no evidence for this), that a plant used to assassinate a wizard later on is actually not a big deal, that Fluffy is an easily researched question (despite Voldemort's having to resort to tricking Hagrid... Voldemort! well known wizarding genius) and that there are a whole bunch of loopholes to a logic puzzle (and, hey, we do know Barty Crouch jr is good at lateral thinking so maybe Voldemort was too). The point is... the only reason you have to believe these assumptions is the conclusion you want these assumptions to demonstrate. That's a terrible argument.

(And, indeed, we do know that is the case... see: the mirror.)

#+begin_quote
  help a situation that really shouldn't be handled by them
#+end_quote

We've established that the only reason to put in the age line is to keep the pupils safe. We have also established that wizards don't consider Fluffy to be overly dangerous. So... why would they put an age line to prevent access to a security measure we're told only Dumbledore and Hagrid know how to circumvent when we have no evidence to believe they're actually worried about Fluffy's hurting pupils? It makes things extra safe? This is in the same book that tells us wizards aren't logical.

#+begin_quote
  Buckbeak is not dangerous at all yet they still decided to "kill" him because Lucius Malfoy ordered them to do so
#+end_quote

Yes, precisely. We're meant to believe that Buckbeak isn't dangerous. If a dog attacked a child at a school... even if the child was being stupid... we'd destroy it. Really not sure what you think you're saying here.

#+begin_quote
  It's like a strong repulse can cause blunt trauma if strong enough, and those are fatal, yet they still teach it in charms.
#+end_quote

How you think this helps your case escapes me.

You: Fluffy is too dangerous! Me: Fluffy is clearly not something wizards are overly concerned about... look at all these dangerous things wizards don't give two hoots about. You: Here are some more of those dangerous things wizards don't give two hoots about.

Hey, I guess that was your point... that "dangerous" is a label that the completely corrupt wizarding society allows to be applied via what passes for their political processes. Well, okay, clearly Quirrel should have been manipulating the political processes to have Fluffy destroyed (if, indeed, that's actually possible) instead of acting how he did. Are you actually surprised one of the most important figures in this corrupt society (i.e. Dumbledore) decides to just stick Fluffy in a school? It's a corrupt society that appears to endorse rule breaking for your own ends.

I mean, hell, Sirius tried to murder Snape when he was a teenager and no-one cares particularly... it's not even Snape's worst memory. Judging anything in it by the standards of the real world is clearly completely insane.
