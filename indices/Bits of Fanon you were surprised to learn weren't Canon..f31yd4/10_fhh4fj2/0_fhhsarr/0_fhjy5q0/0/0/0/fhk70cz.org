  Also, wizarding society clearly suffers from Blue and Orange Morality... no-one blinks an eye when Dumbledore says entering a corridor in a school will lead to a painful death.

Three first years managed to beat everything. If Dumbledore actually cares it would've been much harder and there would an age restriction line outside the door don't you think? And whatever is as obstacles in the maze is all taught in first year, a simple Wingardium Leviosa can knock out a troll just in case you don't remember there was a troll as an obstacle. Second, you are talking in a school full of teenagers, since when do they listen to teachers serious until they screw up deeply? I would bet that at least Fred and George would've went there first thing in the morning the next day after Dumbledore's announcement of staying clear from the third corridor of third floor.

  Sure, Ron complains about Fluffy when they meet him, but look at all the lethal things they engage with in Herbology.

Magic itself is dangerous too if we are going with your logic, and that's what Hogwarts's for, to learn how to control and prevent deaths or injuries from happening by learning the nature of them and how to defend themselves from it.

  Dumbledore doesn't create a martyr, but instead tricks a self-sacrificing and (in some ways) pessimistic young man into a situation which Dumbeldore believes the "martyr" will survive. There's absolutely no reason to believe that Harry couldn't have burnt himself and Voldemort to a crisp via Fiendfyre.

You said it yourself too, Dumbledore tricks a person that is self-sacrificing and pessimistic into saving the entirety of the Wizarding world just because a prophecy says it has to be him. It's a form of Manipulation, by using one's personality to manipulate the person into another's doing. In all words, doing the dirty work of one person without the other knowing. Prophecy's are always flimsy and you don't always know when and what will it happen until it's directly in your face, I think Dumbledore put too much weight on it.
