But isn't it suspicious when Dumbledore mentions "Ah, I see you did everything right. very good" or smth along the lines of that. I'm pretty sure if the CoS fiasco didn't happen Dumbledore would have something else in store for Harry. Not to mention that Dumbledore used Harry as a fucking bait for Voldemort which could've harmed other students in the school. That's already neglecting his duty as Headmaster, plus, I'm pretty sure Dumbles "greater good" would be taking control of Harry's life completely. He already succeeded in doing so by slowly creating a martyr(Harry).
