Dumbledore's actions really aren't utilitarian ("greater good") at all.

It's completely true that he manipulates and guides Harry's life, but one of the things he tries to manipulate Harry's life into being is ordinary or unburdened (something like that anyway). That's why he doesn't tell Harry about the prophecy earlier (he specifically says this in King's Cross). This is much more like paternalistic reasoning.

The Greater Good would suggest sticking Harry in a boot camp and training him as a child soldier or assassin, X-23 style. The closest you get to that is the first book.^{1}

^{1} Can we just talk about this for a minute? Fluffy must be immune to pretty much any magic since otherwise nothing in the book makes sense. The Devil's Snare kills Bode, iirc, in OOTP, which implies it's dangerous and, critically, rare. That Hermione knows what it is suggests nothing more than Hermione's obsessiveness and ignorance of magic... she reads about everything because she doesn't know what's important to read about (hence not knowing what mudblood means). I know they reference Professor Sprout and Harry assumes it's from Herbology but Hermione may have just asked her. It's a defensible trap is what I'm saying. The flying keys do seem an actually bad defence but, on the other hand, wizards aren't very logical... which is how they decide which key to look for. The logic trap is also used by Snape, which rather implies it's probably a true critique of wizarding society. The transfigured chess pieces. Let's talk about their ELO for a minute. That we know Ron can beat them doesn't tell us how good they actually are. For all we know Ron could be another Capablanca, Alekhine or whatever. It could actually be a very good defence. The troll is useless but Voldemort clearly influenced that one so whatever. And then there's the Mirror, which was only vulnerable because Harry was there.
