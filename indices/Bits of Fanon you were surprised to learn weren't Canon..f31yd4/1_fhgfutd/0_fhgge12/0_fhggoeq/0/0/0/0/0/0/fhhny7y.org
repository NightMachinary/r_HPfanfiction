There is an extra who is in Order of the Phoenix movie, who could DEFINITELY be Daphne. There's this blonde girl directly behind Harry (I don't know if it is canon or fanon that she is blonde, when he collapses during Fred and George's escape from Hogwarts. The girl is wearing Slytherin colors. There's a lot of people I see using her as a reference when it comes to depicting Daphne.
