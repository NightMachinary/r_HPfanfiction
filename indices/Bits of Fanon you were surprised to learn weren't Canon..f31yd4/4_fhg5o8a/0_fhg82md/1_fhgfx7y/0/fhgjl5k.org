I would disagree. Dumbledore clearly knows exactly why Harry went into Gryffindor rather than Slytherin, he is prompting Harry to remember a fact that they both know. Now, it is possible that he read Harry's mind, but at this point legilimancy hadn't been introduced, while the sorting hat was used multiple times in the fic, is present in Dumbledores office, and had Harry talk directly to it in a non sorting capacity. Other than fanon, there is nothing to suggest that the hat is sworn to keep the secrets of the people it sorts, while context readily hints at Dumbledore having knowledge that he could have easily gotten from the hat.
