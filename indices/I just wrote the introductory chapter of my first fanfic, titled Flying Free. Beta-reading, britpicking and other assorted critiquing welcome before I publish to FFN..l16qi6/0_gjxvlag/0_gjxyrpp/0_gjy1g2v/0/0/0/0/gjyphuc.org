The Wiki has Pigwidgeon as a "miniature" scops owl, which is a genus that's on the small end of the spectrum to begin with - averaging 20 centimeters in height in the case of the (common) Eurasian Scops Owl.

For reference, the elf owl is the very smallest species at 12-14 centimeters. Hedwig, a snowy owl, would be at least 3 times as tall as Pigwidgeon from head to talons if we take the average sizes - male snowy owls averaging 60 centimeters, with females being a bit bigger.
