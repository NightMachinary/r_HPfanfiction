Those are adult owls, though - birds tend to have fairly large differences in how the baby version looks compared to the adult. Compare this...

I will be elaborating a bit more (specifically that it looks /somewhat/ familiar but not really) thanks to your feedback, but to a child of all of one-and-a-half those two might as well be completely different species of bird. Harry would definitely recognize the latter as an "owl" but /probably/ not the former.

If I changed that paragraph to the below, would that help?

At that moment, Harry felt an intense double heartbeat. His father and the kindly old man who sometimes visited, seemed to have regained their senses just in time to witness this last surprise - Harry saw a vision of a small grey bird he didn't quite recognize, but that looked kind of like a small, fuzzier version of the birds that sometimes brought his mum and dad things. At that moment, he wanted nothing more to be not hurting his mummy and daddy, to not be Harry Potter who was currently making a mess of the nursery. His mind latched onto becoming that bird he just saw, as a way to not be in the middle of whatever was happening.
