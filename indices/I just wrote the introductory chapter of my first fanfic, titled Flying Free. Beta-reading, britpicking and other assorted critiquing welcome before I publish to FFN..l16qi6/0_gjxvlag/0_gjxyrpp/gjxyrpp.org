It's actually a version of the (Pottermore-)canon Animagus potion effect, which his magical surge is acting as a shortcut to/imitation of in that moment - that gives you a brief vision of the animal you turn into, after which you transform. Another hint to that effect is the "intense double heartbeat" that Harry feels, that's also how Pottermore describes the first transformation feeling.

Canonically, the Animagus potion doesn't really give you a choice as to "which animal do you end up with". If Harry had any control over that, I'd all but guarantee he wouldn't steer himself towards "owl" - in fact, in the brief scene that shows Harry's vision, I use the word "bird" to hint at the fact that Harry doesn't know which specific kind of bird he's seeing.\\
If Harry had a choice, he'd become an animal he immediately recognized - any of the stuffed toys in his crib, or a baby version of his dad's stag-form (which would more closely resemble the adult version than an owl-chick resembles an adult owl).
