Counterpoint: the perspective shift didn't bother me at all. For me it read smoothly as an omniscient narrator.

My nitpick would be that Harry didn't notice anything wrong. At that age kids are very alert to differences, and the stress from Lily plus the loud noises would be noticed by Harry, and he would either be curious or scared (depending on how well Lily kept her cool).

Otherwise, it was great! Looking forward to more, and thanks for the reply to bring me here :)
