It is, in fact, a Stunner she gets hit by. There's an explanation that will be pieced together over time for /why/ a Stunner and not a Killing Curse, but it won't be for a while - Snape's self-exiled, and Voldemort's dead. There's no-one they can question for the information at this point.

Thanks for the advice regarding perspective-shifting. Most of the fic will follow Harry's viewpoint exclusively, with minimal flashbacks or perspective-shifting and more forewarning when it happens - I couldn't write what I wanted in a way that avoided a certain degree of perspective-shifting here, though. Not without spending another month figuring it out, and I find my muse drying up rather quickly from writing-and-rewriting to that degree.
