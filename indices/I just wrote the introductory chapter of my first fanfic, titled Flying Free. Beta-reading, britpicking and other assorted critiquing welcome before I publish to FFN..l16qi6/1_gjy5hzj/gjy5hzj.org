What I found weird was the shift of perspective from Lily to Harry. In the beginning it seems like the chapter is told from Lily's perspective, but with her getting hit by the stunner (?) we suddenly are being told how Harry feels.

Maybe just not go into what the characters feel, and just tell what is happening? Although then you'd have to pass on telling about the "intense double heartbeat"... Still that could be told in a later flashback.

Otherwise I really liked it! Good work.
