Also, doing 50 at a time will help you sort out which ones failed easier than 1600 at once. Invariably a few fics out of that large number will fail to download properly. Second times the charm for most, unless the site isn't supported.

(I've downloaded around 200 fics, and Had 2 or 3 fail for whatever reason. I'd assume connection issues as they were mostly longer fics, greater than 100,000 words)
