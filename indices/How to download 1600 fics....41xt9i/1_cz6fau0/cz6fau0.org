Note: FF apparently doesn't like it when people hit it hard for downloads like that, and can blacklist IP addresses. FanFicFare proceeds very slowly with them as a result, but you still need to be careful. I did 50 at a time, two or three groups a day, just to be safe, by using a Firefox plugin that copied all selected links on a page (from my favorites list - groups of 50).
