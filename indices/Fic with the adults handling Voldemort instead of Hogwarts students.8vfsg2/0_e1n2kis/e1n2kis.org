[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously, and the canon plot was basically shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Although this Harry was significantly stronger than the canon version, Dumbledore really did the heavy lifting, even the Ministry was cooperative. But Voldemort would still have beaten them all, if Hermione and Aberforth hadn't picked up the slack. Canon Harry would never have a chance against this Voldemort, and canon Horcrux hunt would have never worked.
