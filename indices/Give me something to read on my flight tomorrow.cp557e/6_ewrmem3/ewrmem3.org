Have you read Antithesis? It is long but at the same time good and not boring.

New blood is also good and has a slytherin Hermione (But realistic, and it does not take away everything of what hermione used to be, you can still see parts of the cannon one there too)

If you want mystery, Basilisk Born by Ebenbild should do it. Nearly (Very nearly) complete. I would reccomend a long journey home but it is not as long and it does not have the same feeling of mystery.

Do you like horror? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]] is the longest good horror fic I have seen, with 40000 words but still a one shot (but large)\\
