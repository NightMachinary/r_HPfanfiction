A few things come to mind that fit this.

linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) is pretty good, but the writer's strengths lay more in character interaction than in plot, so be warned. It is however incredibly long. Very, Very slow updates (but the writer is working at it again, they said so in the Epilogue of Blindness)

linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?) is long and hysterical. Quite good in terms of grammar, and despite being crack actually does take a number of things seriously.

linkffn(The Song of the Trees) is a good mystery that is stopped right after the climax began. The mystery is solved by this point, it's really just wrapping up loose ends that's left, and the end of the climax.

linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate) is an interesting Avengers crossover. Very long, also not updated in quite some time.

linkffn(Broken Mind, Fractured Soul by Sensibly Tainted) is an interesting (if old) fic covering Multiple Personality Disorder. It is preslash, and the sequel /is/ slash, but overall it is quite good.

The Black Queen series by Silently Watches is pretty good, and also portrays a bunch of *horrible* people as the protagonists. I won't link it because of the Reddit rules. Four books, all complete however. The first chapter or two of Princess of the Blacks is very difficult to read, but is probably the darkest the series ever gets. Prepare for gore later on though.

linkffn(The Little Veela that Could) is pretty good (and complete), and does some very creative things with Christian lore.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) is long and very creative, but isn't tagged with much of anything so not many have read it. Awesome fights scenes though.

linkffn(Moon and Stone by Andrea13 and PersephoneKore) is a bit shortish, but is a really cool backstory of the Chamber of Secrets.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is a three and 1/100 book series that is quite old but has some good fights in it. The fourth book is only just started and very much abandoned, but Voldemort is dealt with quite handily by the end of book three. It could easily be called a trilogy really. This writer has some issues with repeating phrases but the grammar is pretty good otherwise.

linkffn(Never Alone, Never Again by Bored Beyond Belief) is ancient (2003!) but has actually aged fairly well. Grammar is excellent.

Aaaaaand I'm done. Cheers
