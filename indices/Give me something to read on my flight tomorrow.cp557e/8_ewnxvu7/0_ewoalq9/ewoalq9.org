It's not precisely /cliches/ that people complain about in Harry Crow; it's his [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Sue-ness]] (caution: TVTropes). Everything goes right for him, he's better than everyone at everything. Stories generally need conflict to be interesting, they need to challenge the protagonist(s) and have them overcome the challenge. If there isn't any credible threat or difficulty, it tends to be bland.
