A popular fanfic I would recommend is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071]]). It has 106 chapters and each chapter has quite a lot of content. This kept me busy for quite a while. But if you're not into clich√© fanfics, it probably won't be your cup of tea. I highly recommend checking RobSt's works out. Safe flight!
