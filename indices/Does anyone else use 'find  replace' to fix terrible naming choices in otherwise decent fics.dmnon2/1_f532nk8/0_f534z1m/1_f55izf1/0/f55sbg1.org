Basically the only thing she knew about her Mum's family were those flower names for girls. And yes plenty of them are ridiculous (Primrose, Daffodil, or Hyacinth Snape), but I don't think what she could have against some other. Just in Dudley-has-a-daughter-witch I read about Daisy, Holly, and some others, I have also read about Lilly Aster (in the real life!), Buttercup (Inconceivable!), Camellia, Iris, Jasmine, Sharon, etc. which all seem rather reasonable to me. After all, my wife has the Czech version of Marguerite. I cannot imagine any fem!Harry who wouldn't want to honor this family tradition, if she had the opportunity.
