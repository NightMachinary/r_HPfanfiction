Tomione as a genre casts a very broad net - are you searching for horror? Modern AU that explores a sinister Tom? Romance?

I notice as a ship there's a huge variation on how writers tell a story with those two. The first one I enjoyed which is an AU where hermione finds tom's diary rather than Ginny, made a big impression on me. linkao3(1731827)
