Linkffn(Pygmalion)

It's super dark and bleak but it's one of my favorite fanfics. Tom Riddle travels forward into the future on accident and begins to take over the world during Hermione's seventh year. People are super OOC but the whole premise of the story is that he turns them all dark.

There's another one where Hermione travels back in time that's really good but I don't remember the name. I remember there's Grindelwald and Slytherin and Dumbledore involved in Europe and at one point Tom takes out a hundred trees in a hissy fit. Does anyone else remember what I'm talking about?
