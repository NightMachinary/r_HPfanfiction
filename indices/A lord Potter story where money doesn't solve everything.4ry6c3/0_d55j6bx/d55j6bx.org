I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but it's close and a really good fic. Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) is a WBWL story where the author decided that all the usual tropes from those fics (James potter hating us for no reason, leaving harry with the dursleys, etc.) has to make sense. It is a Lord Potter story, it's s excellent, and the fact that harry is the heir to the potter fortune doesn't make his life any easier.
