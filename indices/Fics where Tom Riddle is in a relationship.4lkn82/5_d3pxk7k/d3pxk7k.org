Linkffn(Persephone by dulce.de.leche.go)\\
Tom/Hermione, dark Hermione, AU after near the end of DH, time travel (usage of a time turner multiple times), WIP but updated regularly. Tom is pretty much always in character, and Hermione is often OOC, but for very good reason.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Rose by MissRoseAlanaHorton)\\
Regularly updated WIP, self-described as AU-ish, likable OC. Definitely recommend for a nice long read that will just keep getting longer
