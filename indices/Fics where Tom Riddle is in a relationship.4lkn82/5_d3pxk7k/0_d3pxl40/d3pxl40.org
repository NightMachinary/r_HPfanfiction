  She knew she loved him too much for her own good. She knew that no matter what seemingly unthinkable thing he did tomorrow or the next day, she would desperately try to wrap her head and heart around it in an attempt to understand. And there were only two ways that could possibly end: either she would break him, or he would break her. TRXOC. Lemons. AU-ish. LONG.

  Better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path. Better still to be the consort of Hades than a part of his collection of souls. Ten years after Voldemort has won the war, Hermione reaches a breaking point and shreds the flow of time to change her future. If she can't change the world, she will change her place in it. - Extremely dark Tomione/Volmione. Warnings inside.
