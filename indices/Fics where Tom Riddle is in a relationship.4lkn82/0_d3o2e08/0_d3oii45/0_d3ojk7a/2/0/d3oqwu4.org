That's strange. I liked /Nightmare/ at first, but then when I realized how abusive and manipulative the relationship was, I started to really dislike it. I also didn't like how OOC (Out-of-Character) Hermione was throughout the story. On the other hand, I really loved /Tied for Last/, and re-read it every now and again.

You're welcome!
