linkao3(Slytherin Career Day by Cambangst) is a fun thing that I'll re-read any day of the year. Love the characterisations. Features a Snape who is rather over his students and their lack of ambitions, but has a job to do regardless.

linkao3(Civil Disobedience by Oceanbreeze7) features a petty af Riddle who has learned that the Minister for Magic now must be of pure blood for three generations in order to have that position, and his plans for becoming a terrorist/Dark Lord are set aside in his spite.

Happy April!
