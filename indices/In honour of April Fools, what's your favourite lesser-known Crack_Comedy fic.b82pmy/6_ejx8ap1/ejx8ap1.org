Surprised no one's mentioned /Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary/, linkffn(12407442). Not crack, but still hilarious. Also, /Boggarts and Monsters/, linkffn(12663362). Definite crack by the same author.

/The Professors' Point of View/, linkffn(7031677): a nearly complete retelling of the series through teachers' memos. Plus, /The Teachers' Notebook/, linkffn(4207913), for the Marauders' era.

/The Rise and Fall of Harry J Potter/, linkffn(8553100): a parody of Super!Harry fics as told by Rita Skeeter.

/Just a Random Tuesday...,/ linkffn(3124159): a day in Minerva's life in fifth year--canon-compliant, but one of the funniest fics ever.
