linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce by imagitory) is one that I couldn't really get into, but I know plenty of people liked it.

And there are a ton of fics that play up Harry's ability to cook, and plenty where he opens some sort of restaurant, but it's usually just there for Harry to impress his love interest once or twice, and not really an important part of the story.
