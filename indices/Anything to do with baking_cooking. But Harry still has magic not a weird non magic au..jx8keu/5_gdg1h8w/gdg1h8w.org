linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten). Harry cooks meals for several people, wants to become a cook/baker. Despite the name, there's still a lot of magic involved.

linkffn(Café by Pleasedial123). Harry gets emancipated, buys a house, starts baking for neighbors.

linkffn(At Jacques' by The Ghostly Minion). Harry is chef at a high-end restaurant.

linkffn(Blackdog by Atlantis Sinatra). Fem!Harry "retires" to NYC and opens a coffee shop. Cross with Avengers. Not much more than a start.

linkffn(Early Retirement by Secondary Luminescence). Fem!Harry runs a café in NYC. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Wanderer by cywsaphyre). Immortal!MoD!Harry opens a coffee shop in California. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Heroes Assemble by Stargon1). Harry leaves Britain after winning, eventually opens "cafe-restaurant-pub kind of thing" in NYC. Avengers cross.

linkffn(Magic of the Force by Vimesenthusiast). Star Wars cross. Jedi Padawan Harry has cooking as a hobby.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Love by Rorschach's Blot). Crack. Harry joins Hermione's Home Ec club at Hogwarts.

linkffn(What Witches Want by Almost Anonymous). Crack. Not cooking, per se, but producing food.

There's another crack one-shot that fits, but I can't find it at the moment. I suspect it's a single chapter out of someone's one-shots collection. Harry makes desserts so wonderful that any witch who eats one becomes devoted to him.
