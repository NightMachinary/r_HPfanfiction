I knew nothing about Fate/stay night, so that was rather confusing. But it was an interesting very AU Harry. I read quickly, so new long stories are a good thing to me. The OP!Harry is maxed out here, way more even that that Miranda Flairgold duology where he goes to that other school of magic and becomes both a thunderbird and a basilisk animagus.
