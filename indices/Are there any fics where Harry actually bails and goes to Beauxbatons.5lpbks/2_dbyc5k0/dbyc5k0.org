Ive asked this same thing multiple times here [[/u/Ironshards]]... sadly the only one that ever seems to get linked is "The Accidental Bond" which has been linked here already.

Don't be a Dobby Downer is well worth a read too but its brand spanking new. I am looking forward to great things from it... terrible... but great ;)

I do hope more FF authors see these requests and explore the idea of Harry at other schools more in the future. There are a few out there but so very few and only the 1 or 2 Beauxbatons ones which is so disappoint. Ive tried to write myself but struggle as my creativity lies more in drawing/painting then writing.
