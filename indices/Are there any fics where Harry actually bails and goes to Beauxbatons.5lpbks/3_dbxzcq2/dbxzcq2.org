I'll unhelpfully say 'I've read one but I don't remember the title' - as encouragement to keep looking. It's out there. I'll update if I can hunt it down.

P.S. I can't swear that it's /good/, but don't take the fact that I can't remember the particulars either way. I have a horrible memory.

[edit] P.P.S. I think Harry (and Hermione?) transfer to Beauxbaton's when his name comes out of the Goblet and he refuses to participate... Or, he transfers in anticipation of another bad year at Hogwarts and gets sucked into the tournament anyway...

I need more sleep. Or a decade or two back.
