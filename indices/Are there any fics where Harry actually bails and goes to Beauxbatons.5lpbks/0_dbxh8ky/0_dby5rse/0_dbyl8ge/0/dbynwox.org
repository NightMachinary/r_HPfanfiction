Chapters are progressively getting longer, I'm probably settling around 4k-6k words per chapter because that's the easiest way for me to block out work for myself.

The Veela aren't glowing, you just think they are. Chapter 8 gives some hints on why that is, but I haven't finished Chapter 8 yet.

I do have a beta, though when I first started writing, I was writing quick and haphazardly, things should get better. This is my first fic ever, and my first ever attempt at REALLY writing, so I'm experiencing a few growing pains.

Thanks for commenting.
