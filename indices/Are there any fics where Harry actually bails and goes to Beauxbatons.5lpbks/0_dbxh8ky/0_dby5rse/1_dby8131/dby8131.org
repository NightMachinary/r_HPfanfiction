I enjoyed what was there. Only issue for me is there was too much Hogwarts bashing in general. Even Dumbledore bashed Hogwarts! Don't get me wrong, I was THRILLED TO BITS that Dumbledore wasn't gonna be all "I have to get Harry back to meet my PLAN mwahahaha", but the level of Hogwarts and Britain bashing seemed unnecessary.

I look forward to seeing where it goes but I tend to side with [[/u/Taure]] on the level of governmental and educational function/dysfunction in the HPverse and you seem to be more on the "Hogwarts and Ministry are just so stupid, amiright" fanfiction train that seems very common.

So my recommendation is to tone that down and focus more on the world building in Beauxbatons. Also, maybe less on the theme that mind magic is all powerful?

Anyway, I did enjoy it, just wanted to leave a bit of constructive criticism. Good luck!
