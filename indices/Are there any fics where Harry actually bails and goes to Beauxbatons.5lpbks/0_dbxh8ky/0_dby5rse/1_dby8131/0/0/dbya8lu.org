Sure, I figured that, and noticed the foreshadowing, but it's still very distracting IMO. What's there feels heavy handed...I don't think there's a chapter that doesn't include some comment about the stupidity of Britain. And if the curse is so bad and can't be removed or alleviated, why do people still live there?

I'm sure you'll go into more detail as time goes on, but these are the sort of questions that pop into my head.
