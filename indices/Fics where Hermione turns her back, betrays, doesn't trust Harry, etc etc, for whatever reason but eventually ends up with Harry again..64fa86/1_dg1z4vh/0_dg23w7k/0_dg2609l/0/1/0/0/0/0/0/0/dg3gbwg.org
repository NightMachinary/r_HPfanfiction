Once again read the whole story than comment. It starts out that way but considiring by the end he he has been sexually molested, skull blown open, problems with friends and multitude of other different things happen.

The harry i believe your thinking of is everything goes his way. Trust me it doesn't. It starts out like that, but the only difference between this harry, and canon harry is he is rich, and actually uses that money instead of being founders heir of anscestor of merlin or has rare power to get things done.
