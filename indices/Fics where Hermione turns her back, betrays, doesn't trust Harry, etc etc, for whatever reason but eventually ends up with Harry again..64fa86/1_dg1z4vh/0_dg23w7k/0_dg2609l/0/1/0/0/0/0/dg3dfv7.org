oh yeah harry owns everything, but unlike other stories there is a reason for that and he actually uses it for something. All he has is money and a fancy spy mirror everthing else, his power is average, hocrux actually almost kills him by blowing his skull wide open.

He does have a lot of problems. I'm not going to tell more about the story just read it or don't. I'm basically telling you the story otherwise. I will say it is very different from any story i've ever read before including the harry owns everything story. Give it a shot. Read the first couple chapters.
