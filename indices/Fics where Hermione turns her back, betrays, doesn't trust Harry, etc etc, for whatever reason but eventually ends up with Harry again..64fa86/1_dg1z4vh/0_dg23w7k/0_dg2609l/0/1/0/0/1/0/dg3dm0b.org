Just read it. The answers are there for you i'm not going to tell the story because that ruins it. Yes it is treated as canon. No it doesn't really bash dumbledore there is a whole build up to it i can't just write what it is. The point of imposing it is the same for why other authors do it. It gives characters depth. Something to grow past.
