I skimmed through the first few chapters, and they didn't really read any different than any other Indie!Harry. Helpful goblins, a fortune in his vault, Dumbledore being an antagonist, Harry deciding to take matters into his own hands, with the help of a few OCs at most, fooling the Order and sending letters to his friends and to Sirius after the fact...

Really, that's different how?
