Lemme get this straight... Just hypothetically, if I were to write a fic with a Manipulative!Dumbledore who keeps trying to oppress Independent!Powerful!Harry while yammering on about Greater Good, but does it in a laughably inept ways that are easily foiled by Harry, you would call it bashing; but if I then revealed that the reason he (Dumbledore) is like that is that in /this/ fic, he suffered a severe head injury during his battle with Grindelwald, you would no longer call it bashing because now there's a "reason" for it?

But, you're right. I guess I owe you genuine thanks for saving me the time I would have spent reading this fic before dropping it in disgust.
