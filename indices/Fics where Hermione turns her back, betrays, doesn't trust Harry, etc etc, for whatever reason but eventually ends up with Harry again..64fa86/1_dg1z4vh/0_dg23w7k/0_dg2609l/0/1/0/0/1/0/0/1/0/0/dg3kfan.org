No. Just like real life if they actually have problems that make them this way it is not bashing. Bashing is when you degrade a character for no reason other than entertainment value.

Secondly are you retarted or something. Do you not know what bashing is. If dumbledore treated harry less than right because he is going to die, and harry treats the headmaster like crap, because he somehow found out about this, and dumbledore has tried everything to get rid of the hocrux, but than through circumstance or magic the hocrux is gone, and dumbledore tries to be a better person that is not bashing. When everything above, but instead he continues being unreasnable (harry and dumbledore) that is bashing.

In this story dumbledore while vindictive, and let his emotions get the better of him still believes harry is a hocrux so he doesn't want a happy person(like dumbledore did in the books and movies.)Harry wouldn't be willing to sacrifice himselfif he was happy.

Could this story be improved? Yes like all storys, but it does not have pointless bashing. If it is bashing it is there for a reason. God you are an idiot to not understand this. Characters in popular culture are 'bashed' yet none complain about it because it is there for a reason.
