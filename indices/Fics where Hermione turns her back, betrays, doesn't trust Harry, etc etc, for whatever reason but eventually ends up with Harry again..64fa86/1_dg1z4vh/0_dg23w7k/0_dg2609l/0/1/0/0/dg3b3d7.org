The main reason is that she was bullied quite a lot growing up, and only the adults were kind to her so she trusts adults to an unhealthy degree because of that.

When she saw harry there tied naked to a bed surrounded by jeering girls, and dumbledore doesn't try to cover him up or keep him warm as a form of revenge for earlier in the story when harry led a peaceful rebellion, and succesfully got umbridge, and later snape kicked out.

That snapped her out of the adults are infallable notion.

P.S. What link. I'm a little confused here.
