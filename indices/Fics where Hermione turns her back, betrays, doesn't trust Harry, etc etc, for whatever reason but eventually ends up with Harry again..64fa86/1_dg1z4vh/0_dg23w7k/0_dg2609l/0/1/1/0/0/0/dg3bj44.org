First read the whole story, and not a chapter, and you will understand how stupiudly wrong you are. Reading a chapter near the end isn't the same as reading the story.

So before you write more comments that are quite frankly untrue read the story than comment.

Do you think watching a scene of a movie will tell you all you need to know about the movie. Or more along the theme reading the fifth to last chapter of a harry potter book will tell you all you need to know? No. Stop being an idiot, and before you comment learn the material.
