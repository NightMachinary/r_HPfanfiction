As someone that was unfamiliar with Stargate I can say, that is not really true.At least for me. He explains easily enough that I understood everything that was happening. Same goes for all the other crossovers he wrote by the way. Most don't seem like they would work (HP/Jurrassic Park, HP/Hawaii Five-0) but they were really fun reads. "Harry Potter: Geth" and "Harry and a Vampire" being by far the best in my opinion.
