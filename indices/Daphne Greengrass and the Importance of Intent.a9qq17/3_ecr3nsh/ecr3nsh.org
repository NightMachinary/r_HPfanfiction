Not a huge fan. The opening commits one of the Deadly Sins of fanfiction, that of elevating a side character/OC into someone more important than the protagonists we are familiar with. Also known as "American transfer student holds the key to defeating Voldemort" syndrome.

In the space of a few short paragraphs, the reader is /told/ that this is a character to rival Hermione Granger in capabilities (and, by implication, leave Harry in the dust). We're also told she was instrumental to Voldemort's defeat. So in the space of a few paragraphs a character has gone from being no one to being more important than two of the most consequential characters in the series.

She hasn't earned that status, it's simply declared to the reader. And that naturally leads to the reader disliking her. It is this which is at the core of the dislike towards Mary Sues.
