Snily is the going term though I loathe it; for that ship I prefer LE/SS as those initials are fairly unique I think? But there is a place for ship names. For example, wolfstar is lovely as ship names go. And when you want to get into tropes and away from (romantic) shipping, I've found "severitus" a useful filter as I don't tend to like fic that labels itself that way.
