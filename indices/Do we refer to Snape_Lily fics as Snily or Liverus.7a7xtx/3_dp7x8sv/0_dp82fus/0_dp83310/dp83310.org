I prefer name acronyms for pairings, except when multiple people share the same initials. Like if it said "HPxPP." Which PP is that? One of the Patils? Which one? Or is it Pansy Parkinson? Sometimes you can find out from summary context, like if it says "ravenclaw Harry" it's probably not going to be Harry x Parvati, likewise if it's HPxPPxPP, it probably isn't Padma and Pansy.
