Perfectly valid point. Still hate them; just my personal hang up, I guess.

(I mean, it wouldn't stop me reading a fic if I saw it in a summary and I'm not gonna flame/downvote/hate on people that do use them or anything like that, but they do generate an irrational burst of anger whenever I see them.)
