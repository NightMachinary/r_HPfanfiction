I wish people would use the downvote button properly. It means "this post does not belong here as it's not answering the question", not "I don't like this story even though it fits the criteria OP is asking for".

HPMoR has a lot of shout-outs, which are listed [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality][here]], but Harry also explicitly thinks in tropes at several points, directly comparing characters to other fictional characters or tropes.
