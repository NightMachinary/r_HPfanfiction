Its kind of sad your asking for a well read harry, if you were just asking for a harry that references things, there appears to be a type of story emerging where there set in modern times and harry makes quite a few references to memes and the like. I think part of your problem might be that generally hermione fills the "nose-buried-in-a-book" personality, so people generally don't write harry that way.
