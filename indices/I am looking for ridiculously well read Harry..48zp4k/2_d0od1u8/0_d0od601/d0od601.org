I'll take well read Hermione as well, I haven't exactly seen that either. The way Hermione is portrayed in the books and in most fanfics is generally nebulously 'smart' without any substance to back it up. We are informed that she is smart, but she doesn't actually act smart most of the time.

Why is it sad that I am asking for well-read Harry anyway? I don't think it's pathetic to want to read a protagonist who is well read, it's usually interesting.
