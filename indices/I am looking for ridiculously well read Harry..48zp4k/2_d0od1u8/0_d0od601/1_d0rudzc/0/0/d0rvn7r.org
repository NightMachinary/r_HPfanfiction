I don't think J.K worked on expanding and developing her as much as she could have, certainly.

Poor Hermione had no social skills, and I'm not really sure why not. Perhaps her magic created a bridge between her and other children, or perhaps her parents were Katie Hopkins-like. Whatever the case, she ended up always trying to prove herself as superior to the others, thinking that they'd like her because she was clever, or at least admire her. And they didn't, she was just the lonely nerd no one liked, but then she found a purpose - saving the Boy Who Lived. She couldn't just live her life like the boys did, enjoying Quidditch and stuff, because she had to have a purpose, something to offer the wizarding world.

I guess that's why it's Hermione/Ron, and not H/H, because to her, Harry was someone who gave her a purpose, a usefulness, a status. She loved Ron because he made her a person, and nothing more. He didn't need her, he just liked and then loved her.

I think that's the difference between her and Luna. Both were pretty similar - Luna was Ravenclaw, so obviously clever, both were rejected and made fun of for their knowledge. Hermione learned because she needed to be able to help, to save, to protect, to be worth something, whereas Luna just needed people to like her for who she was. I think that's why the Hat chose Gryffindor.

Your last part pretty much sums her up. We wouldn't know half the stuff we did about Hogwarts if we didn't have Hermione quoting Hogwarts: A History in the background.
