That actually seems like a pretty accurate summation of Hermione's Character from the books. It explains why she is always the one who owns useful items and knows useful spells but she doesn't make good decisions.

I can't help but feel that her character was meant to be smart and wise and Mary-Sueish by J.K. Rowling. It's hard to tell because most characters in the books don't act how humans would act and they don't have any logical decision making skills, so it seems that she is so much smarter than the rest when she makes a reasonable decision. It's especially noticeable in book three when Hermione treats Harry and Ron as total retards when she deals with the firebolt broom and when they can't figure out what could be wrong with lupin, which is justified only because they act like retards and so she seems smart in contrast.

To be honest I wouldn't be friends with somebody so condescending.

It's really hard figure her out, because she is mostly a plot device to deliver exposition and to solve problems that Harry couldn't solve so she magically either has useful knowledge and rational thought or she doesn't depending on what the plot needs.
