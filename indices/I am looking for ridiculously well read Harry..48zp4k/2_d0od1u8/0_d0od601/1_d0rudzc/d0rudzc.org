I don't know that Hermione is meant to be smart, per say, I think it's more she had pushy parents who named her because they 'thought it sounded clever', and who worked hard because she hoped being clever would gain other people's approval/friendship. So I agree with you. If she'd grown up like me, not a smart kid, but just a wide reader who liked reading, she'd have known who Flamel was, and the Cerberus thing, and lots of other things we sitting on the other side of the page from her, bouncing up and down, hissed the answers to at her. Her trouble was she didn't read for the love of it, or because she had a thirst for knowledge, but because she wanted to know things that would help other people. If she knew all about Hogwarts, and magic, she could help other new students, and become friends with them, and if situations came up, she could help her new friends, and rescue them. That lie about going after the troll - what kid would think up a lie like that? Why not, I got separated and lost, or I didn't go to the feast, or I had left the hall to go to the bathroom? Because using her knowledge about trolls to save other students is exactly what Hermione /would/ do.

That's why she was Gryffindor, and not Ravenclaw. I think. That's why her grades were so important to her, because without them, her parents were disappointed, and she was just another lonely loser.
