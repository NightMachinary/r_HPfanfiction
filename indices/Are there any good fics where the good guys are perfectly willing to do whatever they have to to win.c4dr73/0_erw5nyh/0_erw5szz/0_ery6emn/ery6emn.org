Isn't, you know, the traditional villain someone who has a goal and is willing to do anything, no matter how illegal and amoral, to accomplish it?

If you have your heroes throw out any restraint and kill, cheat, and steal for their victory are they still the Good Guys? Or have they become the Baddies?

The Good Guys kind of have to remain Good, or they aren't. Just look at how people demonize the fanon Greater Good Dumbledore.

I'm not saying that couldn't be an interesting story, about how people compromise their principles for a victory. But if you protag breaks into someones home, kidnaps their child and sends them a finger at a time until they give in they're not a good person.
