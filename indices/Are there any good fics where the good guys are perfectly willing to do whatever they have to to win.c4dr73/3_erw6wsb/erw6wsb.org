Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Fudge doesn't deny Voldemort's return, but instead tries appeasement to avoid a war.

After a year of constant discrimination from the ministry and Umbridge at Hogwarts, Hermione organizes the muggleborns to fight back. Brutally.

As it turns out, ancient wards are good against spells and intruders but not really designed to handle half a ton of semtex plastic explosive.
