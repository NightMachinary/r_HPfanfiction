The 'house elves need to be bonded or they die'-concept is increasingly annoying to me. Mainly because I find it to be a cheap justification to portray the magical community (at least the upper echelons) as less archaic and rooted in classism and racism as it is originally described as. People tend to whitewash their own rationale to establish it as the moral high ground - often without realising it. Unfortunately in the course of that all the moral nuances often get 'lost in translation'.

I can not argue this scientifically, but I find the idea of them being symboitic creatures that draw on their masters/families magic to survive implausible. For one because - hopefully I don't confuse canon with fanon here - it is well established that the magic of house elves is very different to the magic that human magicals use. If they'd draw the magic from them, I believe their magic would have adapted and assimilated to be much more similar.

Also I am working under the premise that magical cores are not a real thing. That means that magic is a natural energy that is generated by world around us [1], meaning that magical beings are mere conduits but no sources. Therefore Elves could, like everyone else, just draw the magic from the world around them, making the bond to their families not vital.

Personally, I believe that the enslavement of the elves had no magical reason at all. The wizards saw a magically powerful race without any inherent pride, ambition or political agenda, what they had was a deep seated need for community and they took the opportunity to employ them for their own advantage. An unkown amount of time later, this need for community has developed into the deferential attitude we know today. The original employment would not even have needed to start out as blatant slavery.

[1] There is a Avatar/HP-crossover that developed the theory that magic is the excess energy that was generated by the planet, and as the planet slowly died, everything magical died because all energy was needed just to sustain what was left. I like that approach very much.
