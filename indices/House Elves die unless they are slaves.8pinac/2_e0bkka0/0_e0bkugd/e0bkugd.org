I have to entirely agree with the first part of that. I merely mention the parasitic idea because fanon often has them drawing on the magic of wizards to survive.

We don't know /why/ they need those things though, or under what circumstances they could still be happy. Wizards may have ended up taking advantage of an incredibly benevolent species. Why does giving them clothes cut them out of this household community? Winky and Kreacher's reactions could be put down to the fact that the House Elves seem to have incredibly strong emotional bonds to people.

Even if the relationship isn't one of slavery to them (which it may well not be), there is a question of exactly how they got into this position in the first place, and plenty of reason to urge the importance of treating them well. How did a species become so thoroughly dependent?
