If they were parasitic, we would see different behaviour from the elves in canon.

The only thing we actually see is elves /need/ a home, which they can change without too much difficulty, and /wanting/ a family so deeply and pervadingly that they suffer profoundly if they get one and lose it. Winky turns to drink, and Kreacher becomes a surly, misanthropic little shit worshipping a dead woman's portrait. We never learn what became of Winky, but we see that once Kreacher starts getting acceptance as a member of Harry's little ersatz family, he becomes a lot healthier in his relationships with others.

They're not parasitic, they're /dependent/, to an extent a human couldn't be. The relationship isn't, to them, slavery, it's clinging to family through thick and thin because the alternative is worse. They won't leave until they're kicked out in the proper ritual form.
