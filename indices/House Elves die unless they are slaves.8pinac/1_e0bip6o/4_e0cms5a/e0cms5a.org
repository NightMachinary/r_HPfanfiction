Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin does it. They go into some detail about it relating it to the concept of Wild Magic(which I found pretty interesting). Although they explore the origin of house elves being created by ancient wizards ages ago, so far their relation to wild magic has been intentionally ambiguous. From what I understand, Wild Magic is forbidden/taboo and was what existed before Wizards "tamed" magic with the use of runes, arithmancy and foci such as wands/staves.

Tbh, I just reread it and it still remains one of my favorites from the last few years. Worth a read if you're interested in a solid Slytherin Harry. Though it is still a WIP, it is extremely dense, packing a lot of story into the first few years.
