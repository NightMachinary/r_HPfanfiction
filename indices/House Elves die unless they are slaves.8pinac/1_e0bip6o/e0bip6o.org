You know, I hear about this trope a lot, and I'm pretty sure I've complained about it more than once myself...but I don't actually remember seeing any fics recently that feature this justification.

Has anyone seen a fic recently that does this trope? The only thing I vaguely remember is something about house-elves just laying down and dying if they don't have a master.
