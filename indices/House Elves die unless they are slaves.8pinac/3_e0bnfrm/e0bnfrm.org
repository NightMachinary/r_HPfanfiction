I wish I could find it again, but there was a fic in which the symbiotic relationship between human and elve was explained rather well. It started off even before humans evolved, establishing elves as an even older race of beings that feeds on sources of magic. That may be the mountains, the forests, the waters,... . Those elvish species split eventually on the evolutionary tree and became dwarves, goblins, nymphs, merpeople,... . It established humanity as an oddity among magical beings in that the hybrids between elves and homo sapiens have developed to become the only species of sentients that were simultaneously a source of magic and independent from any source - free to roam all of the earth. The Houselve was just a logical evolution of the predecessors they share with dwarves and goblins, to latch onto human magic as just one more source of (magical) nutrient.

The story went further in that Hermione had a point. Even though they were sentient, highly intelligent thinking and feeling beings (since according to this fic they basically built human society alongside their Masters), they were treated worse by the law than animals who have entered similar symbiotic relationships with humanity (in the fanfic it was kneazels and owls, all being protected from abusive mages). She gave up on them freeing themselves (as that /did/ severely hurt them and in some cases, kill them), but she pushed through protective laws (adapted civil rights) for houselves and a "Houselve Adoption Process".

In any case, I like the idea, if done properly and in an interesting way.

On the other side I find the story possibilities behind it being just straight up slavery interesting too. How were they enslaved? Is it some sort of species-specific curse or just cultural between the elves. Are there places where houseleves live freely? Have free houseelves gone exctinct?
