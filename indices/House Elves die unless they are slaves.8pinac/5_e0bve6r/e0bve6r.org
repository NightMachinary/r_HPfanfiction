The easiest way I find to look at the origins of house-elves for me is look at what else wizarding homes have. They have mirrors that comment on their appearance. There is a least one incidence of a clock that keeps track of how people are doing. Is it outside of the realms of possibility that a wizard one day decided cleaning is too much effort when he could magically create something to do it for him? So I guess b) but I don't think slaves were the original plan. More just magically created help. An enchanted broom isn't versatile enough, same with a mop or any other household cleaning tool. In the end they created something that can use all of that. I would find a sentient mirror creepy as fuck honestly, watching over as I sleep etc. I don't think I could sleep fine.

With that in mind I think its not unreasonable, for authors who go with B ) to have house-elves genuinely enjoy their work. With B ) they have a purpose in life. a purpose they were created to fulfil. Having a purpose in life is more than we have so really who are we to tell them that we regret their creation and that they should find new purpose. I think A) or c) don't make sense for me and if they're used in stories then you have more of a slavery thing going on. At least with B you know full well that they're a very different species who don't think the same as us. That don't have the same standards as us. Something that annoys me a bit with this fandom is when it tries to humanise things that are proud not to be human. Goblins for example, we see they have their whole law on inheritance and ownership, how I take this is they have a very different but equally valid view. Most importantly they don't think the same as we do. They're fundamentally not human. Does that make slaving them okay? No, of course not. That being said, if you created a magical being to serve you then chances are if you made it right then it wants to serve you and could find no higher purpose than serving you. Now debating the ethics of creating something to serve you is a whole separate debate, but lets be honest, the ethics of the wizarding world are terrifying at the best of times. Obliviation is terrifying.
