I am going to give you the cut and dry of why this often comes up from *narrative* perspective:

When authors include this trope in their fics, it almost invariably not about house-elves; it's about /Hermione/.

Most fics that use this trope do so as a result of some aspect of the story related to Hermione's character.

1. They want to show her as simply ignorant and trying to change things she does not understand.
2. They want to show Hermione as a misguided crusader; she fights for something she believes but does not understand how other people think or the magical world (ex. this was just stated almost verbatim in The Mind Arts chapter released yesterday).
3. The author does not want Hermione to suck the focus away from the story with house-elf rights and the like, so they use this to quickly shut down her moral grandstanding. Authors have a story they want to tell, and this only adds words to something that almost /never/ goes anywhere anyway in fics.

In other words, the trope is a way of shutting Hermione up about this, while trying not to change her as a character (or how the author perceives them at least). Their is also the aspect that the author wants to rationalize the way the magical world works (i.e. it appears inconsistent and ridiculous to muggles because muggles don't understand magic).

On a side note, my favorite iteration of this trope is actually Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). House elves don't need to bond with wizards/witches, but they do need to dwell in a wizard's home, or more accurately a dwelling which has been occupied by magical beings for long periods of time. So they need the homes, not necessarily any given wizard/witch.

I hope this helps clarify, at least in my thoughts.

Note: I am not lambasting Hermione, she is mostly correct from an ideological point-of-view in canon, but she does not have a good idea how to go about issues like this (at least initially).
