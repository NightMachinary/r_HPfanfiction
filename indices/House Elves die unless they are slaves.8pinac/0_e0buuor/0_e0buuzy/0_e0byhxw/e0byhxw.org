Now I completely agree with that personally. Those definitely tend to be the reasons authors seem to do it, but I just don't think they really think through the consequences.

That sounds like an interesting idea and I think I might have to try it out (as much as I hate practically any bashing).

I didn't think you were lambasting Hermione by the way, she definitely doesn't get everything right in terms of how to go about it, there are disturbing parallels to the way in which British women treated the fight against slavery. I think occasionally the authors might have picked up on that and just turned it up to eleven by forcing her into situations where she's wrong.
