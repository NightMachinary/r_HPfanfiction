Well people rarely think through the ramifications of certain story points. Case in point, look at Mrs. Rowling:

- Book 3 Sirius was sent to Azkaban, a prison run by soul-sucking amortal monsters, without a trial when he was innocent. Rowling set up a list of contrived plot elements to essentially force Sirius to be seen as guilty when he was actually innocent. The nature of the Fidelius Charm, not telling anyone else about the switch, not trusting Lupin because /werewolf/, Sirius is laughing like a maniac and saying its his fault they died, Lupin absolutely believing it. Sirius ALSO didn't have the Dark Mark, which wasn't a problem because ROWLING HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT YET.
- Book 4 Rowling introduces the concept of Veritaserum, a truth potion controlled by the Ministry that compels the drinker to tell the truth. She created this as a quick way to simply /force/ Crouch to spill his guts and not show the torture or more adult methods you would expect. This was not used on Sirius or seemingly even considered. Nor was this used on the "Imperius-victims" to find out whether they willingly served Voldemort, for apparently no reason.
- Book 5 Rowling introduces legilimency, which allows users to examine thoughts and emotions of individuals, view memories, and possibly induce false images. She created this as a way to allow Voldemort to trick Harry by way of his scar (project images to him) and get him out of school. More importantly, Dumbledore was a legilimens and potentially there were others who could have simply examined the memories of others, including Sirius and potential Death Eaters. But this was never done, also apparently for no reason.

What I'm getting at here is that many authors, including Rowling herself, introduce elements as quick ways to resolve plot points in a story that they want to tell. You want Harry to become powerful quickly? You make him the descendent of Merlin or give him a super wand or suddenly become a master of wandless magic. But these things essentially break the world they are setting up.
