You're definitely correct, and almost everyone introduces an idea which they shouldn't. I think that maybe some of those instances weren't so bad.

Book 3: almost all of that is true, barring the Dark Mark, which surely even Voldemort can't have decided to mark all of his followers with if he intended any of them to operate effectively as spies. I suppose he might have done, but it's such brain-bashingly awful idea that I have to hold out hope that he didn't.

Book 4: I agree, and it's about the only time I'm willing to accept her 'word of God' statements, namely that it isn't actually foolproof.

Book 5: That one I'm a little more forgiving of because there is no way that legally I'd be happy with allowing people to look inside other people's heads and then claim that such and such was the case. Especially in a world where as the sixth book suggests memories can be faked. It would establish a really disturbing precedent unless you were 100% certain of the investigator being utterly neutral (not of their morality, which could complicate things, but of being completely unbiased).
