I think Hermione had a good idea. I do think just demanding freedom was not the best approach. There is no support network available for the free elves who literally have been enslaved all thier lives and dont know any better! It would be like arresting all the men who beat thier wives without providing shelter, counselling and finince support for the wives. Good in thoery, not really helpful though.
