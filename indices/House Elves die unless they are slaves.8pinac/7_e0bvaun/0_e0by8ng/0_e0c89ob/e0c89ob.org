Oh, I absolutely agree. It's the shades of grey that tantalize the imagination. A 'good guy pureblood, silly muggleborn that doesn't understand world' story can be just as cringy (albeit, I'd say less common), if it's not fleshed out properly.

Ultimately, it's how much originality the author can bring to the world -- while remaining laconic.

For example, one of the questions (was Hermione wrong to have elves treated kindly) can have a number of answers.

1. The elves could be secret masochists that derive pleasure from pain and take a perverted delight in disobeying their masters just to be punished.

2. Or maybe pain and punishment serve as a better conduit for them to "siphon" magical nourishment from their masters.

3. Finally, playing off the parasitism idea, maybe wizards initially subverted elves out of self-defense, normalizing abusive treatment as a barrier to anyone forming bonds with house-elves and freeing them -- because, once freed, they rampage through the world, enslaving the wizards back.

And that's just one tiny aspect.

And, sure, the idea of a race /pre-destined/ for slavery can be disturbing -- or liberating, if a reasonable explanation is found.

The idea of the demon story-line (with some individuals yearning to cast off the shackles of servitude) can also be very inventive. Every one of the questions/ideas you posed can lead to a great plot expansion.

But, personally, I will always gravitate towards stories that try to turn around contemporary social mores and present something alien.
