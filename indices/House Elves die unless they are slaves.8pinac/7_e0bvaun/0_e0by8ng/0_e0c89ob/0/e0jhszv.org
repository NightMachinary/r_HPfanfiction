Again a series of interesting suggestions, though again there doesn't seem much evidence for most of those. Though all could be interesting if ACTUALLY explored. However, the authors virtually always use it as a way to handwave things. Not to consider contemporary social mores, but just to bypass them.

The life unexamined is not a life worth living, but it needs examination.

I personally don't really mind if they keep contemporary social mores or defy them, provided they have a good reason for doing so. Otherwise it just feels like lazy writing.
