Of course one should hope for something new and original. Imposing one society's values on another's is naturally rather counterproductive when one hopes to create an original fantastical world. However, I fear that in order to avoid falling prey to that particular habit the authors who decided to make the House Elves actually /need/ to be in service went the other way. They decided that they had to make the wizarding world conform, but fail to tell any muggleborns. A problem compounded by the failure of wizards within those worlds to give decent living conditions to the House Elves.

Let Hermione be wrong by all means, but if you're going to it should have consequences beyond that and be more than a straw-man argument to throw at her. So, the Elves can't be freed, but as you point out there are a number of reasons why that could be the case. If you take the ancient struggle story, are the people who used the Elves to hunt wizards still out there? How come the Elves served them? So Hermione was wrong to want to set them free, but was she wrong to want the wizards to treat the Elves kindly? You could have a shades of grey story, and yet we're often left with the first conclusion in which the foolish muggleborn's concerns are simply shrugged off. Yet, no matter how you cut it there's almost always something a bit disturbing about the idea of an enslaved race who were 'meant to be that way'.

If we take the demons idea, often one of the better played concepts, what if some of those demons are actually trying to get free? What if we have a Bartimaeus Trilogy type story around House Elves going on in the background? Are demons naturally things which like serving? In some ways you kind of have to argue not, and if so, does that mean that Wizards have effectively crushed their minds? What does that mean in the grand scheme of things? How are the forces of Hell responding? Can you justify binding demons? Yes, we think of them as evil usually, but then we've already said don't take the cultural norms of one society and impose them on another ...

Basically, just making the purebloods good guys is equally BORING.
