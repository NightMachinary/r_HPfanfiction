The thing about fictional worlds like HP is that they're supposed to be, well, fictional. Different. Something to flavor the palate. So, personally, reading about muggleborn-ish social justice warriors that storm the evil wizarding world with their blinding righteousness (with inevitable triumph) has always left a bad taste in my mouth, because if I wanted to read about the evils and abolition of slavery, then I might as well spend my time on The Life of Frederick Douglass, or one of the other 10 gazillion original books on the subject. It's a horse well-traveled, and, in my personal opinion, the authors who decide to ride it usually do so due to a lack of staffing in the imagination department.

Because there is such potential here, both in world-building and in the exploration of human folly. You can play on hubris; have a character like Hermione free an elf -- only for it to die before her eyes, because her own preconceptions of right and wrong were based on the wrong values. You can create a rich history, where -- just like you mention in option a -- there was a symbiotic bond that wizards gradually subverted over time. You can even imagine that elves were demons that were summoned by some ancient wizard to serve -- and their current propensity for submission is a trace of the original order.

I also love the idea of parasitism, because then you can create a history of an ancient struggle, where elves used to hunt down and capture wizards for their magic, sell them on auctions and the like, until some wizard came up with a way to fight back, led a Spartacus-like rebellion, and the current hate/desire to humiliate elves wizards hold toward elves is a remnant of their fear from so ages ago.

There's a thousand possibilities! But going into a magical world with the mind set of 'evil pureblood wizards enslave elves cause evil' is...plausible, sure, but also mind-numbingly BORING.
