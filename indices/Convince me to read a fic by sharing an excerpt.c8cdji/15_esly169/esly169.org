  "Hesper," Draco sighed, but Astoria didn't hear whatever else he had to say. Professor Babbling had turned back to the board again to diagram more logograms. She looked down to check them against her notes, only to find words she had not written appearing in between the symbols she was meticulously copying.

  /Coming to the meeting tonight?/

  The handwriting was untidy, quite unlike her own, and it had simply flowed into existence between eihwaz and setze on the parchment in front of her. Astoria was baffled. She looked around the room for someone pointing their wand at her desk, but everyone had their head bent to their papers.

  /This is Harry Potter, by the way. Sorry to be writing on your homework./ And, of all things, a tiny smiley face appeared next to the statement.

  Astoria whipped around to look at Potter in shock. He smiled at her, and gave a little wave. She turned back to the parchment.

  /We're doing unbinding spells tonight. But we'll go over the patronus charm in a couple of weeks./ Out to the side of this one he had drawn what might have been either a long-legged dog or a short-legged horse, though Astoria suspected it was supposed to be a representation of Potter's patronus. She'd heard it was a deer of some kind.

  Fascinated against her own better judgment, Astoria picked up her quill. /Can you read what I'm writing?/ she wrote, because whatever Potter had done was something she had never seen before, and what if he could do the same thing during an exam?

  When no reply was forthcoming, she turned around in her seat again. "How did you do that?" she mouthed, drawing a curious look from Misty Fraithwaite who sat at the desk behind her.

  /Echo's Cage./

  Astoria blinked. She looked at the words Potter had written, looked over her shoulder again only to see that he had his head bent to his work, and then she blinked again. Echo's Cage? That didn't sound like a spell at all. It sounded, if Potter wasn't just engaged in some obscure form of Gryffindor teasing, like the name of a ritual. Astoria turned the idea over in her head. The funny thing about ritual magic was that it was a bit like putting together a puzzle with a large but still limited number of shapes. Once someone knew all of the shapes, they didn't necessarily have to put them in the right order. They could swap pieces around to make a different picture. Ritual names usually just told you what main pieces were used, so, theoretically at least, a witch or wizard could figure out how to do something based on the name alone. Astoria knew how to make an echo in a ritual, and she knew how to make a cage. She stared thoughtfully down at her parchment, boring logograms forgotten, and then she began to work.

  First the /echo/. She imagined that Potter must have already done most of the work of this for her. After all, from his seat he could probably see her paper well enough to copy her notes, or at least, the runic bits. She always wrote the runes large and spaced them far apart so that they would be easier to study. She carefully erased her margin notes and the random spots of ink, hoping that the clear rune diagrams closely reflected what Potter had copied, and then she meticulously traced Potter's writing in her own hand. Satisfied, she moved on to the next part.

  The cage stumped her for a couple of minutes. There were several ways to make a rune cage, and she had no idea how Potter had gone about it. Finally she decided to just use the two most basic binding runes in the standard size. She etched these quickly all around the border of her paper. She sat back to admire the rather pretty effect all of the runes made when combined while she pondered what sort of thing she might use to empower parchment. What would Potter have used? She highly doubted that the Gryffindor sixth year had some kind of illicit stash of Objects of Power in his school bag. Maybe there was something he could have used in the advanced potions kit? Astoria's own year four kit didn't have anything likely, but who knew what Slughorn had the sixth years brewing.

  Glancing around once to be sure that no one was watching her, Astoria casually scraped the pad of her finger against the edge of her quill. A single drop of blood beaded there, and she dabbed it onto the center of the runes at the four corners of her parchment. /"In cruor, vita,"/ she murmured, pressing her magic forward with a mental effort and hoping that the words were both vague enough and powerful enough to do what she wanted them to do. To her surprise and pleasure, a nearly invisible shimmer ran down the runes on the parchment, almost as though the ink was suddenly wet enough to reflect the sunlight spilling in through the classroom windows.

  Feeling so inordinately smug that she was sure it must show on her face, she picked up her quill again and wrote, /Potter, why are you scribbling all over my notes?/

  /Bravo./ Potter wrote. /I knew you could do it. The first DA meeting is tonight. Are you coming?/

  Astoria had been so pleased with the challenge of unraveling Potter's miniature ritual that she hadn't even stopped to consider what she might write back when she did it. Her lengthy pause didn't go unnoticed.

  /Astoria?/

  Her initial impulse to tell Potter that they were most certainly not on a first name basis was halted by the appearance, in rapid succession, of an itty bitty ink dementor, a frownie face, the dog-horse patronus thing, and a smiley face. To add to the madness, little arrows appeared pointing to the faces and labeling them /Astoria G. without the DA/ and /Astoria G. with the DA/. Oh, Merlin. This had to stop right now. She was starting to think that Harry Potter might actually be endearing, and then she wouldn't be able to eviscerate him in battle.
