Everytime I stumble over "The Sum of Their Parts" I can't help but feel of two minds. On one hand it was a superb story. On the other, the author made it incredibly bad by losing interest and just jumping from the middle of the story to a half assed epilogue... I mean, that excerpt you posted is like the last paragraph before the epilogue... It should be 200k words away from it. Just sad that the story was kind of ruined.
