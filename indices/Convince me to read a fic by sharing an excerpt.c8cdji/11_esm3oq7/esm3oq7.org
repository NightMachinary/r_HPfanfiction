Three different fics, should be fairly recognizable:

  The Ministry would burn. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon. They would burn, every last one of them, because if that was the only way to keep them from ever going after Ron and Hermione again, then that was what he would do.

  Burn it all, scour it to the very bedrock, and rebuild it from scratch in the ashes. If the Minister could not command the Wizengamot, then the Wizengamot would yield. By Fiendfyre, blackmail, or loyalty, he did not particularly care which.

  His left hand rested by Hermione's neck, tangled in her hair. His right had a tight grip on Ron's shoulder, “silent reassurance that he was there, that they had him back for good.

  "They will burn," he vowed quietly. "Every single last one of them will burn for this."

  Hermione's breath hitched. Then her grip tightened and she looked up to meet his gaze, stubborn and furious and defiant through bloodshot eyes and ash-grey skin.

  "They will burn," she agreed.

  "... Every single last one of them," Ron finished, low and hoarse. "Every single last one.”

  Turning around, she cast an Amplifying Charm. "Wand-Commander Daniel is dead. Special Authorisation granted. Centre, move to engage the enemy! For Britain!"

  The Wands behind the walls charged to the gaps or climbed the walls. Hermione herself rushed to the top of the closest wall thanks to conjured steps, pointed her wand at the monster and summoned all the hatred she felt.

  "Avada Kedavra!"

  All around her, green spells flew towards the enemies. For a moment, she felt elated. No one could dodge that many spells!

  The monster was too quick though, and vanished behind a conjured wall himself. Even before the obstacle was shattered by dozens of curses, Hermione was already casting the next Killing Curse.

  "Avada Kedavra!"

  Another wall shattered, and this time, staggered curses followed it up. Hermione saw several of the Fanatics behind Lestrange fall down, struck. She aimed her wand at the centre of the enemy's formation, where a wall was stubbornly standing. Spell after spell hit it, and it would be destroyed soon enough, no matter what kind of magic kept it standing despite the onslaught.

  Before it fell though, two figures shot up into the air from behind it. The monster and Lestrange, both flying without a broom. That ... Hermione sent a spell after them, together with several other Wands, but she knew they wouldn't hit them. They were too fast, too far away.

  The stragglers on the ground though... that was a textbook encirclement. No one had to give the Wands any orders as they cut the fanatics down with well-aimed spells.
