Here's a fun one, about Tom Riddle trying out the anagram spell:

#+begin_quote
  'Valid Motor Molder.' No.

  'I'd do Trevor Mallom.' Oh god, Trevor would never let me live that one down.

  'Tim, Mad Drool Lover.' There will be no Dark Lord Tim! Stop trying to trick me into that one.

  'I'm Lord over a lot, M.D.' True, I suppose, but not what I'm looking for.

  'Lord, I'd revolt a mom.' Okay, now you're just being mean.

  'D-Liver Mortal Doom.' There we go! Now we're working in the right direction. I'll never go by the name D-Liver, but Mortal Doom sure has a nice ring to it. I knew there'd be some good ones in here. I wonder if I can influence the spell through intent. I try the spell again, focusing on the words 'mortal' and 'doom'.

  'Mortal Doom, Dr. Evil.' Hmm. Well it appears you can influence the spell, but 'Dr.' seems a bit too muggle and not vengeful all-powerful God enough for me. I give it another shot.

  'Dr. Doom, Evil Mortal.' No doctors! And I am not mortal! I will rule forever! I don't think my influencing is helping the spell any. Let's just see what it comes up with on it's own now.

  'Diva Lord Meltmoor.' Umm... I don't even know what to think about that one. But my instincts are screaming 'No way, sister!'

  I think I might need to reevaluate the trust I place in my instincts.

  'Overlord Lo, Dammit!' Hmm, well, maybe I'll keep that in mind for when I take over Asia.

  'I droved a Mom Troll.' Okay, this is getting me nowhere.
