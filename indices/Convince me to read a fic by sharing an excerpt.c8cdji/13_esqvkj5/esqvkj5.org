  ‘Ask me something else instead,' Albus said softly.

  ‘Alright,' Harry said eagerly. ‘Tell me about the mirror.'

  ‘What mirror?'

  ‘You know damn.well what mirror I'm talking about!' Harry scoffed. ‘The mirror that shows the future!'

  Albus raised his eyebrows. ‘You think it shows the future?'

  ‘Well, doesn't it?' Harry faltered. ‘I thought it did.'

  ‘Why, what do you see in it?'

  ‘What do you see in it?' Harry threw back at him.

  Albus shook his head. ‘No, no. You're just fishing for clues. You tell me first.'

  Harry squirmed. ‘You won't laugh? I'm worried about it now.'

  ‘I won't laugh,' Albus promised solemnly.

  Harry leant back and closed his eyes. ‘I saw myself but older and stronger. You and I were standing side by side and there was a crowd of people behind us cheering.'

  He paused uncertainly. ‘Its hard to explain, but somehow I could just tell that there'd been a big battle and Voldemort was dead. There was blood on my face and you had your arm around me. We were both smiling.'

  Harry took a breath and opened his eyes. Albus was staring at him very intently indeed.

  ‘And you thought that was your future?'

  ‘Yes,' Harry said sadly. ‘It's what I always hoped would happen.' He sighed. ‘What was it really?'

  Albus smiled. ‘You said it yourself, it what you hoped would happen.' He leant forward and adjusted his glasses. ‘The mirror of Erised shows us what we desire most in our hearts. I should also mention that our greatest desires are often linked to our greatest fears so it's no great surprise that you see yourself living in a world where you have conquered Voldemort and are strong, whole and free.'

  Harry breathed deeply and nodded. ‘And that you're there with me, too. That we're safe together.'

  ‘Yes.'

  Harry sat up slowly, rubbing his eyes. ‘It's so embarrassing,' he mumbled. ‘What do you see when you look in the mirror?'

  Albus cast his eyes down. ‘Well, that's the interesting thing. You and I appear to have been subject to a very rare phenomenon.'

  Harry blinked. ‘What do you mean?'

  Albus looked up again, his bright blue eyes meeting Harry's emerald green ones.

  ‘When you and I look in the mirror of Erised we both see exactly the same thing.'

The Phoenix Burns Brightest by AnyaYanko. Dumbledore raises Harry after finding out that the Durlseys are terrible, the result is pretty fascinating. Harry isn't some miniature adult who slings curses and steals witches, but he has read 1001 magical herbs and fungi and does know an earworm jinkx that doesn't go away until dispelled. He's smarter, more curious and more knowledgeable than canon Harry, but not unbelievably so. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]])
