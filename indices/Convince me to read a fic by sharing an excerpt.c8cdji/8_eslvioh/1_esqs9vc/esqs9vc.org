Normally, I'd agree with the "show, not tell" approach. But for this author, the stories are almost like sketches (as opposed to say, paintings). Showing not telling would result in a fiction that was significantly longer than what is written. Instead, the author chooses to quickly sketch out the story, covering years of time in a short span and conveying interesting plot points.
