"The thief was further ahead than he had expected - and he was closing in more slowly than he should, too. Unless they were on a Firebolt as well, of course! He clenched his teeth - the thieves had stolen enough gold to easily afford one.

The witch shot above the next roof, close enough that he almost expected to see tiles break. She was good - but Harry was better. Yet another series of jinxes, followed by a pair of Stunners. One missed, the other didn't - and the thief's Shield Charm shattered.

Harry grinned. He had her now - his next spell would end the chase.

Hermione Granger pulled hard to the left and down when she felt her shield shatter. She almost ploughed into the roof of a garden shed, but two Stunners missed her - one by what felt like inches. Clenching her teeth, she took a hard right, dropping lower, using the shed as cover. That gained her a second out of her pursuer's line of fire. She used it to recast her Shield Charm and urged her broom on. She just needed to gain a little more distance and she'd have outrun the Anti-Apparition Jinxes...

She flew even closer to the ground, skimming the pavement, and reached the corner of the side alley she was in before another Stunner flew at her. She banked left again - she had to keep flying away from Grimmauld Place - and tried to apparate.

It didn't work. That was the third time! Had the Aurors covered half of London with Anti-Apparition Jinxes? That was impossible! Maybe if she flew straight up... She glanced over her shoulder as she accelerated above the road leading to the bus station, and gasped. Her pursuer - it had to be Harry, no one else flew as well and as fast - was diving at her from above!

She pulled up and rolled, almost losing control of her broom when another Stunner splashed against her shield and forced her off-course. She managed to recover and pull up in the last moment before she slammed into a parked car.

Hermione kept rolling as she banked right, narrowingly missing a wrought-iron fence and a lamp post, diving into another side alley for a second. Now she had to be out of range! She focused - and cursed some more. Apparition was still blocked!

And there came Harry again, closer than before - she spotted the marker behind her. And red flashes as he cast Stunners at her. Her shield was gone, but she was twisting her broom into desperate rolls, and the spells missed her again. She pulled up, then dived down - any straight course would let him conjure obstacles in her path.

There was the corner. She grit her teeth as she forced her broom to take a sharp turn to the left - sharper than wise at her speed - and pulled up, heading straight for a taller building. A glance behind her showed that Harry's marker was taking the same turn - and tighter than she had. This wouldn't work either - he was just too good on his broom.

She jinked left and right, then shot down to the ground. Muggles were walking around there, unaware - Harry wouldn't be able to cast at her here. But neither would she be able to lose him.

She was panting, sweat running down her neck as she bent low over the shaft of her broom and tried to get a little more speed out of it. Another attempt to apparate failed. And she was coming up to a crossing - with several cars and a few pedestrians.

She recast her Shield Charm again, then veered right. She had to lose Harry! She spotted a park ahead. Maybe she could lose him in the trees there... No, he'd follow her in. And he was the better flyer. And a conjured wall between the trees would be fatal.

Short of the park's entrance, she veered off again. She had one surprise left. There was a side alley. Very narrow. It was risky - foolhardy even. But what choice did she have?

She rolled and jinked, more spells missing her. As soon as she rose above street level, to a height where muggles wouldn't notice anything amiss, Harry's Stunners came at her. But low on the ground, she would hit someone sooner or later.

She urged her broom forward, spending a precious moment to calculate the angles. Nudging her broom a little to the right, she flicked her wand. A sticky line shot out of her wand, the Chameleon-Tongue Spell wrapping itself around the lamp post on the corner. She felt as if her arm was wrenched out of its socket as she was pulled to the side, but managed to hold on as she whirled around the lamp post, straight towards the side alley."
