“Draco?”

The squeal that echoed through the house was quite impressive and Harry was startled that he had caused such a reaction in his best friend. Granted, he hadn't announced his presence when he had climbed the stairs to the third floor of Grimmauld Place and located the bedroom now belonging to the blonde. He also had expected to push open the door and find Draco standing in front of a mirror, wearing a skirt.

“DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO KNOCK?!” Draco was blushing so intensely that he thought he might spontaneously combust, twisting to view his friend with a nervous looking glare. He was barefoot, his shaggy hair in pigtails, wearing a t-shirt that hung off one of his shoulders and a black pleated skirt with red edging. Certainly not what Harry was expecting to see.

The two stood awkwardly, staring at one another as Harry quietly closed the door behind himself - clearly Draco hadn't wanted to be discovered.

“That's, uh, quite the outfit, Draco...” he spoke slowly, finding that his eyes skimmed over his friends body from top to bottom, several times. The blonde nervously tugged on the front of his skirt, pulling it down as though trying to cover more of himself.

“Not a word, Potter,” was the response, silver eyes glancing to where Draco's wand lay on his bed. The summer had treated him well and he continued to grow, the skirt making already long legs look even better.

“Are you... wearing panties?”

Draco moved quickly, it seemed, and Harry suddenly found himself outside the bedroom with a solid wood door slammed in his face.
