  Harry watches it go, still astonished. Then he turns back to the kitchen, where Padfoot, who is still a human and not at all a dog, is staring at him.

  Harry stares back.

  “Damn,” says the man. “I suppose you have some questions.”

  “Are you magic?” asks Harry.

  “Yes,” says the man. He is wearing Padfoot's tags and license on a necklace.

  “Are you a werewolf?” asks Harry.

  “What? No,” says the man. “Why would I-- that's not how werewolves work.”

  “Well, no,” says Harry, who has now had a second to think about it and feels a little foolish. “I suppose you'd have to be, like, a reverse werewolf, right? Because you're a dog all month and now you're a man.”

  “I'm not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I'm your godfather.”

  “My fairy godfather?” Harry asks, because his mother reads him a lot of Brothers Grimm.

  “Not --- in that sense, no,” says the man. “Just your regular godfather.”

  “My regular godfather, who is magic,” says Harry.

  “Yes,” says Padfoot, who has lived in Harry's house for more than a year now, and read most of the books on its shelves in the middle of the night, including the ones with titles like /The Adoptive Parent's Toolkit/ and /My Family, My Journey/.

  He says, “Your birth dad was my best friend.”

  “Was he magic too?” asks Harry.

  “Yes,” says Padfoot. “And so was your mum. And so are you.”

  “What?” says Harry, who had not been expecting this turn of events in the least.

  “You're a wizard, Harry,” says Padfoot. “And so am I.”

The Dogfather by hollimichele. I think this author does the best of capturing a child Harry, who's still pretty dynamic and better-than-canon. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]])
