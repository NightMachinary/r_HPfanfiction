"I'm sorry," Harry said. And they were silent for a few moments.

"What do you miss?" she asked. She feared he wouldn't answer. That the question would be too invasive for him to answer. She knew that some reporters had tried to get him to do an interview about the accident. But he'd refused.

"Hermione," Harry said. Gabrielle just stared at him. For some reason that answer surprised him.

"Why?" she asked.

"Hermione was the first one to really make me not feel alone," Harry said.

"Whether it was at school or after. She was the one that was always there. I mean I didn't want to fall for her. I knew Ron liked her. And it would have been so much easier to not. But she was the first girl that actually spoke to me and was nice to me. What else was I supposed to do?" He let his voice trail off.

"I don't know," Gabrielle said quietly. Harry barely heard her.
