Hard to do without any other clues, but I found this one fun. The excerpt is about halfway in. It's Sirius' thoughts on the situation at hand.

/Well,/ he thought/, At least I know he's a good kid, well, as good as the son of a Mafia Lord can be. And he knows me. I've been able to be a part of his life, even if I didn't know it at the time... How the hell did I not figure it out? It's so obvious! Green eyes, black hair, bad eyesight, MAGIC! But then, everyone knows (well, thought) that he was actually Sal's kid. And I wasn't looking for Harry, I thought I knew that he was hidden in a safe spot, which wouldn't be here./

. . .

/Never in a million years did I think/ */I/* /would be the one to teach Harry about our world. And especially not in the language I used./
