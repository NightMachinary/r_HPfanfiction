He had wandered around the globe, without purpose, without direction. Taken where the winds, the sun and the stars led him, he had seen every continent, visited incredible places, and met wonderful people. He owned nothing but the clothes on his body, the wand in his pocket, the guitar on his back, and the few items in the small backpack slung around his shoulder. He didn't care for anything else, didn't need anything else. So long as there was food in his mouth, and a soft bed to sleep in once or twice a month, he didn't really care where he was. But now, he was back. Back in Britain. Back home.

When he'd first gone out, it had felt like he was escaping. Escaping the pressures of his new-found fame, escaping the confines of what his world had turned into. Shaking hands with random pedestrians, because they had recognized him from the papers, enchanting his house, because he might be attacked in his sleep. Slowly, what had seemed marvelous at first, had become oppressive; irritatingly so. The thought of leaving hadn't consciously formed until a year after the Fall, but he knew he'd been playing with it subconsciously quite a long time before that.

When it had registered, the thought wouldn't go away. He spent his nights alone in his shabby apartment. At first, he was dreaming about what to do, out alone, later, he began planning. He included no-one in those plans; not his best friends, nor his family. This would be a solitary undertaking. A quest, not for the greater good, not for the wizarding community, but for him. Just for him. And that had been enough.
