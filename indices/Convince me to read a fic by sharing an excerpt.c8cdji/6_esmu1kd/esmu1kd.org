  Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. "Hang on," he said, looking back at George, "didn't you promise Hermione you wouldn't bring any Wheezes products to the wedding?"

  "Yeah, but this was a prototype," he explained. "Not an actual product."

  Harry gaped at him. "You've unleashed an untested Wheeze on Muriel at Hermione's wedding?"
