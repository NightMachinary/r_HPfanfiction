"Mister Potter, you will take your feet off of your . . ." The Professor stared at the needle. ". . .finished needle? Did you finish?"

"Yes, Professor." He still didn't have his eyes open.

"I see." She placed another matchstick on his desk. "Can you . . ." before she finished, it had become a silver needle with a gold-plated point and little green scrollwork along the sides. She blinked. "Alright. What are you doing now?"

"I'm reading my textbook, Professor."

"You have it under your feet, Mister Potter."

"Yes?"

"Do you have eyes on your feet?"

"No, Professor. Besides, the book is closed anyway."

"So how are you reading it?"

"Very well, thank you."

"Detention, Mister Potter."

Alternatively:

There was a cheer from the Gryffindor table. "Alright!" cheered Gred. "Malfoy's started a food fight!" Suddenly, the air was thick with mashed potatoes banished towards other tables. Tureens of gravy emptied themselves as Lee Jordan helped his friends.

Within seconds, the other tables had responded, half at the twins for the attack and half at Malfoy for starting it. Professor Dumbledore animated a roast chicken, which picked up a knife and saucer and proceeded to defend him, wearing a helmet made of a hollowed out roll. He then went back to eating as the pseudo-knight warded off flying food with its little china shield.

Snape was almost instantly covered from head to foot in mash and gravy and he was being barraged by animated drumsticks that kept trying to beat out the school song on his head. The four tables were all buried under food from other tables. Malfoy himself was currently buried under a roast pig, sixteen loaves of bread, four sticks of butter, and a selection of sherbet the providence of which was uncertain, as dessert had yet to appear.

In the midst of it all, Hari was eating from his small bowl of rice and fish, unsullied by comestible projectiles. He was currently sitting on the pile of things covering Malfoy, apparently unaware of the war taking place. Sometimes, without apparent realization, he dodged a ballistic victual. Several of his housemates had taken refuge under the table and were using their wands to launch a concerted barrage of peas at the Twins, who were already coated in food, but apparently enjoying themselves immensely.

It took several minutes before McGonagall managed to return the hall to order, primarily by transfiguring all flying objects into water. Once everyone but Hari was soaking wet and covered in sodden food, she cleared her throat. "There will be a school-wide detention courtesy of Mister Malfoy for starting this fight." Professor Snape's mouth opened. "No, Severus, Mister Malfoy clearly, and in front of all of us, flung the first piece of food. Now Poppy, if you would please make sure that the students are uninjured. You can leave Mister Malfoy for last, since he was so enthusiastic about this fight."
