Snape read Harry's article and the ... elk horns that had come along with it.

The essay had been well written, and to the point. Harry pointed out that the cause of the effects of the potion came from the conceptual properties of the potion ingredients being transferred to the potion/cream itself by the usage of magical transference that occurs in the brewing process. Then he pointed out that compared to newt eyeballs, elk horns were much easily obtained and in greater quantities.

The boy then digressed into economical benefits of running a elk farm rather than a newt farm. Unfortunately, that particular bit wasn't on topic, so points were taken.

However, by providing his own material to back up the theory he had written, Harry had essentially earned those points back anyway.

What confused Snape was where Harry might have learned about elk horn usage in potions.

Snape himself didn't know, and he knew for a fact that Dumbledore didn't know.

Was it his family?

He shook his head.

'Where he heard it is not my business,' Snape thought as he graded the paper and moved onto the next. 'But a good read, nonetheless.'

Then he scowled as his own Slytherin's work came up as a chicken scratch.

"Bloody ingrats," he muttered to himself as he bled the paper with his red ink.
