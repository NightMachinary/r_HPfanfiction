Suddenly a huge jagged bolt of lightning struck powerfully right in the middle of the street, when the light and smoke cleared a thick stench of ozone hung heavily in the air, and there stood the seven foot, noseless figure of the Dark Lord Voldemort. He was accompanied by a triad of masked Death Eaters, and a fourth which was the clearly unmasked form of one Lucius Malfoy.

"Avast! Harry Potter. My great nemesis. You shall not escape me this time. Ha. Ha. Ha. Haa!" Lord Voldemort cackled beneath a 'Sonorus' as the shoppers all took note of what was happening. Many of them took cover, or scattered in flight altogether while the two foes looked one another over with scorn.

Harry turned with confidence, squarely facing his adversary. "Ah, Voldemort. We meet once again, do you like my boots?" gesturing down to the accessory crafted from blue‑grey dragon leather.

"Yes‑sss of course I do, they scream 'Harry Potter: Dragon Slayer.' But now is not the time, for we must duel. Is that not right Lucius‑sss Malfoy?" intoned Voldemort, the ess's dropping off into Parseltongue.

The two traded tremendous blows back and forth, big bright flashes of light and an immense conclave of energy bleeding off the Dark Lord made the duel one for the history books. The First Battle of Diagon Alley it would eventually be named, the opening skirmish in Voldemort's second war.

"Crucio!"

Luna Lovegood went down in agonised screaming and Harry Potter from his knees shouted a big, "Noooo!"

"I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!" The Dark Lord taunted to his disheartened opponent.

Just when things looked to be at their worst a powerful beard stepped into the middle of the battle, protecting the injured Luna and the exhausted Harry. "You cannot hope to win Tom, the light side is more powerful than you can possibly imagine. And Lucius, I cannot say I am surprised to see you here today."

With that the aged Headmaster and the feared Dark Lord begin to battle in earnest. An even more impressive duel broke out with both opponents flaring a Visible Aura, bright flashes of spellfire were unleashed as the two traded thunderous crashes of terrible energy. Eventually the Aurors showed up, witnessing several bone shattering spells harmlessly splash over an Imprimis shield Voldemort somehow cast with wandless abilities, and the team even heard a parting message intoned by the fleeing Dark Lord.

"Avast! You may have won this time Dumbledore, but you cannot stop me forever. For I am invincible, Bwahahaha!"

With that Voldemort and the Death Eaters were gone from Diagon Alley, and the world now knew of the Dark Lord's rebirth.

"Harry, why in heaven's name did you keep saying Avast!?" Hermione asked him as he set about removing the glamours which were making him look like Voldemort.

"What?" the black haired fifteen year old answered with a questioning look, "Voldemort speaks in a pirate voice doesn't he?"

Hermione face palmed and Luna, the polyjuice potion charged with Harry's hair running its course, answered with the boy's distinctive tone, "Not as far as I'm aware Harry. You were supposed to go for a kind of sibilant hiss. Remember?"
