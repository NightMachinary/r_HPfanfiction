"Weasley, Ginevra!" Professor McGonagall called out. Ginny was surprised as she'd assumed that her name would put her dead last. Mustering her confidence, she walked down to the stool where the Sorting Hat rested. She had half-believed Harry when he told her about the Sorting Hat, but she'd imagined something a bit grander and not so shabby.

"Shabby, am I?" said the Hat, causing Ginny to emit a soft "meep."

"Um, sorry?" Ginny thought rather than said. She was suddenly surprised to realize she was having a psychic conversation. "You're just ... not what I was expecting."

"Humph, you shouldn't be expecting anything at all. Who'd had thought Harry Potter of all people would be such a blabbermouth? Oh well, let's get this over with. You are a Weasley, I see. Though the first female Weasley in centuries. Ever since that unpleasantness with ... ah, forget I said anything about that. I suppose Potter's not the only blabbermouth around here."

"Wait, what are you ...?"

"No, no. Forget I mentioned it. Anyway, you are, as I said, a Weasley. So I suppose you'll be wanting to follow in your brothers' footsteps blindly without the slightest thought to your own ambitions. That seems to be the Weasley way. On the bright side, I suppose if you're in Gryffindor with your four brothers, they can look after you and protect you and keep you from any sort trouble. That's good, right?"

"What?!" she explained mentally. "No! I'm not blindly following anybody! I do have ambitions of my own, you know, and I certainly don't need any of them looking after me and protecting me! I can look after myself and find my own way, thank you very much!"

"Hmm, feisty!" exclaimed the Hat. "Lots of Gryffindor spunk, I see."

"Eight-year-olds have 'spunk.' I have determination."

"Heh-heh. I suppose you do. So I guess there's only one question left. Which is more important? That everyone around you know how brave you are? Or that you actually be brave?"

That question surprised her and brought her up short. She thought for a few seconds. "Be brave, always," she finally said and with firm conviction.

"Humph. About bloody time one of you lot said that," the Hat said before finally shouting out:

"SLYTHERIN!"
