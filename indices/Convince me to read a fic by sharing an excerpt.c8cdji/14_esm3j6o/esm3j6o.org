  "This way." She led him to a, a...

  "Sorry, there's an anti-muggle Notice-Me-Not charm on the entrance. Take my arm, you should be able to walk through the doorway even if you can't see it."

  He did as he was told, and soon entered what was obviously a pub, although with a different clientele than he was used to. Everyone was in wizarding robes. Tom noted with a mix of joy and despair that more than half of the witches and wizards were better dressed than their little party. None were as pathetic as the Gaunts. This gave him hope for his son's future, and simultaneously embarrassment for his immediate situation. It was intolerable for a Riddle to look worse than average at any gathering.

  "That may have been the least disagreeable trip I've ever taken from Little Hangleton to London," remarked Tom casually and quietly, for it would not do to seem at all amazed by his surroundings. "The train takes so long."

  "Apparition gets more tolerable with experience," said Miss Granger as she sat him at a small table. "Try a butterbeer." She went to the bar and bought two. "It has a tiny bit of alcohol, not enough to worry about."

  He tried it. His mouth liked it, but his recently-emptied stomach didn't trust it. He gave it some time to adjust. "Where are we?"

  "A pub called the Leaky Cauldron," said Miss Granger. "The gateway to Diagon Alley, and a conduit for all walks of wizarding society."

  The pub had quite a large fireplace. Sometimes the flames turned green, and people stepped out of it, or into it, so that was another doorway. Quite a grand couple appeared from the fireplace, beautifully dressed, sparkling with jewels. They had a peculiar little servant with them, with grey skin, huge green eyes, and furry ears. It was dressed in a rag, the maximum contrast possible to the finery of its masters. It rushed around its lady's skirt, removing the faintest traces of ashes from the hem.

  Tom drew close to Miss Granger, although he caught another disturbing whiff of Amortentia when he did so, like opening a door in a storm and realizing he'd been breathing stale, stuffy air before. The sensible thing to do was to close the door and not let the storm in. He did his best to ignore this and spoke quietly. "That couple over there, that's the look we need to go for. Where can we get clothes like that?"

  "What?" This was not the question she'd been expecting.

  "Everyone in this pub treats that couple with utmost respect. Look at how everyone steps aside for them. They didn't have to wait at the bar for their drinks, they got them immediately. That's how the Riddles will be treated."

  "But... you're just trying to blend in unobtrusively. You're not trying to join the aristocracy!"

  "Of course I'm not trying to join the aristocracy," he agreed. "I'm already in it. The wizarding world must simply recognize that."

  "They won't!" she said in a furious whisper. "You're a muggle!"

  "My son's not," said Tom. "If I'm going to raise him, I intend to do it right, and that means giving him the best possible start in life. No Riddle is going to start at the bottom."

  "This is ridiculous!" she said in her furious whisper. "You should count yourself lucky if your half-blood son is tolerated in wizarding society at all!"

  "What's ridiculous is the suggestion that any son of mine would not start at the top," said Tom calmly. "I just have to establish that that's where we belong. I'll start with the clothes."

  "You can't be accepted into pureblood wizarding society by just buying the right clothes!"

  "Of course not. I'll also need accessories, like that little grey thing they have. With the big green eyes."

  Miss Granger closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. Eventually, she said, "That's a house elf. You are not getting one."

  "Maybe not today," he said agreeably, for she clearly felt strongly about this, and it would not do to have an unseemly disagreement in public.
