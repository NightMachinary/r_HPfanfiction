Harry's got his fingers twisted in the hair along Neville's nape, and things are just starting to look interesting when there's the distinct sound of someone clearing their throat somewhere to Harry's left. Neville jerks away, and Harry makes an annoyed noise, because, honestly, don't people know enough by now not to go snooping in the janitorial storage? There are only two reasons for students to be in there, and both of them work better with the door closed.

“Hermione,” Neville sounds slightly choked, and of /course/ it would be Granger who found them, the busybody. Fuck. That's slightly awkward. Neville won't approve of Harry wiping his best friend's memory.

“Is there something you need to tell me, Neville?”

“It's not what it looks like,” Neville says, and Harry can't help but roll his eyes, even as Granger arches her brows.

“So, what, you tripped on your shoelaces and just happened to land on Potter's mouth -- knocking you both into the closet and pulling the door closed behind you?” Granger may be a know-it-all, busybody bitch, but Harry has to give her points for sarcasm.

“Longbottom's a klutz,” Harry tells her, lets his teeth show when he grins, ignores Neville's sputtering. “And I was strategically positioned.”
