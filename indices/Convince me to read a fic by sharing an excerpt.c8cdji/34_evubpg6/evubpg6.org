Voldemort was severely angry with his Mirror. Harry gripped the balustrade as his scar continued to hurt.

He made his way through the Dursley's house, now cleaned from the mess his arrival had created. He heard his aunt chopping vegetables in the kitchen rather vigorously. The little dog in the hallway growled at his approach.

Petunia turned around, holding the knife up. "What do you want now?"

He gripped the table as that strange feeling overcame him again. "Nothing."

"You look like you need a cup of tea." She went back to hacking her vegetables for her stew, and did not lift a single finger to put the kettle on to boil.

He looked around, wincing in pain. Harry needed to be distracted from the uneasy feelings he felt, so he asked questions, hoping to find out a little more about this world. "Are you in contact my mother?"

Petunia's knife paused. "No, not since..." She tensed. "I do not have contact with the freaks of your world."

"Er, how-how is Dudley?" He figured he should've started with a question that would've softened her a little.

Petunia grabbed a handful of chopped carrots and dropped them into the pot. "He has recovered from his injuries, and was almost expelled from Smeltings for unruly behaviour and obtaining drugs. Vernon thought it was best to get him away from here, and take him somewhere for a holiday to harden him up again."

"Right..."

"Your people killed our neighbours, Dudley's friends, and tortured many. We were so terrified. Out of all the streets in the world, why pick this one? Was it some sick joke from your side? What did you tell them to make them come here?" she spat.

"Aunt Petunia, they all know I have Muggle relatives---"

"I'll never forget the look on your face when you tried to wake Dudley."

"Why's that?"

"It was as though you were torn. I can't describe it." Petunia closed her eyes. "It was as though you were half happy, half sad. It was only a split second, but I could see it burning in your eyes... then you knocked me unconscious."

He could clearly sense the mistrust in his aunt.

"What happened to your brother?" she asked.

"I just killed him."

"You're keeping secrets."

"Of course I am."

She pursed her lips. "Two days after the attack on my street, I went to your brother's funeral. That was the last I saw of your mother... Your father almost cursed me when I mentioned my doubts about you, and Mr Dumbledore walked away from me. Everyone brushed me off, saying that Harry had made a mistake not killing my son."

Harry thought that was a bit harsh. "What's the Muggle---I mean---your world without us like?"

"Horrible. This mist," Petunia waved at the foggy weather outside the kitchen window, "has been a phenomenon in the U.K for many years. It's quite rare that we get two days in a row without it clouding our vision, and some say it's getting worse and thicker. It's spreading to the continent. From what I heard from your lot, it's because of those /Dementeds/ breeding."

"Dementors," said Harry, gently correcting her.

"Normal people are disappearing in record numbers. Others end up like vegetables or insane and then there are people who turn up dead---bitten to shreds. Then homes and buildings are destroyed.

"The government knows and is terrified -- but they made up a story that it's terrorism from the Green Skulls.

"Two Prime Ministers have been killed by the /Dementeds/ in the last twenty-eight years. People are scared and leaving the UK in droves and there's a curfew after dark. In many cities the army has been employed to keep the streets safe. What good are tanks, when they're dealing with your lot? No one helps us. The U.N turns a blind eye, and the other countries don't help us much because they know that only wizards can fight wizards. The bad side is so powerful, so they kill us for fun.

"It's mass murder, Harry. It's genocide of the Normal folk." She pointed her finger into his direction. "It's your people destroying our world!"

So this is life if Neville had died and if Voldemort had never been vanquished. Harry was shivering. "That's just horrible."

She laughed. "What an understatement." Petunia stirred the pot, the gentle steam giving off a pleasant savoury aroma. "Now, if you please, I'd like to enjoy my dinner alone." But she did ladle a bowl full of stew for him to eat. Full to the brim, which was something she never did in his world.
