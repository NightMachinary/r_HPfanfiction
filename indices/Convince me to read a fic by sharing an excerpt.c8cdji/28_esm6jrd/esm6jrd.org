“As soon as he was given the antidote, Severus felt the numbing effects of the veritaserum overdose fade. In its place, fury and betrayal such as he had not felt in years filled him. He seized his wand from Molly Weasley's hands.

"Severus, I apologize for --" Dumbledore began.

"Today you have violated me as surely as the Dark Lord ever has," Severus interrupted. Nothing that you can say can forgive this, old man. I gave you everythingin exchange for your promise to protect Lily. Yet still she died. Later, I swore my continued service to protect her worthless son, asking you only to let me retain my privacy. Today, you broke those terms. Twice broken, never mended.

Severus looked up. The phoenix had, as usual, refused to enter Grimmauld Place. No matter. He shouted, "Hellspawn! I surrender! I agree to your terms." I will have my vengeance, no matter the cost.

The moment he called, the phoenix appeared. Severus felt a jolt of power flow from the creature to him. Flames covered him, yet he did not burn. All of the texts he had read had described phoenix fire as a comforting warmth.

They were wrong.

Perhaps if Severus had accepted the phoenix when he had first appeared, it would have been different. None of his extensive research had found anything to suggest that phoenixes remained invisible to others before bonding. From that, he suspected that either very few had ever refused an offer to bond, or else his phoenix was more stubborn than most. Severus had been at his emotional nadir when he met the phoenix. The phoenix's fires might have felt comforting then, a welcoming hearth after a long, cold day.

He was in a very different mindset now.

His rage and the phoenix fire burned as one. They consumed him. He blazed, a figure of wrath and pain and vengeance.

The treacherous Order backed away from him in fear, as was only right.

"Come. We have a prisoner to rescue," Severus said.”
