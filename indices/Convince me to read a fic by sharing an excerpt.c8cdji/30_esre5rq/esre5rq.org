  Then was the day of the winter solstice, and only three stood in a small stone chamber, saying vows they had said times before. Vows that felt written into their hearts and on their skin, floating inside their bones in blood they gently spilled into a bowl that Flitwick held, voice gentle and commanding.

  They held hands and watched magic rise and twine and gather and release. They saw yellow tying together emerald green and violet-blue in a fragile thread, a knot over their heart. So delicate, and yet so strong.

  /Two are stronger than one. For when one would fail, two would prosper./

  Flitwick's final words, as he held their hands in his own.

  Then yellow swirled and was gone, collapsing upon itself out of existence.

  Then they, too, fell upon themselves, in a fever of magic and emotion.

  And between them, slender and strong as a spider's web, their souls grasped one another tightly and didn't let go.
