My favourite Dark Marauders story and probably one of my all time favourite Harry Potter stories is */The Innocence of Wolves/* by */Gateway Girl/*. It starts during their school years and continues on to the years afterward.

Summary

  AU. The Prank goes wrong, Severus Snape dies, and the Marauders dispose of the evidence and get away with it -- and after that, what can't you do? While Remus falls for Sirius, the Marauders become the Free-Blood Guards, working to destroy Voldemort's servants.
