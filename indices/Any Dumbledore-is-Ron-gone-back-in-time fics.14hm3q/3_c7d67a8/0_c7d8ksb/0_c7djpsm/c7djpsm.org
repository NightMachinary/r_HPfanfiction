I see Ron, stealing things like the 12 uses of Dragons Blood from the future and generally abusing other types of knowledge, to appear one of the greatest wizards of all time. However he did not research time travel well enough to know that changing the time line would mitigate much of his future knowledge. He had Hermione help him with the research in the future, as a hypothetical of course (she was thrilled he was thinking academically after leaving hogwarts)

He accidentally jumps too far, back to pre WWII, and has to come up with a backstory. Now Ronald is not "dumb" just doesn't apply himself. He's the chessmaster, so he starts arranging the pieces.

But things keep changing on him, things keep trying to correct themselves, ripples in the timeline mean small things in the 1940's have repurcussions he didn't plan for in the 90's.

In the end, he is able to arrange for Harry to end up with Ginny, and he with Hermione (his plan all along) but then Harry/Hermione find out about the Amortentia! Harry is also just as immune to obliviate as he is to Impirius, it all goes wrong for him.

Hermione is ostensibly married to Ron thanks to the Amortentia after effects. But both her and Ginny's children are Harry's, and the three of them are happy together. Present Ron is kept in the dark about his future self (dumbledore) and is none the wiser about the kids not being his. I mean come on, red hair! hello? Forgetting that Harry carries a recessive gene for it from Lily.

Ron the Cuckold, Dumbledore the dead chessmaster.

Though when Ron DOES find out about Harry/hermione/Ginny being together, he decides to time-jump to fix things....
