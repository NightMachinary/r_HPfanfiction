Well, the original timeline had Hermione spending most summers at Potter Manor with the Marauders. Ron went back originally to get Hermione, which he succeeded at in this timeline for a little while. Possibly original Ron was a bit more capable than current Ron as well.

New Ron decides to go back to make changes, but is too incompetent to do anything but use what he knows about Dumbledore (once he realizes he IS dumbledore) and so his going back THIS time is only in order to maintain the current timeline, in fact reinforcing the WTF moments like basically sending the trio down after the Stone in first year (after all, if he never goes back in time, then Dumbledore doesn't exist, so the original timeline takes over. Where there WAS no Voldemort.)
