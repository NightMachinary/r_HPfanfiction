I know you were not, the point was that I've been an active part of the FF community for 10+ years and I'd never come across peggy-sue or the name 'ministry 6'...Well, might've come across that one and never thought of it.

Though, in my defense, most of my reading is on ff.net, and I'm usually in Time-travel land.
