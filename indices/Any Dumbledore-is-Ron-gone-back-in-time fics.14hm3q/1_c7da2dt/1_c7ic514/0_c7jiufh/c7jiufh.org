I have not forgotten, I've just been busy. Sorry. Here we go: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny_and_Blue]] It IS slash, but I think it was well done and not too lemony, silly at times, but great, and it's complete.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6261496/1/Forced_Perception]] no pairings, non-slash. Kind of a cool one where Harry is older than Albus (as opposed to being the same age). It's in progress, but it has been getting updated regularly, as far as I can tell.

Other than that, I dont recall. There are more I've read out there, but only as I come across them. Those two are nice long reads and I've enjoyed reading them, esp the first, as it's hilarious and silly at times.

Happy reading!
