That is the first time I've heard of that. I'm a big time-travel ficcer, but I'm usually harry-centric or hermione-centric in my TT reading. I've never seen this senario, but seeing Ron travel is fairly uncommon. I did just read one story where it was Ron, Harry and Ginny. Or you sometimes get the Golden Trio or what I call the DA 6. or Harry going to Dumbledore's time. I'll keep an eye out and do a few searches, as this sounds like an interesting read.

But I honestly cant see Ron and Dumbledore as the same person.
