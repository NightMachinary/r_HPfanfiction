I haaaave been looking for something to get me writing again. I have dabbled in a few new fics but they all petered out... I think I used all my good stuff in Searching For The Power...writing 560k words will kill a genre for you for quite a while.

I'm actually already dabbling a bit in time travel with my HP crossover (with Incarnations of Immortality) so I'm in the headspace...
