Muhuwahaha, so the entire reason for Ron to come back as Dumbledore to make Harry marry his sister so he could marry Hermione (who originally ended up with Harry).

His master plan began with turning Tom Riddle into Voldemort by forcing him back to that orphanage every summer, then planting a fake prophecy for Snape to hear, which leads to Harry's parents being killed and Harry growing up poor (backfired slightly since he still ended up with his parents money, but Ronbledore didn't mind, because as Harry's magical guardian he had access to the Potter vaults anyway.) This also allowed him to send Harry back to the Dursley's every summer (in the original timeline, Hermione spends most summers at Potter Manor) and have Hermione stay with him at the burrow until they could "rescue" Harry.

When Harry and Hermione STILL looked like they would end up together, he had to "nudge" Harry towards Ginny with potions in sixth year.

Genius really, Ron was playing the long game
