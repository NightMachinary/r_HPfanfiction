"...You did punch him in the face." A bushy-haired girl, one of Harry's /best/ friends, if Dumbledore was to be believed, stated, a /tired/ tone to her voice.

...Remus was feeling /really/ nostalgic.

"I am surprised you didn't try to punch that /dementor/ in the face." The red-headed student , the other presumed best friend, snorted.
