Semi-relevant thought: Voldemort added time sands to the poison, which causes the drinker to start being resigned to their death in the events leading up to drinking the poison. The two known victims of the poison were competent enough to think of trying something other than drinking death juice, yet both shrugged and did it anyways. Destroying the basin is a possibility.

We don't know exactly what Regulus Black was up to in the months leading up to his death, but his actions of telling absolutely nobody about the horcruxes to the point of ordering Kreacher not to disclose anything is markedly similar to Dumbledore's elaborate assisted suicide plan.

This also might explain why the potion is the only thing that permanently replenishes: it's looping itself in time.
