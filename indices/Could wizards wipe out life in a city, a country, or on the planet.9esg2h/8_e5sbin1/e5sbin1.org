I've had to find ways to avoid this scenario multiple times in the Arithmancer-Verse. Self-replicating spells degrade or run out of power before they can go full grey goo. Mandrakes only kill at point-blank range, and /Sonorus/ doesn't work on them. Fiendfyre will burn itself out pretty quickly if left unchecked. Imperiusing someone to Imperius more people like a virus (even though that only extends to wizards) is unreliable. Unbreakability spells can be overwhelmed with sufficient force (so you can't leverage them to initiate nuclear fusion or something). Radioactive materials cannot be transfigured, period. All of these things as described in canon could have catastrophic city-destroying effects or worse, but my headcanon is that magic is self-limiting in ways that it simply takes too much "power," for lack of a better word, to make them work.

As for a dedicated group of wizards bringing down the muggle world, that it scarily plausible and could only really be avoided by wizards as a society self policing. Magical terrorists destroy the electrical grid? Aurors Apparate in and magically repair the transformers. Imperius world leaders to start nuclear war? Someone (maybe the ICW) is keeping an eye on that. (I hope, anyway. Fudge sure didn't seem competent enough with the muggle Prime Minister to even know what a nuke /was/.)
