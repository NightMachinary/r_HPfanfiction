No, electricity does work around magic. that's a misconception in a lot of fanon. Arthur Weasley did lots of magic at the Dursley household and it broke no electrical things. People are confusing Hermione's statement that lots of magic being around Hogwarts stops electronics and think that means any amount of magic stops them. It doesnt.
