A Wizard Solo without a Wizard attempting to stop him could take out a city in under 2 hours with just FiendFyre

Country would be more difficult but a massive ritual based around it, like ultra massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions (which if they could do it could mean the end of the world)

If they can make Volcanos go off, they just set off Yellowstone and It's time to play some R. E. M.
