This... isn't exactly a response to your question. Rather, it's me free-associating along the lines of your question.

With that said...

Can curses self-replicate? That is, if you cursed something, could the curse apply itself to something else? We know the gemino curse can exponentially clone objects, especially when someone touches it, but could it exponentially clone spells?

The most basic application of this is a magical plague. Touch the infected and you too are infected. It'd take a lot of work to calibrate it to spread like a pandemic - it can't be too weak (it'll die out) /or/ too strong (it'll kill all potential hosts or will be quarantined too fast) - but you could make something really dangerous.

Then, could you do that with a non-physical spell? Say, anyone who is infected spreads a confundus-like compulsion. It doesn't have to be lethal, or even harmful, but now you've got a mind-control plague.

And what if you tweaked it further? What if it was a subtle compulsion or a delayed reaction? And what if it could spread through eye-contact like a viral form of legilimency? Or better yet, if you tied it to a taboo-like effect, spreads through performing (or even witnessing) certain actions. Hell, if you set it right, could you design a curse that curses anyone who reads a specific line of text and compels them to write more of that text? Well, now you've got a magical meme.

Or, in SCP terms, you've got a Euclid- or Keter-class memetic hazard.
