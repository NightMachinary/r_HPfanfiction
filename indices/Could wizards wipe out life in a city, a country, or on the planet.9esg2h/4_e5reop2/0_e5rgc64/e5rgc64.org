  We know the gemino curse can exponentially clone objects, especially when someone touches it, but could it exponentially clone spells?

Indeed it can. The vaults deep within Gringotts used the Geminio curse to replicate the objects in the vault, and the other enchantments on the contents of the vault were carried over to the cloned objects too. Like the Lestrange vault had all the objects cursed to burn at the touch, and all the copies were had that curse too in DH.
