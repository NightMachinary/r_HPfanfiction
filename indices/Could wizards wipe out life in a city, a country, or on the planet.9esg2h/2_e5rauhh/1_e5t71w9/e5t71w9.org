What I'm going to say comes up every time in these "Wizards vs Muggles" threads, but it's important to point out: In canon we see an expert on muggles who doesn't know how to pronounce electricity and the average Wizard is unable to pick out appropriate clothes to wear in muggle society.

I therefore find your ideas hard to accept. Though they make a lot sense on a theoretical level or in a "what if muggles had wizard powers" scenario. In practice Wizards appear to be way too isolationist to come up with any of these tactics.
