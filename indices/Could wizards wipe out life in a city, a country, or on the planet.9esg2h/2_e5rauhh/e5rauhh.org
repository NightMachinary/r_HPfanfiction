Sure there would be, and you could even make it specific to Muggles!

What do Muggles in the western world need, but wizards don't? Electricity!

I think around 5-10 wizards using apparition and a few well-placed blasting-curses could take out (and keep it down) most of the European power grid, same for the US.

A study by the German government came to the conclusion that for an europe-wide blackout within 1-2 weeks most of Europe would go into a civil-war-like state. Oh, and if you like fun, also attack the water grid, that's bound to be fun in a city like London or New York.

Back to electricity: we can also creatively imperius a few of the people working on nuclear reactors. A few of them exploding wouldn't be too bad now, would it?

Imperius is also a good idea in general, pilots can do a lot of damage if you point them at the right targets. Imagine 10-20 pilots suddenly going rogue, all at once. Not nice.

And of course your ideas work too, just look at the destruction of the obscrus in the FB movie, and how quick they repaired it.

If you use a bit of creativity you can really kill a lot of people easily.
