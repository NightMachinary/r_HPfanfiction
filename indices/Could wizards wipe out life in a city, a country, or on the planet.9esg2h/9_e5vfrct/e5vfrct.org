Is it cheating to use the imperius to unleash nuclear armageddon? Legilimency+memory charms to gather the necessary information on who to target, then a small number of wizards (potentially even just one very powerful one with a few international portkeys) order the relevant individuals to initiate simultaneous launch of the world's whole stockpile.\\
If the wizarding world in general was out to do it then they'd probably survive too, wards, unbreakable charms etc. could make for some rather impressive bunkers, bubble head charms, aguamenti and similar spells could likely handle fallout quite well by providing clean air and water to grow plants and breathe/drink.
