Harry woke up after a restless night at the crack of dawn. He peered at his fellow dorm-mates, surprised that they were still sleeping in. As quietly as he could, Harry dressed in clothes his didn't mind getting dirty and crept out into the common room, finding it empty.

Glad that there was no-one around, Harry started looking for cleaning supplies in some of the various cupboards littered around the common room. He found little spiders, rolls of parchments, extra robes, dozens of books; he even found a muggle book squirreled away but no cleaning supplies.

Frowning, Harry tried to think of where else to look. Even a duster would do.

"Mister Harry Potter asks for a duster?" a voice squeaked from behind him. Harry turned and was shocked at the sight of the small creature before him. It had large eyes and rather floppy ears, wearing a rather nice tea towel around their skinny body. In their hands was a feather duster, looking brand new.

In his shock, Harry said, "I'm sorry, but who are you?"

"Tippy, sir. Tippy the House-Elf, at your service, sir. Hogwarts said you needed a duster, sir, so Tippy brought the duster. Is the common room too dusty?" Tippy asked, wringing their hands nervously.

"N-no, it's really clean," Harry started, seeing a large smile on the house-elf, "But don't I need to earn my keep? Clean, wash, cook?"

The elf looked horrified, "No! House-elves do all that. Mister Harry Potter is a student, students don't clean Hogwarts!"

"But I need to earn my keep somehow, right? Otherwise they'll kick me out. Or worst send me back home. Please, I want to help somehow," Harry begged Tippy.

Tippy frowned. She was certain she seen this kind of behavior before. She'll have to report to Madam Sprout about this but hands over the duster to Harry, "Tippy normally dust the room at this time. If Mister Harry Potter is willing?"

Harry was more than happy to grab the duster and started going round the room systematically.

Tippy nodded to herself. She'll report to Madam Sprout and hope she won't get punished for letting a student help her.
