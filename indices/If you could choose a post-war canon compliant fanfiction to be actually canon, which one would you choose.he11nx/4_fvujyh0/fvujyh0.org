If you forget the epilogue and the cursed child, as in, Harry and Ginny don't happen, then...

At your service by Faith Wood

such a great mystery, it felt like I was still reading HP. it's eight year, so they are also at school still, just after Voldy is dead. not sure if she disregarded Hinny or if she just made them break up though, so not very sure how canon compliant that is. (the fic is Drarry).

I just. really. hate. the. epilogue.
