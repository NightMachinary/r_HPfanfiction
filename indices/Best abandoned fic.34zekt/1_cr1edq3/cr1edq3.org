Man. This is really hard, because they're not... done? Alright, slight modification to your question: I'll give you the story that I wish had been completed the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5723954/1/Order-of-the-Phoenix-by-TIJK][Order of the Phoenix by TIJK]]: Harry gets expelled at the trial before fifth year, ends up moving in with and learning magic from Sirius. Good concept, but it ends before anything happens with the plot. It's basically 40k words of exposition for a story that never happens.
