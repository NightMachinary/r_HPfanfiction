I spent over 30 minutes going through my bookmarks and pulling my hair out, but I couldn't decide on the best one.

  Nuclear war breaks out and Voldemort casts a spell to stop time. He and Harry alone are left to defuse the missiles and prevent the war. Voldemort's radiophobic. Oh joy. LVHP. Spoilers for HBP, none for DH.

This fic has the funniest Voldemort I've ever seen. The poor thing, so scared of muggles.

  In one world, the war against Lord Voldemort is raging. In another, a Hogwarts professor named Tom Riddle decides to put his theory on alternate worlds to test and embarks on a trip that quickly turns into a disaster. AU sixth year. DH compliant.

This is one of the few proper "good Tom Riddle" fic that isn't a "Voldemort is secretly a misunderstood good guy" fic. Not sure if it's really abandoned. Riddle vs Voldemort is the best thing that happened to the war.

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.

Not sure if this one is really abandoned too. History makes me drool.
