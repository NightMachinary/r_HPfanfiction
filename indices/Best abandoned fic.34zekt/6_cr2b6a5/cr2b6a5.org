I would have to say [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128372][Free Life]] is by far one of the ones that annoyed me the most, probably because i finished reading it like yesterday. It is the sequel to [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11709][Taking control]] and does not look like being finished ever, it was last updated in 2011, and while the author said he was going to continue it as recently as last year, i doubt anything will happen
