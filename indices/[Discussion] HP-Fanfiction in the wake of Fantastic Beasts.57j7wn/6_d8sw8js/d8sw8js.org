For one I just look forward to a bit more worldbuilding. I already dread whats to come and how much I'll have to ignore, but at least we get some new stuff to discuss.

New places, new people, new creatures,... I can't wait. Finally we get a new protagonist on which we can base stories.

What I hope for fanfiction is that people divide their focus from Hogwarts and the British Isles to a broader playing field.

From the movies I hope they don't just play in the United States. The following Ameriwank would be unbearable. I hope, since she hinted on Grindelwald, that we also see continental Europe and maybe we even glimpse towards Asia and Africa.

In any case I'm looking forward to some new stories. Fresh stuff is always good for a fandom.
