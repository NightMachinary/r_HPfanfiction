We are /finally/ going to get a better idea of just how wizarding societies are structured around the world. I cannot say just how much that excites me, since blindly groping in the dark is really hard when it comes to trying to write societies that may or may not predate their muggle counterparts by decades if not centuries. For one thing, their version of the UN is centuries old. How the hell do you write/account for that? We may soon know the answer.
