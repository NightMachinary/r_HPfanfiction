*My hopes:*

- As others have said, new perspectives on magical creatures.

- Interesting characters with complicated flaws and motivations.

- A continued emphasis on choices between doing what is easy and doing what is right.

*My fears:*

- A plethora of new American OC-Sues who help Newt save the day.

- Factions drawn up to debate the legitimacy of new canon content with each side drawing from the new films to support its claim in biased fanfics.

- A rash of stories deriding the original series in favour of the new one.
