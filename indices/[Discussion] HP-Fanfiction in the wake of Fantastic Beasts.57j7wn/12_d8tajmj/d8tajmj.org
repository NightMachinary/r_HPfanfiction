Since /Fantastic Beasts/ takes place (at least partially) in Harlem, NY, I expect there will be an increase in fics set in the US.

Harlem in that period was primarily black, and the US as a whole is only two thirds white. /Fantastic Beasts/ doesn't reflect that. So I expect almost all OCs to be white.

/Fantastic Beasts/ has references to First Nations magic, if I recall correctly. However, it doesn't do anything to make those references reflect any beliefs or myths or lore or history of any people group. So I expect a mild surge in talk of native North American peoples and magic, but I expect that it will be equally unresearched and uncaring toward the people depicted.

I would /like/ more fics that contain fresh looks on what magic in the Americas could look like, especially with a non-Euro-centric view. I would like fics that deal with international politics. I don't expect many of them.
