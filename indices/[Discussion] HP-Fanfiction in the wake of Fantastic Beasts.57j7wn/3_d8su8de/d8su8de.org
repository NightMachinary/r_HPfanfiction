I am hopeful that the series will stand alone in terms of characters such that the magical world can be explored as snapshots of time and geography. A story in Africa about the Nundu and other stories in other places. Distinct locales and distinct people such that each might spawn its own universe, but not as cheesy because the films no longer have to be directed at children as a primary audience.

Thus an exploration of magic at many times that would really expand what information ff authors have to draw from in a character and narrative sense. I expect none of this, I merely hope for it.

Btw it's affect in this case not effect.
