Except for Harry Potter fics I read all the rest of my fandoms on A03. I have no big problem finding fics although its different. I'm glad to see more authors like you using them as I love features like being able to download a mobi with one click.

It did take Ariel to get used to their searches and such, what's your user name on a03 so we can check out your stories.
