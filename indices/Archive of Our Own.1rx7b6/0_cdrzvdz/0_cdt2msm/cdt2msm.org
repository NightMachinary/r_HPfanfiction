A few quick questions, as you seem to know what's up:

The few times I've perused the site, it seemed to have been mostly slash, smut, or both, at least in the Harry Potter sections. Is that still the case?

As I primarily write non-smut fiction, I'm wondering whether I'll get many eyes looking at my stories if I join the site. Is the site expanding beyond that niche?

Also, what's a typical wait time for an invite nowadays? I remember trying for one several months ago (maybe a year?) but giving up.

Thanks!
