You were fantastic, thank you!

I think the best solution to the tag thing is to do a negative search on characters that shouldn't be relevant to the kind of story I'm reading. (i.e., for Petunia, adding -Draco).

I haven't spent much time looking for specifically H/G fics, but I've actually been having good luck with gen fics.
