  Why do you feel the need to "sink" other's 'ships?
#+end_quote

I don't. Just like you felt the need to explain why you think Hermione and Riddle would fit together, I felt the need to explain why they wouldn't.

Your argument about fantasy is completely incorrect. The fact that the series is a fantasy about unrealistic things happening, does not mean everything can happen against reason. It's like I'd say I ship Harry/Umbridge because they fit, and you'd say they don't, and I'll respond with "but it doesn't have to be realistic!". It's simply not a valid argument. Otherwise you wouldn't have gone through the effort to justify your ship earlier.

  Even Ron/Hermione, by Rowling's admission, is "unrealistic" as a 'ship
#+end_quote

Can you give me the exact citation that says this, please?

You can ship Riddle/Hermione as much as you like, but, please, just drop the pretense that they canonically fit.

The thing is, doesn't that just defeat the entire point of shipping? I mean, I'm not into it, so I might be wrong, but isn't shipping about looking at two characters, and saying "they would make a great couple"? it's not like you just ship characters randomly. You choose them for their qualities, and the way they fit each other. So what's the point of shipping characters that don't fit?
