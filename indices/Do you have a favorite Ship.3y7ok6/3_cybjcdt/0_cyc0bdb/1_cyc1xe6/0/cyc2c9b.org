Why do you feel the need to "sink" other's 'ships?

It was never a matter of debate, as I pointed out on the original thread, as linked. It's a matter of preference; for example, not everyone is going to like chocolate ice cream, or believe in God, but that doesn't mean that you can try to poo-poo them for it.

This isn't Battleship, for Merlin's sake. It doesn't work like that. Do you really think that people are going to say, "Hey, you sunk my (battle)ship"?

Do you go around telling little kids, "sorry to ruin your fantasy, but Santa Claus doesn't exist"? Or how 'bout one of those people who would run around the bookstore during the release of /Half-Blood Prince/, shouting, "Dumbledore's dead"?

Fanfiction isn't about, and has never been about, debate, unless you count ship wars, and those are both immature and irrelevant. I have no desire whatsoever to participate in such petty pissing contests of "whose 'ship is better".

If you don't like it, my advice is to ignore it, and move on. You are not contributing the discussion with additions like the above, and you're not going to change my mind.

Personally, I think it's also incredibly rude and disrespectful to go around telling others, "your 'ship sucks", or "sorry to burst your bubble".

The whole reason why anyone reads Harry Potter is to escape into a /fantasy/. It's unrealistic /by nature/. Saying "your 'ship is unrealistic" is merely redundant to me, because /that's basically the entirety of the Harry Potter world/ already. Especially in Harry Potter fanfiction, where the most popular 'ships are the "unrealistic" ones!

Even Ron/Hermione, by Rowling's admission, is "unrealistic" as a 'ship. Does that mean that people don't have a right to enjoy it?
