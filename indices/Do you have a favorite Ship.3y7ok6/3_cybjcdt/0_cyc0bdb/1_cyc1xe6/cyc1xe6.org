  chances are, Tom Riddle also would have at least felt some sort of kinship with Hermione as well.

And this is where your entire ship sinks. While Riddle paralleled Harry, he was also very, very different, especially in regards to friendship. Considering that Harry himself frequently felt agitated with Hermione's behaviour and hardly enjoyed her company (reasons and examples detailed in [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html][this]] article), it's hard to imagine Riddle enjoying Hermione's company. He would surely mock and ridicule her for her foolish self sacrifice and Gryffindor tendency to get into danger for her friends, adherence to muggle social ideals (S.P.E.W), benevolent morals and occasional naive attitude.

When it comes to intellectual pursuits, Hermione is not even close to Riddle's level, not even to Snape's level. She didn't invent any new magic or dabbled in obscure magic (in fact, she was averse to "non-Ministry-approved magic" as she says and shows in HBP).

So, sorry to ruin your fantasy, but there's no chance in hell that Riddle would ever get romantically involved with Hermione. Or anyone else, for that matter. Riddle doesn't /do/ romance. And I hardly think she would like him as well, for all his admirable qualities.
