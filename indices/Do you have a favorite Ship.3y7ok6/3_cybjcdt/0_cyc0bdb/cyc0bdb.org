Reposting my response from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3is6rt/what_crack_ship_do_you_actually_ship/][a previous thread]] on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] on shipping.

  I ship Tomione, or Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger.

  This is for several reasons. One, when one gets down to details, they both share some similar character traits. Both are logical and driven to succeed academically, to be "the best" when it comes down to who achieves the most in classes each year. Hermione can also be quite ruthless, cunning, and cold at different parts of the series, especially in OOTP - her face-disfiguring hex and having Umbridge be kidnapped by centaurs - and DH. If it wasn't for Hermione, Harry and Ron would also be in a world of trouble in DH. In a way, Hermione - even in PS/SS, helping Harry with the Potions room - helps to foil Tom Riddle's attempts to capture and kill Harry.

  However, even from the start, Hermione proves herself to be a very intelligent, bright, capable, and ambitious witch. To me, she also has some very Slytherin traits - trapping Rita Skeeter in a jar for /weeks/ as a beetle was one among several - and almost reminds me of a young, albeit Gryffindor-esque, version of Bellatrix. (...and we all know how Bellatrix views Tom Riddle, or Lord Voldemort.) Hermione is even able to /lie/ convincingly to Bellatrix, and fool the Dark Lord's right-hand woman into believing a falsehood. That, in itself, is incredibly impressive.

  In COS, Hermione is also the first one to "figure it all out". I'll c/p the portion I wrote for the HP Wiki, all of which is canon.

  - ...Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have "magical powers", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally "caught" the "Heir of Slytherin" when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, she attempted to use the spell /Aparecium/, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an "interested" Hermione.

  - When Ron compared Riddle to Percy "in disgust", mentioning the former as being "Prefect, Head Boy...probably at the top of every class", Hermione responded in a "slightly hurt" voice, "You say that like it's a bad thing."

  - Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had "caught the wrong person", and that "it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people". Later on, after Harry mentioned "hearing the voice" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory.

  I definitely feel that, to an extent, Hermione was the Irene Adler to Tom Riddle's Sherlock, in the sense that it was Hermione who outwitted Riddle, particularly in DH.

  From the books, Riddle and Harry are also directly paralleled, especially in COS. While Harry and Hermione do not end up together romantically at the end of the series, they are, however, best (and good) friends. If Harry is paralleled with Tom Riddle, and Harry is good friends with Hermione and views her "like a sister", chances are, Tom Riddle also would have at least felt some sort of kinship with Hermione as well. Riddle and Hermione also share, again, several similarities: Hermione has some Slytherin traits; she can be cold and ruthless at times; she's clever, cunning, conniving, and intelligent; and, like Riddle, she became a Prefect, and likely in her 7th year, Head [Girl].

  In COS, Hermione also shows "interest" [as per canon] in Tom Riddle, if purely for the fact that Riddle was a Prefect and Head Boy. Later on, in GOF, Hermione displays the /same/ admiration for Cedric Diggory (also a Prefect), to which she has this interesting conversation with Ron:

  - "That idiot, Hogwarts champion?" said Ron, as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd towards the staircase. "He's not an idiot. You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch," said Hermione. "I've heard he's a really good student --- and he's a Prefect." She spoke as though this settled the matter. "You only like him because he's /handsome/," said Ron scathingly. "Excuse me, I don't like people just because they're handsome!" said Hermione indignantly. Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like 'Lockhart!'.

  Speaking of Lockhart, we all know that Hermione had a rather /large/ crush on him, also in COS. Combined with the Cedric Diggory interaction with Ron, it's clear that Hermione is apparently attracted to intelligent, seemingly accomplished, handsome men - and Tom Riddle is not only those things, but highly charismatic. I think it's pretty obvious that if Hermione had met a teenaged Tom Riddle - /without/ being aware of his identity as Lord Voldemort - she would definitely be attracted to him.

  As for Tom Riddle? I think that he would be attracted to Hermione for the same reason he has Bellatrix as a Death Eater: he would see Hermione as both a potentially dangerous threat, as well as a possible, powerful ally. In COS, as soon as Hermione discovers the true identity of Slytherin's monster, what does Tom Riddle do? He orders the basilisk to petrify (or kill) her. Much like Slughorn, I think Riddle likes to "collect" people - as seen with his Death Eaters - and he would want to lure Hermione to his side as well.

  Hermione's a Muggle-born, yes. However, Rowling has also confirmed that Voldemort tried to get Lily Evans - a Muggle-born - to join him as well. That provides clear evidence that blood status does not matter to Voldemort, and his "blood purism" is a facade to keep the Purebloods in his inner circle pacified.
