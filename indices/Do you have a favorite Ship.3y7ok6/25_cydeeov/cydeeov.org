Harry/Hermione is my favourite, although angst and tropes can be a big problem in this ship. There are so many fics written about them it means there is a lot of bad fics written about them. I got into FF to read this ship so most stories I read are Harry/Hermione.

Otherwise I've been through stages of Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks and Harry/Daphne.
