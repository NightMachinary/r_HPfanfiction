Would you believe me if I said I actually can't think of any? I like the pairing because of what I thought up in my own writing, but I haven't actually read a memorable Harry/Luna fic. Well, besides linkffn(By the Divining Light) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song), but the romance is not what makes them memorable.
