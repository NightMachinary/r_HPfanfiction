Sure. I really dislike three tropes that are extremely common with that pairing: bashing, endless angst, and (conversely) 'Harry & Hermione have always been in love,' so most of my favourites tend to be slow building romances or adventure/mystery where the pairing isn't a prominent plot point.

On portkey.org I like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=4723&chapterid=&agree=1][Magic Never Dies by Lynney]], [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Coulsdon Eagle]], [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7056&chapterid=1][Angelica by DerlierMeFromEve]] and [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/1179%20(and%20its%20sequel][The Power He Knows Not by Vicarious Leigh]]. Many of the stories posted on portkey were completed before HBP and DH so it's interesting to see how early authors imagined Harry defeating Voldemort.

Hope one of these interests you.
