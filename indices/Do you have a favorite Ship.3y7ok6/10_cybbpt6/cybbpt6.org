I like Harry/Hermione and Viktor Krum/Hermione. The occasional Snape/Hermione I'll read as well, though my favorite fanfic pair is...Snarry. Lol, I'm addicted.

Come at me, downvotes!

I /hate/ all canon pairs except for Lupin/Tonks which I love, Mom/Dad Weasley, and Bill/Fleur. I also enjoy Snape/Lily as long as it isn't a cheating fic, which I won't read.

Bellatrix/Hermione is a guilty pleasure and I like some more "crack" pairs as long as it is written well...but I guess that goes for a LOT of pairs - except the ones I hate (most canon pairs).

I once read a simply amazing McGonagall fic where she falls in love with a British Muggle (soldier) during WW2...very well written, very sad and the worst part is I can't find it anymore!!!
