Lucius and Hermione. It was the reason I even started reading fanfiction in the first place, and it remains my favorite pairing. I like older men/younger women fics, obviously, and the dynamic of them basically having nothing but pure hatred for each other leads to some of the most fascinating build-ups in romance fics I've seen. At first I was all about the smut, but at this point I don't even care if it mentions them having sex as long as I get to read banter between them, walk with them through their angst and guilt, or delve into their minds when they realize the gravity of their forbidden attraction. I just love it so much. Plus (no offense to Draco lovers) I can't stand his son, so Dramione is completely out of the picture for me.
