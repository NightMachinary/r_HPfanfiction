  After a year of litigation, Lucius Malfoy has a choice - a year in Azkaban to pay for his sins, or prove he's a changed man by passing third-year Muggle Studies, the new and improved version taught by none other than the esteemed Miss Granger. Even worse, his only son may be attracted to a Weasley. Oh, the horror.

  #+begin_example
      I'm not going to lie, Lucius can be a bit OOC at times, but I'm working off of the extreme Woobie\!Lucius we saw in Deathly Hallows, both book and film, who's sort of broken\.  I mix and match where I please, also, taking bits from the films and taking bits from the books, and sometimes just making things up, and not trying all that hard to keep them straight \- hence the 'alternate universe' tag\.  Well, that and I completely ignored the epilogue, and most canonical pairings\.  Fred is still alive, also\.  I missed him too much to do without him, even though he barely appears in this story\.  I'll update when I can, although RL is no one's friend\.  In the meantime, enjoy this little\.\.\.thing\.

  Hermione decides to help Lucius Malfoy transition back into the Wizarding World. She never expected to go through a transition of her own.
