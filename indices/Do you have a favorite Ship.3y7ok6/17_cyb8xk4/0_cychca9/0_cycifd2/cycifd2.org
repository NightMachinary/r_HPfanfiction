There don't seem to be all that many writers for Remus/Hermione. Lots of what you'll find when filtering by that ship is either just smut, extremely short, or a student/teacher deal. Then occasionally you'll come across something like TLM.

I'm waiting for Shayalonnie to finish Misplaced Moony- she's already at 130k+ words and back to updating regularly I think.
