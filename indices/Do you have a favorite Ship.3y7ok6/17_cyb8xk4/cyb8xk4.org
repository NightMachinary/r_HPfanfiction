Remus/Hermione, Remus/Sirius, Sirius/Hermione.

The age gap ships are often either with her out of Hogwarts by the time it starts, or certainly an adult (like those 'return to finish 7th year but there's a new marriage law' stories). Or good old time travel.

linkffn(the debt of time by shayalonnie) linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by mrs j's soup) linkffn(roundaboutdestiny by maryroyale) are all great for Hermione/Sirius, though the first one definitely has Hermione/Remus.

linkffn(the last marauder) is one of my favorite Hermione/Remus stories.

I enjoy linkffn(momentum by children of the shadows) for Remus/Sirius
