Ravenclaw is filled with weirdos. I think slytherins are the ones getting the best grades out of the houses on average bc of the ambition thing. Ravenclaws are the type that will stay up all night reading whatever is the wizarding equivalent to weird wikipedia articles and forget to do homework. Also they tend to be kind of not the friendliest? More withdrawn and tend to think they don't need help because I can do the thing myself thank you !! I am learning how to do it!

Gryffindors are very do-now-think-later. Thrill seeking and like physical experiences a lot. Which could be a nice smelling shampoo or getting drunk off your ass. Or sex. Lots of addictive personalities there. The most antagonistic of the four. If they have a problem with anything you said they will speak up and they will do it right now.

Loyalty is often described as a hufflepuff thing but i think slytherins have a lot of it as well. Who's gonna secretly hex your now-ex-boyfriend? A slytherin will. They're ride or die. If you fuck with my friends you fuck with me. Hufflepuffs will try to make friends with everyone, slytherins will join you in your revenge plotting.

Hufflepuffs are push-overs/people pleasers. They'll let people walk over them to avoid conflict.
