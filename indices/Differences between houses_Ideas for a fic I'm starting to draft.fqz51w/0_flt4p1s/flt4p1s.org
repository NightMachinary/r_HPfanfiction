Ravenclaw- weird/potentially dangerous experiments happening. Maybe they do secret psychological experiments on their classmates? In a creepy, non-invasive way. Starting and publishing a Hogwarts Academic Journal (perhaps co-founded with Slytherin?). Hosts a book club for each year that's open to all houses. They read more than the typical "smart" books because there's always something to learn.

Gryffindor- Organizes intramural sports, whether for just their house or the whole school. Perhaps co-run with Hufflepuff? There's also always a game of Truth or Dare going so it's not unusual to see Gryffindors doing weird things.

Hufflepuff- Throws the best parties. Organizes volunteer work and field trips. Runs a mentorship program in partnership with Slytherin.

Slytherin- Runs the wizarding versions of FBLA and DECA, the Hogwarts secret society was founded by a Slytherin many moons ago. They sponsor career days and internships for older students.
