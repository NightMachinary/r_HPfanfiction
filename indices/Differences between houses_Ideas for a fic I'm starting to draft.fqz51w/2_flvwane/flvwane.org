I like to think that each house has a different dorm system: Gryffindor groups students by age and gender, so all of the first year boys are together, and so on. Hufflepuff puts all the boys in one huge room and all the girls in another, though beds are assigned by age so that students are still with kids their own age. Ravenclaw just gives every kid their own room, and Slytherin groups kids together in rooms if two or three.
