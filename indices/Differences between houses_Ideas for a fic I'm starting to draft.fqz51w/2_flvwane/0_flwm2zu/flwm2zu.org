LolL great minds think alike, I have pretty much the exact headcanon, in fact, I always imagined Hufflepuff's dormitories like a barracks and Salazar Slytherin saying to his firsties:

"Look at the person you have beside you. You will share a room with him or her for the next seven years, what will you make of them? a friend? an enemy? an ally of circumstances? a follower? the true nature of a human being reveals itself when it believes it's free from scrutiny, you will have the chance to learn about him or her more than anyone else in the school, and the true measure of your humanity will be in what you do with that knowledge"
