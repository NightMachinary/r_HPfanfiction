I remember a story talking about how because Dumbledore favored the Gryffindor's so much, they didn't get many of the higher jobs in the ministry and ST Mungos (except Aurors as expendable) because they had gotten all the breaks in Hogwarts. I think it was a discussion with McGonagall who had her eyes opened to the blatant favoritism of Dumbledore and his mistreatment and neglect of the other houses. Can't remember which one though, sorry.
