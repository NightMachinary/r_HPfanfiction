I reckon house based nepotism is absolutely a thing, especially for high ranking positions, or even plain old bias. Would a former Gryffindor choose to promote their hard working Hufflepuff subordinate or would they subconsciously think that a Gryffindor would do the job better? Would they pass over hiring a Slytherin because they can't be trusted, while a former Ravenclaw wouldn't be as prejudiced since the had no rivalry with Slytherin at school. Bias ingrained at a young age is a powerful thing and we see how prejudiced the wizarding world naturally is anyway, plus as you say proof is absolutely seen IRL with the old boys club, so I reckon the housing prejudice still exists, it's just not actually verbally acknowledged.
