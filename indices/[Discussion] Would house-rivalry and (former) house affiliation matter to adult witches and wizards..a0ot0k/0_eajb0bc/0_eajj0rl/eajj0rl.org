I agree with you. It'd be an uncouncious action. Harry wouldn't assume someone is likely a liar because they are Slytherin but his trust in them would suffer and if a Gryffindor and a Slytherin gave two different accounts about something, he'd be more inclined to believe his alumni. On a similar vein, he'd uncounciously expect a cleverer solution from a Ravenclaw while would expect a hufflepuff's solution to focus more on effort.

A belief system engrained in a child at such an impressionable age tends to stick around and show its face in subtle manner throughout one's life unless the person makes a councious effort to stay objective.
