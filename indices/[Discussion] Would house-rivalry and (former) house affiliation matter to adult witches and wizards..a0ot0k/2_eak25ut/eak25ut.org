I see it more like confirmation bias. Everyone was in a house, and many know each other from school, so if someone does something, they try to fit it in the school cliché - like "Well, he is a Gryffindor". Or they use it in conversation - "You're a Ravenclaw, use your brain". But things or traits that go against the cliché get ignored in such situations.
