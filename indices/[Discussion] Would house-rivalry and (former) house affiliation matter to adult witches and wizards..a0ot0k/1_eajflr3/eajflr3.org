Think like how people treat their alma mater. Some would continue to live it up, some would look back wistfully, some would ignore it except maybe during a particularly big time sport event or happening.

It may matter more among a bunch of parents during the school year if there kids are in the same house at their parent and the bunch is bragging and such.
