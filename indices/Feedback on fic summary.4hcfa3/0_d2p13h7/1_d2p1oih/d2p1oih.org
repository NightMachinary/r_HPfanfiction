Thanks for the advice.

The last sentence was something I ran across related to the phrase blood is thicker than water, and that came up.

I see your point about the third and fourth sentences.

I don't see a fell apart, I see a fell for good reasons, and the next sentence there is a fall apart, so maybe I'm seeing something different

Again thanks
