'an unpleasant surprise' and 'the best laid plans fall apart,' are stock phrases that don't tell prospective readers much about the story. IIRC Muggleborn is capitalised.

The last sentence is interesting, but strangely phrased. It leads me to believe that Astoria will be the antagonist in a largely political fic.

Also the tense is a bit strange (e.g. 'came across' then 'tries to turn'). It sounds like all of this has already happened. 'Fell apart' also hits the inner ear wrong. Do you mean fall as in 'fall apart' or 'fall to pieces' or 'fall by the wayside?' Given that you use 'fall apart' in the next sentence, I'd recommend rephrasing it.

I think your third and fourth sentences could be merged into one: Some traditions fell for good reasons, and sometimes the best laid plans fall apart.

Edit: Here's a decent, but very generic format.

Setting [e.g. Post-GoF AU]. When [source of conflict] [acts], [protagonist(s)] are [forced to act] with/in spite of [challenges]. How will [he/she/they] survive when [hint at resolution/further conflict]?
