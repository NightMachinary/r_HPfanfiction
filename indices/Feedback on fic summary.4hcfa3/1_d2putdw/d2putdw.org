It really comes across a bit choppy. The first sentence is fine. The second sentence is a bit odd.

/Her/ favorite muggleborn scholar? If we're talking about Hermione, you might be better off with breaking the fourth wall there and replacing "Her" with "Our", because there's no apparent reason for Daphne and Hermione to know each other, much less like each other. You have to introduce that relationship first before I'd accept such a statement, and you can't do that without me reading the story, which I won't do after reading that statement.

If it's /not/ Hermione, then keep it in because it if people assume Hermione like I did but don't see her tagged, they'll get curious, which is what you want.

The other three sentences are what feels choppy. You can do what [[/u/MacsenWledig]] suggests and combine them, but honestly I think you should remove the fourth sentence entirely, possibly even the fifth sentence. "The best laid plans of mice and men" and variations of the phrase have been done to death.

The wordier version of "blood is thicker than water" is a good mixing up of another done-to-death phrase, but it doesn't work with the rest of the summary. To put it metaphorically, the phrase is a good hook, but it's not attached to a line. I would add a sentence specifically about Daphne and the Muggleborn scholar making a deal before the fifth sentence if you want to use the fifth sentence as a hook.

Both the third and the fifth sentences are good hooks, but they can't work together.

Personally, I would take out both the fourth and fifth sentence and focus on the third, using some variation of "Some(times?) traditions fall for a reason." This is also a good hook, and it is a more relevant to the previous two sentences than the fifth alone.

The best summaries lead into the hook. My favorite example is this_old_dance's Wastelands of Time

  Take a deep breath, count backwards from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It will all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter, the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces the greatest challenge of all... Time.

Wordplay aside (and damn is it good wordplay), it goes from Non Sequitur -> Main problem -> Main protagonist -> Antagonists -> Possible answer/challenge

Each statement leads into the next. Each statement is relevant to the next.

I kind of forgot where I was going with this. You probably get what I'm trying to say by now. Good luck!
