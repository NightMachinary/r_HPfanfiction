  'Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.'

Book 7, Chapter 35. Dumbledore's response to Harry showing pity for what is assumed is a fragment of Voldemort's soul (scar Horcrux). Since most precise descriptor of the thing in question is:

Thus, even if no help can be provided, chastising someone for taking pity upon a thing that looks small, harmless and in much pain comes across as quite heartless to some.
