True. We are told he started suspecting after Diary. But I am amassing quotes that CAN be used, not necessarily should.

Additionally, if we believe Dbles to be evil, but not extend that assumption to all his compatriots, we know three things about Dumbledore that make this quote valid. He knew that Voldemort was still around. He knew what Horcrux was, and had some suspicion from Slughorn. He liked to keep secrets.

That is other part I have seen thrown around: solid suspicions, 10 years to act and no results? A bit hard to believe, ain't it?

But then again, this is a repository of 'maybes'. I am well aware that canon Dumbledore does not provide a single 'certainity'.
