I'm sorry I'm late. I went back to my [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c01jqp/tired_of_ron_bashing_lets_discuss_what_ron/er3miye/?context=3][Ron comment]] to get a rough outline for Ginny.

- Likes/dislikes

Ginny likes

Ginny loves flying--and she notably likes Chasing the best. Seeking gets the glory, but Chasing is the most active role in the game. Ginny likes doing things and she likes doing it as a team.

Ginny does not like being put down. She's the youngest of the family and it's implied she's often babied.

Ginny grew up to resent this, and part of her more pro-active stances are likely a continuation of this.

- Strengths

Ginny is absolutely devoted to her friends. She won't let them diminish themselves.

When Neville Longbottom tries to pass himself off as "nobody," Ginny is quick to counter this.

Ginny has a maternal streak to her, even if it's not particularly pronounced.

She's kind to Neville.

She's protective of Luna.

- Weaknesses

For all her desire to not be seen as a little girl, Ginny does have a bratty streak to her.

She comes up with an immature nickname for Fleur--Phlegm. However snobby Fleur is (and she is indeed a snob), "Phlegm" crosses a line.

She throws a tantrum when Molly tells her she cannot stay up to listen to the Order's meeting.

She's small--If you were ever to write a fight scene, however powerful with jinxes Ginny is, if her opponent is able to close the distance and it becomes hand-to-hand, Ginny's doomed.

- Biggest Misconceptions

As eloquently put by [[/u/InquistorCOC][u/InquistorCOC]], Ginny is not a slut.

She dates two boys, Michael and Dean, in the span of approximately two years, with a considerable gap between her break-up with Dean and when she starts going out with Harry.

Furthermore, let us examine Ginny's outrage when Ron "tries" to warn her about the risks to her reputation. Ginny is furious, insulting Ron cruelly, but she also is noted to be "near tears." Ginny is noted as rarely being weepy. So we can conclude that she's deeply hurt by the insinuation.

Ginny also does not resemble Lily Evans. Ginny is routinely described as having typical Weasley flaming red hair. Lily had dark red hair. Ginny's eyes are bright brown, exactly like her mother's. Lily had striking green eyes. Ginny is described as small--even as late as /Half-Blood Prince,/ strangers call her "a little girl." We're never given a real description of Lily's height--though we can at least judge that she isn't notably short.

- Other insights

Ginny has an inclination towards older names. She named Ron's owl "Pigwidgeon." She named her Pygmy Puff "Arnold."

Make of it what you will, but those were old names even in the 1990s.

Examine Ginny's friendship with Luna Lovegood.

When first introduced, Ginny calls her "Loony," but makes a note of calling her "Luna" to her face.

She muffles her laughter--though whether she's laughing at Luna or laughing at Neville and Harry's reactions to Luna is an open question. Possibly a bit of both.

Ginny snarls at Luna for insulting Hagrid.

But we later see them in each other's company outside of classes and Luna later says that Ginny defends her from bullies.
