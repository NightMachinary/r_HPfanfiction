Agreed on all of this.

One thing I would add is that while she is Devoted to Harry, she can and will stand up to him and call him out when needed... whether about not asking her about his possession worries at Christmas in OOTP, his shouting at them after the Sirius vision, and even with the HBP book where she's skeptical until Harry proves it's /just/ a book with notes in it.

Also, I'm not sure the right word for it but when offered the chance to go to the Yule Ball with Harry she turns it down since she already said yes to Neville. If she were as "must marry Harry" crazed as some claim there's no way she'd do that.
