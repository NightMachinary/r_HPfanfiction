Canon Ginny is:

- Aggressive: would physically beat up/magically assault someone just for annoying her. Zach Smith found it out the hard way twice.
- Brave: faced off some of the worst sadistic mass murderers in Magical Britain at age of 14, didn't hesitate to go back fighting again and again.
- Devoted: unlike Hermione who has her own agenda, she seems unconditionally loyal toward Harry, whether it was to get him into Umbridge's office, defend him against Hermione with respect to the Half-Prince Book, accept his decision to break up with her, or try to steal the Gryffindor Sword for him.
- Emotionally strong: She overcame the massive trauma suffered in her first year and the crush on her hero, and grew up to become a popular jock in the school by her 4th year. Unfortunately, the Books are mostly from Harry's POV and we don't see how she made this change. The biggest fandom attack against Ginny the character is that most of her development happens off screen. She also never cries which is a major reason why Harry likes her.
- Intelligent: Of course not as smart as Hermione, but clever enough to sneak them into Umbridge's office. Later in Year 7, she and Neville organized the student rebellion at Hogwarts, without really getting caught.
- Jealous: During the Wedding, she got upset when Gabrielle was hero worshipping Harry. Later in the Room of Requirement, she bluntly denied Cho to accompany Harry in searching for the Diadem.
- Mean: When she doesn't like someone, such as Fleur and Zach Smith, she can be exceedingly nasty. When she gets upset, she can be quite cruel, as her verbal thrashing of Ron showed. That was one of the worst insults of the entire series.
- Powerful: Again, lots of telling but no showing in the Books. We get to see a few times when she knocked out others with her Bat Bogey Hex, but that's basically it. She survived the Final Battle without injuries, I see that as a combination of skills and luck.
- Pretty: Don't get fooled by Emma Watson, Ginny is depicted as a lot more attractive (at least for Harry) than Hermione in the Books.
- Protective: She will go great length standing up and taking care for her friends. Luna is one. Later during the Final Battle, Harry saw her comforting and helping an injured student on his way to the Forbidden Forest.

Canon Ginny is not:

- A slut: If you think having two boyfriends in two years makes one a slut, then it's YOU who are having an issue. For those who think she only used the two boys, it was Hermione's suggestion to begin with. If you want shit on her because of that, at least shit on Hermione at same time. I don't like double standards.
- Lily Evans lookalike: This is in my opinion a huge misconception in the fandom. There is not a single piece of evidence in the Books saying they have physical similarities, even the shades of their red hairs are different. This misconception seems to mostly come from readers in places where red heads are rare. But in Britain, up to 10% of the population can have red hairs. Personality wise, Ginny has far more in common with James than Lily, as both are definitely not sticklers for rules.

Honestly, Books 5 and 6 have done enough for her characterizations. You just need to pay a little attention to excerpts involving her.
