I really like how Ginny is fleshed out in Nightmares of Futures Past, but unfortunately FFN took it down due to spurious copyright claims. You can still find most of it on various sites, and the ebook has up to chapter 43.

Ginny is a main character from the start, plus a lot of the story happens at the Burrow. Opinions are mixed on the ethics of their friendship, since Harry has traveled back in time, merged with his younger self, and is thus arguably much older, but the characterisation of Ginny is spot on IMO.
