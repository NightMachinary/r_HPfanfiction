It depends on what you really think about her. I really like her, even though she is written very poorly in canon (I think, she is probably the worst written main character in all of JKR books), so any good fanfiction has to make a lot of work to finish bad job left behind JKR. I really like stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] (also on [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewuser.php?uid=13604][SIYE]]), who did in my opinion magnificent job in filling her story. There are some other:

- linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) was one of the first fanfiction stories I have read, and I still hold it as my alternative headcanon (with the Northumbrian's one as the main one).
- recently I have discovered linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang), which is what I was talking about: fixing horrible job left behind by JKR in the Half-Blood Prince.
- for AU Slytherin Ginny, which is however very positive for her, read linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) (there are also sequels linkffn(12713008) and linkffn(13143812), but I am not sure about those, they seem to be rather drawn for too long).
