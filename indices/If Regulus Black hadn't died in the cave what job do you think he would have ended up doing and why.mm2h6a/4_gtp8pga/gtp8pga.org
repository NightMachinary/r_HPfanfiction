Personally I see him as really good friends with Severus Snape, they were in Hogwarts together though not the same year, and I see him rubbing elbows with other purebloods and playing the rich, elitist, pureblood games, but in actuality he is passing information over to Severus and helping him spy on the other Death Eaters and Voldemort, making Severus' job a little bit easier and possibly a little bit less dangerous. I think he'd have stood up against Voldemort in the final battle and also tried to help Harry if they ever crossed paths, secretly of course. Dumbledore would've known and trusted him to an extent but probably not unconditionally as with Severus as I really don't see Regulus willingly going underneath someone's thumb especially with how that worked out with Voldemort. But that's my take. He'd have probably tried to reunite with Sirius as well. Whether or not he affected the plot is unknown. I'd like to think he could have perhaps prevented deaths, mainly Fred and Severus' deaths, but of course there is no way to know that.
