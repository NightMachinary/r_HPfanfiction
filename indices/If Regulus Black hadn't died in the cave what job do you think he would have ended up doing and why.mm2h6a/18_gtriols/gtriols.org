He would have been forced to go into hiding, because he destroyed a Horcrux and would have also known that Voldemort would one day return. However, as a rich pureblood with no real common sense to speak of, he couldn't just disappear into the muggle world, because he wouldn't know a rubber duck from a double decker bus.

So I think the clear and obvious answer is that he would have become Stubby Boardman, lead singer of The Hobgoblins, and hidden in plain sight.
