You know if he had lived... And had like functioning magic I think he would have hid out somewhere Trying to destroy the locket and maybe a year or 2 after the war ended voldemort disappears whatever he'd hear a whisper somehow... 1 For some odd reason I think he would end up hiding out in Canada or something because that's where a British people go to disappear for some reason.... So like maybe a year or 2 after voldemort is vanquished he'd Hear whispers of it in some random very isolated magical community in Canada and then actually get information that his brother is supposedly the right hand of voldemort and is Currently incarcerated in Azkaban... Regulus was a death eaters I think he would have known if Sirius was one as well... So I would like to think regulus considering he found himself standing up to the dark Lord somehow eventually I think he would somehow figure out how to get his brother out A few years earlier than Canon it might take a couple to figure out a game plan and maybe brew in a potion but I would say from getting the information and the fact the guy was walburga's favorite with access to a houseelf... Probably somewhere between 1 to 3 years for him to figure out how to do it properly without getting caught and then I can just kind of imagine Sirius being a bit crazy.... Wanting to find Harry... but Regulus Somehow petrifying his brother and dragging him back across the Atlantic with him until hes seen enough healers and regained enough of his sanity to actually be a functioning human without quite the crazy but while still being Sirius.. I'm kind of picturing a lot of heated very Venomous arguments between those 2 over the course of a couple years while they try and figure out where the fuck Peter is what happened and Just deciding Sirius and Regulus Will share the same identity just so they don't have to keep running from the aurors... A bit of poly juice sirius Leaves the house.. So he looks like regulus or perhaps an Uncle or something if they have access to hair of someone else basically I'm kind of seeing the black brothers become very reluctant roommates over the course of a few years while they figure out what the fuck to do in clear Sirius' name... And I'm picturing Sirius Reaching out to Remus by making his brother help him dig a giant bear pit near the woods where Remus is transforming maybe wherever the hell in Great Britain he is and then just mentally picturing in the morning when Remus is stuck at the bottom of a hole bitching and swearing at Sirius Threatening to murder him before regulus cuts in," Will you shut the bloody hell up lupin rah ran betrayal...blah blah James....Kill you... He didn't do it my brothers no death eater I'm the only crazy flucker between the 2 of us that ever swore an oath in that circle jerk of a crazy fucking organization and I've got the mark to prove it. My brothers unblemish batshit crazy and a right tosser but no death eater. Now will you bloody well shut the hell up sit in your pit quietly and listen to him explain everything and if you don't want anything to do with him after we will leave peacefully. And you can crawl out of the hole you're literally in back to your pathetic life of menial labor and barely eating. " But for regulus looks at his brother who somehow barely containing a smile at the dumbfounded expression on Remus's face and says," Now will you bloody well hurry this the fuckup Sirius I'm missing my tela novela Because you made me help you with this ridiculous operation brother."

Before Sirius being an older brother Tells regulus not to get his knickers in a twist before laughing and saying to Remus, " He is right though." And rolling up the sleeve of both his shirt arms rolling up both his shirt sleeves to show clear unmarked for arms beside the few scars from his time in prison.

" I'm no death eater Mooney."

And then he pulled a lunch Box out from behind his back and shakes the clear plastic side of it to show a very terrified rat in it missing the 4th finger on its right front foot .

"And I'm not a killer "

The whole morning I would expect go rather unpleasantly for Remus who as we all know just want a good cup of tea and a nap after an unpleasant nighttime Transformation.
