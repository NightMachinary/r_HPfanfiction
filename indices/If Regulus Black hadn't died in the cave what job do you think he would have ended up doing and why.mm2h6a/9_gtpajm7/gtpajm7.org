If he survived it or if he never went?

If he survived it, maybe he would go into hiding or maybe he would keep his death eater position but I like to think he would try to manifest voldemorts down fall. Weither that would mean telling Dumbledore so he'd "finish him" or doing it himself as a turncoat death eater or using house elves and magical creatures to destroy him, etc.
