There are a few factors to consider. Dumbledore vouched for Snape, but he doesn't really know Regulus enough or trusts him enough. The locket-horrcrux thing may remain a secret to the Ministry and unable to be used in a trial. Regulus didn't spy for Dumbledore and there's no evidence of him being near Dumbledore. Regulus might have made more public crimes before turning over, maybe he murdered someone. Do we even know if he "turned over"? For all we know he just wanted to defend his elf and didn't want to join the order. He might still held pureblood ideology.

Of course in a fic this could be handled. But if staying in canon, would require him not murdering anyone and having Dumbledore trusting him instantly and doing good chunk of lying in trial for him.
