I strongly dislike and avoid Dumbledore bashing, but I think he would lie in court with no problem whatsoever.

In case Regulus tells him the entire story, Dumbledore wouldn't want the (presumably) entire Wizengamot to find out about the Horcruxes in a court, or probably anywhere else. He would rather lie and keep that information to himself and do something about it, possibly with Regulus.
