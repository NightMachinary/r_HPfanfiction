  Do we even know if he "turned over"? For all we know he just wanted to defend his elf and didn't want to join the order. He might still held pureblood ideology.

We don't, but we also don't know if Snape really turned over. Snape's loyalty to Dumbledore stemmed first from wanting to protect Lily thanks to the dumbass mistake Snape made, then because Voldemort would kill him if he knew he was a traitor.

Regulus probably did have remnants of pureblood supremacy in him, but him first attempting to help kill Voldemort, and also being able to give Dumbledore important info(Dumbledore didn't know Riddle had Horcruxes for sure, just guessed) should be enough. That of course all hinges on whether Regulus does go to Dumbledore, or if he just goes into hiding with Kreacher
