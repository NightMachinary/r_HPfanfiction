Real Santa who is maliciously compliant for Draco Malfoy

“Cissy how was I to know that Draco wanted a baby Salamander? He said he wanted ‘something that breathed fire'. I thought these Blast ended skrewits seemed unique and interesting, so I bought him a whole clutch. Who could have known they'd burn down malfoy manner? Not I, thats for sure.
