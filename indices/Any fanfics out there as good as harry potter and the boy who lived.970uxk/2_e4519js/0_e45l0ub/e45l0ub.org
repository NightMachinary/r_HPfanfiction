The story is finally coming into it's own. The first three in my opinion were weak in how closely they followed Canon. For me it was like what was the point? Sure you get to see Harry becoming something awesome, but it's really only a glimpse or two. Those first three years also felt really similar to Prince of Slytherin, just half as long and half as good.

Second year made no sense at all. Harry and his friends figure a lot of things out in February and then nothing until near the end of the school year just like in Canon? Infuriating.

Not really a fan of Dumbledore or James in this story either. The author wants those characters to be seen as evil and wrong but it's done so poorly that it's hard to take the author seriously.

Regardless of the faults I still find it pretty interesting and it helps that the author updates consistently. There have been lots of hints about things not really being what they seem and of course I want to see how powerful Harry gets.
