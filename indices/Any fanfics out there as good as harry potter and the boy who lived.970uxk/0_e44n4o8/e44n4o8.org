linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) is what I'm going to give you. And yes I'm reccing it again, as it deserves all the love I can give it. Harry is certainly competent, his DADA professor allowed him to skip all normal classes and personally sparred with him. The result of one of his duels caused countless deaths and the destruction of London.He views friends as tools, his interactions with Hermione in 1st year assure us of this. No decided pairing, although if there is it will likely be either Aenor Rose (OC) or Daphne.

This fic is very AU, Voldemort does not exist (thus far) in this fic. After Grindelwald fell the Pillars, a group of light pureblood families took over the political scene. Harry is a Black, and the Blacks have falled from grace, but retain much of their power. The most promising currently updating AU in the fandom, the lethifold arc was nothing short of incredible.
