I just gave this a try....Daphne in this story is truly a Trainwreck. Why is she groping him (they are cousins) and laughing (for no reason) and screaming at people (for no reason) and sobbing (for no reason) all in one sitting?? She does all of these things during one meal, cycles through a few of each, actually.

At the risk of sounding harsh, there's no way I'll be able to continue if she doesn't get killed off--like before the second chapter she is in ends. The characterization of Daphne is REALLY at odds with how interesting and reasonable every other character was. How upsetting.
