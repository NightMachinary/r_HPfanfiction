The worst part for me is that it's only 'okay' because she is a girl. If a male character did that we'd all be very concerned that Harry was about to be raped or something and it would be pretty dark (and still make no sense). Since she's a girl her emotions apparently are just that way and her predatory behavior is played for laughs. So not cool.
