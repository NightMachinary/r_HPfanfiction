I think my main distaste is his near crippling fear of the fairer sex..sure as a young sheltered teen it's quite understandable if he's not not exactly some ladies man or whatever but this phobia of his is a liitle disturbing and daphne personality doesn't really help matters. I'll still continue to read till I'm done as it's quite well written and the author has obviously put a lot of thought into this story, but my hype is slowly whittling away.
