Like, abstract power levels, or literal ones?

HP certainly has power /tiers/ - Dumbledore and Voldemort eclipse everyone else in raw magical power/ability, then there are a lot of people described as 'powerful' in magic that would be under them, and then there's a bunch of people that are much worse.

But if he meant 'Dumbledore has a Magic Indicator Rating of 323,186,253 - good enough for the 3rd strongest mage in Britain', that's kinda dumb lol.
