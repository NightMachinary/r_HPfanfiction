Power levels in general. Remember it was before fanfiction was even a thing. Back then a wizard was just as powerful as any other wizard, the only question was skill and even that was murky (Dawlish, Fudge, Umbridge etc.). Most wizards, even Voldemort, in the books didn't show any amazing magic apart from Dumbledore (the arrest scene in OotP).
