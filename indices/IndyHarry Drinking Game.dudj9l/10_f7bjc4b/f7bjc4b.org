This whole list of comments made me laugh so hard. I think you've hit nearly every cliche (and I should know, I've read a crazy number of these fics). Except maybe "Harry is miraculously great at potions after all, Just Like His Mother, and Snape becomes His Biggest Fan because of it." Because naturally Harry is Actually Totally Slytherin. That feeds into the overall theme of "all the Death Eaters are actually good and Just Misunderstood." Which isn't a theme of *all* indy!Harry stories, but quite a few.

ETA: I hope your hangover is not too terrible and you have water and are taking care of yourself.
