Jesus Christ on a stick. I mean, you're not wrong. I just never really get far enough into the stories to get to these.

Although the story I'm about to abandon has sex magic, and I'm quickly running out of Cola, and having to mix my Rum with Squash.

My next story have Harry being raised by Tony Stark. It looks terrible. Can't wait.
