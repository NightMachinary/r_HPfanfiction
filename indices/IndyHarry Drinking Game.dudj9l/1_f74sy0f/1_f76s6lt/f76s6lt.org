Make sure Harry doesn't take a lemon drop because Dumbles has poisoned them with truth/obedience/compulsion potions of some sort.

Also Harry takes in Dobby and every other house elf on te planet because he treats them nicely. Dobby also gives super wierd names to everyone Harry meets and calls Harry something rediculous like 'The Great and Kind Master Harry Potter Sir'.

You also cannot forget Harry's little visit to the chamber of secrets and selling the basilisk for $999,999,999,999,999 because there hasn't been a basilisk in a thousand years. Then we get all the ancient books that Harry finds in the secret room if the chamber that Voldemort never saw.

Lets not forget that every woman Harry meets has the biggest set of tits you have ever seen and they all join his harem.
