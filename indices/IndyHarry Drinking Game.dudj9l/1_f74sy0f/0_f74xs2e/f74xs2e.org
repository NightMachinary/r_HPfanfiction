Lemon drops are omnipresent whenever Dumbledore is involved, whether he's manipulative or just your "typical" normal Dumbledore. He'll /always/ offer it whenever someone ends up in his office, whether they're about to be expelled for some heinous action or made a great service to the school. Honestly, this has never really bothered me -- hell, I'd probably be a bit thrown off if it /wasn't/ there.
