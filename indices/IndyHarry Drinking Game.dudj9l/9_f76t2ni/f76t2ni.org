i've really only liked 1 fic where harry gets a snake and he does end up with daphne in that fic, but it's not his first relationship (the first as an OC harry met in america) and it had a decent enough plot to it i didn't mind some of the cliches (cliches are not bad afterall, only if overused in a single story are they bad)
