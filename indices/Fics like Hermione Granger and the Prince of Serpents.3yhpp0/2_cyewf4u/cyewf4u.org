There's a fic I just reread where Hermione is extremely manipulative and cunning, but because she was in Gryffindor, no one expects her of anything. Shes still a good guy, but she has an "ends justify the means" outlook on it. It's got some elements of intrigue and is quite long but I thought it was excellent.
