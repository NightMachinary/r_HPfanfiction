Practice makes perfect. It's also ill advised to start with your dream story. The amount of rewriting you will have to do because your skill is rapidly increasing from total noob to sub par will be enormous and suck all the motivation out of you. I recently wrote the first chapter of my "epic" (and my first chapter ever) and posted it on the dlp forum. Man was I proud of that chapter and oh man was that chapter objectively garbage. If you want to write your epic like I do, I suggest you join the dlp forum and post scene by scene in your own WBA thread and have people help you out by pointing out why you suck dick at it :). That way you will steadily churn out your story scene by scene until one day you are done.
