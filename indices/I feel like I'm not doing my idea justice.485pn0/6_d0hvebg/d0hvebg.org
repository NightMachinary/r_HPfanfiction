  but I actually think it would have pretty broad appeal if it was well-written

Then you'll just have to write it well, won't you? It will be bad at first, of course. All writers are when they begin. But the more you write, and the more you study /how/ you write and /why/ that writing is good or bad, the better you'll get.

  The other thing is that I'm so busy with my family and work that I really don't have time to do it justice. It makes me sad that this epic will probably always live in my head.

Not to be callous, but with that attitude, it /will/ always live in your head. There are a great many quotes about finding time to write, and they all boil down to this: You don't find time to write, you /make/ time to write. If there is a single hour in your day that you spend luxuriously on yourself, /that is time to write/.
