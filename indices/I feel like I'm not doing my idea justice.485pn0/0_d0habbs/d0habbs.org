Only too well.

I'm writing an outrageously long story. On the plus side, the novel format allows the author to take their time in creating interesting characterizations and laying intricate hooks for future plot developments. On the other hand, one minor change means having to go through the /entire/ story to look for any possible conflicts.

Sometimes the level of detail is what makes a story interesting to write. Other times it's the reason to walk away.

Edit: phrasing
