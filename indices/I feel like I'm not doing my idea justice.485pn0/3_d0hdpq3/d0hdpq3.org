  There's so many things to consider and when I actually put words to page it just doesn't feel like what I'm writing is good. I feel like I have this grand idea of a really fantastic fic but I'm not doing it justice.

  I wish I was a skilled enough writer to put it into words.

You have it all planned and worked out. You're concerned about the quality of your writing. That puts you ahead of like 99% of fanfiction writers. No one is expecting fanfiction to be perfect and it sounds like the only thing holding you back is your lack of confidence. I'd say go for it! It's not like you have to finish.

You haven't mentioned anything about your actual story, but I already know I wouldn't mind reading it. If you find the act of writing it a fun thing to do with your spare time, what's the harm trying?
