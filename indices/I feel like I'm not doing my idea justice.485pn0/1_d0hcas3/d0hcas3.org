This kept me from writing the story I'm working on now for three years.

What finally got me moving was the realization that, because I had so much of the thing outlined and plotted out, there was nothing wrong with me just starting to write any scene I wanted to at any moment. No order, no compulsion to finish what I write, just writing---with the files organized in roughly outline order. I got 20,000 words into the story that way, just writing scenes and bits of scenes and snatches of conversation with no guide except what I was excited to write that day.

As it turned out, a lot of my plot points didn't quite work once I finally wrote them---among other things, I had a character vanishing twice in a half an hour to facilitate two similar but not identical scenes, and a lot of scenes didn't quite make sense in the order I had them. A lot of the scenes I'd kept myself putting off for later, because I wasn't excited about them, turned out to just be bad ideas; once I had written the "exciting" scenes around them, it was easy to see how to replace them.

But because I'd tricked myself into writing so much of it already, it was easy to a) see those problems and b) reorganize and revise what I'd written to fit. You'll leave the outline more than you expect, but once you're actually writing that doesn't feel so bad. (And the changes rarely affect the germ of the idea that made you want to write it so badly.)
