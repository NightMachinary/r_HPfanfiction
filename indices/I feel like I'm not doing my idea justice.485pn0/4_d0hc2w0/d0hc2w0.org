Yup. Definitely get that feeling when writing long fics. One thing that's worked for me is being willing to detour from the spreadsheet a bit. More organic interactions arise when I do that. So do the little details that really flesh out a story. If I'm just writing to get from plot to plot, the story lacks life. Of course, when I do that, I end up having to record the new details just in case they're throwing something else off. It is time-consuming and can seem hopeless. I have to take breaks now and then, which is why I like working on two stories at the same time (more if I'm throwing short stories in too.) I can switch back and forth and avoid burning myself out on one idea.
