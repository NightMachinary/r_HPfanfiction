I dedicated all my writing time to an epic once, unfortunately i didn't like the way i was taking it and gave up.

The premise and certain scenes held promise but i just couldn't portray it as my mind's eye held it and i think that's the hardest thing i've faced as a budding writer. I think people who can articulate plot elements with the true force of feeling behind them are the ones who are always the best writers , if you can't manage that then your writing seems dry and without life and that might be the most horrible thing i've had to deal with ; not being satisfied with how you're showing your own fantastical and vibrant idea to others.

It's like having a movie be in Oculus Rift-esque reality and turning out as a plain 2-D movie when you're finally done filming it.

Writing is a very time consuming and somewhat wholly encompassing hobby. When you have an idea like that hours , days and weeks pass just perfecting it in your head. Then planning it all out and finally getting around to writing it ; it takes a lot of effort and not everyone is willing to dedicate all of that time , i certainly wasn't.

But it's not all doom and gloom , one of the best feelings in the world is when you write down a story you've had in your mind and have people understand and go through the same feelings you did while you experienced it for the first time ; that's why i write.
