[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): After his little excursion into the SW universe, Harry got magnitudes powerful. Hermione and Luna literally threw themselves at him, while Ron and Ginny became his loyal 'minions'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Harry is very ambitious, manipulative, and powerful in this fic. Even though he fell out with Ginny, he remained extremely close with all of them, and they all gave him good advice in dealing with Daphne.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Harry grew very powerful and politically savvy in the 2nd half of the story, and their friendship became even stronger.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]], linkffn(5270746): Fairly typical indy!Harry fic with lots of cliches, but Ron, Hermione, and even Molly remain close to him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): They grew dark and powerful together. Best of my recommendations in this thread.
