Couldn't get through the first chapter unfortunately.

Not that I'm a paragon of grammatical accuracy, but there were too many simple errors that made the fic painful to read.

Edit: Missed the edit by the OP. I'll push through and see if it gets better.

Edit2: Five chapters in. It didn't get any better unfortunately.
