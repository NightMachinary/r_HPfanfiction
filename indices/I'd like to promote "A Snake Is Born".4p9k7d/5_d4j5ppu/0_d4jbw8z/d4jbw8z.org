Oh dear, first person...

Other problems: Harry is MIA for a whole year but Dumbledore organises a stand in. This is such a cop out. Clearly the author wanted to fast forward to book four without changing cannon at all.

Also /"I smiled innocently and tried to channel my inner Schwarzenegger."/ why would Hary make this reference? How would he be familiar with The Terminator?
