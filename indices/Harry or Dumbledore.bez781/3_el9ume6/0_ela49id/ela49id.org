When Lupin met Sirius in the Shack, Harry had already told him about seeing Peter Pettigrew on the map. And he saw them enter the secret passage on the map so he saw the name too. Add to this that he probably knew about Scabbers (since Hermione and Ron did have some pretty loud arguments in the castle about this and Harry may have mentionned it during their Patronus lesson) and he already knew or heavily suspected what had truly hapened.
