Lupin was on the outs with the Order because they suspected him of spying. He had no idea that Sirius's dog form was relevant in any way, and had every reason to believe that there was no way for him to get into Hogwarts. He didn't immediately kill Sirius because Harry and co. were also in the room and potential casualties, and was willing to hear Sirius out to keep him talking.

And, of course, what Sirius wound up saying made plenty of sense. He hadn't murdered Harry on sight, so there was that in his favor. Plus, he would have wanted to have his friend back.
