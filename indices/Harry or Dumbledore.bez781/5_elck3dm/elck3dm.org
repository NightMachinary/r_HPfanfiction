I don't blame Lupin for not contacting Harry as a child. He was a lesser friend it was always James and sirius and two tag alongs. I have 5 friends since childhood but one of them is my best friend beyond everyone else's. But that's not the point of this thread the point is he would've never done anything that would've disappointed Dumbledore. He put Harry put in more danger because he was afraid of disappointing Dumbledore.
