Lots of Lupin-hate in this thread. People like complicated and multi-faceted characters that say something about the human condition, and sometimes that means people like characters that don't always make the right choices and who have pretty big issues. I think he's a brilliant character because of his flaws. He is consistent in his cowardice and he is wracked with guilt and self-loathing. He's more than the perfect teacher we thought he was in PoA, perhaps many people never shed that impression of him, and so when they are faced with the real character, they feel lost and disappointed that he not as ideal as they thought? He seems to me a perfect candidate to be someone's favorite character.
