This is exactly it. At least I think it is. People are shocked that lovely teacher actually has serious flaws. I've seen people complaining that Remus in DH was out of character. Others said that Remus in HBP was too depressed and why on Earth was he so emotional when Dumbledore died. We get a character with flaws that are obvious and he doesn't always make the right choices, we complain. We get a character who does and says all the right things, we shout Mary Sue. There's no winning here, I'm afraid. There's also the fact that team Harry is ready to find everyone who has wronged Harry and punish them, and Remus is a very good candidate. I sometimes wonder what those people would have done if they had lived the way he did. Like one elderly lady said recently, it's easy to talk about nobility when your stomach and wallet are full. Sorry for my pointless rambling, but I think you are right about people not liking that Remus the teacher didn't do all the right things. The same goes for wise Dumbledore.
