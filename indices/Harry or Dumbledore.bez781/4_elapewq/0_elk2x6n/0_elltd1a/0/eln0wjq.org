I don't know if its selfish. I think we just tend to defend things we like and with fictonal characters it can get very personal, especially if we identify with them. I don't think Dumbledore is the only one who gets this. Snape gets it all the time! I've seen some very negative comments about Molly too. But it's always the same- he/she didn't do what I thought was right, so I dislike that character. I mean, I understand the dislike because it's such a common reason for choosing your favourites and the ones you dislike. I think with fictional characters it ends up being personal anyway. But it sometimes seems strrange that people can't understand why others like characters they don't. It's as if it's impossible to like a character with flaws.I've seen the opposite result too. I commented once that I wasn't as fond of Sirius as others seemed to be since he reminded me too much of Byronic heroes from classic novels. There were a few people who said they were glad they weren't the only ones who weren't Sirius's fans. But I got comments from those who did like him, and I felt as though they thought I was a little odd for not appreciating his tragedy and his good qualities. I do appreciate them, but I just find other qualities I dislike. It seems to me that one has to follow a common trend. In this fandom it's hating Snape and liking Sirius.And if you don't, everyone is surprised. Sometimes it feels like some characters have to go to something resembling that Harry's hearing and readers sit there as judges. But that might be because I've seen some very angry comments. It almost seemed like those characters were real people who had done the reader some great personal wrong. As for Remus, though, it seems a bit strange to me when those who dislike him point out his flaws and then are surprised others like him. Do they think we haven't noticed those flaws? We read the same books after all. I mean, no one would like him or other characters if they were completely immoral murderers or something. But no, maybe they would.But I don't think we have to as if justify our preferences. I mean, I'm often curious, for example, why people like Bellatrix. But with Remus and Snapeit becomes something like,'how dare you like him'. I'm tempted to suggest they analyse those characters or something. I know I read some posts about Dumbledore to understand him better. As for Dumbledore, team Harry is still powerful and I think they are the ones who dislike him the most.Someone made a post which said Vernon wanted Harry to get out in OOTP because he realised his family was in danger. The author got the usual comments about the Dursleys being horrible and how Vernon didn't think Harry was his family too. So, to sum up this long strange post, like characters others like, hate those universaly hated, talk ill about the Dursleys, then you are safe.
