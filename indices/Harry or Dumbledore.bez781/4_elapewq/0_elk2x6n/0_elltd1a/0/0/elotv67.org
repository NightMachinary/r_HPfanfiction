Hahaa, yes, team Harry. I've never given it a name, but it sums it up perfectly. There always has to be a bad guy. Snape is a perfect example from both perspectives because I have seen people sympathize with Snape at the expense of Dumbledore; for some reason /one of them/ must be bad and the other good, and it is often suggested that Snape was forced to work for Dumbledore when Dumbledore asked the words "and what will you do for me?". As offended as I am for what this means for Dumbledore, I actually think I'm more offended for what this means for Snape. More than once I have seen the word "shackled" used, but if Snape doesn't make the /choice/ to join Dumbledore, then what the hell is the point of these books anyway? Themes? Motifs? Why analyze /those things/. Time also doesn't apparently exist, because if Snape /is ever good/, then Dumbledore ought to have known it all along.

That's why I loved the rankdowns so much. Moose did such a great job enforcing critical thinking, and nobody was ever criticized for showing sympathy for dark and evil characters. In fact, whether or not they were good or evil took a backseat to the other far more important aspects of a character like depth and internal consistency.
