Yes! Exactly! Remus would not have chosen either of them over Dumbledore.

He had nothing to do with Harry during his ‘childhood ‘, he wanted to abandon his own son...

Refused to talk to Harry about his parents until almost forced

And unlike Sirius, Remus never even wrote to Harry

Ignored him being locked in his room in OOtP ....

Shit person, spineless and a deadbeat father/uncle

One of my least liked characters
