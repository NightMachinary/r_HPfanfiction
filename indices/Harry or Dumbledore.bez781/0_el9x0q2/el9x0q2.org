I always found some of JKs characters really difficult to imagine IRL. Lupin being one of them. Bit spineless throughout.

Odd he was â€˜such a good friend of theirs' but had relatively little to do with Harry prior to arriving to teach. Even during third year it took him awhile to even start engaging with Harry properly. Relatively small interactions thereafter but, by the last book Harry is his child's god-parent. He struck me as overly staged and unrealistic. If he was real he'd either be better or worse. Not a wishy washy middle ground character who's somehow equally close and distant to Harry simultaneously.
