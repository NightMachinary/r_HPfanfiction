One of the problems we have about this story is that it is told from Harry's eye, we don't know what happened before so maybe Remus did try to meet Harry but Dumbledore refused for security reasons.

And Remus Lupin is a character that often wallow himself in self guilt. He probably wanted to meet Harry, but had tens of contradictory thought like what would happen if a monster like him met Harry, what if Harry hated him or even how to say him that part of the reasons Sirius Black could betray his parents was because they suspected HIM to be a traitor. . .

I don't know if the character of Lupin is well fleshed because honnestly, considering the life he had (had a dangerous disease who make people hate him, still managed to go to school because one guy hide his disease and invited him, found some true friend there but they thought he was a traitor and died partly because of it not to mention years of poverty) I doubt I would ever met anyone in the real world who could serve as a comparaison.
