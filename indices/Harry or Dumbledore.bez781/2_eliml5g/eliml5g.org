Well, and I don't understand why people here hate him so much. And the one person who, in my opinion, explain why people find it hard to like him got downvoted. What a surprise. I like Remus because he isn't perfect, just like me. I like him because I can relate to him on a personal level. I like him because in spite of how he is treated by society, he remains a kind and compassionate person. I admire him for this because I can't be like that. Yes, he didn't tell Dummbledore about Sirius and put Harry in danger. He admits it was cowardice. Fear of losing the trust of a person who gave him a chance of a lifetime. Selfish? Certainly. But many people are selfish. How complex would Remus be if he had made all the right choices? He would be too perfect and too boring. How many people do you know who always do the right thing. Remus ends up high on HP rankdowns due to his complexity.He also has a way with children. Any character who has a way with kids is bound to be my favourite. He is also very perceptive. I can't make you like him, nor would I want to do that because its your own business. But people like Snape as well and he isn't the nicest person. All in all, people like characters who are human, who make mistakes like any other person, who feel fear, anger, jealousy. Given the life Remus lived, I'm not surprised by his behaviour. Just like with real people, we often find it easy to judge others and feel morally superior even though we have not lived that person's life, but analysing fictional characters helped me understand this. I hope that answers your question. Remus is my favourite HP character.
