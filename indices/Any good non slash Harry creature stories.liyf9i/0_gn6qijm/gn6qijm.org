I swear there was a near-identical thread to this one, not even 2 days ago.

+Also, you should flair this as a Request, not a Recommendation - the latter is for when you have a fic you want to recommend.+ EDIT: This has been done, so strikethrough'ed.

Both of those things out of the way, one of the few Creature!Harry fics I know of that doesn't devolve into a poorly written slashfic is The Beast Within.

Harry is a werewolf, there's canon pairings with very minor soulmate-type stuff. Sadly the sequel's been 'on hiatus' for about 4 years now.
