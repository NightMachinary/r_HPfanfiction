The curse was not broken until Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom went back for their eighth year. Neville still has nightmares about dripping basilisk venom laced Ink onto the floorboards of the head students dorms every night for a week. It was a ridiculous solution but it was either that or have Ron Weasley and Harry Potter after his head on a silver platter. Neville didn't particularly fancy dating hermione either she was a wonderful friend but not particularly his type So the ridiculously laborious curse breaking method had to be implemented.
