Interesting. I'll have a little prompt, if I'm allowed.

So, this Harry hasn't let Ron's bad habits infect him. He's found that he was best at defense against the dark arts. While studying it, he stumbles upon curse breaking, and finds that he likes solving the mysteries that are curses and wards, he finds it simulating. Soon, he becomes passionate about it.

Arrives year 7. Voldemort, aware of the curse on the head boy and girl, decide to meddle again. He'll have Harry made head boy, and the daughter of a sympathizer made head girl, this way, it will be easy for him to deal with Harry.

As he realizes having the daughter of one of his close subordinates do it would be too obvious, he uses blackmail or other methods to use Daphne Greengrass instead.

So we have Harry, who decided to break this curse but has to balance it with his new duties as head boy, and Daphne, trying to escape the clutches of Voldemort and keep her neutrality. Draco is ordered to keep an eye on Daphne. Then Daphne's friends decide to "protect" her from harry, and Ginny starts becoming jealous.

So now everything's in place for Harry's, Daphne's and Voldemort's plots to clash horribly with each other, while Dumbledore's meddling and Draco's nonsense only make things worse.

Amongst all that, Harry still has to keep up in the competition with his rival from first year, one Hermione Granger.
