Okay, but even if 5% is gay, you only need 1 out of 2 of the students to be gay. So it's not 15% of head students, it's 15% of pairs have at least one gay head student. Only one needs to be gay for the curse to fail. So that's needing half as many to be gay. So about 7.5%. Still perhaps a bit disproportionate to the general population, but not overly so and maybe other factors influence the behaviour of gay students at Hogwarts, leading them to act in a way that makes them more likely to be chosen as head boy or girl.
