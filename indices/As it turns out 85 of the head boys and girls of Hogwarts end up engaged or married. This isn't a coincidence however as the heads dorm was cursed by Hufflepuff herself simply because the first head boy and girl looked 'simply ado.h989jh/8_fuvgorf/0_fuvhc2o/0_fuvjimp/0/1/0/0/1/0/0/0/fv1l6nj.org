It would be true if the curse only worked one time or two (ok even 10 times, why not) but this curse has been around since the time of the founders, as per OP, so more than a thousand years. If one of the students being gay was the only reason for the curse to fail, after so many instances, probabilities tell us that the failure rate should be close to the part of the population who is gay (see the law of huge numbers). So if 5% of the population is gay, it represents around 5 of the 15% failure rate, which still leaves around 2/3 of it unacounted for. The idea that magic cannot make people fall in love, and thus the curse only creates the conditions to make it happen is a far better explaination. First of all because if magic was able to make people fall in love, I don't see why it would care if you're gay or not, It should make you fall in love anyway. The absurdly high 85% success rate is then a testament to how powerful a witch Hufflepuff was. Or, again, you could have more gay in the magical world, but having multiple causes instead seems more interresting.
