15% gay students ? I don't think so. Unless it's different with magicals, gay is about 3 to 5% of the population, iirc, maybe even less. It doesn't add up.

Edit: After checking, it appears I was wrong. It appears homosexuality is about 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female's. Doesn't change the point, though.
