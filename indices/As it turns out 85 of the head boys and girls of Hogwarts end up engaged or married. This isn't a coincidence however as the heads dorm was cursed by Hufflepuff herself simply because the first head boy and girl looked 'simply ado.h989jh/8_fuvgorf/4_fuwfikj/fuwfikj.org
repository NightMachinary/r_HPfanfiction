It wouldn't have to be a dorm, because I do agree that they didn't and it would be unrealistic that they would have a unisex dorm room. This is the school that has wards up to keep the opposite sex out they wouldn't have a boy and girl share a private sleeping area together.

But they do have the prefects bathroom, so they could have other things. Like a study room, or an office for the the Headboy and girl and if it was cursed it might do cool things like the room of requirements so they would use it all the time. Like your studying hard and a snack appears when you get hungry. Only eventually the room sneaks stuff in for it's agenda. (Evil laugh)
