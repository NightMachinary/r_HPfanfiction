Some years ago, a teacher from my town forced a young girl (maybe 8 or 9) to eat peanuts. Problem was, the girl was allergic, even had a note from the doctor. The kid didn't died, but it was a close thing. Another teacher (same town) tore off half the ear of another kid, if you can imagine that. I won't even talk about teachers knowingly leaving kids to be bullied, or even harrassing some of them themselves or picking on them to settle accounts with the parents (one of my friend ended up threatening a teacher with death before his disabled child finally got some protection from the kids who were punching him almost daily). I don't remember cases of children being sexually mollested by their teacher but it's still all too common.
