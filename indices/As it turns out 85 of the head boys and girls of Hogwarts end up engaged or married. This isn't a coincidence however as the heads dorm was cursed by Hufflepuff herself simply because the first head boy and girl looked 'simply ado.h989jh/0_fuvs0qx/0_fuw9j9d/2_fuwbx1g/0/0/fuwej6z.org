To me, that is so incredibly unprofessional, and crosses the boundaries between student/teacher in a huge way. I am an instructor at a university, so my students are all adults, and I would /never/ think I had any right to meddle with their personal affairs like that.

My mind is blown, lol. Some people just don't understand minding their own business.

Edit: great username, btw
