really i think 7th year redo fics letting everyone who stayed at Hogwarts continue up is just absurd. for at least a couple of months a number of DA members weren't attending classes and were basically waging a guerrilla campaign against the Carrows. No good teacher would think that 70% of a school year where half the classes were just anti-muggle propaganda is acceptable.

oh wait "good teacher" i can see where this theory might fall apart in fanon. But still, at least me personally in 7th year redo fics everyone would redo their 97/98 year if they chose to return, or at least they would be required to pass a competency check of some sort to be allowed to advance as normal.
