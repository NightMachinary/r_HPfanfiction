Snape, rather strangely, was the person who could obtain the most from Dumbledore. Just look at the shit he pulled all of his career. Maybe Dumbledore was feeling guilty about all he had Snape go through (including giving away his life, ultimately), but the idea of Snape obtaining his own prefects isn't absurd. McGonagall, however had a strong tendency to follow Dumbledore, even against her better judgement (I'll just cite Harry's dropping at the Dursleys at the start of first book to make my point).
