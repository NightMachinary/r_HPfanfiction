In my opinion a lot of the Draco romance just seems to be projection. Hermione though is just a character I've never really liked, in canon at least. My biggest problem with the whole redemption stuff for Draco is that it was unlike Snape where Draco was basically taught it, and even then it wasn't much his fault as he didnt know what else to think. That's my whole problem with a lot of redemption arcs in fanfiction, is that it either doesn't address this, or does it terrible in my opinion.
