Can't speak for the person you're responding to, but as someone who isn't a fan of Dramione but is pretty okay with Pansy/Harry, it mainly boils down to a few things.

- One, Pansy's not a racist asshole towards Harry, so we don't have as many instances of her yelling insults about his blood as we do with Draco and Hermione, where Draco keeps dropping slurs at her.
- Two, Pansy's just not around as much, so there's less negative stuff with her from canon. There's just less specific examples of her being a shit. Hell, in DH her most shitty thing is...being a 17 year old who doesn't want to die. I know we're supposed to hate her for that but...eh?
