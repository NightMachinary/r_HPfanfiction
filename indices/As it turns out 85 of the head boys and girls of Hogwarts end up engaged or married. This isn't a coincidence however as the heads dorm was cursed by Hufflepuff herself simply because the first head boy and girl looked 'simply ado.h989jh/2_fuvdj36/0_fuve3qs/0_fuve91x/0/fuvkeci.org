I've read a few harry/pansy fics. It's not my thing but they were fairly ok reads. Haphne works really well to. My personal spin on this was going to be a Neville is the chosen one and Harry isn't. Or a post seventh year return fic with daphne being head girl because hermione is tracking down her parents or is otherwise indisposed/dead.
