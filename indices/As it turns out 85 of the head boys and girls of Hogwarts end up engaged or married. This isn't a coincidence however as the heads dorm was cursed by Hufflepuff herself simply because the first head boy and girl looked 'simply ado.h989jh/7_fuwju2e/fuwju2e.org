I wonder if the 15% of the time that it doesn't work is because one or both of the heads a) are gay/lesbian, b) are asexual/neutered, c) have a non-human heritage that makes them only compatible to someone else who also has that same heritage, d) a set soulmate(s), e) couldn't get engaged because they were already engaged before they became a head, or f) died before they could.
