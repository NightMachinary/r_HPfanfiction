This is pretty great.

Firstly, Heads dorm makes sense. While we don't know exactly what the Head Boy and Head Girl /did/ (at least, I don't remember a book saying what they did or even mentioning who had the roles after Percy left) if we assume that they're above Prefects but below Professors it makes sense that you'd want them staying somewhere outside of the House dorms. Both for the appearance of neutrality and so the Prefects of other Houses could speak to them.

And also, having it be Helga Hufflepuff who did the curse avoids any of the weird Professor manipulation undertones of some of these fics by having them be as exasperated as any of them.
