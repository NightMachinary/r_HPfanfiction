Sorry, but head dorms don't make sense at all. If you're running a school, you don't give the kids a special dorm to themselves to shag in, I can't imagine the parents would be happy.

Head Boy and Girl just seem to be ultra-prefects, and prefects don't get a dorm to themselves, they're there to lead the student population and they need to be among them to do that, not set apart in a show of "muh authoritah!" There was no mention of Percy living elsewhere, he was still hanging out in the Gryffindor common room.

The Head dorm room concept is just some fanfic nonsense for romance and reluctant romance fics. No teacher or headmaster would think it was a good idea. It requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief, and I've yet to read a good fic that featured one.
