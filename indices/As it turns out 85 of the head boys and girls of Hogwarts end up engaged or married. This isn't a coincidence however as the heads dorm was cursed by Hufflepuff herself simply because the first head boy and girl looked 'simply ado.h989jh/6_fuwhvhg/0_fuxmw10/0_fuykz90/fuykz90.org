That reminds me of this one fanfic where it was a retelling of the Apple of Discord in Harry Potter.

Pansy threw the Golden Apple into Slughorn's party, and Harry had to choose between Hermione, Ginny and Luna.

Hermione offered brains, Ginny offered beauty, Luna offered to trade a radish earring for the apple.
