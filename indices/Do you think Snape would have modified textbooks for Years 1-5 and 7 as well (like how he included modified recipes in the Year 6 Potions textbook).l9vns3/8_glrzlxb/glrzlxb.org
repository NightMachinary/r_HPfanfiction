I was at Hogwarts during the 1990's.

Typically, Snape would review the textbook, have students make the potion by the book, and then disdainfully explain why we all sucked.

Then if he was in a smirky mood, he'd explain how we had missed the point of the instructions: “The POINT, Futue, is NOT to add chopped skelander. It is to reduce the receptivity of the mixture to astrological influence. Therefore, you want the JUICE of the skelander. If you had sense, you would know this.”

Thanks a heap, Professor. Thanks a LOT.
