The students used the same potions book for years 1-5, and a different book for years 6-7. Snapemight have kept his potions book from school as a reference for his later years, and when he started teaching, that book became his prescribed textbook. We don't know when he started writing in the margins and modifying the instructions. He had many years after his school years to also change them. Many years also as a potions teacher. When you are a student, I am guessing you get to only make a certain potion once as a student. But when you are a teacher, and you teach potions year after year, you have many more chances for iterative improvements after researching the theoretical knowledge about the ingredients, their compositions and how they interact with other ingredients. So I gather Snape compiled his modifications over many years of iterative improvements.
