I am of the belief that he did modify every recipe - maybe not as a student, but after he became a master. If you notice in the books, he never has the class follow the process/ingredients list from the book, he always puts everything on the board.

Edit to add, because reading is hard: I think more than modified recipes for younger years, it's more likely filled with questions. “Why do I need to dice instead of mince?” “What happens if I stir 28 times instead of 30?”
