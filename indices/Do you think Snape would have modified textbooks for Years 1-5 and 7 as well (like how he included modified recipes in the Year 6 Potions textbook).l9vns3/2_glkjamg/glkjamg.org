As someone who defaces my textbooks, there are a few factors in which ones get my brilliant annotations.

1. Intro level texts are less likely, for a lot of reasons, but 2 in particular. First, they rarely need as many revisions. Then, if there's any chance I'm going to sell it for use by a future student, I keep it pristine using sticky notes while I'm studying. In Snape's case, he might have expected to need the money in order to afford the next book.

2. If it's a reference book among my specialties, I'm much more likely to keep it and write in the margins, especially when I disagree with something in the listings or have another source to reference (e.g. "check [other book] for more on this"). This feels more like Snape's /Advanced Potion Making/ book. He might have done something similar with the Charms or Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook, BUT it looks like he put his innovative spells in the /Potions/ book, so maybe not. As for the Year 1-5 text, since it /is/ a lot like a reference with lots of recipes, maybe he /would/ keep it and have some notes, but I would expect dramatically fewer "improvements" than the advanced book. Unsure about the notes unrelated to Potions.

3. Writing in them isn't the only thing you can do to make your books more useful. If the book is absolutely massive, I might just take an exacto knife and /slice out/ each chapter as I need it. I'll either use a binder clip or three-hole punch it or some other way to make it more manageable, and then I can clip/add my essays, assignments, etc to be super organized. This is less common now that so many are /ebooks/ and all my work is digital. But anyway it makes me wonder about the kinds of genius magical study solutions that someone like Snape or Hermione would have come up with.

Good luck with your fic!
