Sure Snape should not expect all of his students to make the same realisations that he did on their own, but he should at least try to teach it. Also while Snape does seem to have a gift for potions, it is also probable that most of his students are hamstrung in comparison as they associate him with the subject and have all of their enthusiasm drained away. Remember, he is literally Neville's worst fear as shown by his boggart, and nobody is surprised by this or finds a problem with it.

Hermione is convinced Harry is cheating because his isn't following the printed instructions to the letter. Part of that would be Hermione being Hermione, but that implies that Snape has been teaching them to follow the set instructions without question. Even if he had been giving them his modified instructions, this is evidently an objectively wrong way of teaching the subject, as shown by Harry's success. I don't expect Snape to teach everyone to make all of the same improvements that he did by themselves, but he should at least made them familiar with the subject.

Starting in first year he could have taken some common versions of the potions they were making, pointed out his problems with the methods and explained why. Lessons and homeworks on specific preparation methods for common ingredients would help students learn what the differences are and the better ones could then extrapolate this knowledge for whatever they are working with. Then maybe later on he could set essays on ways you could try and improve a particular recipe and what specific affect you thing each change would have. Perhaps after he has checked them to make sure it is nothing dangerous, he could even have a few lessons of the students working from their own modified recipes, to let them get a feel for it.

Maybe if he had done all of this, rather than spending all of his effort in class on terrorising Neville, then Harry wouldn't have been the only one to be even aware of the concept of improving book recipes. Also as an aside, Slughorn is a renowned potions master too, so presumably he is also familiar with adapting his own recipes, and yet he never covers it either.
