Your post deals with two separate issues with Snape as a teacher: Snape's class curriculum and Snape's treatment of his students. I'll address them separately because they have nothing to do with one another. Snape's failures as a teacher are personality based. He terrifies Neville and makes him anxious. He's petty with Harry. He is mean to Hermione, but that never affects Hermione's class performance. She still gets top marks and does well. Snape's personality is a classroom obstacle. Some kids, like Hermione, can overcome it, although none should have to. The Slytherins don't seem distressed in class. Teaching is its own skill that goes beyond knowing material. Personally, I would say you need empathy and patience to be a good teacher. These are qualities Snape lacks.

About the boggart in particular, you said it yourself, "nobody...finds a problem with it." The entire class laughs when Neville admits he is afraid of Snape, even Neville grins sheepishly. The scene was written as a comedy: Snape is dressed in drag which everyone laughs at. That isn't to say Snape didn't scare Neville, but there's no classroom intervention by Dumbledore or the rest of the staff. Hogwarts is shown as a tough place. If modern teaching standards were applied, there would likely be a number of staff changes. I'd bet Snape, Hagrid, Trelawney, and Binns would be gone, maybe even McGonagall. After all, Neville at age 11 spends an entire night crying when McGonagall took off a huge number of points in PS/SS. She also punishes him for Sirius' break-in to Gryffindor Tower, although Crookshanks was the one who stole the passwords and Sir Cadogan was the one who let Sirius in.

​

I disagree with your interpretation of the curriculum because it's entirely arbitrary.

  Harry wouldn't have been the only one to be even aware of the concept of improving book recipes

But *Harry reverts back to being a bad potions student once he no longer has the textbook*. That means that Harry wasn't able to carry over anything he learned while he had the book to further lessons in spite of the fact that he spent extra time reading it: "Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks..." *This suggests that the tips aren't so simple that you can use them to extrapolate the concepts or theory behind them*.

  Hermione is convinced Harry is cheating because his isn't following the printed instructions to the letter...follow the set instructions without question. Even if he had been giving them his modified instructions, this is evidently an objectively wrong way of teaching the subject, as shown by Harry's success
#+end_quote

How can Harry's success be proof of objectively wrong teaching when Harry and Hermione are doing the exact same thing: they are both following a set of instructions. The difference is that Harry's instructions are better than Hermione's. We also can't call the method "objectively wrong" because Hermione uses it to brew NEWT -level Polyjuice, a potion we are told adults are reluctant to brew, in her second year of school. If NEWTs, which are competence levels set by the Ministry, show advanced proficiency in a subject and advanced proficiency involves correct brewing, then modifying recipes is something beyond NEWT level.

Furthermore, HBP disproves your idea about Hermione only being able to follow potions recipe with no sense of theory. *HBP explicitly proves Hermione does know potions principles.* Slughorn assigns the class an activity where they have to create an antidote for a poison they select from his collection of phials. Hermione tells Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "It's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry," she said brightly as she straightened up. "*You have to understand the principles involved this time*. No shortcuts or cheats!"

Your views on the curriculum don't line up with what the books show us:

#+begin_quote
  he could have taken some common versions of the potions they were making, pointed out his problems with the methods and explained why
#+end_quote

This is what I mentioned earlier: there is no indication there are problems with any of the recipes before 6th year. Since the potions turn out well whenever the directions are followed (and there are no second set of directions), we have to assume all the directions before 6th year were perfect. As for pointing out problems and explaining why something went wrong, we see him do something like this in OoTP. He assigns Harry an essay on the correct composition of Strengthening Solution, "indicating how and why [Harry] went wrong" with his potion during class. It's implied Snape will grade the essay.

It's hard to make your claim for what Snape should have taught students when we know so little about what he actually taught students. We know Snape lectures because in CoS Hermione learns about the Polyjuice Potion from him. We know he assigned an essay on the properties of moonstone in 5th year and used a textbook called Magical Herbs and Fungi in 1st year, so your idea that students aren't learning about general properties of potions ingredients isn't supported by the books. We know students have some idea of how to prepare certain ingredients because of that scene in PoA when they are shredding roots. Malfoy, with his injured arm, complains that Ron didn't do a good job of cutting them compared to the way Ron cut his own roots.

In addition, there's nothing suggesting Snape had entirely free reign over his classes. At the very least he is limited to teaching the OWLs rubric. We know there is a Ministry curriculum from OoTP and because of 5th and 7th year examinations, so teachers must need to teach according to the material that will be on the exams. Given that Luna's mother died while experimenting with spells, experimentation might be deemed too dangerous for students.
