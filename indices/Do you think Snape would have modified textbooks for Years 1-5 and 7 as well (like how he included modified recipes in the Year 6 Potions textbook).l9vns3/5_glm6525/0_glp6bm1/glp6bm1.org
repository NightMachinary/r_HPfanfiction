  The thing that bugs me about the 'Half-Blood Prince' book is that Snape has come up with all of these subtle alterations and improvements to make potion making easier and more effective, and then failed to teach any of it

I see this passed around a lot and I wonder why because the books make a point that Snape puts the instructions on the blackboard. What's to say his written instructions aren't recipes he modified?

  if he wasn't actively sabotaging his teaching

In OoTP, Umbridge says his class is advanced and he is teaching them advanced material ("Well, the class seems very advanced for their level, she said briskly to Snape's back. "Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that were removed from the syllabus.") He also expects a high pass rate. There's nothing to suggest that Snape is "actively sabotaging his teaching" as opposed to being a jerk in the classroom because that's his personality.

  Yet apparently those few notes scrawled in the margin when Snape was seventeen were enough to let Harry completely outshine all of his peers who had been studying under the same person with years more experience for five years.

Harry uses Snape's book/Snape's teenage notes to outperform everyone else who is following a published textbook. Even Hermione who is top of every class except DADA can't do as well as Harry. The point isn't that everyone in the class sucks because Snape didn't teach them well enough; the point is that teenage Snape was a potions genius.

They aren't "a few notes." HBP implies the opposite: "To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions." At this point, you're using the fact that none of the other kids think to deviate from published instructions and make innovative leaps of logic as to what would improve their potions results as proof that Snape taught them badly. It's not the norm to revise your high school textbooks.
