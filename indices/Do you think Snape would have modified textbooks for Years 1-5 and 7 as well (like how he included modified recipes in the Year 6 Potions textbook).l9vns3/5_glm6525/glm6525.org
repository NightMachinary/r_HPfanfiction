The thing that bugs me about the 'Half-Blood Prince' book is that Snape has come up with all of these subtle alterations and improvements to make potion making easier and more effective, and then failed to teach any of it. Yeah sure, Harry hasn't covered any of the stuff in the book before Snape stopped teaching him potions, but a lot of the stuff seems to be basic principles like how to prepare ingredients and stirring which he could have started teaching from first year, even if it took him until his sixth to work it out for himself. Yet apparently those few notes scrawled in the margin when Snape was seventeen were enough to let Harry completely outshine all of his peers who had been studying under the same person with years more experience for five years.

It would be interesting to see Snape's reaction to seeing what could happen if he wasn't actively sabotaging his teaching.
