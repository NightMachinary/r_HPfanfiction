The two other textbooks that appear as required for the Potions class in the books are: "Magical Drafts and Potions" and "One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi". It's most likely that these two books were used by years 1-5 so I think Snape would have definitely taken notes on them. Not sure if by first year he knew enough about potions to experiment on his own, but probably he did find the Potions class fascinating and wrote down ideas that he heard in class or from Lily (who I believe was also pretty good with Potions) for future reference.

It would be cool though if someone in their first year comes across these two books and awe the entire class with the fact that they are a Potions prodigy.
