"Blind Faith" is a canon compliant fic which starts from the moment that Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters escape from Azkaban. The story focuses on Bella, but there are PoVs from other characters mixed in. It's a surprisingly unique exploration of behind-the-scenes interactions between Voldemort, Bella and the other Death Eaters during books 5 & 6. I enjoyed the way this fic explores the twisted minds of Bella and the Dark Lord. There are many great creepy moments, along with a few surprisingly heartwarming ones.
