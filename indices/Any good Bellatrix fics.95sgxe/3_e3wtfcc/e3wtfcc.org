Not Bellatrix centric, and she only makes a few appearances in it, but the Bellatrix Lestrange we see from the glimpses in linkffn(Dragon Lily) - (which has a fairly decent plot, in spite of the ridiculousness of the pairings and the smut) is by far the most terrifying and deranged I've come across so far.
