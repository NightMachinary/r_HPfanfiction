I don't mind the concept of Horcruxes (Horcurxii? whatever) either, it feels like a variant idea of the Phylactery, which itself is almost always associated with evil magic users (ie: Liches). As for Harry being one or not, I go with him being a pseudo-Horcrux, where Voldemort was originally intending to use baby Harry's skull as a Horcrux (possibly as a trophy showing his defeat of the one destined to destroy him), and had therefore prepared his soul for the creation process before he even arrived at Godric's Hollow. Then, when his body was destroyed by whatever it was that Lily Potter actually did (I can't remember off the top of my head if her final moments were ever elaborated on or not), Voldemort's pre-split soul fragment latched onto the scar on baby Harry's head, while the rest of his non-corporeal form fled for parts unknown.

In my interpretation, there isn't enough to the fragment in the scar to contain any form of consciousness, or to influence Harry's personality by itself (so none of that 'the Sorting Hat wanted to put Harry in Slytherin because of the scar Horcrux' like in canon), and merely grafts into Harry the Parseltongue ability, and providing a way for his mind to be connected to Voldemort, allowing for some emotional feedback and, eventually, glimpses of what the other is doing. Which then in turn leads to Voldemort figuring out a way to send dreams to Harry, because the Dark Lord is crazy smart with magic like that.
