Yeah, Harry was never one to roll over and accept death meekly, no matter how bad the situation was. Have him go out in a blaze of glory instead, and I don't mean some "herpderp supermagic" bullshit.

He's a wizard with a wand, a Firebolt, the Invisibility Cloak and nothing left to lose. Have him die going on a suicide run against the Death Eaters, using every ounce of skill and cunning to sneak behind enemy lines and disrupt their attack. Have him attempt to assassinate Voldemort from behind, only to fail because Voldemort has decades of skill and experience over Harry. Have Harry die in a hopelessly outmatched battle with nothing to save him this time- no Lily Potter, no blood wards, no twin wands or Dumbledore.

Voldemort uses the Elder Wand against Harry and it will not kill it's master, but Voldemort's soul shard is not it's master, despite being attached to Harry. Instead of backfiring, the Elder Wand fires the killing curse like in canon- except it kills the soul shard with Harry merely being collateral damage, thus giving us a logical explanation for the King's Cross Station scene. Now that he's defeated Harry in combat, Voldemort is the true master of the Elder Wand, so Harry can't count on that in the final duel.

Lastly, in the final duel in the Great Hall, Harry manages to verbally unsettle Voldemort enough to expose a weakness in his defenses- not enough for him alone to exploit, but enough for everyone else together to. The Elder Wand is powerful, but it is not unbeatable- especially in the hands of a distracted wizard. Voldemort dies under a hail of spellfire cast by dozens people. Harry's greatest strength throughout the whole series was his friends. Not his strength or his skill or his courage, but his friends- the power of love. Voldemort could never understand risking your life for a friend's, or being willing to do /anything/ to save the ones you love. It's only fitting that his defeat is at the hands of all the people who love Harry.

There. A version of Harry's death that stays true to character while still meshing with canon.
