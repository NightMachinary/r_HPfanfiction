While I don't mind the concept of Horcruxes, Harry being one is just a very stupid plot device. Especially since Rowling made it clear that Harry had to sacrifice himself as opposed to suicide bombing the Death Eater camp or using the invisibility cloak for a hit-and-run ambush.

I get the "sometimes, few have to sacrifice themselves for others to live" sentiment, but then give me some 300-style sacrificial battle with thousands of slaughtered foes where each inch has to be paid for in blood, not "I'll walk there to die".
