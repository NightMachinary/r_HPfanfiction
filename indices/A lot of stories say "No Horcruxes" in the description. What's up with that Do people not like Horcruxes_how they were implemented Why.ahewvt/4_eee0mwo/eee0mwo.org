I don't like the hamfisted way how the Horcruxes are just a way to send our intrepid heroes go on a glorified scavenger hunt visiting exciting locations.

Also I don't like their implementation. People often complain how some fanfictions (for example with Magical Cores) take away the 'mystery' from magic, yet Horcruxes do exactly that to Voldemort and his magical prowess. But that seemed to be a theme for DH considering how boring, technical and mundane the "wand lore" bullshit was.
