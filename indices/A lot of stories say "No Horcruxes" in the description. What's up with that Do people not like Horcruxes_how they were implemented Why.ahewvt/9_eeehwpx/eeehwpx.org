I always felt that horcruxes were a plot device that Rowling ripped off the One Ring.

Only thing is, she has Voldemort, a mortal, make six of them. Even Sauron, a God, had just one.

That's not even going into the absolutely shit martyr walk, and the completely open areas where Voldemort places pieces of his soul. He hides one in the Room of Hidden things because of the connection to Hogwarts, but not one in the Chamber of Secrets, where no one other than a Parselmouth lucky enough to find the entrance has access to. The basilisk in the Chamber would also have made for a far better defence than any of the crap that canon Voldemort uses.
