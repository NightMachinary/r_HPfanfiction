Furthermore, it draws our heroes into a very uncomfortable position. In canon, Death Eaters could be imprisoned or take plea deals, or even repent. In this version, the only way to end the war is the wholesale slaughter of the Death Eaters.

Considering that most of the Death Eater ranks were made up of purebloods (and canon hints that Voldemort had /a lot/ of support from the purebloods), you're looking at what could be considered a pureblood genocide to end the war.

There would be no redemption for Snape, no change of heart for Draco. Only the government- organized murder of a significant chunk of the wizard population.

The socio-political scars that come from something like that would run deep, and that would have to be addressed.
