One alternative implementation of his soul anchors is the Dark Mark. As long as one marked Death Eater survives, he can always come back. He uses up only a tiny fraction of his soul essence for each Dark Mark. Theoretically, he can hundreds, if not thousands of such soul anchors.

Similarly, he can still use objects, but again he uses only a minuscule amount of his soul in each one of them. He would select a mix of artifacts and ordinary items, and hide them in most inaccessible locations around the world.

Under both scenarios, canon Horcrux Hunt would have totally failed.
