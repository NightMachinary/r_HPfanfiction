Mysterious Figure is easy if you remember not to bring more than 4 curagas and the other setup needed to avoid proc'ing his spammy AI, even without spamming Thunder Surge.

It sounds like you don't like HPMoR, and I'm honestly not a huge fan of it either. Your comment about the earlier parts of the fic are unrelated to the issue, though, and the author doesn't forget about the required murder- Quirrelmort is pretty explicit about having killing hundreds of people. But regardless of the context, it does something interesting- it both runs with the Horcrux idea and modifies it in an interesting way, subverting the reader's expectations twice and extrapolating some consequences from that setup. It lets Voldemort actually hide his Horcruxes, but shows that being well-hidden wasn't the perfect solution.

And nothing in canon actually tells us the Horcrux needs to be made right away with the murder. The soul is internal, so my interpretation has always been that it's more that the murder creates a small tear in the soul, and whatever ritual needed to actually create the Horcrux is what fully rips apart a piece and stuffs it into the pseudo-phylactery. Hence why not everyone is walking around with Horcruxes, even if they're mass murderers. It's popular for fanfics to mix it up a bit as well, especially when you have weird deaths (Myrtle, Morfin+the Riddles, Hepzibah Smith) where the murder is either indirect or obtaining the necessary doesn't necessarily allow time for him to "use" the murder straight away. And it's not unfair to assume that Voldemort didn't make multiple Horcruxes before talking to Slughorn- we generally assume that the Diary was first (June 1943), and he also already had the Ring when he talked to Slughorn in the memory according to HBP, so if he didn't actually make a second Horcrux until after that the timeline is more lax.
