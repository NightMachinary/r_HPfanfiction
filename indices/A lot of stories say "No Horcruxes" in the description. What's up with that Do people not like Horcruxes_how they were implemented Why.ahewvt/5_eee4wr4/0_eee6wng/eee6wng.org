I mean, this is one thing I liked about HPMOR- the Horcruxes aren't just soul anchors/phylacteries, they literally need to be found by someone to actually "work" and bring the original person back to life. Or Prince of Slytherin effectively requires the Horcruxes to exclusively be in sufficiently "magical" objects/beings. And for all we know, maybe there's some magic that strengthens his hiding places because they're connected to him, or maybe he literally could /only/ hide Horcruxes in places that were important to him in some way to keep them active.

Basically, you can treat it as "dumb Macguffin," but you can also suspend disbelief and assume that the super powerful evil wizard actually had a general knowledge of what he was doing when he chose the Horcruxes and their place.
