It's not just Horcruxes, though. I'm speaking to a more general tendency where fics will actively try to munchkin something, but where they have to add extra (often non-canon compliant) material to justify their munchkinry.

For example, I see so many fics where it's like "wow Harry here's a book that teaches you Occlumency" and "replacement potions professor teaches you how to modify potion recipes from the start," or "Dumbledore should've done X to prevent Z from happening." To a point, I think those are interesting angles to explore. Snape's a terrible person, and Dumbledore can be hard to dissect but is fundamentally trying to do good.

But many of these are definitely fanon ideas that have basically transformed into headcanon for so many people through numerous fics. I liked that PoS basically went full AU for Occlumency instead, and its potions explanation was that the class is basically structured so you could create any required potion on an actual OWL or NEWT just through drilling the basic skillset and ability to make a potion by following written directions. Or Sine Qua Non has time traveler Harry mention that modifications to potions are complicated and dangerous- so Snape was skilled to do them as a sixth year, but it's not something that was ever actively taught in classes.

Not every magic system needs to be formulated by Brandon Sanderson. Often, the justifications are extra bloat. One thing that HP canon does exceptionally well is show us a lot of throwaway magic in the background, like magic sweets, toys, backdrops, and trinkets, that add a layer of texture to the world of HP magic that feels lacking in many other fantasy texts. That level of texture is not really something you get in many other fantasy works.
