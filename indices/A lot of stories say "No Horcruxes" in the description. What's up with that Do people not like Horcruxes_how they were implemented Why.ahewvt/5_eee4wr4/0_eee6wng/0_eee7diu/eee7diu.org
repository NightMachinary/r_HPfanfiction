I like those ideas but I prefer it when the author actually says something along those lines because at least for me and I know a few other people where it's basically unless it's directly implied or written it doesn't exist. Like if I don't give reason for horcruxes being in their hiding spots it feels like there's sheer dumb luck and an idiot dark lord.
