  assume that the super powerful evil wizard actually had a general knowledge of what he was doing when he chose the Horcruxes and their place.

This works to explain the objects, but not so well the places. The Gaunt ring and Slytherin's locket are both hidden in meaningful places. Arguably Ravenclaw's diadem as well, if sitting in Hogwart's lost-and-found room counts as being in Hogwarts. But the diary and Hufflepuff's cup were both given to followers to hide. Bellatrix put the cup in her bank vault and Malfoy kept the diary in his basement or whatever. Neither of those places seem to have any significance.
