There can be some arguments against this:

- It's presumably not pleasant to be stuck in the object the Horcrux is connected to. If so, you want it to be in a place where's it possible to find, but only for your loyal minions that will totally bring you back to power and not unknowingly sacrifice in a minor power play/saving their own neck.
- Maybe Horcruxes have to be bound to significant places in your life, otherwise over time the magic binding the soul to the object fades as your soul gets pulled towards those significant places like a ghost (or some explanation to this effect).
- Something about arithmancy.

None of these were actually explored in canon, so you're totally correct in that for the explanations we received about them, Voldemort's hiding policy was asinine.
