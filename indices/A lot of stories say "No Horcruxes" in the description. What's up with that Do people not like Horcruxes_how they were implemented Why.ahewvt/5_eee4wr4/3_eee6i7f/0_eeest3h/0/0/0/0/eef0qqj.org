If you think the world of yourself and you don't understand other people you can try to be as careful as you want and it won't get you much.

Arrogance leads to assumptions. Lack of understanding leads to continuing blind spots to those assumptions.

Voldemort banked on Lucius remaining utterly loyal to him, remaining in fear of him.

He laid defenses for the locket thinking only of the challenger he imagined, someone around his own level of magical power, never thinking that person would ever be teamed up with an underage wizard. He probably never gave much thought to the magical powers of house elves, merely considering them inferior and unworthy of his attention.

The list goes on.
