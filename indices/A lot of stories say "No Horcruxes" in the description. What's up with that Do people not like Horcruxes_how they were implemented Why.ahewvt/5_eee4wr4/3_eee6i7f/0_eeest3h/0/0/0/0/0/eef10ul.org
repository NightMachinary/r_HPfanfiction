The biggest reason I have difficulty with his he used a house elf so what's to stop someone else? Surely he'd at least think to deal with his own method. Another thing I couldn't say would work for sure but it would be simple to use imperio on someone make them drink and return the locket from far away, transfigure a dog and bowl for it to drink stuff like that. I get that Voldemort is shown to be super arrogant but still. It's hard to think even he's that self centered. Also the whole underaged-overages wizard boat thing was ridiculous. Why not make it one person period. It just makes the villain stupid beyond belief and serves as a decent unrealistic plot tool in my opinion.
