I dunno, I find him entirely believable. I'm not saying here that I've encountered a bunch of sociopathic murderers in my life, but I have run into plenty of powerful arrogant people who constantly self-sabotage as a result of that arrogance. I'd also submit that being incredibly intelligent in one respect doesn't speak to your intelligence or ability to navigate other things. Intelligence =/= self awareness or control. It may be a laughably bad way to go through life, but man is it one that some people subscribe to.
