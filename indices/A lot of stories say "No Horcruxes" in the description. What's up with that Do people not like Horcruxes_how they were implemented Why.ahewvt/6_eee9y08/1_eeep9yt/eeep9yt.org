Yeah he was a pretty weak main character. The only thing he had going for him was bravery and the sense of adventure - which almost every other gryffindor also had!

He wasn't particularly funny, smart, caring, cunning, clever or hardworking either. He survived and won because of everyone else and dumb luck. But I can't say anything bad about him because of his bad childhood...
