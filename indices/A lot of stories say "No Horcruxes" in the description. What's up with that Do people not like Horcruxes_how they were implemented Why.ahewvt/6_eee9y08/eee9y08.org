I don't like the way they were done, to be honest. They introduced more plot holes than they resolved, and the way Dumbledore wasted an entire school year on Pensieve memories was asinine. All he had to do was say /"Harry, the diary you stabbed had a piece of Voldemort's soul inside. I think you have a piece as well. Let's hunt them down before he, I don't know, takes over the Ministry and all."/

My worst pet peeves center around Harry the Accidental Horcrux. Thousands of years of magical history, and Voldemort is the only one with the bad luck to accidentally split his soul because a mother loved her baby? Harry nearly dies from basilisk venom, but that doesn't destroy the Horcrux? Why doesn't the Voldemort-soul inside Harry ever try to take over, like all of the others do? Why does Harry get Parseltongue, but nothing else from it? Why does the Horcrux only die if Harry lets himself be killed like a chump? Why does Voldemort have to do it? Can't anyone kill the Horcrux?

I have tons of problems with the other Horcruxes, but I'll leave it at that. In the end, I disliked the last book and a half because Harry barely does anything to defeat Voldemort. He doesn't even have to learn new skills, like cursebreaking; all he does is steal or find the easily accessible Horcruxes. He doesn't have to work for his victory, he just has to listen to Dumbledore and the convenient bit of exposition (Rita Skeeter's book, the radio, convenient photos of Grindelwald, Hermione's reasearch, Kreacher, the Gray Lady, etc.), and the answers are handed to him. It doesn't make for an interesting finale. I was much more invested in the resistance movement at Hogwarts.
