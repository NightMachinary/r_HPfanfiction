  You can't kill a horcrux with a killing curse, a Dementor can't suck a horcrux out of its receptacle, and certainly there aren't any medical procedures that can extract it. Even when you do something to destroy the horcrux, like stabbing one of Voldemort's horcruxes with a basilisk fang, you're not directly affecting the soul piece. The basilisk venom doesn't kill the soul, it destroys the physical object, after which the soul must move on. The only way to destroy a horcrux is to physically destroy the receptacle.

This is true in general for the Horcruxes we see in the story, but I don't really see it for the Horcrux in Harry's scar. Even though Harry's body wasn't destroyed beyond repair when he was hit by the killing curse, the Horcrux in his scar still died.

The other living Horcrux, Nagini, was cut apart by a sword coated with corrosive venom, which understandibly killed its Horcrux as the physical object was destroyed. I don't think Harry has so much as a papercut when he 'died', so something must be different in his situation.

I can think of maybe two possible explanations right now. Either the Horcruxes /in/ living things die when the living thing dies (but isn't necessarily destroyed), or Harry's protection from his mother had a funky interaction with Voldemort's killing curse, which removed Voldemort's Horcrux. If the first one is the case, I don't know why Voldemort would ever make a mortal snake into a receptacle for his immortality. Harry wouldn't necessarily have had to die to Voldemort, as anything else would do. The second explanation seems also unsatisfying to me, as the Horcrux scar got there in the first place because Harry was hit by the killing curse way back then (and also had the protection from his mother). So it shouldn't be any different in this case.

I might be missing something here.
