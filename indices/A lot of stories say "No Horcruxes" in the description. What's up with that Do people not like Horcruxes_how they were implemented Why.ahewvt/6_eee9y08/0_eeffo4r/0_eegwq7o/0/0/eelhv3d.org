And I think this proof right here is why so many do add the "No Horcruxes" disclaimer to their fanfic. Because if the inevitable conclusion to your story has to involve Harry dying (or his body being destroyed) in some way to defeat Voldemort than you're going to be pretty limited in where you can go with it.

I mean I'd be interested in your thoughts on how to get around Harry's accidental Horcrux problem without killing him, and also without something easy like "Oops he was kissed by a Dementor and now it's gone for good."
