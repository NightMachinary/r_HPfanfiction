Your wall of text only answered /one/ of the pet peeves I posted about the Harry-Horcrux, and saying that Harry was "destroyed" as a vessel sounds ridiculous when he's up and walking around a few minutes later, but whatever. It's just like magic!

That still doesn't explain why Tom's diary Horcrux tries to get itself a new body, sets a monster loose, and tries to kill Harry, but the one inside his own head does /nothing/ except give him a helpful language skill (and can coexist with Lily's love-shield for years and years). Harry has a chunk of Dark Lord in him, and he's pure as the driven snow until the OG Voldemort starts sending him mood swings in OotP! The trio didn't allow the locket Horcrux to possess them, and that one /still/ found a way to screw them all up and send Ron packing, prevent them from using the Patronus Charm, and all sorts of angst ensued.

You could argue that the older the Horcrux, the stronger it is and the more powers it has, but that creates its own problems. If the diary has 1/2 of a soul, but the ring only has 1/4, the locket 1/8, and so on, that would mean that the "master soul" is 1/128th of a soul, and weaker than ALL of his Horcruxes bar one. Voldemort should be more of a joke than a villain at that point, since mathematically he's even more unstable than the chunk that went into Harry accidentally (1/64).
