While I've never read a fic like that, I don't think, I've always wanted to.

I really don't see the point of following Rowling in all her plot devices when you're writing fan fiction. As far as I'm concerned, keep the magic, but change anything else you like. Take AQ, for example, still my favorite fic of all.
