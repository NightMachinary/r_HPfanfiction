  A million and other things could have happened. The beauty of fan fiction is you can change any of them. You're not as constricted by canon as you might think you are.

Obviously, but changing those fundamental parts of entire years means you either have to cover it in some detail (which can be tedious) or come up with an alternate scenario (Malfoy slips Ginny a dark artefact, the Weasleys are bankrupted, Harry and Ron do not get their bonding duo adventures and so on) and then explore it. Which can be very tedious if you are trying to tell a sixth-year AU story but are caught up in all the changes.

And you always run the risk of losing the HP vibe if you change too much.
