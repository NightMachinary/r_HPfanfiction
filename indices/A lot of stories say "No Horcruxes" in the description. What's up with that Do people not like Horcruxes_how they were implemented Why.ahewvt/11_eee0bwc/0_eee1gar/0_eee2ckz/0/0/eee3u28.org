I haven't yet written a fan fic, so you'll have to take what I say with a grain of salt.

That being said, as a reader, I don't think you have to cover anything. You can just write sixth year as you want to, and damn any explanations. Maybe nothing of note happened in second year, or any other year. What does it matter. You write your story, and if glimpses of the past do come up, write them as you like as well.

As for the "HP" vibe, I'm not sure what that is, to be entirely honest with you. Or if I do, I don't see what it has to do with plot changes. I really think the magic itself is all you ever need. The rest is up to you.

P.S. Think about a story where Voldemort did die and never came back. And now you want to write about Harry Potter in his sixth year. His parents are still dead, he still survived, but no Voldemort. What changed in your mind? Who are his friends now? And, what adventures or dark wizards await him instead?
