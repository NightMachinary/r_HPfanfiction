Well, sure, Voldemort enchanted the diary to act as it did.

As for him being revived, you can just claim Lily's magic didn't actually kill him, but merely get rid of his body. His soul remained intact and anchored to Earth, either because of the type of magic Lily used or some other protection Voldemort had devised for himself.

So, while yes, you have to come up with believable, well-thought out explanations that are interesting, that doesn't mean it's not possible.

And besides, there's no reason to include the diary or him dying in the first place, either. One, you can write or explain a different kind of adventure for Harry in his second year, and two, Voldemort may have not even died for certain, merely disappeared. Perhaps he was extremely weakened and took all this time to recover, not daring to show his face to Dumbledore and his followers. Or perhaps someone found him in this state and kidnapped him for their own reasons. Or maybe he time-travelled. Or dimension-skipped. Or maybe a whole new quest opened before him once he failed to kill Potter, such as Death showing up and offering him a deal to reclaim his wand, cloak and stone in exchange for Immortality.

A million and other things could have happened. The beauty of fan fiction is you can change any of them. You're not as constricted by canon as you might think you are.
