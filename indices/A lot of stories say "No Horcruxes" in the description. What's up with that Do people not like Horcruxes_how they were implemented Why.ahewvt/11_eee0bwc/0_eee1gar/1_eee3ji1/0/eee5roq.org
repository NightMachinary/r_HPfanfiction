I don't think that's what was supposed to happen in Canon, at least the way I understood it, but feel free to disagree. Rather, I think if Diary Riddle had managed to resurrect, that's would have become the same Voldemort as we witness after fourth year.

Otherwise, you have to wonder, how does this whole horcrux business actually work? Say they killed him again, but without destroying the other Horcruxes. What now? Would he still be a sort of spirit, capable of possessing people? Attached to which horcrux in particular?

This is why I think the projection of Voldemort that we witnessed in CoS was only the Horcrux, but had it been brought back to life, it would have acted as Voldemort's main soul container, so to speak. It would have held his essence. The actual Voldemort. And the spirit that had wandered the world prior to this would have settled itself in this new incarnation - that's his actual consciousness, and not some self-aware Horcrux. The Riddle-Horcrux may or may not have been aware of this, but this is how I think it would have worked. And the same for any other later successful incarnations.
