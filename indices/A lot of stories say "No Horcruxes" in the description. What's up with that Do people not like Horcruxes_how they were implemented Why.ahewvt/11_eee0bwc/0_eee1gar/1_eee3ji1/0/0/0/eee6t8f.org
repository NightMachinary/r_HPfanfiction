I believe that's because the Diary was personally enchanted by him to gain some sort of self-awareness, or rather to be a kind of copy of his at the time he wrote it in or made it. Or maybe the fact that it was a diary allowed the piece of soul in it to more easily possess someone else who wrote in it. Either way, we have to remember, these are pieces of his soul, and I would expect them to have some sort of power other than merely keeping him alive.

As for that, that's not how I saw it. I always thought they acted as fail-safes in case he died. As in, if he managed to get himself killed, he would always be able to be revived so long as a Horcrux containing a part of his soul remained undestroyed. After all, he died to his own Avada Kedavra. So why didn't the Horcruxes keep him truly alive during that?
