I assumed that the Horcruxes prevented him from dying, but inherently (Diary aside) did very little. The Diary is the only Horcrux that seems to have a true sentience, but I always figured it wasn't truly Voldemort. Tom Riddle from the Diary didn't really seem to behave like what we see Voldemort do in canon, but rather as an actual teenage Riddle.
