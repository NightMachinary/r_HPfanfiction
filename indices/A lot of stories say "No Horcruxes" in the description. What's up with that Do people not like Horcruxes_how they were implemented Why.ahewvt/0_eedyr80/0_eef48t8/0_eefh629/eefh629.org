The Paradigm of Uncertainty series by Lori Summers is still one of my favorite FF series written (starting) before GoF, this does not even mention Horcurx. Unfortunately it was abandoned on "book" 3 about half way through, although she did post what her plans were to finish it out when she officially abandoned it.
