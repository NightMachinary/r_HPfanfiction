I'm torn between a few I think. There's some overlap and feeding into one another. I'd go with something along the lines of Lies & Secrets, Justice / Injustice, and Compassion & Forgiveness.

To break them down a little ...

Lies and Secrets:\\
We get this nearly from the start. Harry has to keep the secret of his magic from Aunt Marge. Substituting lies. Fudge and others are lying to Harry about their belief that Sirius broke out to kill him, and keeping the secret that they believe Sirius to be responsible for a mass murder and the deaths of Harry's parents. There's Harry's coming into secrets about Hogwarts by way of Fred, George, and the Marauder's Map. Malfoy trying to get as much out of deceiving people about the severity of his injury from Buckbeak as he can, not to mention his lie about the situation being unprovoked on his part. Lupin's secret regarding being a werewolf. Hermione's possession and use of the timeturner.

​

Justice and Injustice:\\
Many of the above plot points get double duty. As always, we're treated to an inside look at the start of just how unjust Harry's situation with the Dursley's is. Lupin's ostracizing by most of society. The discussion of the morality or lack thereof of the Dementor's Kiss. In tandem with discussion around Sirius' fate and history, we have Buckbeak's trial and subsequent unjust sentencing. The look at the climax at the real guilty party having escaped justice, while the innocent one was punished. Sirius' self loathing belief that he was on some level guilty, having been the one to advocate the switch in secret keeper. The conclusion of all of this containing some wins for justice and some losses. The belief of the Ministry that Sirius is still guilty, but his and Buckbeak's escape of further direct punishment.

​

Compassion and Forgiveness:

We get some of this throughout the book. Ron and Hermione fighting but eventually managing to reconcile. The trio's compassion toward Hagrid and what's going on with Buckbeak. Interplay around grudges, old and newer. The most significant example of this of course is in the climax. Lupin's ability to understand and forgive Sirius, Snape's inability to do the same toward either of them, or toward Harry for that matter due to past injustices against him. Harry's compassion allowing him to be somewhat merciful toward Pettigrew and prevent his murder by Sirius and Lupin, his upholding of his personal idea of justice rather than revenge.
