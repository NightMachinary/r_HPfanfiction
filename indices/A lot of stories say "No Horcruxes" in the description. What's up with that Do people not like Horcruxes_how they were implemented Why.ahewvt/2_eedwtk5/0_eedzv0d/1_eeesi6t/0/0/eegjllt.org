I'm not familiar with Vento Aureo so I can't comment in respect to that.

In respect to the entire HP series we get the obvious ones. Love, Death, Loyalty, Heroism, Good vs Evil, Growing Up, etc... But we also get particularly significant and somewhat more book specific ones. With Voldemort's second rise to power and the Ministry's response we see strong themes about Injustice (plot lines about house elves, bigotry from the likes of Umbridge and Fudge, and hell, society when it comes to deeper insights we get into what Lupin and other werewolves have had to deal with).

We see themes of Totalitarianism and Power and Corruption, not just in Fudge's suppression of truth and attempted arrests without due process earlier on, but extreme in-your-face outright totalitarian fascism when the Ministry fell to Voldemort. Later on, particularly in Deathly Hallows, we get themes not centered merely around Death but around the Difficulty of Loving the Dead. Harry in particular dealing with feelings of Betrayal in light of what he learns about Dumbledore's history. The search for the Horcruxes, particularly the earlier portion of it, has all sorts of stuff going on. Choices, Losing Hope, Loneliness, Isolation, Individual vs Society, Fear of Failure.

Later in the book we get Reunion, Home, Sacrifice, Rebellion, ...

I could go on like this for a while, not to mention choose any given one and go deep on it, so I'll cut myself off here. There's a great Podcast called Harry Potter and the Sacred Text where the hosts pretty much do exactly this. It's a Chapter by Chapter analysis of the entire series with the framing of reading it as they would a religious holy book. Analysing the central theme of each chapter and pulling from it instruction and inspiration. Not only is it extremely well done, but the fact that the series can support this level of reading is testament to the richness I've tried to convey.
