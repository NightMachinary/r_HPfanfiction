I think there's a fair bit of evidence that she had at least a basic idea of Voldemort and the fact that he had multiple horcruxes from the beginning of the series. Not only the diary, but the fact that horcruxes are a tribute to a really to a long and rich history of very similar things in literature and myth. The One Ring in LOTR and a finger bone in one of the Prydain novels just to name two of the examples in the modern era of fantasy literature.

As for themes, I'm not sure what could possibly have more thematic resonance and depth than the hunt for the horcruxes gave us. The entire series is immensely rich in that regard, but none are more so than the last two books. Basically that's all to say that I couldn't disagree more and I'm curious to know what's led you to that conclusion.
