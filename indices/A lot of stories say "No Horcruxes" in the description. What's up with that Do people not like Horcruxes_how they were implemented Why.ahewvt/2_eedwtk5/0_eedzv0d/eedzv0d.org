That's true. "Collect the 8 Badges" works in Pokémon because Pokémon is about going on an adventure and growing with your growing and evolving Pokémon.

But Harry Potter? It isn't really about anything thematically. There's a good guy and a bad guy and there's magic that can do anything except when the author says it can't. It's not like the heroes destroyed one Horcrux at the end of every book. It's just something the author came up with at the last second, probably because too many fans predicted what shed actually do. Or because her publishers said no to what she planned.
