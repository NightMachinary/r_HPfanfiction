Lord Potter Black Peverell, the reincarnated Master of Death who in his last life was thrown in Azkaban after his twin (whom his parents favoured to the point where he was neglected) was proclaimed to be the Boy Who lived.

In his second life, his memories were bound by Death until his creature inheritance came into being.

Albus - too many names - Dumbledore had been found embezzling money from Hadrian's vaults by the Goblin Nation (who proclaimed Hadrian as Goblin Friend) for the greater good. The Order was horrified by his accusations, Remus calling him 'Pup' in disappointment. Dumbledore, ever calm, asked "Would you like a Lemon-drop Harry," his eyes twinkling like little stars.

His avada green eyes pierced the darkness, glowing with power as he found out that Molly was feeding him love potions to make him fall in love with Ginny.

(But in all honesty, not all of them are that bad lol)
