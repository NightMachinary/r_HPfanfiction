Fair enough, for some reason Ibthiught I remember reading a post along those lines but my memory is fuzzy. You're likely right it's intention is just to subvert the WBWL and Slytherin!Harry tropes. I liked the story but I feel recently its gotten a little out there and off the rails. It could be that I grasp and get immersed in stories was better when I can read them beginning to end unlike when I read ones not yet finished as they update. In this case though I also think the story has started to get bigger than itself and has lost grasp of the narrative in the process. Just IMO.
