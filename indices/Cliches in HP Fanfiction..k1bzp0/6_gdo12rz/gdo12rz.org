Don't forget got magical core blocked before school and Harry is actually 5 gazillion times more powerful.

Also /insert character here/ read all the books before their first year so now know more than anyone in their grade and also probably anyone in school because magic is about memorization and practice and deeper level of understanding is meaningless I guess.
