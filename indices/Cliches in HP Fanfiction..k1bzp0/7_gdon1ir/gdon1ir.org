There's that whole Magical Guardian thing, which I'm pretty sure is never mentioned anywhere in the books but in fanfiction it's universally Dumbledore for some reason.

I mean, I get it, but it's plausible that there's no evil scheme to keep Harry in the dark about his supposed great inheritance(that's also not really in the books), and Harry really is just an orphan who falls through the cracks because of non-existent child welfare offices in magic-land.
