Improving my summary sounds like an excellent suggestion, and I will hop on that at once. On the other hand, what plothole is listed in the summary? My estimate of their ages?

I'm sorry to hear that the prologue chapter turned you off. I thought about simply opening when the three of them arrive in Konoha (in other words, at Chapter 2), but I try to avoid starting in medias res if I'm going to have to write a flashback almost immediately to explain what's going on.

Aside from the questionable decision that Dumbledore made (and even though I'm sympathetic toward Dumbledore, it's not the first questionable decision he has ever made), the majority of the story revolves around the world of Naruto, not HP, so if that's the problem, maybe I should just pull down the prologue... I wonder if it might be stronger that way.
