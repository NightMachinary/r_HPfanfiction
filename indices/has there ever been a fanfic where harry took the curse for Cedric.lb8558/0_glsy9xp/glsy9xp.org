Unfortunately no, but I see huge potentials here:

1. Wormtail's AK killed the Horcrux in Harry, and he wakes up after a few hours.
2. Wormtail's AK killed Harry, and the Horcrux wakes up after a few hours. He pretends to be Harry, but secretly wants to be the dark lord.

The second option sounds far more intriguing to me, as this can make for a much more credible "Harry as the 3rd faction" story. Him corrupting the good kids will also be interesting to watch.
