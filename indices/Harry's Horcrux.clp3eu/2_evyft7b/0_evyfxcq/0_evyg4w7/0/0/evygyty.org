There's a piece of canon I think from Pottermore which suggests muggleborns are effectively the long-lost children of Squibs. I don't know how "true" that is for the HP universe but I don't think it's really relevant to Harry and his Parseltongue - we have a much clearer link with textual evidence from canon that it's a result of the Horcrux which was created at the same time as his scar.
