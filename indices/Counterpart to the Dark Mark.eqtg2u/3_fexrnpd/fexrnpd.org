This actually happens later on in Behind Blue Eyes. They draw a symbol on the wall and it spreads around. Warning for those who haven't read this, it alternates between depressing as fuck and angsty as fuck and primarily focuses on Harry interacting with a Muggle OC for the first half. I really enjoyed it though. The few 'light in the darkness' moments really carried me through the immensely depressing parts. And egad, I cannot emphasise how many of those there are.
