Not a fic as such, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f3lpo/post_your_favorite_alternate_media_fanfiction/ctlfo3o][I came up with an outline of one as inspired by some wanted poster fanart someone posted]]. One thing that, in retrospect, I am not seeing is Harry leaving Britain; it just wouldn't be Harry. I was following what the posters said.

That said, I don't see a non-HINO Harry leading a guerrilla movement as such; he is more likely to be the figurehead and a squad leader, with someone else actually running the organization and calling the shots. Even if it's going to be someone from that year (as opposed to a grownup like Moody or Shacklebolt or one of the older Weasleys), it'd probably be Hermione: more ruthless, more versatile magically, better at planning and organizing.
