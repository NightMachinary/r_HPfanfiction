Maybe should share: [[http://fictionhunt.com][FictionHunt]].

Not as sophisticated as [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net]], still maybe helpful to some.

Most interesting thing you may find are those red/blue bars that represent character mentions in whole fanfic text. Useful thing in a way that it actually allows you to see how well author used character names and pronouns.

Amount of fics is quite low mainly because of the feature called footprint that slows processing down.
