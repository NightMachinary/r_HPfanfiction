A few friends have informed me of more sites for this list. Some of these carry nothing but adult fic, and are not intended for readers under 18.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/index.php][Walking the Plank]] - Dedicated to HP/SS ship fics

[[http://quietones.org/][It's Always the Quiet Ones]] - Dedicated to Hermione, Blaise and Draco "in every way"

[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/][Restricted Section]] - General HP adult fanfic (under 18s prohibited)

[[http://hp.adultfanfiction.net/][Adult Fanfiction]] - General HP adult fanfic (under 18s prohibited) - I'm told the search function is utterly borked.

[[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/][Moonshadow]] - Dedicated to Snape/Lupin slashfic (under 18s prohibited)

[[http://www.witchfics.org/][Witchfics]] - a collaborative HP fanfic site. Looks like it's been active for a number of years

[[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/index.php][WIKTT - When I Kissed The Teacher]] - adult HP fanfiction, particularly focused on teacher/student ships. There's an art page & a subsection dedicated to HGSS. Obviously, under 18s prohibited.

[[http://simmeringcauldrons.com/efiction/][Simmering Cauldrons]] - "The archive of Hermione Granger and Severus Snape Fan Fiction by Snapesflower and other invited authors." Adult fanfiction, under 18s prohibited.
