What a great idea. Thanks for this list - I hadn't heard of half of them. May I recommend a few more?

[[http://www.dramione.org/][Hawthorn and Vine]] - a specialized HP site for only Draco/Hermione fics. Stories are prescreened by mods.

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]] - a general Potterverse site. Stories are prescreened by mods. A fairly active site that sponsors occasional fic challenges and fests that bolster the roster.

[[http://grangerenchanted.com/][Granger Enchanted]] - Stories must include Hermione Granger as the main character - otherwise, anything goes. Stories are prescreened by mods, but frankly, they do spotty work - there are still lots of spelling and grammar errors in the stories.
