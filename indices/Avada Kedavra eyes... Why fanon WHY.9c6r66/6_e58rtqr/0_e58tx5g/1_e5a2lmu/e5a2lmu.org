The abbreviation I can't stand is DADA. It makes me think they've got a class for an art style developed in Europe during World War I. The abbreviation D.A.D.A. appears in canon once, but in speech, characters assiduously refer to the class as Defense Against the Dark Arts (and the subject in general as Defense).
