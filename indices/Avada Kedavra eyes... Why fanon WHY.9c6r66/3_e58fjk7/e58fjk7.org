Well emerald has been done to death, particularly by romances. Anyway, what other comparisons would writers use for green that's cheap and easy but makes the thing sound significant (emeralds or killing curses)?

His forest-y orbs?

His Slytherin green eyes?

Pupils surrounded by grassy irises?

I don't see people doing that to be honest.
