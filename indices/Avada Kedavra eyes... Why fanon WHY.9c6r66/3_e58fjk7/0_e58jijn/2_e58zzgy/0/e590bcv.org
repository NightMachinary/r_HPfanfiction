I'm familiar with RGB being hex values through my usage of html and css.

This CSS code for example would make a webpage have an emerald background:

#+begin_example
  body {
    background-color: #50C878;
  }
#+end_example

You can also specify RGB values as hex when using Adobe Photoshop and presumably other graphics editing software as well. Pixlr is similar enough to photoshop, open [[https://pixlr.com/editor/]] and check out the color palette to see that it will accept hex values and also tell you the hex value of your current color.
