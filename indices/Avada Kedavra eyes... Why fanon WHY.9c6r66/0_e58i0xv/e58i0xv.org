9 times out of 10, this makes me cringe massively too. Surely, you, as an author, can come up with something more creative than THAT as a description for green eyes. Hell, you could just say that they are GREEN. Toss in a romantic adjective. Not that hard.

THAT BEING SAID

The one time I do approve of it? MoD!Harry fics, a la, On A Pale Horse. Eldritch abomination Harry may absolutely have "Avada Kedavra green" eyes if it's done so to point out that it is now an /unnatural/ shade of green as opposed to what he had as a relatively normal human being.
