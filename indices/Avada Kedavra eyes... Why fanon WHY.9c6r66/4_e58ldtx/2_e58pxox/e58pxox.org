I do see eye colour mentioned for other characters, too, especially if it's a romance fic---Hermione's soulful/warm brown eyes are commented on, as are Draco's grey ones or the Weasleys' blue ones.

It kind of makes sense to me, since the only time I really notice eye colour in day-to-day life is when looking at someone I'm in a relationship with. I don't think we tend to look very closely at eyes casually, but if you notice the colour it kind of gives a sense of gazing into them?
