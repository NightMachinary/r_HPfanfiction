this sounds like the kind of thing that happens in fanfiction. ie: harry travels back in time, and some random guy on the street notices his potter hair and asks if they're related.

Fanfiction: "Yes, I the homeless time-traveler am related to you."

Real life: "No, sorry, I just forgot to brush my hair this morning."

Dream life: "No, I just actually have sex hair."
