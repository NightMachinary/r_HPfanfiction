Can I just say as an aside, I hate people saying avada kedavra when referring to the curse itself. As for kc green eyes, I think it's a good description for MoD harry that essentially becomes death. Even if that's an overused clich√© at this point. My favorite MoD was in a Naruto xover. The fic itself wasn't too great, but the main thing was harry could only die of old age, and heal any unnatural ailment. Natural causes like age and allergies were off limits though.
