Harry Potter and the Serpent Court by whitetigerwolf has Harry and Hermione become Basilisk animagi (other characters become their own magical animagus) who can turn their eyes yellow and petrify people while in human form. It's about a dozen chapters long and hasn't been updated since 2010 I think.
