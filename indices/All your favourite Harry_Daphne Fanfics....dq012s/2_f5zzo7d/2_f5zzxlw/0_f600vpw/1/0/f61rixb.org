Doesn't matter the pairing? I may have one or 2 other H/D, but I'd have to go through my stuff, and that's like thousands of fics to sort through...

If you don't care about pairing, there's a bunch with Fleur. Also, how do you feel about femHarry and femSlash? And fics where starts y1 but goes on to year 4 and beyond?
