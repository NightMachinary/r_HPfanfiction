From what I've read regarding both The Eliminators and Critics United, while their mission statements seem sound enough the reality seems that often there is a highly aggressive tone taken and they set out to humiliate those they target as much as anything else. They are vigilantes and in some (not all) cases bullies, this is not to be condoned. The site should be responsible for its own policing.
