That doesn't look so bad... the first subforum has to do with plagiarism, which I see nothing wrong with being reported, and the second one concerns copyright infringement, which does not concern HP fics mostly. (Unless someone likes inserting song lyrics I guess?)

Anyway, they don't seem responsible for the FFN deletions of good stories. Afaik, those purges a few years back were due to some dudes called critics united or something. They would post a review naming the author's 'violations' and warning them to change their story or face their wrath (report!) .
