"We are not toys or attractions for the amusement of your children. You trespass in our forest and have the gall to parade us in front of you like your prize stallion? Shall we mate for you next? This is the gravest insult you could possibly have given. Know that you and yours are not welcome in this forest any longer. The children shall not be harmed, as we are not savages like you so clearly believe, however any adult who enters the forest shall be met with extreme hostility. Now begone Hagrid. And do not deign to step foot in this place again."
