The first /Deathly Hallows/ movie in 2010 gave us oh-so-many Harry/Hermione tent-dancing oneshots . . . plus a brief(?) obsession with Scabior.

Maybe a year or two before that, H/Hr authors seemed particularly fond of facilitating romantic development by packing Ron off on a family vacation to visit Charlie in Romania. I think I even wrote a trollfic on that theme, way back when.
