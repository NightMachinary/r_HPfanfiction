Year 4 and 5 are the years of betrayal and azkaban. Most of the betrayal fics I've seen either start up the betrayals with Harry for being chosen as the Tri-Wizard champion or the courtroom scene.

Though there are a few 7th year fics as well, one 7th year betrayal fic I've been trying to find again, where Harry is abandoned during the camping trip from hell, eventually marries and is confronted by Ron and Hermione, and their daughter, who has a prophesy saying that she must kill Harry Potter, weird premise but good fic if only I could find it.
