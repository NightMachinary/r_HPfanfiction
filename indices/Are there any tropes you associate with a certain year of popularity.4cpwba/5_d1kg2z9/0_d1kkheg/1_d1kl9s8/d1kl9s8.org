(I have problem with ffnbots)

The three stories I've been following all began in late 2015/early 2016:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11827316/1/Cult-Potter][Cult Potter]]*: this fem!Harry is actually not dark so far, but the story is still early and things could change.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty][Call Me Moriarty]]*: she basically created a Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious situation for herself. She was light side's 'The Girl Who Lived' on one hand, and the Dark Lord Moriarty on the other. This fem!Harry felt overpowered, but the story is very fun to read.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761312/1/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]]*: she is not evil, but fights back ruthlessly and violently. Dead bodies are already piling up by the summer after year 4.
