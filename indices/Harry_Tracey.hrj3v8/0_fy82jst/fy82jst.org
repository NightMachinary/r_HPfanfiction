linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chance Meeting by Clell65619). Tracy runs into Harry the night before her wedding. A very nice story, but I like almost everything Clell has written.

linkffn(Modest, Too by Luan Mao). Tracy convinces Harry to take her along with him when he's escaping the goblins and destroying Gringotts.
