I didn't care much for What it Takes to Survive, but I did like his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10541297/1/Book-One-Death][Book One: Death]]

#+begin_quote
  At a young age, Harry becomes one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The young Pale Rider must reunite the Horsemen but first he must overcome his own trials and reclaim his artifacts all while still at Hogwarts. Features an Independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, a realistic Dumbledore, and a bunch more magic involved.

There are some problems, but I mostly enjoyed it.
