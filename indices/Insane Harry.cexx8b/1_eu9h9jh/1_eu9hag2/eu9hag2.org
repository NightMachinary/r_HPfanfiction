  Harry has been a little off since the graveyard. He sees more than a closed door in his nightly visions, and he's losing his grasp on reality. The memory charm around the student population isn't helping. Who has Voldemort allied with? Riddle, always suspicious, seems to be a symptom of something larger.Between lessons at Hogwarts, where the professors resolutely insist that nothing is wrong, and the strange glances Harry gets in the Great Hall, it's only natural that he makes friends with a Slytherin Tom Riddle, even if he doesn't understand everything about the boy.
