To be honest, I've never read anything Harry/Twins or one of them. IDK, but I always thought they worked better as big brothers. But I don't I'd care about it anyways, as long as it makes sense. I also don't care if there's smut or not, as long as it isn't slash(with or without smut, I don't read slash, at all)

Gonna check it out, though the bashing tags makes me a bit leery. Thanks though.
