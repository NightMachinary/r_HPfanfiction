I think that something grinds my gears with a lot of crossovers with Naruto, is that they use Hari. Its such a bastardization of an already common name that it feels unnecessary and lazy, while trying to to "japanize" the name and story. Fuck, give her a flower name but in Japanese, not Nihonglish if you're that desperate to "authenticate" your fic, like Hana, Fuji or Sumire. I once read a x-over with Lily and Naruto's mom (forgot her name) swaping places after their deaths, and Lily is usually called Riri, which is fine for me, but only because it happens on dialogue, and not during descriptive parts.

Anyways, enough ranting... Gonna check this author out, thanks for the suggestion.
