I'd rather a longer story, I think I've only ever read and enjoyed one one-shot so far, one about Daphne and Harry, I think its called Ice Princess by Luan Mao, or something like that.

I like getting to know the characters, and usually this means reading about this particular iteration for a while. My usual minimum to start a fic is 30k+, with the occasional shorter pearl, like Hocus Pocus, Adele polkiss.

Gona read this though, because I love femHarry/Bucky. The saddest part for me is that most stories are never finished.
