I've read everything from Engineer4Ever and while I didn't like much Consul and Ever Twisting wind, I loved Unrelenting Frozen Seas. Su Li is just too cute not to like it and I prefer Rhode's personality a lot more than the other girls.I get that the authors wanted to mirror parts of their parent's personalities, with the calm winds, the harsh sea and cunning and ruthless underworld, but I really enjoyed more Rhode.

Godling Ascending I tried to read but got bored 4 chapters in. I don't remember why, I think it may have been because the setup was too artificial, if I make any sense.

I rarely enjoy reading fics with less than 50k, but I'll give a shot for the Marriage Contract one, it seems quite intneresting.

Not a huge fan of Vampire Diaries, but I do love some vamps. I did watch it till season 4 or 5 (the last one was after Elena stoped being a vamp or being crazy, somehow, I don't remember, just that she and Damon split up)

I should've said something about GoT in my description or tittle. I really hate the world and books. I always thought that after the second book, he lost completely his plot. He still writes marvelously, but the plot itself went to shit and he didn't know what to do, so kept adding characters to make you like and then kill, over and over again. For me, the only good characters are Jon, Tyrion and Davos. Even Dany is boring and tacky to my eyes. I find Cersei to be quite stupid, compared to her father or brother. She only got her father ruthlessness and not his brains, while Tyrion got the brains and Jaime got his sister's cooch. /endRant

Anyways, thanks for the suggestions, and I'll check the Vamp Diaries after I read the Avenger's one.
