Well, my friend, all I can say it that it was very lucky for me to find this tonight. I am also a big fan for Female!Harry over Canon!Harry, especially when it comes to crossovers. Don't worry, I don't like any type of anime either.

Here are some good ones I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761202/1/The-Forgotten-Potter][The Forgotten Potter]] by njeha - It's a crossover between Marvel, the Vampire Diaries, and apparently more. Whilst it is very good, it unfortunately hasn't been updated in almost two years.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11854861/1/The-Ember-Diaries][The Ember Diaries]] by njeha - It's a crossover with the Vampire Diaries as well. Once again, the author hasn't updated in almost three years.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11957661/1/Alaska-Falls][Alaska Falls]] by njeha - It's also a crossover with the Vampire Diaries. If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of this author. Once again, it hasn't been updated in almost three years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11063669/1/The-Almost-Forgotten-Marriage-Contract-of-1763][The Almost Forgotten Marriage Contract of 1763]] by worldtravellingfly - It's an Avengers crossover. It has a marriage contract, but it is rather well-written and has a good plot. If you're anything like me, I think you'd enjoy it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11324421/2/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-The-Lightning-Thief][The Ever Twisting Wind: The Lightning Thief]] by Engineer4Ever - It's a Percy Jackson crossover. It's well-written and has a good plot. Fem! Harry is a daughter of Zeus. It also comes with two other companion stories that are basically different Fem! Harry's in other universes. I really like it. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12130850/1/The-Ever-Twisting-Wind-Of-Monsters-and-Titans][The Ever Twisting Wind: Of Monsters and Titans]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309061/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-The-Game-Begins][Consul of the Underworld: The Game Begins]] by Engineer4Ever - Is Fem! Harry is a daughter of Hades. I personally think that Consul of the Underworld is my favourite of the companion fics. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12862799/1/Consul-of-the-Underworld-Grinding-Phase][Consul of the Underworld: Grinding Phase]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey][The Unrelenting Frozen Seas: The Journey]] by Engineer4Ever - It's the last series in the companion fics. It's Fem! Harry is a daughter of Poseidon. It's sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12506800/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Trials][The Unrelenting Frozen Seas: The Trials]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending][Godling Ascending]] by Hi Pot and News - It's with Fem!Harry (Herakles) as a demigod, but I forgot what legacy/parentage/grandparentage she's from, sorry. It was last updated nearly a year ago, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11862402/1/Phoenix-Queen][Phoenix Queen]] by Sereven - it's a GoT/ASOIAF crossover where fem! Harry is reincarnated. She's Master of Death. It's very well-written and I really like it. It's a sort-of prequel is a Percy Jackson crossover with fem!harry's reincarnation as a daughter of Hecate: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12470816/1/Deceitful-Mind][Deceitful Mind]]

I have a whole load more well-written fics in my "Fanfiction Inventory" if anybody wants recommendations. I'll also be posting this on [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction][r/harrypotterfanfiction]] for all to come and request more. :)
