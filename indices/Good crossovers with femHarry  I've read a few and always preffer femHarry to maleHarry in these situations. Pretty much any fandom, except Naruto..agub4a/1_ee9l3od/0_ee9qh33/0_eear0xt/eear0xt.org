Hi! Sorry for the late reply.

linkffn(“Black Sky” by “Umei no Mai”) is a very well written crossover with the anime /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/. It uses its tropes well, has some greatly executed characters and character interactions and stellar worldbuilding, though where it really shines is when the crossover part starts to become relevant. Which, by the way, the crossover fandom is almost nonexistent in the first ~60 chapters. Oh, and by the way, when it says “slow burn”? It /means/ it.
