I really liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1437976/1/The-Way][The Way]] Â» Draco Malfoy, the rich and arrogant fool. Pansy Parkinson, the wealthy and stubborn brat...Draco Malfoy, the abused and trialed hero. Pansy Parkinson, the brave and emotional heroine. Everything's more interesting on the dark side. Harry Potter, T, English, Romance & Drama, chapters: 29, words: 269k+, favs: 123, follows: 53, updated: Mar 27, 2008 published: Jul 21, 2003, Draco M., Pansy P.

I remember it being well written, but I haven't read it again in a while.
