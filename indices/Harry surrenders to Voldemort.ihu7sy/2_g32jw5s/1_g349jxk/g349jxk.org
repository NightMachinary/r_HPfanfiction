Harry intentionally sacrificed his life to invoke the same protection his mother did, making Voldemort unable to kill any of the Defenders of Hogwarts, not exactly unconditional surrender.

And Voldemort couldn't really interrogate Harryy, Harry has just shown himself capable of not only resisting Legilimency, but also capable of using their connections to read Voldemort's mind instead. And torturing him wouldn't work either since Harry owned the Elder Wand and we literally saw him capable of shrugging of Voldemort's cruciatus.
