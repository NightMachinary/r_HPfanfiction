There's a long one I skimmed through a couple of years ago but I remember very little about it. During the latest chapters Harry was full of worry/anxiety about Ron & Hermione's wellbeing and Voldemort arranged for both of them to visit Malfoy Manor and arranged their wedding as a way to celebrate the new regime. I'm not even sure if he surrenders to V or he gets trapped into it.
