Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 was nothing short of incredible. I had read the original "Shadowed Malice" (Antithesis was a rewrite of this) and the author really managed to nail it and improve; fixing all the cringey power wank moments and adding real characterization and conflict. Antithesis does drag on a bit but it is well written and tells a good story. The uniqueness of what it does also cannot be understated.

This is more from their original work to their rewrite (not the author as a whole), but I really think this fits the bill.
