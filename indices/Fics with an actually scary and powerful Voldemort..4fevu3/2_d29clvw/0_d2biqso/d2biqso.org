As a part of LessWrong myself, I always found it funny how divisive HPMOR was - not because I can't comprehend why people don't like it, but because it's not actually all that important. Eliezer wrote HPMOR as a funny side project, and I wouldn't take anything in it to be immediately indicative of his beliefs given that he has already written the /Sequences/. So I'm amused that people took it so seriously.

By the time HPMOR was over, the population of LessWrong doubled and the rest of the fandom had developed a severe allergy to anything rationalist.
