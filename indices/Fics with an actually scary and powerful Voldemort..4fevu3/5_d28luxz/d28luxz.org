In my AU story "Patron", he's cunning, calculating, making plans that do not rely on coincidences or mistakes of his enemies, and scarily powerful. For example, the whole "Harry is put into the Tournament against his will" is just a diversion, to keep Dumbledore too busy protecting Harry to detect and foil the actual resurrection plan. And if some of the sabotage acts (the tournament itself is rather safe in that story) actually succeed in killing Harry, then that's a bonus. He also doesn't trust Snape, too close to Dumbledore.
