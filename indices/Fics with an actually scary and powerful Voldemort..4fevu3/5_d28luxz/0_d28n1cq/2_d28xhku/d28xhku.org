Oh good, I'm not the only one. I've tried to read Patron so many times, but I've never made it past chapter 25. Every time I see it recc'd by Starfox, I try again. I don't know why it just doesn't hold my interest. I want to like it, and the writing's fairly good, and I liked the premise, but...there's something about it.
