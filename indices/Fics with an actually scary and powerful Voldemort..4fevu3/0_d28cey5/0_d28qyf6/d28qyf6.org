Agreed. A lot of the elements of this fic have aged badly, like katana!Harry, but despite that the Voldemort is pretty awesome. I remember reading this before DH came out and it was the first time I had ever seen a version of Voldemort that was actually strategic and making meaningful steps towards control rather than just performing random attacks on non-strategic locations like Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, which was the standard fanfic back then.
