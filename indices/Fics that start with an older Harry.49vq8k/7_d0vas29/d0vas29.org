All my stories so far start at 4th year or later. "Patron" might fit part of your request. It's an AU, starts in year 4, with a different past, and a different tournament. Harry's friends are not that different, but a number of characters are very different from canon - Lockhart for example is actually no fraud, but known as an author with lots of skilled friends whose adventures he writes about, and not exactly a slouch at magic himself. Daphne's a ditz, Pansy a cunning Slytherin and Hagrid a respected teacher and famous expert on creatures, since one of Dumbledore's first actions after becoming famous for defeating Grindelwald was to reverse his expulsion. Harry's still the BWL though.
