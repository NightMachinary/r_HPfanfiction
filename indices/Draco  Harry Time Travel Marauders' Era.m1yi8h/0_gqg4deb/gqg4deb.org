#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him---and Malfoy---to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.
