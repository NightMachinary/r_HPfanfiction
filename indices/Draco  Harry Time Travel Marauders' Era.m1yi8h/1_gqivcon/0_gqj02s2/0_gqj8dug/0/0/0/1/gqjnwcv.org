  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  Lily has a dream. It's a good dream, full of magic and an adventure, but she wakes up in her warm, safe bed, eleven years old again and magic-less, and cries anyway.

  Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.

  Tribute to Regulus Arcturus Black, a Black, a Slytherin and a hero.(Being both was never an exclusive combination) Do not tell me Slytherin's aren't brave. Do not tell me they aren't loyal. Do not tell me they aren't wise. Look at Regulus Black. He sacrificed himself, avenging a house elf, and died for a chance at peace. He died alone, this brave boy. He rose above his destiny and family legacy and made his choice.

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him.---------------------------------------AKA that unnecessarily long and complicated fic that will lead to an overprotective Harley Keener.Or- that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU literally nobody (including me) was looking for.

  You don't get away with writing an epilogue nineteen years later, giving all these people kids and jobs and telling us they ended up just as their parents were before. These kids fought a war, they didn't leave it unscathed. People died, people were murdered, and they had to go on with this loss in their bones the rest of their lives, with a flinch at every sudden sound and sudden movement, with a cold rattling in their lungs; they had to learn to live again. I want to read about the aftermath. I want to read about everything not being well, but maybe, just maybe, well enough.
