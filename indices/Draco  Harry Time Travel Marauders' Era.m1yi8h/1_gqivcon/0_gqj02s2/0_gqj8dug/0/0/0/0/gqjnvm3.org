  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Lily has revolved around him for years, ever since he held out his hand and made impossible things happen; cracked open her tiny little world and showed her magic.And for the longest time she loves him. And then he rips her apart.“Mudblood," he says, and it's like poison right in the heart of her. She starts coughing.~Basically I got fed up of people online blaming Lily for not loving Snape so I decided fuck it she's getting a fic where she's strong and brave and needs no man, especially not one that treats her like shit thank-you-not-very-much.Yes I'm salty.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

Going back in time, he takes Tom from the orphanage, but his optimism shatters with every year they spend together.Tom still longs for darkness. Tom stifles him in his possessiveness. Tom is fixated on him to the point of destroying the world just to keep him.But Harry loves him. And the future changes.
