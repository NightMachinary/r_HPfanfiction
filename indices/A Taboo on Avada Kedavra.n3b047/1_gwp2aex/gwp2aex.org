I think, overall, the books and the HP world is very well thought out. We do not know where the taboo originates. It could be that Voldemort invented it during the second war. I doubt Dumbledore would have encouraged people to say Voldemort's name if the taboo had been used in the first war. I think if they put a taboo on words like Avada Kedavra, people would learn to do it nonverbally or just come up with different spells. I also think that AK isn't all that easy to cast - Harry struggles with Crucio on people he hates - which would still mean people need other spells in duels.
