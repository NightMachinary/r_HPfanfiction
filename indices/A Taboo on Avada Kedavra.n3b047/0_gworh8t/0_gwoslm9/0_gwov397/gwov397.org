That's because the Trace didn't pick Morfin, but Tom. In Canon, the Trace cannot identify /who/ used Magic, only that Magic was used in the proximity of an underage witch or wizard.

In CoS, Harry received a warning because of that. The Ministry saw that a spell was used in Privet Drive, knew that Harry Lived there and decided he was responsible unless proved otherwise.\\
Also, while the idea is never explored in Canon, Harry should be able to use Magic in any known Magical location (the Burrow, Diagon Alley . . .) without any repercussion because the Trace is ignored from these locations. Since it's impossible to know if a child really used magic or it was just his parents, the Ministry consider that the parents are responsible for their children.

Anyways, the point is that the Ministry saw the Trace being activated in Little Hangleton (and maybe that the Killing Curse was used since CoS ministry knew what charm Dobby used). In the absence of known children living there, they went to investigate and quickly found that all the proofs blamed Morfin Gaunt so they arrested him.
