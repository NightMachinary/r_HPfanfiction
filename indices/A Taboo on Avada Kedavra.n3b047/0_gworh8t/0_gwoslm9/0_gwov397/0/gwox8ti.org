right so an alarm went off only indicating that magic in the presence of a traced wand went off in the riddle house. and then they dont look for the traced wand which is again the problem.

the situation being caused by the trace doesnt make sense it would make more sense with a taboo on the spell.

the only way it works in canon is if Morfins wand has the trace for riddle to activate which is possible or the aurors completely forgot to look for the magical child who was in the building with all the corpses which based on the circumstances could be dead. the only other way it works is if he goes to morfins house sets it up cast the avada kedavra with it multiple times to put it on the wand and then goes and uses his own wand to kill the riddles to activate the trace
