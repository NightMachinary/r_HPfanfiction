Arthur literally got a license to temporarily connect 4 Privet Drive to the Floo network so he could go get Harry. On the books, an adult wizard is going into the house of an underage wizard. It stands within reason that magic may be performed. For Hagrid, the Trace wasn't a thing yet in the first book, so it doesn't count. But even so, I'll humour you and say that the Ministry had no way of knowing who was there, since it wasn't an official residence of the Dursleys.
