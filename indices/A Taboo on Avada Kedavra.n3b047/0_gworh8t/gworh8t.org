  The only scene I'm not sure would work with Taboos in place would be Riddle killing his parents.

In Canon, the murder of the Riddles was immediately detected because of the activation of the Trace. When the Aurors (or whatever magical authority) arrived in Little Hangleton, they found a wizard living there: Morfin Gaunt, whose wand had been used to cast the spell. The man had previously been sentenced for Hexing the same Muggles, and quickly admited the crime (being even able to descrive the events). Because of it, Morfin Gaunt was quickly convicted to Azkaban where he died years later.

I fail to see how the existence of a Taboo on the Killing Curse would change anything in the way Morfin Gaunt was condemned or Tom Riddle got away with murder.
