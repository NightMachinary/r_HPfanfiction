I would love to read a self insert draco fic!!! :) Also yes the self insert could become harry's friend in diagon alley when they first met and also do other not canon rehash stuff like easily stealing the Diary Horcrux and destroying it, and also maybe incriminating Lucius and Narcissa and getting them arrested very early on! :) Then maybe the self insert could go live with Andromeda or something! :) Yes there is so much not canon rehash story potential in this self insert!!! Yes if I was writing this story I would do most of these things I mentioned here, and also yes everything would go very different from the very start. :)

I do not like when self inserts or time travelers in fanfictions sit on their butts for all seven years of Hogwarts just to "maintain the timeline and keep foreknowledge" instead of /actually acting like/ they are committed to ending a war and saving lives, which yes requires /preemptive actions/ and not going to school for seven years doing nothing.

I also really do not like it because time travelers or self inserts are all two shoe goodies who /not only sit around/ on their butts to "maintain the timeline," but who also don't just be more like KYLE REESE, who was a time traveler and unlawful good!!! He went around stealing cars and breaking into places and stuff in his time travel mission, and he was a kind person! /He got things done!/ My self insert or time traveler would be more like Kyle Reese, and just apparate to azkaban with a group of mage mercenaries and break Sirius out, and go right to Dolohov and the other free Death Eater homes and just capture them and turn them all right over to the Order and tell them to stash them in a basement somewhere!

Why would you sit around and follow all the rules and laws and waste so much time trying to get Peter imprisoned and tried and Sirius exonerated and jeez I HATE HOW FANFIC WRITERS DO THESE PLOTS!!! IT IS LIKE THEY ALL JUST TIE THEIR MC'S HANDS BEHIND THEIR OWN BACKS INTENTIONALLY TO WASTE TIME AND STRETCH THE WHOLE PLOT!!! "OH I CAN'T TELL ANYONE I'M A TIME TRAVELER! OH I CAN'T GO OUT LOOKING FOR THE HORCRUXES! OH I CAN'T ENLIST AID IN ANYTHING! OH I CAN'T JUST GO TO AZKABAN AND GET SIRIUS IN HALF A DAY!!! NO I HAVE TO SIT HERE IN SCHOOL AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO BREAK RULES OR BE PROACTIVE!!!" KYLE REESE GOT THINGS DONE BECAUSE HE SAID SCREW THE RULES I HAVE A MISSION TO COMPLETE!!! WHY CAN'T THEY BE LIKE KYLE?! THEY COULD PROBABLY LITERALLY BEAT VOLDEMORT AND DEAL WITH ALL THE DEATH EATERS AND FREE SIRIUS IN LIKE A MONTH IF THEY REALLY ACTED LIKE THEY WERE DESPERATELY COMMITTED TO A TIME TRAVEL MISSION TO SAVE THE PAST!!!

IN FACT YES, I AM SO FREAKING FRUSTRATED ABOUT HOW THESE STORIES ARE HANDLED THAT I AM LOGGING INTO MY QUOTEV RIGHT NOW TO WRITE A MORE TERMINATORY KYLE REESE VERSION OF THE TIME TRAVEL FIX IT STORY!!! MY PROTAGONIST WILL DO IT IN A MONTH.
