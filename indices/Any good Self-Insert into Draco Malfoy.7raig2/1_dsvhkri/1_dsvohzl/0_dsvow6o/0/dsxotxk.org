The SI's presence will change things no matter what; butterfly effect and all, but changing the timeline majorly at the beginning fucks up everything, you lose most of your knowledge, thus your only advantage against the opposite side. A smart SI would begin to change things around 5th year, letting Voldemort resurrect to truly defeat him, using his knowledge, the SI would help Harry indirectly (clues about the horcruxes whereabouts) and directly opposing the compromised ministry (un-imperiusing ministry workers). He would help in the shadows, knowing the dangers of befriending Harry or any important character, he wouldn't draw attention to himself, thus making him seem more powerful and mysterious (if he created an alter-ego). He would know the places and people to strike with his knowledge (again making him seem incredibly powerful and unbeatable). This would be the ultimate SI in terms of effectiveness; what most readers are looking for is someone who interacts with the HP characters, get himself know and yadda-yadda, providing entertainment for himself (the reader).
