I feel like canon!Draco is just wasted potential; it's clear that Rowling created him to be Harry's 'nemesis' (Then Voldemort when he eventually gets resurrected) but he is not only incompetent, idiotic but also weak in terms of power. Rowling should've made him smart, reasonably powerful; countering Harry but not winning against him, plotting and at least playing pranks on Harry (instead of spreading dumbass rumors that are partially true). The 'Nemesis' could have eventually allied himself with Harry, realizing the danger Voldemort posed when he was resurrected. It would have made for a much more original and enjoyable story.
