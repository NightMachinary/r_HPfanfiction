Well yes, in the self insert case they WOULD need to go to Hogwarts to learn their magic stuff, but the time traveling adult? They SHOULD NOT be wasting years in that place hanging out with their childhood friends rather than going out and furthering their mission. :( Also yes there are probably anti apparition charms on Azkaban, but you could just take a boat or a portkey, or imperius a guard to get you in, or polyjuice a guard, or a dozen other things.

Also YES. :) I will make a long adult Draco time travel story!!! :) :) But I am also writing one with Harry that will be very short, to show what he could do if he did not screw around playing with his friends, and pretending to be a kid again like in most fanfics "to keep the timeline" even though he's trying to change it in the first place!!!
