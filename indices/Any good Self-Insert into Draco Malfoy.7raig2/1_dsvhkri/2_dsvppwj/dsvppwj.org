It depends on when the OC becomes Draco, but I would imagine that a self insert would be rather attached to his family by the time they have the capability to actually do anything significant.

The reason they don't suddenly bust into azkaban is that the OC is supposed to be human. They just died and lost everything they ever knew, so it's not surprising that a reincarnated OC would be more interested in just living their life and enjoying it rather than jumping into plans that are likely to get them imprisoned or killed (especially considering most SIs are rather sheltered from their previous safe lives).

In fact, I'd quite like to see an SI/OC "gone wrong" fic, where the protagonist jumps into a big plan to save the world and is instead locked up in azkaban for years instead or some such (perhaps upon release their time leaves them a little twisted, angry at the foreign world that wronged them).
