Found it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3876231/13/Ambition-s-End][Ambitions End]]. Forgot how it ended because it all but my interest dropped after the main mystery conflict was solved. I couldn't get into the romance plotline lol and it felt like it didn't even get to Hermione attempting her ultimate goal for the arrangement in teh first place.
