Ooh, there's also monsterblogofmonsters, which explores creatures and conditions in the wixen world. Often ties in known mythological creatures.

Departmentsofmysteries has case files from the department of Mysteries. There's a little bit of a plot concerning the agents if you choose to read into it, such as a time line, and the agents are all canon characters with code names (no spoilers!). But you can ignore all that and just look at things like a room made to screw with time for the purpose of studying werewolves, or information about the veil. All nicely tagged with a separate tag page where it's broken down.

(sorry I love those two blogs!)
