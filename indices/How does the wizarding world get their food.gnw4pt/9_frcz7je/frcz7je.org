I headcanon that there are one or two pureblood families that deal exclusively in "import/export". And by that, I mean moving things between the muggle and magical world.

Exports? Alchemy made/separated metals and gems. Gems/ores found while mining/excavating. Magically crafted mundane items. Selling old items that would be considered antiques magic is great, ain't it?).

The purebloods may look down on muggles with contempt, but there is most likely one or two families (actual Slytherins, not this legacy sorting BS you see in canon) that saw the potential for gain and took it. Think about it, a wizard made... table (victorian era design), might go for 100-200 pounds in galleons (and be seen as normal in the wizarding world), but in the muggle world, they could go upwards of hundreds of dollars more, since they seem more authentic (and or could be considered antiques).

They have two choices here: A- convert the money at Gringotts and be done with it. Or B- use that muggle money to buy commodities to sell in the wizarding world at normal costs. This probably escapes a currency exchange fee too. That, and there is still profit, because they are selling something they bought at commercial bulk rates at consumer level prices. So this is still another profit.

Why not increase the price? Because this way the government backs off from their dealings with muggles and is a little more... relaxed in their selling of magically made (yet still fundamentally mundane) items to them. And most of the profits are made in the first step.

In a closed caste-based society like Magical Britain, there are only so many monopolies that can be made. And you can be damn sure that the pureblood families would claim their trade as a monopoly. Either by force, law, or by being economically better.
