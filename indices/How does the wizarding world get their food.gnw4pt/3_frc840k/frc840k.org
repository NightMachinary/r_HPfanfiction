I read in a FanFiction once that someone theorised that there were food cupboards that refilled with food every week. The payment was automatically taken from the gringotts vault. Idk seemed pretty muggle-inspired to me but maybe possible.

But tbh it seems like a lot of wizarding families have house elves so probably they just have some sort of house elf market where they can buy and sell produce.
