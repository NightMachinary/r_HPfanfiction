To add to that, just to give a feel of scales:

Generally, it's fair assume a wizarding world of some 15k people in Britain, the size of a small town. 15k people eat 30 t bread/week? That's some 20 t flour or ~25 t wheat/week. That's 1300 t wheat/year. You would think magical crop yields at least as much as the best Muggle crop does, which is ~9 t/HA. So that's ~130 HA, the size of one small to average farm. You arrive at the same result doing price calculations. One farm is enough resp. more than one farm (for one kind of goods) doesn't really work out as a reasonable income for one as rich as Malfoy.

And, of course, Malfoy having a monopoly on, say, wheat, is just how they like it.

And using this, you can imagine two bakeries, one in Hogsmeade, one in Diagon Alley.
