We know that the Malfoys were granted a large amount of land by William the Conqueror.

We know that the Malfoys are very rich.

The main way to extract an income from land is to farm it. I don't see Lucius himself farming but that's quite common - the owner of a load of land will have beneath him a handful of tenant farmers.

So I think one of these 3 must be the case:

1. The Malfoy family grows crops/rears animals for slaughter via wizard tenant farmers

2. The Malfoy family grows crops/rears animals for slaughter via Muggle tenant farmers.

3. The Malfoy family uses their land for something else (magical animals/plants for potion ingredients, perhaps).

I think we can rule out 2, given the Statute of Secrecy as well as the Malfoy family's view of Muggles. So that leaves 1 or 3 - or possibly a combination of them, which is what I went for in Victoria Potter.

  “Aparecium!”

  The spell had been cast by Bertrand, just as the hippogriffs looked like they would gallop straight into a thick hedge. The greenery parted before them, forming itself into a tall arch, and they passed through onto a long dirt track. Fields stretched out on either side, as far as the eye could see, each one divided from its neighbour by a low stone wall. To their left, tall strands of golden winter wheat swayed in the wind; to their right, the field was dotted with burrows, out of which poked small reptilian heads.

  “They're mokes,” Draco explained, seeing Victoria's curious look. “Their skin's used for shrinking things... bags, gloves, stuff like that.”

  “One of our most valuable livestock,” Lucius said. “Sometimes I think Crabbe spends more time fending off poachers than actually looking after the mokes.”

  Victoria blinked. “The Crabbes live here?”

  “Indeed,” Lucius said. “They've been among our leading tenants for several centuries.”

  “The Goyles, too,” Draco added. Suddenly the way Vincent and Gregory followed him around made a lot more sense.

  They continued for several miles down the track. Wheat gave way to peas and broad beans; the moke field was followed by herds of hippogriffs and cattle. Here and there the track would branch, the side paths meandering across the rolling landscape to barns, stables, and rustic cottages with smoke rising from their chimneys.
