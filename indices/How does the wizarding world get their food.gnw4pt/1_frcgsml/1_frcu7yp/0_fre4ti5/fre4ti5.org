Eh, I think it would need more supervision than you're assuming. Enchanting a plow to move by itself, sure. Enchanting it to stop and turn around at the end of the row, move on when the field is done, stop if there's a person or stray animal in the way, etc - much harder. And successfully milking or shearing a herd of animals without direction would be vastly harder again.
