In general, house elves should be able to handle all active involvement necessary. Hogwarts elves for sure would.

I can see how Malfoy, in particular, may not give his elves the necessary leeway for that, or how his elves may simply not do their best unless micromanaged. But then again, that's just speculation. Perhaps he has a more loyal elf than Dobby who's simply told to "tend to the fields".
