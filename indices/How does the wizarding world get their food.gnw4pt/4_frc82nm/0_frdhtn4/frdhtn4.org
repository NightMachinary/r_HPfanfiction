I don't think there's anything in canon, but I think some sort of 'cold cupboard' makes the most sense. Or, like, the milk comes in charmed bottles that stay cold until about the time the milk'll be going sour anyway. If the bottle is warm, it's gone bad. Course that means of the spell breaks it'll go bad anyway and bottle returns.

Either way, I don't they're doing individual charms as they bring stuff home - people forget that kind of thing all the time.

Edit because my brain finished the think: Probably some combination of the two: specialized preservation spells cast by the producer on stuff that needs it and simpler cooling cupboards for whatever else you need it for.

As for where it comes from.

There's definitely some grow what you need going on - the Weasleys have a garden and, i think, chickens. That goes along way, especially with idk accelerated growth spells and a rooster. And I have doubts about the theory that the Hogwarts greenhouses are 100% medicinal and lesson plants - 1st years could definitely be getting the basics on... idk carrots.

But, unless the guy that runs the apothecary is VERY busy, there is a precedent for sourcing outside ingredients. I don't see why there can't be a standard market next door. Probably run by the same family.
