It doesn't really matter. You can create spells, and the most powerful bit of magic shown in the books (as far as pure energy is concerned, anyway) is Gubraithian flame - perpetual fire.

If wizards can manage to create a spell for perpetual energy, they can create spells for preservation as well. Refrigerators have been around since the early industrial ages, so any enterprising wizard with a knowledge of muggle advances could have created such a spell in the 150 odd years of the refrigerator's existence.

A spell also does not need to mimick the refrigerator's cooling effect. Adding spices to food is a form of preservation, along with pickling food. A spell that does either of those things will suffice as well.
