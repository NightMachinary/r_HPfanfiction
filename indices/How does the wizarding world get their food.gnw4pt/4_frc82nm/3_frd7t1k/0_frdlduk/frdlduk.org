I can't remember any references to stasis charms in canon, though. (At first, I thought there was a preservation spell on the ruined Potter cottage, but from searching, it seems to have just been left untouched).

Personally, I don't like the idea that much. Couldn't someone just preserve their food forever and keep on duplicating it so they'd never have to buy food?
