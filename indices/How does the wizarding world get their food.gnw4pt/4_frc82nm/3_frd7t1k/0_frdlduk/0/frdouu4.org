I think we are running into one of the plot holes that exist when you look at the various permutations of the issue. For instance, we are told under Gamps Law that food is one of the exceptions to conjuring out of nothing. Eg you can't conjure food. We are also told that you can't transfigure food, i.e., if you transfigure a rock into bread and eat the bread it will eventually return back to rock causing you serious problems.

We are told that you can summon food. We are also shown that you can increase the amount of food by using the Engorgement charm. But that begs the question of where did this extra food come from? It can't appear out of thin air as that would violate Gamps law, and if you transfigure non-food into food it will revert and cause problems. So if you have one lb of vegetables and use the Engorgement charm to now have 2 lbs of vegetables where did that new lb of vegetables come from?

So since canon really doesn't tell us how food is acquired or stored that leaves a lot of flexibility for fan fic authors to explore a lot of alternatives.
