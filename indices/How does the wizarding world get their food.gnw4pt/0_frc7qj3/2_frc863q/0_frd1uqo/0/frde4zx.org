They just shit their pants and then vanished the evidence. There was a whole Pottermore tweet about it!

  Hogwarts didn't always have bathrooms. Before adopting Muggle plumbing methods in the eighteenth century, witches and wizards simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence.

What the fuck.

  "Yer a wiz- hnnnggg"

  Hagrid's face screwed up in concentration.

  "Hol' on a sec. Hnnngggg!"

  A dreadful, overpowering stench permeated the cabin as Harry and the Dursleys gagged and retched in disgust. Apparently, the giant man, with no warning or justification, had decided to push out an equally giant shit right into his pants as he stood there talking to Harry.

  Hagrid then produced a gaudy pink umbrella and, looking down over his shoulder, pointed the tip of it at the back of his trousers, which were now visibly bulging and seeping with shit.

  "Now then, what is the meaning of this?!" bellowed Uncle Vernon. Dudley, meanwhile, could no longer take the horrid smell, and began to vomit all over Aunt Petunia's shoes, while she shrieked in horror, "Oh Dudders, not on mummy's shoes!"

  "Er... /evanesco shit/," Hagrid muttered, giving the umbrella a little wiggle and a squishy poke to his bum.

  The shocking smell and the lumpy wet bulge both promptly vanished, and Hagrid beamed.

  "Yer a wizard, Harry!"
