I'm going to have to search to find the fics but one fic has the wizarding goverment stealing a portion of the muggle harvest and storing it in a central facility where it can be acquired by any wizarding family.

The other fic had elves going to a handful of squib owned grocery stores and acquiring the food after hours. I believe both fics hypothesized how the Malfoys would lose their minds if they knew they had been eating muggle food.

Life Sucks Then You Die by Radaslab discusses a central food distribution. I believe this is the story where they first steal the food from the muggles.

I'm not sure if any of the stories truly address why magicals are not aware of muggle brands if they are getting the food from the muggles. For families with elves you could believe that they never see the food in the package they just see the unwrapped food on a plate. (Finding out that Draco's favorite bedtime snack is a tasty little pastry his elf makes special for him otherwise known as a Twinkie).

For those without elves like the Weasleys you have a different problem about brand recognition. A possible explanation is that central distribution just eliminates the packaging and changes it to a clear package so you can see what you're purchasing and primarily keeping towards raw materials not finished products (eg no already baked cakes but flour, sugar, cream, butter etc can be purchased).
