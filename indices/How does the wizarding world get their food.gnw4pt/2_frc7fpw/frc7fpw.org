It's possible to increase the quantity of food by magic, although we can assume that this is fairly difficult, given that the trio couldn't do it in the seventh book. So beyond NEWT level. Or alternatively the trio did increase their food supply off screen, but there were limits to how much it could be increased.

Another possibility that was mentioned in the books was that you could summon food, if you know where it is. It's possible that wizard grocers are just stealing it from the muggle world via magic. Considering how much food muggles actually produce, this might very well go undetected, depending on how careful the wizards are.

Or perhaps they won't bother to cast accio all day long and as you said, that the grocers/government buy food from the muggle world and sell it to other wizards. That way only a small number of wizards would have intimate knowledge of the muggle world, while the rest would buy it with wizard money from magical stores.

There could be plantations, with house elf workers, that grow a variety of food and potion supplies. Malfoys could very well be growing all of their food, if Dobby or his replacement did all the actual work.
