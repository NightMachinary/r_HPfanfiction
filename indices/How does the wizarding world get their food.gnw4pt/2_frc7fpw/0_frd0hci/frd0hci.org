  It's possible to increase the quantity of food by magic, although we can assume that this is fairly difficult, given that the trio couldn't do it in the seventh book. So beyond NEWT level. Or alternatively the trio did increase their food supply off screen, but there were limits to how much it could be increased.

Important to note that the trio didn't lack for food in the literal sense. In the DH "Gamp's law" scene they have fish and mushrooms. The problem is that they don't know how to turn those ingredients into something palatable (to be fair, how many 17-year-olds know how to fillet a fish) and they can't use magic to just conjure up something palatable instead.
