I can't remember which fic it was in, but the reason they used quills and parchment is that quills, having come from living animals, can channel minute amounts of magic, and imbue parchment, which can also retain that magic better than muggle paper or regular wizarding stationary, with the students' magical signatures.

So by using a simple spell, they can compare an assignment's magical signature with the signature on record for a student and instantly verify whether a student wrote it themselves.

I think it was also expanded upon in that contracts were also on parchment and signed with quills for this same reason. By using magical signatures (embedded within the written signature), a contract can be verified by simply checking for valid and correct magical signatures.

It's been the most logical reason behind parchment and quills for students when they clearly have printing presses and normal books and such.
