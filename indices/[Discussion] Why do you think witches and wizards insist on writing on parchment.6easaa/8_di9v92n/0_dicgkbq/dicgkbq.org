That explanation does not sit well with me. Living trees are at least possibly magical (wandwood), and if mundane animalskins work, mundane tree pulp should too. At that point, the best justification you could have is that machinery, or prolonged contact with metal, channels magic out of formerly living things, but then you could easily produce paper using only non-metallic substances & magic, especially once plastics were invented.

Similarly, it is trivial, again especially if using magic to manufacture, to create modern pens entirely out of 'organic' materials.
