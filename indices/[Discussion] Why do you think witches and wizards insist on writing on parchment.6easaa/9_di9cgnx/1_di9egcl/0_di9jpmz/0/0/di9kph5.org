That I agree with, normal quills generally aren't more sturdy than metal or wood. Certainly, quills won't break in the middle of writing the way pencils can (which is why you are a fool if you don't carry a sharpener with you and that's that, it's a few seconds to get it working again if you do), but they do definitely get worn down quicker than wood, though I can't say about plastic as it's a gamble with that one, and alas metal as the main building material for pens is not the most common thing when it comes to the cheapest stuff.
