Parchment holds onto ink better, I think. Aside from that, it's likely harder to use magic on as it's thicker, making it harder to cheat on homework. Quills have more longevity than pencils or pens as they can't break in the middle of class while you're writing an important essay, due to them being made of stronger materials than simple wood or plastic (Quills have metal tips I believe). There's also something to say about the fact that pens/pencils are muggle inventions and wizards want to show that because something is new, doesn't automatically make it superior, maybe just more convenient.
