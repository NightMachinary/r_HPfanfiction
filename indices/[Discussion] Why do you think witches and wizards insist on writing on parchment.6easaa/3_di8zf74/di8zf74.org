Easy to produce. I made a point in another thread, that the Duplication Charm, canonically doesn't vanish and disappear after a certain amount of time, dispute what fanon claims. Instead it is more prone to rot and tarnish, becoming "worthless". Geminio increases the reactivity of items. However, parchment is much studier than paper, and likely can stand up to a lot more abuse, and time. At that point, it is a matter of convenience. For a society which values knowledge above all else, the power to copy a book, or some notes instantly and perfectly is invaluable. We don't even have that capability in 2017. We have to scan a book, then print each page. Yes, we can mass produce books, but for a tiny society which doesn't really benefit from automation, being able to just copy something in a second is amazing.

The Daily Prophet doesn't have to last long. It is probably better if it does decay faster, if it gets left out in the Muggle world for whatever reason.

Anyway, we don't really know what Wizarding books are made of. They may well be made of a magically refined parchment. Imagine taking a large piece of parchment, and then shrinking it, so it is as thin as paper, but retains it's properties.

There are a lot of explainations for weird things in the Wizarding World, if you think a bit. Hope this helps!
