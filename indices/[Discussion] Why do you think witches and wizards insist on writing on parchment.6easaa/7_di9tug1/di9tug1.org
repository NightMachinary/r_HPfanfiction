Isolation I believe. For many magicals who are born into magical families, they would hear about the non-magical world from their parents/grandparents before Hogwarts. Dumbledore was born at the end of the 19th century and he was still alive at 1990s. So think about it: the headmaster of Hogwarts was born in an era where a lot of people in non-magical world were still using parchments and quills. (Pottermore says 1881) I'm sure there are also many grandparents that were born at similar dates. Even Arthur Weasey had been so clueless about muggle items, just imagine how cluless others would be. And imagine those people living only with their kind in their own isolated world. Where would they learn about muggles? Their own parents first and then from muggleborn children in Hogwarts. (And I'm sure there wouldn't be much information transfer from muggleborns to magicals. It would be opposite. Muggleborns would ask many questions about magic.) And what would they say about the non-magical world to their children/grandchildren? About what little they know. And in the non-magical world, people used quills and parchments even in 1800s (although they started fountain pens, it was only the rich people who used them). So isolation is my answers to your question.

Also from that perspective: magicals seeing muggles as barbarians with no worth is also actually very possible thing even in 1990s. Imagine how different lives of muggles and magicals would be in the middle ages. In a fic I read long ago, there was a line sth like that: "They were still using chamber pots and cleaning them with their hands while we could just enchant them the vanish it". In middle ages, wizards and witches would live like gods. Their living standarts would be much much better than even non-magical royality. And if they had little to no contact with non-magicals, they would have no need to borrow ideas from them thinking them to be still primitive. Maybe one or two people in every generation would check out non-magical contraptions and try to make magical counterparts but it would be a very slow process.

I believe one reason could also be that there are many enchanted quills and parchments and instead of changing all of those, it makes it easier to continue tradition. And perhaps those blood quills had some sort of real use instead of torturing children?
