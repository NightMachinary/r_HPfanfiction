My guess is that it all comes down to the underlying mindset of producing materials with magic, and the fact that mass production hasn't been introduced in the wizarding world.

Wizards have magic, and (with the only notable exception being potions) use it almost exclusively through their wands. This means that if a wizard is going to make a thing, he's going to cast spells on stuff with his wand until he produces what he wants. Any sort of complex machinery isn't going to be useful or anything a wizard considers making, because machines can't cast magic, and a wizard can only cast one spell at a time.

So way back in the day, wizards and muggles alike discovered that they could make parchment by treating animal skin in a certain way. But for muggles, they eventually needed a faster method of production. You can only raise or catch and kill animals so fast. You have to wet and dry and wet and dry the skin. There are lots of limiting factors in the process that can't be done any faster. However, for wizards, this isn't the case at all. A wizard can soak, dry, stretch, or treat the skin in an instant. Transfiguration means that the source materials don't necessarily have to be animals in the first place. Hell, there's probably a transfiguration spell to simply make something into parchment immediately. And perhaps most significantly, there are charms to duplicate and increase the quantity of materials with virtually no limits. So basically, individual wizards could produce as much parchment as they needed, as fast as they needed, and never needed to look into alternate products.

Another point to consider is that the magical population is /significantly/ lower than the muggle population. So in many cases, mass production is not something that would necessarily be as needed or cost-efficient in the wizarding world.

And also, parchment doesn't necessarily have to come in rolls. Some very simple charms that probably every wizard can do could lengthen, cut, and reshape it. The only reason we've heard so much about rolls of parchment is because the books are mostly set in Hogwarts, and rolls of parchment seems to be the standard for school essays.

I hope that gave a decent answer to your question. I've thought about stuff like this a lot, and have a ton more thoughts on the matter that I could provide if you're curious. But basically, to understand the specific stuff the wizarding world uses, you have to think way back and boil it down to the basic underlying philosophies and how magic would influence the culture from the ground up, because it really makes things a /lot/ different. A common mistake is to look at the differences in materials and technology and think that the wizarding world is simply a couple centuries behind the muggle world, because that isn't true at all. Instead, it's developed in a different direction.

TL;DR: Production with magic involves an entirely different philosophy, it's all about craftsmanship as opposed to mass production.
