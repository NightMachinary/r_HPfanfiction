I think its simply because of tradition. Its not like wizard would actually have a problem with the cost of it when they can simply produce cheap parchment with the use of transfiguration. It probably also allows them to feel superior to most muggles who couldn't afford to use parchment in amounts that large.

The reason why they use quills is probably because by the times pens were invented there was already a established market of enchanted quills. I mean why would you integrate pens into your society if you have quills which are self inking, spell checking, can be dictated what to write, and can answer automatically.
