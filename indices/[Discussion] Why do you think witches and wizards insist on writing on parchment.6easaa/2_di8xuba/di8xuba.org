Some thoughts on the matter:

- Tradition. Wizards love it.

- Government corruption. Perhaps the wizarding parchment manufacturers paid for a law to be passed restricting the sales of paper for use as stationary.

- Parchment is tougher than paper. Perhaps this is needed to stand up to the rigors of a magical learning environment.
