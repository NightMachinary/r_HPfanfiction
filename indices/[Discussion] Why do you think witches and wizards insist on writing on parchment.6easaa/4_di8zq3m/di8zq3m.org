All parchment actually comes from a breed of magical cows whose skin is particularly receptive to enchantments, and all kinds of parchments Hogwards allows students to use are enchanted with "anti-dictaquil" and some other anti-cheat methods. Why else do you think the muggle-borns haven't revolutionized writing equipment yet?

That's why magical contracts are made with parchment but books and the like don't need to use it. Of course, the binding of the books still uses the material and is thus very enchantable too.

There, kinda makes sense no?
