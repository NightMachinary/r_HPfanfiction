I do hate them, especially because they always turn out pretty much exactly the same way. I usually say that I hate manipulative!Dumbledore, just because saying that excludes the majority of awful fics that use that trope, but I'd be pretty open to a fic where he was manipulative or outright evil if it was done well. So far I haven't found one example of this.

A cliche I'm not fond of is the Ice Queen!Daphne characterization, because the character is virtually an OC save for the fact that she is Slytherin and (if I recall correctly) a pureblood. You could write her virtually any way you wanted, yet the fanon seems to have conjured up a characterization for her, and it's an awful one. Again, I'd be open to this if the fics that featured it actually did it properly. The biggest issue is that even though she's supposed to be a cold and aloof character, she warms up to Harry in the span of about three chapters, so what's the point?
