I hate a lot of independent harry ones. They feature a lot of the common cliches and they way they make Dumbledore look like an idiot boggles me. Like give the man some credit he has multiple high government positions defeated Grindlewald in a duel and know more about magic than all of Britannia pretty much. If he is as manipulative as they make him out to be in the stories then he should be able to trick a 15 year old. Make him evil sure but don't make him dumb evil. Also the nickname they give him in all of those fanfics is annoying. Don't have Harry call him Dumbles which is what a fourth grader would call him have Harry call him Albus that at least shows he doesn't respect him anymore but wont stoop down to 1st year name calling
