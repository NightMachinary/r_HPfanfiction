I absolutely hate abusive Ron who obviously keeps Hermione captive against her will. Another cliche I hate is Death Eater Ron.

If you don't like Ron, just have their friendship drift apart in the background. Maybe Harry takes different electives in yr 3 or they never kiss and make up in year 4. But you can grow apart from someone and not hate them or join a terrorist cult for revenge or whatever.
