The difference is that canon Hermione /thinks/ she knows everything and you're wrong if she's wrong if she doesn't understand something it just isn't possible thus she rejects it and that's absolutely ridiculous. I'm not surprised she didn't have any friends outside of Ron and Harry. Cliche Fanfic Hermione just legit knows everything like she's a walking encyclopedia.
