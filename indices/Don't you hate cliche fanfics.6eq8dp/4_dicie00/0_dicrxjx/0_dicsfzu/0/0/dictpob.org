There is a difference in thinking you're right and actually knowing you're right. Canon Hermione's arguments half the time are "That's wrong because it just is" while happening to be right (And sometimes be wrong) but she doesn't actually have reasons

Fanon Hermione's are "This is right because x,y, & z" with solid reasoning and research in a short time-frame all the while being 12 years old
