But even if she /thinks/ she's right, she end up being right in the end. I'm not saying it's not a character flaw, when it's brought up (ex: the whole scabbers being eaten by crookshanks ordeal and the Firebolt) Hermione went about it in a stubborn way and all wrong but ends up being right.

That's why I'm saying the way canon Hermione was written doesn't help the omniscient Hermione fanon argument. If she always ends up being right in the end what's the damn point of not listening to her.

Which makes book 6 Hermione very weirdly written. It's like Rowling forgot 5 years of shenanigans and plot so Ron and Hermione can act the way they did.
