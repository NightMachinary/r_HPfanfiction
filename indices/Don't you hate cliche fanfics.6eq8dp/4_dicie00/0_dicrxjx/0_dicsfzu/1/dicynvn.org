That what I like about canon hermione because that a real human reaction she's used to being that smart kid who knew everything now she's in a world were there are so many more possibilities that you couldn't possibly know all of it. She knows magic is real but since she grew up in the muggle world she probably still uses the muggle world as a reference as what is possible or not.
