I don't hate them. They're not my favorite fics, but essentially they're just as good as any other fic with cliché's that have gone stale. If it's a nice read, I would not throw it away.

I don't care about cliché's much. All of literature has evolved from cliché's. The Lord of the Rings-style of writing has been done to death after the original trilogy. For example: Game of Thrones is inspired by Tolkien's work. And it's still good. Also, how many fantasy fics use Orcs, Dwarves and Elves? I won't say Tolkien was the /first/, but he definitely set a trend. Is that bad? Of course not. Sure, there will be books, fics or whatever that use the races of Tolkien, of plotpoints from fanfics, but if its written well, does it really matter?
