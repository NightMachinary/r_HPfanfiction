I have a cliche threshold, I can manage maybe one or two, depending on how overused it is and how interesting is the story, but OOC Friendly Goblins almost invariably make me close the fanfic.

Another cliche - Snape as Draco's godfather. I'm starting to think people take it as canon. But not only was it never mentioned, it doesn't even make any sense, especially not post-HBP book! Older generation pureblood Slytherins should have known about the scandal of Eillen Prince marrying a muggle, or, at the very least, that Snape is not a pureblood name. Not to mention, he went by Half-Blood Prince in school! Why would Lucius choose a halfblood for a godfather of his son? At the start of HPB, if Snape was Draco's godfather, Narcissa would have used that to convince him to help, instead she only says that he's Draco's favorite teacher.

The next one - lets get rid of Harry's horcrux by removing the scar! This one is probably mostly a misconception, but its in every fanfic that changes the way horcuxes are dealt with ever, so it's very annoying and would have been easily avoided if people just stopped to think how illogical it is. Horcrux is in Harry, not just in Harry's scar! You can't get rid of it by just removing the scar! It's a curse scar caused by especially dark magic (Avada Kedavra), it even looks like AK wand movement, so that's probably why, in combination with the piece of Voldermort's soul inside Harry (not just inside the scar), it causes pain to Harry when Voldemort is near. The scar is not separate in any way from the rest of the body, how do you even make it a separate container for the soul. That container is Harry himself.
