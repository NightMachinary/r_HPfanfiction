the problem is usually to many 'fix-it rants' that explain everything away and the plot quickly becomes more of a wiki discussion than a story, and stale. if harry is a lord and political then write the story differently. the most obvious thing is that a 12 year old can't reorganise the ministry, just bump the whole thing forward a decade, or whatever.
