1) Harry's abilities would, in my mind, make the full time deployment of an agent reasonable. For the sake of the story, maybe even have him fall into this world and help Black Widow out (or make him fall out of whatever Black Widow tried to prevent - Tesseract induced dimensional rift, whatever... your call).

He has a basic idea of magic, and I think you could reasonably argue that with training and focus, he could work on making himself more knowledgable/powerful by formulating his own magical theory in time.

2) Levitation, Lockpicking, some basic transfigurations (material change, color change, form change, inanimate to animate), some defensive spells. Incendio, Aguamenti, Lumos,... I'd agree on a very rough "makes the target a vegetable" Obliviate.

3) As I said, through mental training and discipline, Harry could "basic research" his abilities as a wizard and formulate his own magical theory with time and effort. We know that Uagadou, for example, teaches a lot of wandless magic, instead of the mainly foci-bound magic Hogwarts teaches. I think you can get plenty creative there before you hit a wall of disbelief. The magic of Harry and the magic of the Sorcerers are quite different anyway. Harry is in himself a source of magic, while sorcerers use the energies of the multiverse to do magic, so an outside force. In that he may eventually become quite interesting to them, given his unique way of doing magic.

4) The wand is a focus. We know from Pottermore (no matter if you think of that as canon or not. I think of it as sometimes good inspiration) that there are different dogmas of magic use. Uagadou, as I already said, teaches wandless magic and uses foci only for more complex magic. There are also staffs, and I could think of many more reasonable foci to use. If you want to go with the Marvel universe, maybe you could let Harry find an item made from [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Uru][Uru]] (the stuff Thor's Hammer is made from). Or maybe he is the only one who can use the [[http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Darkhold][Darkhold]] without being corrupted. The Marvel universe allows for a lot of creativity there.
