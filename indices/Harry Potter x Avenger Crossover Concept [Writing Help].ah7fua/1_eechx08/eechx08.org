I love this way more than im supposed to. I like the idea of sending someone trustworthy, and for that I think maybe cap America? I think they have a lot in common (all the crap I don't like about harry I also dislike about him) and he could give Harry the perspective that this world is also worth saving etc. Maybe also get him in touch with a family (clint's for ex) would bring him that weasley vibe and he would become attached.

Spells. I think that would be the hardest part since in avengers world that would be no one to teach him stuff. That way I think you could either bring the whole golden trio (hermione would teach him in that sense) or just teach him a very few spells and let him learn the basics of wandless magic with dr. Strange. That would also create the possibility of wand breaking and not relying solely on it. Spells could be all duel spells he already has. Maybe accio even though is a fourth year spell.

That's it I hope you find this useful and you can understand most of it (English is my second language). Congrats on the awesome idea!
