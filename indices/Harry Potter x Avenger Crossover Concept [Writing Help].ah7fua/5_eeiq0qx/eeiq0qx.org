Fourth year Harry winding up in Avengers world when he touches the TWT cup would make things so much easier perhaps even cleaner because at that point he would have enough knowledge to be powerful without being OP and you wouldn't need to invent ways for him to acquire new knowledge, he could just make do with what he already knows and maybe he could just work on using what he already knows more effectively and/or creatively instead.

But if it has to be "/post 2nd YR Harry but pre 3rd YR Harry"/ then absorbing the horcrux's knowledge could be an options to increase his own but then the question is how will that work exactly not to mention 16 years old TMR's knowledge would very probably make Harry, if not instantly then eventually, incredibly OP for Avengers world.

A 12-13 year old Harry has no idea that he is carrying part of someone else's soul with him, has no idea about any kind of mind magic apart from obliviate so he can't just decide that 'oh I'll just connect to the horcrux and learn from it'.

There has to be an event that would make Harry realize he has access to some knowledge even if he has no idea how it's possible or why. People used this trope in different ways, in some cases Harry, after some traumatic event or something, just absorbs every bit of knowledge horcrux had instantly and just continuous on instantly. Some "authors" write some line like 'I have to sort all of this new knowledge' or similar bs to give illusion of Harry not really having a great handle on what he absorbed but that line is usually gets forgotten quite quickly when plot demands it. I think having horcrux talk to him is even worse.

I'll recommend treating horcrux just as collection of memories and making Harry see part of some lectures TMR attending in his dreams he would recognize he's somehow watching TMR's memories and they are helpful so he tries to put himself under hypnotic sleep or something or may be someone from SHIELD or some other character from that world could help him with accessing the memories at least initially.

About the wand issue

If he will just learn to do everything he could do with a wand, without it, then just don't break it.

Unless you have a great idea for how Harry acquires new material/object to use in place of a wand or you're confident you could write him learning wandless magic in a exciting way which is pretty hard to do.

Usually we get stuff like 'Harry concentrated again but after -some amount of time- later feather was still standing. He vowed to work on this as long as it took him.' then later in the same chapter 'After -some amount of time- Harry's hearth filled with joy, when he saw the feather rise up' then in next chapter we see a line like 'He continued his studies in wandless magic' and then in the next chapter Harry is the master of wandless magic.
