oooh, this sounds fun.\\
only thing i have an idea for is #4. when it comes to wand alternatives, i keep thinking about the method used in "Merlin", a tv movie from...late 90s i think (edit: 98). Here, magic is taught in three stages: Incantation, gesture, and finally mind/will alone. I dont recall a lot of the specifics (like if there were specific incantations for the first stage), but it was an interesting way to go about it.\\
(the series was based on Mary Stewarts Arthurian Saga...i think)
