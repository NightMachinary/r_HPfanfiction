Good is subjective. Besides even at it's worst A Cadmean Victory is pretty okay by fanfiction standards. Also the Harry Fleur romance was definitely one of the better Harry/Fleur pairings. (Most Harry/Fleur is either harem,veela bond, 1 dimensional characters or all of the above)

It's not an high standard, but there are many fanfics worse, that don't get called abysmal just because someone has the temerity to suggest them.
