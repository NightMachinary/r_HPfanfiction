The whole set-up for Harry's brooding isolation via Katie was the worst example of a rectally-inserted idiot ball I have ever read. And if you need that much idiocy to make the plot work, the story sucks, just look at HBP.

And the story is incredibly trope-y as well, which is again not the sign of quality writing.

Also, just this line

#+begin_quote
  "I don't forgive. I don't forget."
#+end_quote

should be more than enough to void any argument in favour of this story.

#+begin_quote
  that don't get called abysmal just because someone has the temerity to suggest them.

I am not just now calling "Cadmean Victory" terrible.
