Yes the story had plenty issues, Katies whatever that was was definitely a major one. Still doesn't deserve to be put down when suggested.

I don't really understand why people keep bringing "I don't forgive. I don't forget." up as a negative example. Like we had a 14 year old spout a cringey line in a moment of high emotion, so unrealistic /s. Harry even realizes himself later on that it was cringey.
