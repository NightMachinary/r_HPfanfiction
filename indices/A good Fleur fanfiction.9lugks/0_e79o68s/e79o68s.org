Good as in.. a harem story featuring an attractive blond who wants to have sex with Harry or featuring well written characters and plots?

​

The majority of stories with that pairing is harem and Mary Sue Lord Harrison Potter-Black-Peverall stories where Fleur and the other women are little more than mindless sex automatons for the auth-...Sorry..."Harry" to sleep with. If that is your jam, pick any harem story that mentions Fleur or Gabrielle in the summary or the character filters on FFN. Some of them are at least decently written, the worst are at least not as badly written as My Immortal.

​

Otherwise, there are a few few decent to great stories including:

​

linkffn(12627473) : Harry Potter and the Half-blood romantic

​

Arguably the best Harry/Fleur story out there if well written characters and interactions are what you are seeking. The story is a slow burn on the romance side and the main story takes place during an alternate retelling of the Half-Blood Prince. It isn't complete and there is no serious relationship between Harry and Fleur as of yet but as of the last chapter Fleur is still engaged to Bill Weasely during the buildup of the emotional and physical tension with Harry. Some people have mentioned being repelled by the cheating element of the story so I am letting you know beforehand.

​

linkffn(8604692) : Taking Umbridge

​

Like the aforementioned story, this is set after the events of the Goblet of Fire and Fleur has joined Hogwarts as an instructor. Takes the POV of Fleur instead of Harry which makes it an interesting mirror to the Half-blood Romantic. Just a warning this isn't a fluff piece, the main story is Fleur dealing with a personal history of child abuse.

​

linkffn(11287688) : In spite of Obstinate Men

​

More of a Poirot inspired investigation featuring Fleur's father. The Fleur and Harry romance isn't the main focus of the text and their interactions is more of them maturing and getting to know each other and the course of them transforming from enemies to friends. The sequel focuses on the blossoming relationship and eventual romance between Harry and Fleur.

​

linkffn(11624519) : In Spite of Appearances

​

This is the sequel to ISOM, and the relationship between Harry and Fleur is at the forefront. As a warning, it's not finished and the author jumps between updating stories on an irregular basis.

​

There are a few more worth mentioning, but these are a good place to start.

​

​

Stories to avoid if you want characters:

​

As mentioned, pretty much every Harem story that features Fleur or Gabrielle. Also I would avoid:

​

linkffn(6535391) : Letters

​

The author of the story posts on this subreddit from time to time. I find his latest series (It's not a Fleur x Harry pairing...in fact people who like Fleur might not like how his current series is progressing) to be enjoyable overall and his best work, much better than Letters to be sure. But this seems to be one of his most recommended stories.

​

In full disclosure, there are some good parts. There is some early Daphne x Harry and his alternate ending pairing chapters lends the story a sort of choose-your-own-adventure quality, which is slightly amusing in how angry some readers get over that aspect. There are also elements of the Harry x Fleur relationship that are well written, but it's really hidden under wasted potential. Unless you want brief fluff elements interspersed with a pointless and auto-resolving main story I would skip it.
