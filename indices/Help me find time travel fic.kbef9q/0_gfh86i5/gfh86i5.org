I've read this. Let me think.

IIRC this is the one where he kills Voldie, bops around for a while as a badass Auror, then stumbles across living Dumbledore, James, Lily, and a couple of younger siblings born after Halloween 1981. He realizes that his entire life was orchestrated, so he travels to the past to do it over.

Because he's a time traveller he does well in all his classes. He made sure he came in 1st place at the end of second year but doesn't ask to take all the electives until the beginning of third year. That way Dumbledore has already approved it for the Gryffindor in 2nd place and has to allow it for the Slytherin in 1st place, but Harry was sure that if he asked at the same time as Hermione, then Dumbledore would have denied them both.

Each time turner has just enough time sand for classes so the kids can't abuse it. Harry convinces Hermione to take him back with her instead of two separate trips; she doesn't realize he's using the sand he saves to break school rules.

At some point he does a ritual in the Forbidden Forest naked in the snow. Snape feels the ritual energy and comes to bawl him out.

...all this and I can't remember the name! I hope someone else does because now I wanna reread it.
