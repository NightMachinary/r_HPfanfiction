Edit: Whoops, sorry, forgot to add anything but the link.

He does it a few times in this (Harry Potter: Geth). It's a crossover of HP and Mass Effect though. Other than this story, I haven't come across one where he can fly without outside influence like Voldemort is shown doing.

The author has a bad habit of replacing every usage of 'while' with 'whilst', including places where it just wouldn't be used. I only bring it up because it bothers me a bit, because everyone uses it like that, even hardcore American type characters in the middle of a war zone.
