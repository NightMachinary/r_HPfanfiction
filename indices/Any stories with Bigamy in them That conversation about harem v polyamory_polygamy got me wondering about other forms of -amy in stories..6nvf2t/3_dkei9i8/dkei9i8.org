Quatermass has some pretty good Lunar Harmony (Harry/Hermione/Luna) fics. the only that is really pure Lunar Harmony that I've read is Just A Touch of Kleptomania. linkffn(12369862) Most wind up with some sort of harem, but Lunar Harmony is the core. (Mainly because they make a Freudian Trio: Luna is the impulsive Id, Hermione is the intellectual Superego, and Harry is the grounded Ego.)
