#+begin_quote
  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
