Nice. I like it. I've seen that used so many times, and that never came to mind. You've brought up these related thoughts, though:

"Basilisk venom, Mr. Potter? From what I understand, it is both highly toxic and exceedingly corrosive. Are you aware of how many small nicks and splinters I receive whilst working on wands? What makes you think that I, or any other wandmaker, would be sufficiently reckless as to work with such a substance? I'll thank you to leave my establishment now."

"Phoenix tears? Mr. Potter, should I attempt to put the most powerful healing agent known to wizards in a wand, do you know what I would then have? No, Mr. Potter, not a powerful wand. Not a wand of any sort. A sapling, Mr. Potter. I would have a sapling!"

"Phoenix tears and basilisk venom? I am not a potions master, Mr. Potter. I have no idea how the two will behave when combined, nor, given the expense and volatility of the substances, do I wish to experiment with them. Nor, were I so inclined, have you provided enough for me to test with every combination of wood and core with which I work. I shouldn't be telling you, or anyone else, Mr. Potter. However, please accept and understand this small bit of wandlore. It is the structure of the connection between the wood and the core that gives a wand the ability to channel magic. A wand without a core is merely a piece of wood. Neither can a heartstring, feather, or hair be used by itself."

"It is the structure of the connection between the core and the wood that determines how well a wand will work, and for whom. At its finest level of detail, that cannot be controlled. That, Mr. Potter, is why wandmakers maintain a large stock of wands, and why I say that the wand chooses the wizard. We make no custom wands. Phoenix tears and basilisk venom cannot be used in wands because they are liquids and have no structure. I have no idea whether the traces left behind after they evaporate will work as a wand core. Even if they do, the connection will be arbitrary. Such a wand may work for you, but in all likelihood, it will not."
