Leroy woke to a heavy thump near his head with a start. Bleary looking around he saw two things and knew something was up.

First was a stack of newspapers thick as his head. The second was his boss Veronica standing over him looking mighty wrathful.

Gulping he tried to remember what it could be. Sure the end of season party had gotten a wee bit out of hand. He was sure though they hadn't gotten any pregnant, this time, or destroyed anything.

Reading the first headline he groaned as memories started coming back into focus.

*Fiendfyre Flames Completely Cover Malfoy Manor!*

/The last members of the Malfoy family died last night in a horrible tragedy. A large group of distraught soon to be first years soon made their way to the manor once word spread. One young girl had to be restrained as she attempted to enter the building screaming about having to save her "Sweet sweet Drarry ship!"/

*Fisticuffs Fight in Diagon Alley.*

/Several soon to be first years of Hogwarts were brawling in the Alley today. The reason for the arguement was truly astounding. The group was broke into two main camps, one which "couldn't wait to see their dark prince Professor Snape" and the second which is quoted as saying "I hope he does the world a favor and dies using an Erumpent horn dildo". It became a brutal brawl after that./

*Largest Class of 1st years in nearly three hundred years at Hogwarts!*

/You read that right! This years class has the single largest group of nearly two hundred students headed off to Hogwarts. When asked why they accepted so many instead of sending them along to other schools in the isle Headmaster Dumbledore stated "We are still trying to figure out exactly what happened but the Quill of Hogwarts constitutes a binding contract."/

*Stop visiting my house! My wife is fine now thank you very much!*

/While we at the Quibbler appreciated the helps that came about and saved my wife Selene from a spell crafting accident we can safely say she is fine now! Please stop coming by to check on her. We also greatly appreciate the friends my daughter had made these last few days. However we have lives outside of endless play date everyday so please stop visiting so we can get work done!"/

Leroy stopped reading the first paragraphs at this point and just skimmed through the various article headlines.

*Goblins Confiscate LeStrange Vault!*

*Sirius Black Not a Death Eater! Petergrew was the Rat!*

*Harry Potter signs book deal with Gilderoy Lockhart in tell all of his childhood!*

Leroy let his head fall to the table and looked up at Veronica and tried to think of what best to say.

"Would declaring once again my eternal love for you help?"

He could tell it wasn't going to work this time as he didn't even catch a glimpse of a smirk from her.

"Okay fine, there was just over a gross of cases left! So I figured hey, it should work out just fine!"

Her eyes narrowed and he figured she was not accepting his excuse.

"Come on dear we had nearly 10,000 cases this season! It can only do good overall right?"

Finally she relented a bit, they had been exceptionally busy this season.

"Fine, but you owe me mister. I expect foot a massage everyday for at least a month!"

Leroy smiled and stood up kissing his wonderful and best boss ever on the cheek.

"Besides, you have to admit reincarnating all those Harry Potter fans together at once in one world is going to be super fun to watch unfold!"

She turned on him as he grinned cheekily bouncing to work. The job at the Heavenly Translocation Office never grew boring while Leroy Jenkins was on the case!
