1. Make sure you get all the names right. Stupefy, not Stupify. Lily has only those two L's, not three, and so on and so forth.

2. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Don't just post your first draft, because it will be filled with typos, sentences that just don't make sense and other monstrosities.

3. No. Magical. Cores. HP magic don't work that way, unless you are doing a massive AU Ã  la linkffn(Wit of the Raven)

4. DO NOT HAVE REVIEW RESPONSES IN YOUR AUTHOR'S NOTES unless a review has a very good point that you want to /briefly/ address

5. Related to 2. Get a beta or two. We don't catch all of our own mistakes. A second might catch stuff the first didn't.

6. Plan it all out.
