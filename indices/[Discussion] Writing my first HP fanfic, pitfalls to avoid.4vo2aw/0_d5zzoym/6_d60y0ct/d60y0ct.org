Honest questions in non-English translations is it spelled Lilly? It's really the only way I can explain this one. If the author spells it incorrectly once I assume it's a typo, but I've read fics where the author uses that spelling for the entire fic and doesn't seem to notice it's wrong at all. My only way to reconcile this is that some of the non-English translations spell it Lilly so non-English speakers don't even realize its wrong.
