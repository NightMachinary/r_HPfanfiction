  Make sure you get all the names right.

I had troubles spelling "Lavender", so eventually I configured my editor to automatically correct "Lavendar". (And "gorup".)

  No. Magical. Cores. HP magic don't work that way

It's not /too/ out of line. It's an easy way to explain why Hermione isn't the biggest badass of the crew. There are better ways of doing it without even getting into magic -- athleticism, an instinct for combat situations, Harry being especially motivated, ruthlessness and a willingness to be hurt to achieve his goals.

If you're looking at the magic system in general, you could say, for instance, that everyone has slightly different affinities for aspects of magic. Hermione might have an affinity for spell acquisition, letting her learn new spells with ease. Harry might have an affinity for combat magic, letting him cast spells with much more efficacy than you would expect. There are other ways to go.

In general, though, if someone invokes magical cores in a vague, tangential way, it doesn't bother me. If they go into depth and have something interesting to say about magical cores, it doesn't bother me. The "we read a book about how to unlock our full cores and now we're ten times stronger!" way of doing things is just...bad. The author cared about this aspect enough to write about it specifically and turn it into a plot point; they didn't care enough to do something original.
