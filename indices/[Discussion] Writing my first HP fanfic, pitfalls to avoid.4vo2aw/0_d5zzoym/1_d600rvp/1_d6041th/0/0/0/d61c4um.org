I've always imagined that magic was kinda like a muscle, some were more talented than others but everyone can better themselves with practice and effort. Just like a sport or something, you're not inherently the best, but if everyone had the same potential every jackass with a vendetta would be Voldemort.

Lack of balance is just bad writing. OP Harry/Dumbledore/ etc. is fine if the opponent is heightened as well. It is also super annoying when Harry is so much better than everyone around him. It diminishes the other characters, which is just a lazy writing technique.
