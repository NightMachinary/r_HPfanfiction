Yeah, do tell me about it. Many times I've started getting into something only for it to become boring because the author decided that having the main character become OP with no limits and no real problems is the way to go.

But then again, I am well aware that not everyone trying to write is good at it.

PS. I actually have a story in writing (not a fanfic) where there is something functioning /like/ magic cores. But instead of being stupid I'd decided that it affects how quickly one's magical energy regenerates, meaning that those with weaker “cores” (not actually called that way in the story) can't overpower those stronger in a direct clash (you know, Dragonball-style), but it doesn't actually limit one's ability to continue fighting. Although there's blood magic which does have a limit of that sort (unless you bring properly-prepared comatose people as batteries, which ... yeah, is not good). My point is, because of the above I find the fact that most people using that particular plot device failed to use it well to be quite sad, more than anything.
