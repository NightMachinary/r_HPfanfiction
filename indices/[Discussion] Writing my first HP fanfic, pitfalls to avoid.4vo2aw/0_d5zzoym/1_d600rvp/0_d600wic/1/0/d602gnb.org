Not really. That was more of a physical strength/energy thing. Think more of the Elder Scrolls games. Works in Nirn due to Elder Scrolls lore-madness (shit is crazy, yo). Doesn't work in the canon HP-magic system which seems to be incredibly symbolism/meaning based.

EDIT: The real question here is how the fuck have you managed not to run across magical cores in fanfiction?
