Agreed.

But (there's always a but) a kind of "tiredness" would not be unreasonable. Doing the same thing over and over makes us tired, be it physical exertions, mental exertions (as in prolonged studying), or casting magic.

The (magical) trick is to stay away from giving it a physical ELI5 likeness, often with containers and pipes. And light. There's always some kind of light.
