You have to understand that this is your own universe, you don't need to follow any rules. If you wanna do magical cores, do it IMO it's not as bad as most people make it out to be. Don't limit yourself to what "is canon" and "isn't canon" as in the long run you aren't JK and you don't have to abide by anything other then your own rules.
