This. That said, if you decide to go for something that is not canon, simply accept that the story will definitely be an AU one rather than trying to show it as “more canon because my version is better” as there were people who did that and they all only pissed off people with it.

Also, if you include an element in your story, be it magical cores or anything else, make sure it's actually relevant; if you have a story with magical cores where their existence never actually matters then you might as well not mention that they are in it because the readers don't need to know and in a story rather than a world-building book it will only be useless clutter.
