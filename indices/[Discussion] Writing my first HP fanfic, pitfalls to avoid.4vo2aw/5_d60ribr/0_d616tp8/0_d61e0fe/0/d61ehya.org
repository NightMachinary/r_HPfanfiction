I'll give you a hint for that: if possible, make your first story a short one, possibly a one-shot; this way you will be able to write the whole thing /and then/ insert foreshadowing and info for the plot devices that are used.

Once you get that out of the way (to have /something/ released, as that makes a lot of difference for some people), or if you don't have problems of that sort anyway, then simply write the longer story a few chapters ahead before releasing so that you'd have the occasion to go back and insert those very same hints and information bits chapters before something comes into play.

By the way, this is why some people recommend writing a rough script (you know, a few sentences to sum up a chapter) a few chapters ahead, and using organic writing if you are not sure yet how you want to progress. Assuming no major and unexpected changes, that can make it much easier to see what major plot devices you will have that are actually used.
