*Make the world dynamic.* Voldemort died twenty or thirty years ago; technology is advancing; the Muggle population is growing. This should have an impact on the setting. Maybe all of the wizarding world in Britain has gone to ground in a region similar to the area where Platform 9Â¾ resides -- a place with only weak connections to the rest of the universe, so a Muggle can't hike around the Highlands and stumble on Hogwarts.

*Don't duplicate the parents.* This is one thing that gives next-gen fics a bad reputation: you turn the kids into slightly improved versions of their parents, and it's transparent, and there's a new Dark Lady with a name that reads like bad French...

*Ensure that the parents maintain their character flaws.* Or if you solve some, either give them other problems or other flaws. The epilogue certainly shows that they aren't saints:

  Hugo tugged on his mother's sleeve. "Mum? Where are they taking him? Where are they taking Dad?"

  Hermione's jaw was set, her hand gripping her wand tight enough to turn her knuckles white. "Your /father/ just admitted to using a mind-control charm on a defenceless person."

  "/What/?"

  "For some /unfathomable/ reason," Hermione said, her rage palpable, "he decided that it would be /better/ if he /Confunded the examiner/ than if he had to retake a test! As if -- as if having to study with me is worse than six months in Azkaban. As if a Muggle's sanctity of mind isn't worth considering."

  "But didn't you --" At the last second, Hugo shut himself up. There was a reason he'd never met his maternal grandparents, a reason Hermione cried herself to sleep on the twelfth of May and twenty-third of October every year, why she always seemed so strained at Christmas and Thanksgiving.

Those are the three huge things specific to next-gen fics.

For fics in general, *ensure that people act like real people*. They can make mistakes; people often do. They can not take a hint sometimes. They might not reach the right conclusions. They can prefer what is comforting to believe over what the evidence points to.

But, for instance, if you have as a cornerstone of your worldbuilding that birthrates have plummeted and the population is 70% female, actually treat men as rare; don't have them working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement or playing Quidditch. -- Unless people don't actually care about maintaining a steady population.

If you have a group of six characters urgently in need of getting from Hogwarts to London, maybe they should head over to Hogsmeade and take the Floo instead of riding flying horses. Either the horse can go Mach 4 or walking and taking the Floo is faster -- and I don't want to be on the back of a horse that's going Mach 4.

If you have a magic door that opens only at the last light on a particular day of the year, don't have your characters who have spent 80k words just getting there give up on it the moment the sun dips below the horizon. ("Maybe it's referring to moonlight? A Julian/Gregorian calendar distinction? Let's wait a bit just to be sure... I think I see a hint of light!")

That kind of thing. Places where, as a reader, you are screaming at a character: "No, you idiot! Don't do that!" Most likely, that character would have a voice in their head screaming the exact same thing. And sometimes I can have that voice and ignore it, or I feel powerless to obey, but I'm never unaffected.
