People who use confundus charms are the worst I agree.

Especially when they do it for silly reasons.

Like helping the boy they have a crush on make the house Quidditch team. Which Hermione did in sixth year when she used a confundus on Cormac McLaggen. So maybe Hermione doesn't treat it as bad because that would make her a hypocrite.

Also it's a confusion charm meant to distract a person and make them think they saw or did something that hasn't happened. Not a mind control charm like the Imperious curse which removes all free will.
