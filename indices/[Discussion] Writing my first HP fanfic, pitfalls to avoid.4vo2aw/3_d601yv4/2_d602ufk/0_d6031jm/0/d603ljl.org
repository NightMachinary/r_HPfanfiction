Here's the actual quote:

  “Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confund the examiner.”

  “No, I didn't,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”

  “As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”

When you say "the epilogue certainly shows that they aren't saints:", I generally expect the following text to be a quote from the epilogue, rather than a snip your wrote to make your point. It would be better positioned as a follow-up to the preceding sentence, illustrating how new flaws and characterizations can logically follow from the events of the story.
