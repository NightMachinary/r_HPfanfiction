The goblins are dicks, full stop. If you turn your back on them, they will stab it and laugh. There were Goblin wars for a reason, you know.

Plausibility Is Good. If you have to do some story gymnastics to make your plot plausible, do some damn story gymnastics. If you run into a dead end plot-hole, don't deus ex yourself out of it. Find out what caused the plot-hole and rework it, even if it doesn't fit with what you were originally intending to do. I would rather think "that's unlikely, but still possible" than "that's straight up impossible" when reading a story.

If you are going to make some (or all) of your characters OOC, /do not tell us so/. Not in the summary, not in the author's notes, just don't say anything. Nothing turns me off a story faster than flat out telling me that I'll be reading about your own version of the cast. I'm not saying don't make them OOC, just don't tell us. Also, Don't go full OOC out of the gate. Make the change from Canon to OOC gradual (and plausible!) over the course of the story, and with any luck I'll be well invested into the characters by the time they hit full OOC.

Look at my post on Justification elsewhere in this thread.
