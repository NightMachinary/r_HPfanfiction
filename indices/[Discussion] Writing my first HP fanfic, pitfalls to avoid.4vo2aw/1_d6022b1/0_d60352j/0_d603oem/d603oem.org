It's part of the magical oath trope. In a lot of fanfictions they say something along the lines of "I swear by my magic (Some bullshit about truth or loyalty). So mote it be." Its not canon just an overused fanfiction line, and it always just struck me as a really pretentious way of saying so be it. I think it's Freemason, but thats only because google told me so.
