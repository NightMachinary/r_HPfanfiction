It's a reference to the fanon ideas of magically binding oaths (similar to an Unbreakable Vow) which can be super varied in how it's worded etc. Somewhere along the line people got the idea that the vows must use archaic English (thee, thou, etc.), include all of the bloody titles in the name (Lord Potter-Black or whatever the fuck) and end it with "So mote it be."

Fics that use vows in this way usually have other terrible tropes in them, so the phrase is on most people's "This makes a Bad Fic, do not read" list.
