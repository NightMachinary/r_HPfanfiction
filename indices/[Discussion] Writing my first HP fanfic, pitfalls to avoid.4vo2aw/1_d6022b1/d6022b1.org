Don't try to explain why you did something in the author note. In fact, I'd avoid an author note all together. Makes it too easy to start soap-boxing.  \\
Don't use the phrase "So mote it be."  \\
Now you said next-gen so you've got a pretty open field for characterization, but I can not stress this enough. Don't carbon copy them. A lot of people make the junior potters into replicas of the original Marauders or the trio, and you start to wonder, why didn't they just use the existing characters who already have plot and backstory?  \\
It's already been said. But can't be said enough. Names. Missing an apostrophe or a run on sentence are forgivable. Misspelling Avada Kedavra is unforgivable.(Horrible pun intended)  \\
Most important pitfall to avoid? Forcing yourself to put out content because it's expected. If you force ourself to write it when it's a slog, you'll just post shit. The "muse" has to be alive and it has to be fun. Else why do it at all. Fanfiction, not forcefiction.
