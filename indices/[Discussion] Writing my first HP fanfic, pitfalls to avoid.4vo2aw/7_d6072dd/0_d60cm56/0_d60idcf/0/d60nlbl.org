Make (at least) a rough outline of major plot points first. Don't force your characters to follow it no matter what. Sometimes the story and characters takes on a life of their own. That is not a bad thing, it's a symptom of well-written characters and character development.

And for the sake of dog, don't force the story line through all the stations of canon. The /only/ reason Harry ended up with Hedwig the Snowy Owl, is that Hagrid bought her as a birthday present on a whim. No Hagrid, no Hedwig. Visiting Diagon Alley /not/ on Harry's birthday, no present for Harry.

It's about suspension of disbelief.

Which crashed spectacularly in one story where Harry was so weak and useless that Dudley had to cast a Patronus with Harry's wand to save the day. No. Just no.
