I agree with sfjoellen's points, especially on not letting others dictate what you want to write. Yet, I think there is a difference between a strong writer and a weak one. This tends to come down to writing structure, continuity and character/plot development. Style, canon/non-canon, AU, plot, and OOC individuals are up to the writer's preferences. You'll find that readers will have their own preferences on what they like. Your flavour of writing style and exploration, of the HP world, might not be everyone's cuppa; however, no one can deny quality of writing, consistency, and careful crafting of story and characters.

Best of luck and be sure to post it when you do write something. We'd love to see it!
