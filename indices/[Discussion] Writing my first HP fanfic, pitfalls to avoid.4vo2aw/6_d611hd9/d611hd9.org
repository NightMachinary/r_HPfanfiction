The details!

1) Most importantly, I think, is staying constant. If your first chapter is 100% 10/10 quality, don't post a drabble as the second chapter. Keep nick names standard, as well as other character identifiers.

2) JKR is known for having little useless information, if you plan your story you can have a small, unimportant, tidbit from chapter 7 an important plot point in chapter 25. It retains the HP style, and it serves to up the quality.

3)Pay attention to the time! Harry starts Hogwarts in 1991 and the final battle takes place May 2 1998. The Marauders were in school from 1971 to 1978. If you want to be extra detailed, sort your timeline by chapter then date, wolfram alpha will tell you when full moons, days of the week, etc. happen for specific dates, months, etc. If you're writing cannon, this is especially important. Muggle borns in Next Gen will definitely know how to use a computer or text, but Harry won't be particularly in touch with computers.

4) Geography is also important. Hogwarts is in Scotland, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were born in England (which is a part of Great Britian?). Geography effects weather, accent, etc.

EDIT: Numbered points were just one blob of a paragraph
