No I'll actually give her that one. You're right that strictly speaking, Pegasus is a single creature, it's been adopted into popular culture as a generic term for a flying horse. In fact (just checked) the Wikipedia article specifically mentions this: "Although often misused in popular culture, the term "Pegasus" is a proper noun, referring to a particular character, whereas the term "pterippus" (plural: "pterippi") is the generic name for the species of winged horses." In this case, it would be wizards who've got the wrong idea about a magical thing, not muggles.

As for your other examples, she didn't reuse the term "Vila" or "Brownie" but instead created totally new terms, so it's fair enough to change details from the original.

If she wanted a historically powerful wizard she could have made her own. Instead she used Merlin and got the details wrong. And, again, to say it's muggles misunderstanding things wouldn't explain how muggles have stories about Arthur and Merlin that pre-date the founding of Hogwarts.
