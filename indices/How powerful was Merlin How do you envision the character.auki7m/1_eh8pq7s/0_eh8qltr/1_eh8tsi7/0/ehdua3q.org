Jumping on the Merlin thing as "wrong" seems to misunderstand the way JKR has made the HP world. Almost every element of the HP universe was a pre-existing mythological/occult trope /which JKR has twisted and changed/, typically by removing the more mythological elements and making them more "normal". For example, in mythology Perseus' flying horse Pegasus was the child of the god Poseidon. In Harry Potter there are whole herds of winged horses. They reproduce biologically, have no connection to any god, and they drink whiskey.

If the Harry Potter world had to accord with traditional mythology to be "correct", then the whole world is wrong. Veela do not accurately reflect the Slavic legend of Vila. House-Elves do not accurately reflect the Scottish legend of Brownies. And so on.

It's entirely in keeping with the Harry Potter world that Merlin does not reflect the figure as depicted in the traditional legend of King Arthur. The idea that Muggles have the wrong idea about magical things is a consistent theme throughout the books.
