First, she hasn't created a fictional universe. Rather, she added fictional elements to our universe. That's kind of the whole point - wizards being present in our world.

Second, she screwed up loads of stuff. Some of it is purely her own fault, like the economics of wizarding Britain making no sense and some is just sloppy - like the Express leaving from platform 9 3/4 and people accessing it through the pillars between platforms 9 and 10 when *there are no pillars between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross * - the two lines are right next to each other. That's the category of mistake that Merlin falls into.
