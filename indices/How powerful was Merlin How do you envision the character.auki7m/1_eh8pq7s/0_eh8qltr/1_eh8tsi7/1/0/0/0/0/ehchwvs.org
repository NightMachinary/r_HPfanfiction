The settings in the books share many similar elements with the real world just like most other fictional stories written throughout history. But at the end of the day, they are still fictional...none of it is real and as the creator of the Potterverse, she has full license to write or make changes however she pleases. How could she be wrong about a fictional story she made up in her own head? Can't you see how ridiculous that sounds?

I'm not arguing about the many plot holes and inconsistencies found in the books at all.
