  YMMV if random Pottermore stuff counts as canon.

Canon that this is widely believed in Slytherin House, but that they're believing the arrant propaganda from the Matter of Britain rather than the historical facts of the matter, which is that Merlin died more than two hundred years, possibly as much as three hundred years, before Hogwarts was founded.

Although it's entirely plausible that Merlin - in his later life, no longer known as Myrddin Wyllt, but as Lailoken the Mad Prophet - lived in Hogsmeade Valley, and the old stonework at the base of one of Hogwarts' towers is all that remains of his home.
