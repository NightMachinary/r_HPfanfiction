It comes from Pottermore's Slytherin House sorting message. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/49vvji/pottermore_house_welcome_messages/][link to read all of them.]]. YMMV if random Pottermore stuff counts as canon.

  Here's a little-known fact that the other three houses don't bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth?
