There's a great characterisation of Merlin in linkffn(The Long Journey Home by Rakeesh), where he's very much a human. He's powerful but becomes a wise and strong wizard thanks to his teacher.

As for him being a Slytherin, where does that come from? Hogwarts was build in the 10th century while Arthur and Merlin have their stories at the end of the 5th / start of the 6th. I've certainly seen some fanfictions that describe him as a Slytherin but that's just bad research.
