I actually think the portrayal of Merlin was kind of weak in the story. It's kind of overshadowed by all the filler scenes in the future. Like, Merlin is matching Harry in skill after 3 years, despite Harry being /3000/ years older at one point. And it's done with runes, because the author went with the old cliche of runes being some sort of programming language, so Merlin just swaps a couple and bam, solved. It's like a scene out of a bad movie. Like, the story is in theory about an OP Harry, but he's arbitrarily hamstrung at every opportunity, never gets a chance to shine.
