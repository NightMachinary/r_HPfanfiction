imo Merlin was about as strong as Dumbledore

that is an amazing feat considering that Merlin was born before magical education existed in any meaningful form.

then add hundreds of years his legend growing and boom, modern merlin worship.

i suspect Merlin had a personal talent to view the future and used it to snoop on magical classes before those classes even existed.
