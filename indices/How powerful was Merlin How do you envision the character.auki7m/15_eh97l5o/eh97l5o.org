In linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat), Harry is literally touted to be the second coming of Merlin by ordinary folk (whether it is actually true or not is never said).

He is not powerful due to his knowledge or experience but because his ability to see magic and souls/life grants him an unprecedented insight that simply cannot be matched by any conventional wizard or witch.

By the age of 17, he can transfigure complex wards into water, rip souls and dementors to shreds, take on multiple Death Eaters and Voldemort and an Inferi army single handedly, among other feats. All using raw magic manipulation and transfiguration.

Merlin was, according to legend in this fic, known for similar or even greater feats and was regarded as the Prince of Enchanters.
