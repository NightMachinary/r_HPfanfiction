In that case, Merlin is still awesome. There is a reason the phrase "Da Vinci of our time" is so complimentary even though Da Vinci's actual knowledge is pretty limited by today's standards. Da Vinci is a great because he utilized what knowledge and resources available in his time to make massive advancements in multiple areas. Had Da Vinci been born in modern times he would likely be making huge contributions to the sciences and arts just like he did in his own time. I think it's the same with Merlin - it's not his knowledge or magical skills but rather the contributions he made to society. Saying that Dumbledore would beat Merlin in a duel is like saying I would outscore Da Vinci on a chemistry test - it says nothing about either of our potentials.
