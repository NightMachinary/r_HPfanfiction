I imagine that Merlin was born in the 10th century to or was raised by Druids and in adulthood, he made a True time turner device and went back to the 5th/6th century and became the Merlin of Arthurian Legend. Maybe he brought Cadogan and Morgana with him.

Personality-wise, like Dumbledore, Dinsey's Merlin and Gandalf, he'd be wise, eccentric, whimsical but serious, authoritive, cunning and manipulative when needed.

He was the most powerful wizard of his time, perhaps all time and he was involved in the political and religious going-ons at the time and founded the Order of Merlin which in addition to being a Muggle-rights organization, fought dark wizards and witches etc and became a precursor to the wizard's council and became the legal authority among wizardkind to allow them to govern themselves and ensure loyalty to the crown being King Arthur.

He would also be Seer and a Metamorphmagus (thus tying in with his myths of prophecy and shapeshifting. He would eventually meet, train and fall in love with Nyneve/Nimueh and Morgana would use either Metamorphmagus, Polyjuice Potion or self-transfiguration to assume Nyneve/Nmueh's form and either kill Merlin, transfigure him into a tree or lure him into a cave and put him in bewitched sleep and seal the cave.

At some point after, the battle of Camlann would happen where Arthur would either be mortally wounded or die straight out. If wounded only, then Arthur would be taken to Avalon where he would be healed and put into Bewitched Sleep only to be woken when needed again. If he died, he'd be buried on Avalon.

That's one of my interpretations.
