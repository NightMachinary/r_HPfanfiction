*Caution - Self Promotion*

In the Last Mage of Krypton series, there are a couple of comments sprinkled around as to how there were actually THREE Merlins.

Merlin 1 - Maker of magical sword/King Arthur's court wizard.

Merlin 2 - Wizard who taught one or more of the Founders

Merlin 3 - Slytherin Alumni

Wizards being lazy and not fact-checking, all three kinda got mixed up in normal history until we had a Merlin who was a member of House Slytherin, taught the Founders and put King Arthur on the throne via magic sword.
