I always imagine him like I think of, for example, Da Vinci. Way beyond his age in terms of the mastery and sheer /vision/ he has for magic and its many uses. A true genius of his time, but other than many artists, engineers and inventors, actually seen as such. With him being on the forefront of magic, things took a turn for progress. I think of him as the man who changed the preservatory function of Hogwarts into a progressing one, or at least added it to the workings of Hogwarts. I imagine him in school to be a lot like the Marauders - researching, inventing, and doing it all because its just /fun/. With age he would use this same drive in a more serious environment, as well as in a political arena, but it would ultimately still be a mindset of invention and progress.

But compared to Dumbledore and Voldemort, even against people like Remus, he'd be helplessly outgunned if he would be just dropped into such a duel. Simply because he would have inferior spellwork, and inferior equipment (wand). Its one conclusion of my belief that magic and its many facettes progresses and gets modernized (while some old knowledge of it gets lost until needed again).
