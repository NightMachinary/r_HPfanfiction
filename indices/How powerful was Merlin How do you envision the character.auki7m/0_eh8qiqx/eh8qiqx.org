I don't imagine him to be nearly as powerful as you view him. He was a powerful wizard. Maybe enough to easily defeat Dumbledore, but if that's the case I would say that's mostly because Merlin was more dedicated to magic whereas Dumbledore has had like 3 full time jobs for decades - the man probably hasn't improved significantly in a long time. Voldemort is only ~70, and he spent 10 of those years being a wraith.

Merlin's a case of the Boy-Who-Lived or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named phenomenon, but compounded over hundreds of years. A story that gained its own momentum to become myth/legend.

As for his fame in the muggle world.. well. I don't know the story well, but from what I remember there was no godly geography altering power involved.
