I recently read a good story where Harry is Superman linkffn(12191520)

He is in my opinion totally op (superman after all) but the author managed to make Voldemort sane and even have him team up with Grindelwad later on to make it more interesting, good read either way. has my rec.

The first three are fully released and the 4th one is in progress, last update 4 days ago.
