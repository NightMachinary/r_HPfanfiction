Ulquiorra is one of the Big Bad's henchmen, but the fandom likes him anyway. He's more evil by circumstance, he's no doubt done terrible things but it's not as if he gets any joy from them, he seems to prefer figuring things out and taking things at his own pace. He has pale skin, green eyes, can grow bat wings and fling green spears that can atomise city blocks. Also, powers in general in Bleach are linked to swords: smacking each other with them is fine and all, but if you really want to get going, you 'release' your sword and get cracking. There's no guarantee the released powers look anything like swords: one dude has his sword turn into razor sharp petals, another into a giant bone snake and the main character has his turn into a smaller sword.
