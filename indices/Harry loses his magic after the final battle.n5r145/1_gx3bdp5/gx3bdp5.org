Ginny's Gift

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/601108/29/Ginny-s-Gift]])

And its sequel, The Long Road Home

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/994611/1/The-Long-Road-Home]])

Very well-written but YMMV because of the massive canon-divergence (both fics were written and finished /before/ the release of OOtP)

And yeah, just by posting this I'm giving away a crucial plot point - so I'll keep further specifics under this spoiler tag, in case anyone just wants to jump right in:

The first fic ends with Harry losing his magic, and the second one deals with the fallout

There's also:

we can't control (watch me unfold)

This one is not exactly what you're looking for, but Harry does start losing his magic at a point, and needs to deal with the aftermath. Also... I can only describe this fic as... porn with plot. Suuuuper explicit stuff (tastefully done, imo, but still). So YMMV on this one too, I guess.

edit: I just want to clarify that the plot (when it starts to kick in) is very, /very/ good.

It's canon divergent as well - Harry never attended Hogwarts in this one, so things start off a bit confusing, but it all gets explained as you read on.

Sorry I don't have better recommendations, but hopefully by commenting it can attract other people with better recs!
