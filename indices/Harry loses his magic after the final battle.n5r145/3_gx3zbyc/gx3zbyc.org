I don't know if this qualifies or not, it's also a crossover, but one of my favorite fics' premise is that Harry loses his magic, but he can still use potions and still pretty much BAMF, but after he lost his magic, he got cursed with something that attracts spirits and the dead to him.

Unfortunately, this fic isn't fandom-blind reader friendly, so you'd have to be familiar with MDZS to enjoy this wonderful fic.

Summary:

/The final lines were.... the only clear instructions given to him./

/It seemed as though Mo Xuan-Yu was seized with sudden ferocious clarity and drive -- a single demand for the Yiling Patriarch: Whatever he was to do in revenge to the Mo Clan, he was to protect Hari above all. The child was not to be harmed./

When his life was not enough to trade for the protection of his friends in the Final Battle, Harry gave up his magic and found himself cursed. Travelling to the Cultivation World was his only chance to survive, to break this curse that drew the resentful dead into his orbit. While there though, he finds himself caught up in the life of the tormented Mo Xuan-Yu and unable to ignore the echoes of himself in the man's pitiful circumstances. But when Harry's curse draws the dead to Mo Village, the Junior cultivators of the Gusu Lan Sect are close behind, and his life takes a dramatic swing in a different direction, towed along in the wake of Mo Xuan-Yu now that he has been freed of his oppressive family, Harry finds himself in the Cloud Recesses, and involved in a whole new mystery that the 'adults' are determined to keep him away from.
