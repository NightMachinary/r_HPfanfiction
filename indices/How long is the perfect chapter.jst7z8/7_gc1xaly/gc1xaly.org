I do think this kind of thing depends on the type of fic, and the experience that you want the reader to have. Some of my favourite fics are updated on Sundays, with long sprawling chapters that have Harry or whoever getting things done, but they aren't too stressful.

Other fics are fairly action packed and having shorter chapters helps keep suspense up.

Are you going to update as you go, or are you going to finish it before posting, every day or weekly or bi-weekly, i do think that all of this impacts things like chapter length
