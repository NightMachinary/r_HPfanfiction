Chapters can be just a couple thousand words long, but I recommend not having chapters longer than 8,000 words (and preferably not more than 6,000). I read a report a couple years ago that said that engagement drops off sharply past that point (folks with reading disabilities find it especially difficult to read e.g. a 12,000 word chapter vs two 6,000 word chapters).
