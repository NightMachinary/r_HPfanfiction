I think the best advice I received in terms of chapter length is for each chapter to be however long (or short) it needs to be. By all means, plan out your chapters but don't think you have to adhere to an exact word limit. For example, if your goal is for every chapter to be at least 5,000 words long but the current chapter you're working on in 3,500 words, don't force yourself to write the other 1,500 words. Forcing yourself to reach a certain word limit per chapter could be a recipe for disaster. Just let your writing write itself, if that makes sense.

With that being said, some chapters are too short (anything less than 1,000 words) and some chapters are too long (anything more than 10,000 words) so it'd be best to avoid those chapter lengths if you can.
