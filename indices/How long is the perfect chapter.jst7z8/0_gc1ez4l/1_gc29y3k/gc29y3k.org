I agree with this. The canon rewrite I'm doing has chapters ranging from 4000 words to 9000 words, most chapters so far seem to hover between 6 and 8000 though. I haven't dragged a chapter beyond roughly 9000 words yet and don't intend to do so as that just gets too long, and at that point you start to loose the audience as your likely introducing too much stuff inside the chapter that your not resolving, or you are wasting the readers time with filler words that you don't need
