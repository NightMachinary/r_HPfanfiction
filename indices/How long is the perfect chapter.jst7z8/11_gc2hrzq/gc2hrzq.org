Here we go again...

There's no "right" answer. Every chapter is different and will serve different purposes in your fic, and everyone has different preferences for what they want in regards to chapter length. Don't try to force a chapter to be longer or shorter than it needs to be, or you'll just add unnecessary filler.

That said, most people have a lower limit of 2k and an upper limit of 20k. I prefer reading chapters between 3k-10k. 15k is pushing it for me unless the author updates sporadically. There's no bigger turnoff than seeing a 50 chapter fic with something like 40k words, or a 10 chapter fic with 250k words.

For writing it's usually 3.5k<x<8k, but if the length stunts the flow of a chapter, I'll cut or add as needed.
