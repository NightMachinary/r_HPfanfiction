Depends how many things happen in that chapter. I much more prefer shorter chapters with as few as possible words to describe the action rather than a lengthy chapter with unnecessary words in it. If you manage to stay below 5000 words for the regular chapter I will read it. I will read chapter with +10000 words as well if a lot of things happen in that chapter. However to give you an example from canon: the longest chapter is "Detention with Dolores" which comes at +9000 words. The only things that are plot relevant to that chapter are the actual detentions and Hermione coming up with the idea for DA. I think that those two could have been summarized in much fewer words.
