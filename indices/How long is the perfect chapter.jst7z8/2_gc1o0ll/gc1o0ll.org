If I read all the story in one go it doesn't really matter that much. If the story takes more than, let's say, one week to update, during that week I'll probably read a load others fanfics, some even with the same concept , so you have to give me something to remember your fic by, otherwise I'll lose interest in it.

Personally I would say: -Everyday= ahahaha you wish -Twice a week = 1k/2k is alright -Once a week= more than 2k, 4/5k would be ideal -Once a mont or more= at least 10k if not more -Once a year= if I'm still waiting on an update after 1 year then it doesn't matter, just give me something.
