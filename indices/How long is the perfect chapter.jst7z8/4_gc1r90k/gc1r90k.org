As a reader, I'd posit that the /minimum/ length for a chapter should be around 1-2k words, because any less than that and you're basically just writing a single scene. Maximum length is harder to pin down; the only thing I'd say here is that unless you're making a deliberate stylistic decision, they probably shouldn't wildly vary in length. (Good Omens does this well, to give an example.)

That said, as long as something actually /happens/ in each chapter (plot advancement, foreshadowing, character introductions, etc.), you can get away with whatever length you want.
