The just about only rational argument for how long or short a chapter should be that I can come up with is reading time. Chapters mark places where a reader can put the story down, if you can't leave a bookmark in between two paper pages. So if it takes three hours to read one chapter, but you haven't /got/ three hours, it's annoying.

It's not a really strong argument, though. I suppose there are ways to fix this with whatever software, too.

So, beyond noting that a typical scene is at least a couple hundred words, and usually, you want more than one scene in a chapter, it's the definition of /~whatever/.
