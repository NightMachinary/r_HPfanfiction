I don't know about the immediate consequences, but longer-term, Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't become friends, and then...

"This is the most ridiculous conspiracy theory I have ever heard, and I have an uncle who believes that the queen is secretly a Communist," pronounced Hermione. Neville, who was standing next to her, nodded along.

"Well, nobody asked you," said Ron. He and Harry were facing the other two Gryffindors, who were blocking their way out of the Common Room.

Hermione ignored him, and turned to Harry. "Harry, I know Professor Snape is absolutely horrid to you, but that doesn't mean that he is stealing the Philosopher's Stone for You-Know-Who! Please reconsider!"

"Sorry, Hermione. I can't risk him getting the Philosopher's Stone. Please don't try to stop us." He stepped forward.

"And mind your own business, for once!" Ron added, also stepping forward.

"Very well." There was a gleam in Hermione's eye, that made Ron shudder. "Let's try basic logic. If you can't get past us, you do not stand a chance against Professor Snape." She drew her wand, and Neville drew his.

In retrospect, he was the lucky one, Ron thought to himself, as he stared at the ceiling, due to lack of other options. Hermione's Full-Body Bind had cancelled out the other jinxes that she had cast on him, and wasn't in itself particularly uncomfortable. Harry, on the other hand, had taken some abomination of a spell from Neville. Said wizard was now kneeling next to Harry, tearfully apologising, even as the prefects were trying to get a hold of Madame Pomfrey through the floo.

Apparently, after the better part of a year under Hermione's tutelage, he had had the confidence to cast a spell in anger (or at least the fear of disappointing Hermione to), but still lacked the ability to reliably control the results. "She really is a nightmare," Ron wanted to whisper to himself, but couldn't.

McGonagall's eventual arrival brought with it a firm talking-to to everyone involved, and a loss of 200 points for Hermione and Neville, so it wasn't a total loss.

*Choose your option:*

1. The next morning, despite everything, Dumbledore was looking very... content. Slytherin won the House Cup for the eighth year in a row. Snape left Hogwarts, and Dumbledore announced a search for a new Potions Master and a new Head of Slytherin. The rest of their Hogwarts career was pretty uneventful. They even won the House Cup a few times.

   A few decades later, on his deathbed, Dumbledore invited Harry Potter and told him about the prophecy about which he no longer had to worry, because Voldemort was trapped beyond the reach of his followers, and that once Harry too passed away in due time, Voldemort would be gone for good.

2. The next morning, Dumbledore was absent at the high table. He returned the day after, bearing dire news: Voldemort was back, and he had the Philosopher's Stone.
