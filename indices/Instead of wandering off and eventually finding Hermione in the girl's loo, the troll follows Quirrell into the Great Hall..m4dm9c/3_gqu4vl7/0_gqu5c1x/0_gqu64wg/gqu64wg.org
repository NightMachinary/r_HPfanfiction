True, I know its mentioned that they are naturally resistant to magic though, but how resistant exactly is never specified

But I also imagine the shock factor kicking in for a lot of the kids along with sheer panic making it much more likely only a handful are even prepared to fire off spells (if they are effective) before the Troll does any damage to any of vast amounts of very squishy targets it has available to it
