Who knows? Maybe the prefects and other older-students end up taking it down before any damage is done?

If we assume that there are about ten to maybe twelve people per year, that would be quite a lot of wands aimed at the troll (the fourth-years and up would be roughly 12 x 4 = 48 students per house).
