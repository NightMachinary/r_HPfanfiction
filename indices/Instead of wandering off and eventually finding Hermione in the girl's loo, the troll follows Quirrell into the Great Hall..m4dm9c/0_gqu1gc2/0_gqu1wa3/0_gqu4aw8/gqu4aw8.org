I would too, but I don't think I could do it justice right now, if ever. I love writing but so far I'm not happy with my quality of writing. Also, my head is spinning with the story I /am/ trying to write and Regulus Black would probably saunter in somehow. That wouldn't work ;) please someone feel free to write the one shot and comment it here for me and [[/u/eleydan][u/eleydan]]
