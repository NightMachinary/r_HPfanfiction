That would be funny. Not only is Quirrell's cover blown, but the troll walks headfirst into the best defended room in the whole place since all the teachers are congregated there. Or at least the ones that are useful in that sort of situation, as in, we wouldn't know if Trelawney was there, but I doubt it would matter when you have the heavy hitters like Dumbledore and the HoHs.

I'm liking the imagery of tiny Professor Flitwick levitating the troll. The troll depends on size and strength to defeat its victims so removing gravity renders it impotent. Meanwhile, the other professors incompacitate Quirrellmort who is at a disadvantage from pretending to faint and being outnumbered while upper year students shield themselves and younger years from stray spells from Quirrellmort defending himself.
