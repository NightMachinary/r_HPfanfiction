"TROLL IN THE DUNGEON" Professor Quirrell shouted exuberantly in fear. "thought you ought to know" he stuttered out before his eyes roll into the back of his head and he collapses on the florr in the middle of the great hall. after several heartbeats pandamonium broke out the students start crying out in fear, one particular slytherin student and his babbling baboons look as if they are about to wet themselves. its so loud its a wonder anyone can hear themselves think, suddenly from the head table a rather thunderous 'BOOM' emits from Professor Dumbledore's wand.

"SILENCE" he screamed calmly to the students. he was about to give instructions to the Prefect but before he had the chance to a 2nd loud bang rhe doors to the great hall suddenly slam open to reveal the hideous mug of said troll. dumbledore without missing a beat states" it would appear as if the troll is no longer in the dungeon" another moment later the short statured Proffesor Flitwick was standing on the table, and the troll was in the air slowly spinning attempting to grab anything to find purchase, helpless in the effort having dropped its club."however did a troll get into the castle" pondered dumbledore alloud " I wonder if by chance you would know Qurinus, after all you were the only staff member not here at the feast, and i seem to remember you have a peculiar partiality to the predomination of these particular creatures"

Professor Quirrell and his parasitic passengers knew right then the jig was up. in a snake like voice emanating from the back of Quirrell's head "forsaking the part of the fool, old man" Quirrell stood up "since as you put it the jig is up, i suppose i just have to kill you, and take some of your precious students with you" he spat in a voice filled with venom. all of a sudden sickly colored curses were flying across thw great hall, dumbledore casualy put up shields and the older students after a moment did as well. Quirrellmort caught at a major disadvantage, not expecting mere school children to be able to defend themselves this well, began to flee, before suddenly he was surrounder in a cage, at somepoint the trolls club had shattered, giving dumbledore and mcgonagall ample material to work with. voldemort seeing no alternative combusted, leaving Quirrell's body as dust while he escaped.

Mcgonagall after this event, looked almost ready to cry at the amount of paperwork she would have to fill out

flitwick, hagrid, and professor grubby-plank escorted the clubless, very dizzy troll to the forest.

the students were simply confused

and trelawny retreated to her tower to drink herself into a stupor.

and harry is much closer to his year mates, barring Hermione. because sharing an experience like that is sure to create bonds.
