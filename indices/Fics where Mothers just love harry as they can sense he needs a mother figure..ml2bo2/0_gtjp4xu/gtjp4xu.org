I just had the thought of an idea where /every/ magical mother (creatures like dragons, kneazels maybe even owls possibly included) instinctively acts motherly towards Harry, this includes witches who are pregnant. And Harry discovers a Slytherin (Pansy, maybe) is pregnant because she goes from threatening/insulting him to insisting that he eats more or asking if he's getting enough sleep.
