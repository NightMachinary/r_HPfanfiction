That one was super meh for me. The pace slowed to glacial about the time Harry went to Hogwarts, and the whole thing got into this loop of "omg Harry and his friends are so cool and can do amazeballs stuff because of his time in Equestria also the pones are so cuuuute!" It felt like it was just another OP!Harry fic but with MLP thrown in.
