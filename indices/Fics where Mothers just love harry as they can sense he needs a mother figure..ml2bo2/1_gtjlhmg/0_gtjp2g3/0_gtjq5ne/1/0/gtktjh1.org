I absolutely agree with you. But as I said, I don't really read it so much for the main Harry plot as for the inter-dimensional immigration plot. It's both the best Equestria meets Earth fic and second best Wizard magic meets modern technology fic I've read. All the side plots such as the new Changeling hive, Starlight Glimmer working to incite a revolution against Purebloods, the rapid modernization of Equestria, the advances in space travel, the British government freaking out, the wizards being stubbornly ignorant, and others are all much more interesting than the weird polygamous harem Harry has going on.
