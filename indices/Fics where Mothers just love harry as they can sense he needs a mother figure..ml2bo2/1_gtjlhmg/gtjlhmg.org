There's an MLP crossover where he gets adopted by Princess Twilight Sparkle, and gets taught things like proper royal court etiquette and magic.

That's not the interesting part though. The /interesting/ part is when they go back to Harry's world and open diplomacy with the Muggle government first, because they don't even know there is a wizarding government yet. What does this lead to? Britain becoming a world superpower again and colonizing space.

In the latest chapter they acknowledged the Equestria Girls universe and discovered the Harry Potter books/movies. Existential crises ensue.
