I'm surprised no one has mentioned Cassandra "Cassie" Claire yet. She was particularly well-known to be the reason why Dramione (Draco/Hermione) is so popular as a pairing today, and she also shipped (and wrote) the Ginny/Draco and Harry/Hermione pairings heavily as well. She /particularly/ liked Ginny/Draco, whom she later turned into the characters of Jace and Clary in her 'original' work, /The Mortal Instruments/.
