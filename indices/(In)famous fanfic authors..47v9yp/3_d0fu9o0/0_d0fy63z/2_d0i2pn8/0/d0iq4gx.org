I have to disagree that he's always coming up with "new" ideas - they are only "new" on a very superficial level. The details vary slightly, but the consistent running theme is some creature, elemental, or power-type inheritance which causes Harry to say "f*ck you" to everyone, act like a jerk, turn over expectations, do things his way... Or at least, that's the plan, until he gets four or five chapters in and decides to start over with a slightly different variation.

Also, it's a mistake to think that "dark" necessarily means "asshole." Dark means taking a more ruthless path, being less amiable, that sort of thing. Simply taking the first opportunity to yell and curse at someone who may or may not be annoying isn't "dark" unless you're a toddler.
