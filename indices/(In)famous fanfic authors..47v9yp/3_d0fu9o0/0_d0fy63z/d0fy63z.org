It's a shame, because his original version of his "Emerald Flight" started off pretty good and seemed to have a lot of promise, but then wandered into "the same story he always writes" territory.

Yet I'd still argue that he isn't as bad as DZ2 in that regard. DZ keeps writing the same story in which Harry gets some sort of inheritance or power which gives him an excuse to act like an ass towards just about everyone. I honestly wonder if perhaps even he's bored with that because of how often he starts a brand new story doing essentially the same thing.

It's a shame, because there are so few authors who write Dark Harmony stories like what he keeps starting and then abandoning.
