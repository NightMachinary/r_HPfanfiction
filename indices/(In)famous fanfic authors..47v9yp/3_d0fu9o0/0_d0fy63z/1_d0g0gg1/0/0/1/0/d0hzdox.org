If I were writing it it would have Hermione plotting to escape and the rest jockeying for position, trying to deal with rivals (not limited to non violent means) and such. It would not be that long a story and the point would be to show the harem as a world of its own and an artificial social system the members cling to because they don't want to or cannot deal with the world outside. Anything from the outside would be filtered through that.
