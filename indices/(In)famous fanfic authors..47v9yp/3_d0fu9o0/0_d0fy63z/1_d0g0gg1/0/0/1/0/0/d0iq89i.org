Ah, /that/ would probably work, though as you say it wouldn't work for too long, so it would have to be a relatively short story.

I was thinking more along the lines of a serious story, something like... I dunno, Game of Throne in the Harem? I don't suppose I had a super-clear idea of it, but that's the way my mind was moving.

However, injecting a critical perspective that showed both how ruthlessly political it really could be but also how parasitic it essentially was wouldn't suffer from the same problems. What's happening outside is irrelevant to the person trying to escape (except insofar as those events might help escape, of course).
