Harem politics has potential, but not harem politics alone.

First and most obviously, it would get boring if the women were sitting around in the chambers all the time, just plotting. If they never step out and actually do anything, just scheme and talk, I'm not sure how interesting they would be as characters.

Second, and perhaps just as obviously, they need to be plotting about /something/ - so the story needs to also depict the outside events (like wars) which are being plotted over. If we never see the consequences of the plots, we'll never care about the plots.
