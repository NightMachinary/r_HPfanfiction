Yeah, I think they tend to have a lot. I can't say for sure because I don't read them anymore, but it's rare to have such large harems without a ton of smut as well. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but if you have several stories of exactly that type, I'm not sure it's possible to not get repetitive.

It's also nearly impossible to do a good job developing the individual characters, no matter how long your story is. With multi-pairings, the reasonable limit is a total of three or four people. Otherwise, the author will never do justice to them all and their interwoven relationships.
