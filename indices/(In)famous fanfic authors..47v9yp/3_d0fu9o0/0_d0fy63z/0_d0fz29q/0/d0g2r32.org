It's a difficult temptation to overcome, isn't it? :)

When you see a situation or relationship a certain way, and feel that it works "perfectly" that way, it's hard to write it differently.

It's one of the reasons I prefer to write a FemHarry, even though I have a couple of outlines and initial chapters of stories with a regular male Harry. Putting a girl in the leading role makes it a little harder to fall into /all/ of the same patterns that others have used. I have other reasons, of course, and wanting to see female characters in the leading, adventurous roles is primary, but being forced to look at old situations/scenes through new eyes is helpful to me as an author.
