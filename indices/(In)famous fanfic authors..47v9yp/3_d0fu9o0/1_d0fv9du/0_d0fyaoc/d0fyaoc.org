Actually, he hates Hermione, so all of his stories bash or ignore her. It's worth noting that while that story is perhaps the most different or unique of all his stories, he says he doesn't like and it only leaves it up for others.

It's not a great story, but the part about how badly Hermione is affected by her delving into Dark Magic is actually nice because it's not something we usually get. Granted, as someone who does like the Hermione character, I'm not pleased by what happens to her, but it's still an idea that deserves to be explored more than it has been.
