It's not that he ignores canon, it's that he doesn't explain the changes. The one time I reallt did that in a story, I expressly said "the canon changes are explained in a later chapter as part of the story" and still got reviews with people complaining.

Edit: and I posted the story in complete form so they had no reason to whine that it wasn't there.
