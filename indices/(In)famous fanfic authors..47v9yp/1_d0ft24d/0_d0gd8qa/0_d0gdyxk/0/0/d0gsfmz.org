Some people are idiots who don't read authors' notes and complain that they don't have the info from authors' notes. I'd ignore those types, they are useless for pretty much anything.

That being said, some changes don't really need an explanation aside from “this is a change”, which basically means mentioning the thing at all. Though I'll note that for one, I'd never read the story you mentioned, or at least not far enough that I'd get to the moment you are writing about, and for two, I'd say it falls under either shoddy plot resolution or shoddy relationship writing.
