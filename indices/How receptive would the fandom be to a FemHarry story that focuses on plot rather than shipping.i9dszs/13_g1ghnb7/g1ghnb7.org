I would probably repeat what others said, so I won't write too much. I'm really interested in fem!harry stories without any romance, assuming that the whole thing is not just some boring canon-rehash or weird teenage drama thing. I want to read believable characters and story - if you can nail that, I'm in. With your character you might have to work hard on the story. To give a lazy character a proper story-line, one can very easily go for the fake-drama or "randomly thrown into the middle of things" routes which i personally found a bit boring.
