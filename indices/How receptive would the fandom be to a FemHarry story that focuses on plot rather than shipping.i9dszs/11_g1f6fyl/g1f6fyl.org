Originally I thought that what you suggest is linkffn(The Videus Charm by OfPensandSwords ), but your description feels to fit more linkffn(Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived by Lord Jeram). The first one is fem!Harry (the natural one, not gender-bender) which is surprisingly and refreshingly free of any romance, the second is a bit more weird (actually, a way more weird).
