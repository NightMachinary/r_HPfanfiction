Eh, I'm not really a fan of not changing the name or just calling her "Harriet", cause that just rings of laziness to me. It will never be not jarring and will destroy any suspension of disbelief you attempt to generate.

And tbh the plot point you've sketched out for why the name is the same just seems like a dumb and unnecessary cop-out to me. The rest is nice, but this plot will be tedious and jarring and I doubt I'd read the story if I'm ripped out of it every time I read the protagonist's name.

Just drop that one, give her a name that actually makes sense and this will be a great story.

PS. You asked for criticism and advice, not senseless praise, so I'm giving it.
