The thing with the prophecy is that it explicitly states that the one who will defeat Voldemort is a male. So when Lily had a muggle ultrasound while she was pregnant (the technology was around for nearly 20 years by that point, so she should have access to it) and found out she was pregnant with a girl, she and James knew that by process of elimination, Neville is the one the prophecy is about - but Voldemort didn't know that. So they hid Harry's gender in order to make it look like there are two candidates, resulting in a 50% chance of Voldemort picking the wrong one, which he did.

As far as the prophecy is concerned, Neville is Voldemort's true nemesis, he's just yet to be "marked as an equal" until he's 14 (and Voldemort unintentionally using Neville's blood for the resurrection ritual due to Wormtail accidentally nicking Neville's forearm with the knife while they're scuffling over the cauldron is what fulfills that part). Dumbledore initially believes that Harry is uninvolved and free to walk away but once it becomes clear that Voldemort sees killing her as a matter of pride despite now knowing full well that she's not his real target, Dumbledore begins to suspect that Harry might be the Power He Knows Not in the form of a wildcard whose actions are not bound by the wording of the prophecy but whose involvement via circumstances can indirectly affect the outcome. After all, the prophecy doesn't say Neville has to do it alone and a girl(friend) with a one-of-a-kind protection against his nemesis (due to Lily's protection, Voldemort cannot magically inflict harm on Harry directly, only indirectly via things like blowing up the ground next to her to bludgeon her with the flying debris) is the kind of ally Voldemort can never have.
