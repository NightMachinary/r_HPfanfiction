First, some advice: you should write fanfiction to have fun with it, not to have a good reception in the fandom. There will always be people who dislike what you do, but if /you/ like what you do, like-minded people will like it too! Now, AO3 is better at filtering out the haters (because there /are/ people who look at a summary written *FEM!HARRY* and still comment "Harry is a girl???? Why didn't you say so?? This sucks!!!"), if you want to moderate or not have comments, and it's easier for people to find your story by tags, BUT ff.net seems to have a bigger part of the fandom reading and writing gen (non-shipping) fics, and you should know that [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] is just a small part of the fandom, so the reception will be very different on different places.

That said, I love your idea and I would read the hell out of it! Just from this, I already identify with her so much lol. I, too, would look upon the mirror of Erised and find myself just chilling. And I need more Harry just-leave-me-the-fck-alone Potter in my life.

No bashing and no OP-genius-smarter-than-Hermione Harry? Are you an Angel??

Also I wanna know more about that prophecy..... /Is she the prophecy kid?? Are prophecies BS???? Did Voldemort pick the wrong baby??? Is she even the girl-who-lived??? How many people know about the prophecy, how many people know about the Potters being bait, and oh my god how does that affect each character's attitude towards Harry???? Snape??????/

Ahem. Anyway. If you write that story, please let me know so I can read it.
