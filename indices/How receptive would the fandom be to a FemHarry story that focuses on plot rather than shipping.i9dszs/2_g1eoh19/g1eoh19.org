I don't know about the fandom as a whole, but I'm personally quite receptive to the idea. I just made a request post about a week ago for fics with female leads that aren't romance-heavy, which is honestly a depressing rarity in fanfiction.

I will also add in the obligatory note to not worry so much about what the fandom wants and just write what you want to write. And an added note that even if the fandom is not receptive to the concept (though I don't think this would be the case), I think that female protagonist fics that aren't them being shipped with every other male character is sorely needed.

To sum it up, go for it, and if/when you post it, please let me know so I can read it!
