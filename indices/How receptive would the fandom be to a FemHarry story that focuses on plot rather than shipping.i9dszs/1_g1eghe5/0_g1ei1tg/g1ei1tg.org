I don't really mind whether it's close to canon or not.

One major deviation that will definitely happen is that Harry declines to participate in the Triwizard Tournament (Dumbledore doesn't even say her name out loud in front of everyone, he just lets the feast proceed and privately summons her afterwards) and there are no consequences to her refusal. Other than the plot to get her into the cemetery requiring an alternative way, which drives things off the rails to the point where Voldemort is accidentally resurrected with Neville's blood instead of Harry's (unintentionally fulfilling the "mark him as equal" condition) and Harry fatally bashes Pettigrew's skull in with a rock, leaving Voldemort and Harry unable to directly hurt each other.
