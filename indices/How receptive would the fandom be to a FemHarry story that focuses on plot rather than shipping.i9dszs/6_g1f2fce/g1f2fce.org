I would love to read this! It seems like you're intentionally avoiding/subverting a lot of tropes (which aren't always bad, just used incredibly often), especially power fantasy, manipulative Dumbledore, etc. As long as the story doesn't just exist to subvert tropes but also stands on its own (and it sounds like it will), it's a great choice.

As for the fandom...well, you can never please everybody. People will argue about everything, including whether Harry is an acceptable name for a fem!Harry. But there is also an excited audience for everything as well.

This might be the only fic I've ever seen which really plays with the idea of prophecies being bs, and The Prophecy only being fulfilled because Voldemort is so dramatic. I'm really looking forward to reading it. Please let us know when you post it!
