This will require some shenanigans to explain the so-called "protections" being moved. Or a course for Dumbledore to be called out for not even noticing that they moved.

​

Also, Dumbledore will have to be swinging bats at people looking to get femHarry married into her family. Last Potter, all that money? And before people go "that's not a trust vault blah blah blah", Harry's Grandfather sold his very successful potions business. Harry's father was not irresponsible enough, or alive long enough to spend that much money to leave what was in Harry's vault.

ANYWHO~ That amount of money AND having the fame of "offing the Dark Lord" (or having her ready to hand over when/if the Dark Lord comes back) makes her perfect Trophy Wife material.

Please let Harry be a diminutive name of Harriet or something. Or have a funky spelling. I personally cannot handle people with snowflake names. Hell, this could be how they escape the Goblet: Barty wrote "Harry Potter", and since that isn't her Legal name, it doesn't effect her or leaves him holding the bag with participation.
