As far as I'm concerned parents using their kid as bait for the sake of another family is James and Lily bashing on epic levels, so you're already betraying your last premise there.

Not to mention that you'd have to sidestep all the information security issues of canon twice over, making the whole thing even more dubious.

Also why the gender mismatched name. Even if it's just a ruse, there's no reason not to just lie about it and give the little girl an actual girl name.
