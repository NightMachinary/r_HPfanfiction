It's not necessarily bashing. They didn't hung the baby out to dry, they were fully prepared to die for their child if Voldemort catches the bait and that's just what they did, albeit not necessarily in the same way: I have half an idea that Lily tried to ambush Voldemort with a sawn-off shotgun due to knowing that she can't hold him off in a magical duel and managed to actually hurt him with it, but not seriously because British gun control laws at the time meant that she had to obtain it illegally and without training. Even then, she successfully made Voldemort royally pissed to the point where he literally tore the cheeky little mudblood limb for limb for daring to use a muggle weapon against him, denying her the quick and painless death she got in canon.

And no, the Potters' ploy is not universally treated as heroic. I mean, yeah, Dumbledore thinks it is, but Harry is very ambivalent on the matter and even Snape is heavily torn because as much as he'd like to declare the whole thing to be James' idea he convinced Lily of, Snape knows Lily well enough for a part of him to be aware that Lily herself is fully capable of this kind of subterfuge on her own (especially since Harry is one hell of a dirty fighter herself and explicitly got it from Lily).
