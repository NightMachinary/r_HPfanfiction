Very promising!

My three suggestions:

- No abusive Dursleys, they tried their best, but it's difficult to raise a magic child. Can you imagine tantrums mixed with accidental magic? They did lose their tempers a few times and order her into the cupboard to "chill out".
- Sort her into Hufflepuff, although she's lazy, she's loyal and greatly values friendship.
- Given such major personality change from canon Harry, please please do not rehash canon plot. Even if Dumbledore puts the PS at school, she's NOT going to stick her nose in, so you can either make Voldemort gaining his body earlier or getting neutralized by Dumbledore in front of the Mirror
