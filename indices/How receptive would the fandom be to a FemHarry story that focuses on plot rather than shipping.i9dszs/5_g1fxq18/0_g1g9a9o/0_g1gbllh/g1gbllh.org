A potential plot line I always want to see happen is Harry having a relatively normal Hogwarts time and facing Voldemort as an adult, fully trained and avoiding these pesky issues:

- Teenagers beating Voldemort either through ridiculous power progression or Deus Ex Machina
- Child/Teen politicians
- Children/Teens forced to become soldiers and killers
- Incompetent adults trope in children's literature

--------------

If Voldemort actually kills the good Dursleys, it will hit Harry so much harder.
