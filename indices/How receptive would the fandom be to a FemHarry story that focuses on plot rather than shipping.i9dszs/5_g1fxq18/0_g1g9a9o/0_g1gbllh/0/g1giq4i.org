Incompetent adults won't happen.

Teen politicians won't happen.

No ridiculous power progression will happen. Harry's way of fighting is that of a guerrilla-style dirty fighter: she makes heavy use of the Invisibility Cloak for ambushes, flanking attacks, throwing potions with dangerous effects, fake retreats into traps prepared ahead of time, improvisation with her environment with things like blasting through walls, opening gas valves to set off an explosion after luring DEs into the house and herself getting out on the other side, and just generally being an annoyingly slippery combatant. She can't fight an experienced DE head-on, so she cheats like crazy because honor means nothing if you're dead.
