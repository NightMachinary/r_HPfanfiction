Details still need to be worked out but the general idea is that Neville tags along for the ride and when Wormtail pulls a knife on Harry to take her blood, Neville attacks Wormtail, the two get into a scuffle over the cauldron and Wormtail accidentally injures Neville with the knife, causing Harry to flip out, tackle Wormtail to the ground and beat his face with a rock until he stops moving... at which point Harry gets flung off of him and pinned down by Voldemort, as Neville's blood fell into the cauldron and completed the ritual while Harry and Neville were distracted.

On the other hand, Neville's blood being used instead of Harry's means that Harry's protection via Lily is still very much intact, which is what allows the teens to escape due to Harry realizing that Voldemort cannot magically harm her directly and immediately putting herself between Voldemort and Neville as the latter's human shield.
