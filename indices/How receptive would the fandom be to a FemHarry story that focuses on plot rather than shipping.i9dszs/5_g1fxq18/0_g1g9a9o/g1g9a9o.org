No abuse happens. In fact, I recently thought of a scene where Dumbledore explicitly asks Harry if she was physically abused, only for her to be unable to name even one incident and wonder why didn't they when they hated her so much. To which Dumbledore would casually recount a tale where he was in the response team to a DE raid in muggle territory and caught a DE in the middle of having his way with a muggle teenage girl. Said DE promptly got launched out of the second-floor window and hit the ground beneath in pieces, while Dumbledore stunned the girl, healed her and applied a memory charm so that she won't remember the trauma and can move on with her life. Last time he checked back on her, she was happily married. Moral of the story: child abuse is where this Dumbledore draws the line at whether someone can still be redeemed in his eyes and as he near-smugly adds, he may have "accidentally" let that slip to Petunia.

There's a high likelihood that she won't get involved with the PS, yes. I'm not sure whether she would even get involved in the troll incident, as McGonagall casually solos the beast with the expected competence of Dumbledore's right-hand woman. Moral of the story: don't mess with the stern granny who teaches magic because she likely knows a hundred different ways to mess you up with it, even if she doesn't end up doing it in the end because she's a morally good person.
