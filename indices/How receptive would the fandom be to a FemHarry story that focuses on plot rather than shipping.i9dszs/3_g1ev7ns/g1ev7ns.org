Personally, I prefer plot to ships. I've read too many fics that existed purely to sail ships and what little not-ship plot there was died way too early. I find those to be terribly disappointing stories and wish more people could sustain non-ship plots.

Your premise sounds really interesting, so don't let ship-lovers sink your enthusiasm.
