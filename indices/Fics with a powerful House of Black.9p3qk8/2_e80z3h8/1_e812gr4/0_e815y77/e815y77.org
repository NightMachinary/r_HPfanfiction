It's cool. I haven't updated in a good while because life has been very irritating lately and I wanted to do a few short stories and one-shots recently. Though, I'm 7k words into my next chapter (and a bit into the one that follows it), so I'm getting back into the swing of things.

Maybe check it out one day! I can definitely relate to reading finished stories more that incomplete ones.
