  Voldemort is fighting the ministry for freedom to explore all aspects of magic. Follow the dark magic isn't inherently evil trope. ... Finally make the ministry suck a little bit more. Slightly more oppressive towards half breeds, etc.

Lots of Tomione fics use this strategy to humanize Tom a bit, and make his pairing with Hermione more believable - blood purity is sort of explained away as Tom using it to whip up support to take down an ineffectual, crooked (and quietly prejudiced) ministry, rather than a truly held belief. I think this has sort of mixed results with regard to operating somewhat within character bounds and believability, but it can be done with strong enough writing.
