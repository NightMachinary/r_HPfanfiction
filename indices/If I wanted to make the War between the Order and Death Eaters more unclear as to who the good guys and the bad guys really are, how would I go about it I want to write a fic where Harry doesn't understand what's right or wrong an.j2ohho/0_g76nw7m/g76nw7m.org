You need to make Voldemort more sympathetic than cannon and Dumbledore more openly ruthless. Instead of being about being bigoted towards muggles, Voldemort is fighting the ministry for freedom to explore all aspects of magic. Follow the dark magic isn't inherently evil trope. He's still a terrorist, but it's harder to hate him purely from an ideological basis. You can make a manipulative Dumbledore that sacrifices people and never grew beyond the greater good philosophy. Make him someone that's not above brainwashing children, taking hostages and executing enemies. Finally make the ministry suck a little bit more. Slightly more oppressive towards half breeds, etc. That way Voldemort is even justified in trying to overthrow the ministry and Dumbledore is more despicable for trying to preserve it. In a situation where everyone sucks, it becomes harder to cleanly identify the good guys.

Depending on how you want the story to go you can even disregard the prophecy or make it so prophecy is only self fulfilling in this AU. That way Harry doesn't automatically has to kill Voldemort and the struggle to pick who to fight for is more meaningful.
