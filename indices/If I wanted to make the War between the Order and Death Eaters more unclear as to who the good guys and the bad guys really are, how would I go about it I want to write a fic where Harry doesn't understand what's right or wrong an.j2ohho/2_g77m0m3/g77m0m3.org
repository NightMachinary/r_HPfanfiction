I think that the others have pretty much answered your question: make the Order more ruthless and morally grey, while the Death Eaters should be actual people with actual goals, instead of (mostly) a bunch of one-dimensional villains.

What I think is important is where you go with the whole moral ambiguity angle. The thing is, there are *a lot* of fanfics which justify Voldemort and the DEs and/or villify Dumbledore and the Order, but most of them just go for a full perspective flip: the good guys become the bad guys and vice versa. The Weasleys are suddenly a bunch of villains who would like nothing more than to drug, rob and control the Boy-Who-Lived, while the Malfoys are about the nicest people you've ever met, and so on. And, well, aside from being unoriginal to the point of cliché, this isn't really "morally ambiguous" - it's still the same "good guys vs bad guys" story, just with the sides switched.

What would make for a compelling story, IMO, is if /both/ sides could be reasonably considered "good guys": they would both have ideas that are worth fighting for, they would both genuinely believe in what's best for Magical Britain, but - as it often happens - their ideas are just incompatible with each other, and the increasing levels of hostility between them combined with either side's inability to back down would eventually lead to a full-blown civil war. Once again, as another commenters have said, both sides would have good and bad people, and both sides would ultimately become more and more violent in desperate attempts to win.

For instance, you could write Dumbledore as a conservative whose experience with Grindelwald has left him with a deep aversion for any sort of sudden change within the magical society, and Voldemort as a revolutionary who believes that the Magical world is stagnating and needs to change. They would both believe that they are fighting for the good of the people, and, furthermore, that the /other side/'s actions would eventually lead to the destruction of the society they are living in.

Or you could have a Voldemort who's still mostly out for himself (if not quite as sociopathic as he was in canon) versus a Dumbledore who wants to bring about a better world - and would stop at nothing in order to do so, even if it means destroying the old families holding back progress, or forbidding the knowledge that could be used for evil ends. In other words, a classic conflict of individualism vs. collectivism.

tl;dr "although a conflict between Good and Evil can drive a good story, it's not half as riveting as a conflict between Good and Good"*
