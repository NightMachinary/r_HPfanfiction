This is very easy to do, and very hard to do well.

For instance, giving Dumbledore a scheming hidden motivation that is nefarious works, but is also a bit boring and overdone. The bigger problem is that Voldemort is one of the most categorically and archetypally evil characters ever written, right up there with Emperor Palpatine.

/IF/ I were to do this, this is how I would go about it:

** Adjusting Dumbledore
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adjusting-dumbledore
   :END:
I wouldn't make Dumbledore evil, I would make him inept. He's portrayed as so powerful that he doesn't even really need to use his power in the books. So all-knowing that he doesn't even need to ask questions. Instead, make him only /convinced/ that he is these things, while in fact he's senile.

In this way, he can still have the same pure motivations, and even genuinely be working for good... but if he's unable to exert control, all his /followers/ will more independently express their own morals, letting you show the "light" side to be more fractured and less trustworthy.

Maybe his followers are there more for a blood feud they have with someone on Voldemort's side or personal grievance than for principle. (This is already almost the case anyway when you think about the people in the Order.)

Maybe he has all his powerful positions because he's uniquely someone who has genuine respect from the wizarding world, is easy to manipulate as a figurehead, but also is convinced that he's acting on his own plans and motivations.

This seems easier and more interesting than just twisting Dumbledore into another dark lord.

** Adjusting Voldemort
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adjusting-voldemort
   :END:
Personally I wouldn't want to just rewrite Voldemort's motivations. So instead, what I would do is use his most evil action to make him sympathetic: the Horcruxes.

The Horcruxes split his soul. What if /one/ of those soul pieces ends up in a situation where it sort of resets and gets to live a different life than the original Tom? Maybe it comes in close contact with Neville when he's a baby, supplants Neville's soul, and takes over his body. But Neville is just a baby, so at first Voldemort's soul doesn't "fit" into the new body... it doesn't have the memories, it doesn't have the motivations... just moments and flashes of feelings and dreams.

As the Neville-mort grows up (I chose Neville randomly, you could use an OC or literally any other character you're willing to sacrifice), he slowly pieces things back together, but now it's mixing with his "second life". He finds himself disgusted with who he used to be, but maybe also sympathetic to the things that the "true" Voldemort cares about.

This in effect lets you create a third character that takes the place of Voldemort as a character. The original Voldemort can remain something more like a "force of nature" within the story, like he was in the books. Just an inevitable consequence.

But it gives the space to flesh out a meaningful characterization of Tom, /and/ it also gives you the space to explore something that Rowling wrote in the books then */immediately/* contradicted with how she portrayed Tom: that people aren't inherently evil, no one starts out that way. They are made that way, and then they choose to be that way.

** Harry's Dilemma
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: harrys-dilemma
   :END:
I think the interesting thing here would be if Neville-mort reveals himself to Harry, and is the one that sees the morally questionable nature of the Order. Maybe Neville-mort reveals that he wants to remain neutral, but says he's informing Harry because if Harry decides to kill Voldemort, he'll have to kill Neville-mort eventually since he's a Horcrux, and he's leaving that decision up to Harry.

That makes the whole Horcrux aspect of Voldemort a lot more interesting, because it makes them a challenge to Harry as a character, not just a plot obstacle.
