  For example, you don't write Death Eaters as sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis who relish torture and murder and wanted to exterminate Muggleborns and Muggles. But they can be someone who fought violently for their traditions and rights, kind like the last Japanese Samurais.

Have seen this used before, plus residual fear from witch hunts and burnings. Framed as a desire to preserve the wizarding culture that was borne from persecution from muggles.
