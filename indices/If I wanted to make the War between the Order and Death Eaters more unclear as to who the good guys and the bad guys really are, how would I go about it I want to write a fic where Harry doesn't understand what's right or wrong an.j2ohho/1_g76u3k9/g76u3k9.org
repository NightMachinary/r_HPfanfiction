It's not that hard, but you need to rewrite their motivations and methods. For example, you don't write Death Eaters as sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis who relished torture and murder and wanted to exterminate Muggleborns and Muggles. But they can be someone who fought violently for their traditions and rights, kind like the last Japanese Samurais.

On the other hand, Dumbledore, in control of the Ministry, was determined to change Wizarding Britain into a highly centralized (and autocratic) state. To achieve that, he needed to break the power of the "Old Families", with violence if necessary.

As for their methods and tactics, you leave canon behind and write what parties in civil wars generally do: atrocities on both sides. You can still have Bellatrix as the crazed sadistic warrior, but you can also write Frank Longbottom as the chief Order henchman who had killed and tortured many Death Eaters.

I will also change Voldemort's personality from that monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain. He will be not someone who rules by fear mainly, but through courage, leadership, persuasion, and protection. He is someone who will go to great lengths to exact retributions for the suffering of his followers; he shows both immense magical powers and strategic brilliance. In other words, this Voldemort has earned the loyalty and respect of his followers.
