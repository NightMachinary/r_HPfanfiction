Depends on what you are really asking. Do you want to make the War between the Order and the Death eaters one where good and bad are subjective? Or do you want a war where it is unclear who is in the right?

The first is the more interesting one, the second is bigotry apologia.

In the first, you create a varied AU. You can't have moral ambiguity when literally one sides platform is bigotry. Bigotry is bad and wrong. So make the Death Eaters a sympathetic band using morally grey violent means to accomplish their ends. To keep thematic ties to canon make them a resistance to a cultural and political takeover (pne with actual valid concerns, not bigotry dog whistles). Muggleborn and current government policy are driving out traditional wizarding religious activity, and (valid, not discriminatory) traditions and politics. Have them have tried to work within the system, raise their concerns validly and get ignored, have a leader assassinated or thrown in prison, along with a number of followers, let the rest become violent activists/terrorists/resistance depending on point of view.

Make the Order more of a concerning influence on politics. They are a group trying to enact changes that they think are right and make things better, but they are an external group with a concerning infiltration of the government and educational system at multiple levels, whose members are loyal to one man and his vision.

If you just want the second path, where the Death Eaters are still bigots but there is still visual moral ambiguity from an in character perspective, show some areas where the actions of the Death Eaters are indisputably good, and not just for non-muggleborn. And also show some conerning things about the order and decisions/actions they've made. Be careful not to fall into the trap of showing Death Eaters in a positive light unless you are going to drop the bigotry completely.
