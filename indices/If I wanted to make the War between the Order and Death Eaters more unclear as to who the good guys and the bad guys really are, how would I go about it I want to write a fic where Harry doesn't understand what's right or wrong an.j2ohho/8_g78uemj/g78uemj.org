Something I've wanted to try myself is Voldemort/death eaters agenda isn't blood purity, but freedom. Freedom from the ICW and the statue of secrecy. Why should wizards hide when they clearly have the power? Freedom for creatures like giants, and dragons to freely roam. Basically leading to genocide of the muggle world. Blood purity can still be a thing just like Superiority over muggles is, but it isn't a war against mudbloods it's a war on taking the planet from muggles and coming out of hiding.
