If you don't want to completely change canon like most offer here, then lean more into the idea that a lot of the death eaters don't have a choice, because their families are in danger if they don't become death eaters (that would be a bit closer to WWII german soldiers instead of the SS/SA/Gestapo). Let Harry meet Death Eaters that fight desperately because they fear for their children/siblings lives, but maybe they would let those they don'\\
t have to brutalize flee. Like letting them just ignore some kind of info that hints at someone smuggling muggleborns out of the country.

And on the other hand, let the Order fight more desperate as well. Let them fight more in a guerilla war tactic way. They know who the death eaters are and don't fight them in the open, but attack and kill them at other times. I have a plot bunny story in my folder about one member actual hunt down the death eaters and those that support them in other ways (money, influence...) but that could lead to an old couple being murdered in their home, and that character would kill the sposes of death eaters as well, take their children (whip the memories and send them away, letting them be adopted by muggle families. The character justifies this, as giving the kids a chance to be good people. But a small part thinks it would be fair if the death eaters end up killing their own missing children for their twisted ideology)

You don't have to change the ideologies for either side, but you can play with individual ideologies just fine
