1) Voldemort needs to actually have a goddamn point. Canon is just him being incompetently evil for the hell of it. Maybe he's like in To Reach Without, where his entire purpose is to draw all the pureblood supremacists into a single group to eliminate them all. Maybe he just wants to rule. Either way, he needs actual goals and ways to accomplish them.

2) Play the Ministry and Dumbledore as the horrific oligarchy that it is. In canon, the good guys are corrupt government officials. Arthur Weasely is an excellent example. He has no functional knowledge of muggle society and technology, and yet he runs a major ministry department on muggle technology. He does favors to bail out his friends after they break the law. The government runs a kangaroo court system (when they bother to give the victims a trial before tossing them in the torture box.) Why on Earth would Harry want to support that? Why would Harry want to let them do whatever they want? Tearing down that system is a good thing. Of course, this would take some tweaking of Voldemort's ALL OF THAT BUT WORSE cartoonishly evil canon self, but whatever.

Hell, since I already brought up To Reach Without, let's include that Lord system that Dumbledore bashers love. Hogwarts is for people of a certain social standing and muggleborns (for reasons). The "everyone works in the government" tone from canon is entirely because they do, Hogwarts is the school for high-standing people. The entire rest of society is educated in other schools. Tom Riddle, having been harassed for years because of blood purity, discovers his heritage. It makes absolutely no difference, because they're racists and don't give a damn. His new nickname is mudsnake. He allies with Myrtle Warren, a fellow victim, and they start plotting. They rally the lower classes in an enlightenment revolution and immediately set upon terror attacks. The factions that form are the ministry pureblood supremacists who use the revolution as fuel for their bigotry, Dumbledore's faction of status quo supporters, and the majority of people, who want equality but not by murdering every government official. Tom's faction doesn't include the rich Slytherin crowd, since they're quite happy with the system and equating cleverness with evil like in canon is a goddamn stupid idea. Dumbledore puts together his Order, which as in canon is mostly recruited from technically-not-child-soldiers just out of school. See? They're adults! Snape and Lily still fall out, but this time as a result of Snape becoming radicalized in the much more overtly racist Slytherin house and Lily disagreeing about the violence.

Tom (because he's starting a people's revolution, he's doing it under his very common name) is by now waging war and learns of a prophecy about a potential threat (wording slightly altered because he's not a Lord and cares more about the revolution). The resulting battle when he attacks the Potters kills every participant, except for Harry and Sirius, who is promptly thrown in prison for +leaving the House of Black+ participating in killing the Potters. Dumbledore holds up Harry as some sort of messiah, to which people outside the upper class give a resounding meh.

When Harry shows up at school, the classist and tacitly racist undertones are much more overt, and the half-blood upstart stomps on all their precious pureblood protocol. How rude of him to not say "Well met, heir Malfoy" and all that. How very rude. Years one and two are a bit different in their events, but events still happen where Harry has to fight something. By the summer of year three, Harry's struggling with living with the Dursleys and being forced into fighting to protect people who hate him. When he runs away from them at the end of third year, he winds up meeting Severus Snape, who is running an apothecary on the edge of Diagon (not a single street, but a full town). Snape's not a teacher at Hogwarts because he was an associate of enemies of the state, but is having a great time doing research and taking apprentices. Seeing Harry as another abused child who slipped through Dumbledore's ironclad "don't give a damn" policies, Snape takes in Harry and mixes stories of his mother with comments on how Tom Riddle also got the "you must return to the dangerous environment" answer from Dumbledore. One comment from Snape about Sirius leads Harry digging into what happened to Sirius and trying to rescue him from the literal hell he's locked in. The end result is that while Harry hates Tom Riddle for killing his parents, he also absolutely despises Dumbledore's appeasement of the classist and racist elements that made his life so awful.
