first thing you can do is simply make the good guys more powerful than the bad. the rebel alliance/underdog narrative generally only encourages a view of righteousness where if the order ever did some distasteful things it would be placed in the light of desperation.

have instead the order collect a wide range of allies. but ones that are not necessarily good. dumbledore attempted to negotiate with the werewolves and the giants. what if he succeeds here along with say the vampires and maybe some hags.

Fenrir Greyback in the order of the Phoenix. Fenrir wants more rights for werewolves, same as dumbledore and remus. what he wants to do with more freedom is another thing.

and then those house raids against suspected death eaters begin. its early days with voldemort during the fifth year. he still needs to regain his following only his inner circle has returned and even that is diminished by deaths and prison. old family homes are powerfully warded. the use of creatures like giants or contracts with goblin curse breakers would be what they would need to break through and "citizens arrest" suspects.

dumbledore does not have to be evil here merely not completely in control. after the reign of terror of voldemort people could be willing to play hard ball. arrests without warrants hassling suspicious people. or those groups who aren't elevated by an alliance with the order could be discriminated against by the order. aurors cracking down in Knockturn Alley and overturning businesses.

fudge can still refuse to acknowledge Voldemort's return but he could decide to restart the Manhunt for Sirius Black to a fever pitch. what if he decides to claim Sirius Black was behind the World Cup/the tournament/Cedrics murder/ and crouch jr.s escape and death?

it's a conflict without easy resolution because Harry would have to keep sirius a secret in order to keep the ministry working with the order. fudge is already paranoid this is a coup attempt after all, sirius being in cahoots with Dumbledore might be a political time bomb that might destroy any unity in the light faction.

there are plenty of light families who suffered losses. have them throw the first stone and semi competent voldemort could rally those neutral to his banner.

a big thing would be that i would encourage in such a change is make Dumbledore less omniscient. make him his actual age. a 90 year old man. old out of touch and dying. his calls for peace may actually work against the order or lose the legitimacy of his movement.

imagine like the last of the Mckinnons setting fiendfyre on the branch family of the Rookwoods home.
