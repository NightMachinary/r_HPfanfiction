It kind of is. The rest of the story is going to be mostly from the POV of Ron and Hermione as they try to defeat Harry.

See in the fic, Harry thinks he's some wizard prodigy but in reality he isn't and can barely preform difficult spells. The first chapter was from the POV of a demented Harry I guess.
