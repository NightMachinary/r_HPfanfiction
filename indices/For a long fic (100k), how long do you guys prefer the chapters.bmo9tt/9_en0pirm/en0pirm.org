All of my chapters are roughly 2k (and I've written over 200 chapters)\\
The reason for that is when I started writing, it because a challenge for me to write a chapter a day under an hour. Turned out that 2k was duable that way and made it able for me to post every day (which made my readers happy). If there was a part in the story that required more words, I'd just end up writing /Chapter Title part 1/, following the next day by /Same Chapter Title part 2./ It's also easier to read on mobile if the chapters aren't too long, which most readers seem to be doing opposed to reading it straight from the website.
