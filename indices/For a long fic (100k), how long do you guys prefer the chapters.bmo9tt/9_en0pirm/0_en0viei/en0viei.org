I also tend to chapters between 2 and 3K long, but in my case it's because I have a tendency to concentrate on the structure of the chapter rather than trying to pad it out with turgid purple prose.

Spending a thousand words describing how someone's hair rippled and waved in the breeze as they walked through a door is not the sort of thing I do.

On the other hand, I once did a non-HP story in which one chapter was 15 words (no, not 15K, just /fifteen/) and got loads of positive reviews for it.
