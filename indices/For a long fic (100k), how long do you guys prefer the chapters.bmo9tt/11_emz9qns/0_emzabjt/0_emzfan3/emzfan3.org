Fair correction on basic math, I guess I should have said 300-400k words. There are some stories that have 100k words but 30 plus chapters. Generally that means it reads more like a collection of one shots by the author than a cohesive story. That's what I dislike. If each chapter is a paragraph or two from one character only instead of just mixing them together with page breaks or transitions. Personally it's a turn off.
