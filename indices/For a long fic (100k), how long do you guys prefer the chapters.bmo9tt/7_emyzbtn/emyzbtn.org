That's actually a question I've never thought of. I definitely prefer longer chapters, it just allows you to become more imerced.

I would say 3k would be my minimum.

I know when I write my goal is to get it somewhere between 4 and 8k (I know that's very broad) if it goes 9k or above I'll usually divide it, unless it's a prologue or there just isn't a good place to break it up without ruining the pace.
