If I feel like I'm spending as much time hitting next as I am scrolling, it's too short. Some people use chapters as scene breaks, and it gets annoying.

Maybe 3-4k? I don't know how many words are in a typical chapter, but I want to spend at least a few minutes reading it. 10k+ though is a bit much. If it's that long and you haven't found somewhere to split the chapter, you must be very verbose...
