I generally like it with several major scenes per chapter. I personally write with three or more per, depending on the length and how they relate to each other chronologically within the story's timeline (i.e. Scenes that take place around the same time are grouped together, more or less regardless of their relevancy to each other).

As a result, my chapters are generally 5-9k-ish in length.

Truthfully, as long as the author is consistent with the organization of their chapters I don't really care. If they have one chapter that's 2k and the next is 15k+ that's just irritating, but otherwise just go for it.
