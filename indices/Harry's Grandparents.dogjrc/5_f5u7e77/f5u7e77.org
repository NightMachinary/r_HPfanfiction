The names Charlus and Dorea existed for them in fanon LONG LONG before JKR came out with that Fleamont and Euphemia bullshit on pottermore.

Also a lot of people (myself included) don't view pottermore as canon or even view it favorably at all. That leads to a lot of people just going with the established fanon version of things instead.

There will always be people who disagree, and I'll likely get downvoted for saying this; but I personally will never view pottermore as being actual canon. I think it's a trashy attempt at retconning and JKR should have just given up and never even tried it because she did it far too late.
