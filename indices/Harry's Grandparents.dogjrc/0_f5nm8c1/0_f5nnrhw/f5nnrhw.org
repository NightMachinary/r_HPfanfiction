The thing is that they never made sense as Harry's grandparents, for one Rowling had already revealed that James Parents were elderly even by wizarding standards, while we know Dorea was only forty when James was born.

Then there is also them not being burned of the Family Tree, which they definitely would have been if they were James Parents, since they took Sirius in after his family kicked him out, and helping Sirius got his Uncle burned of the family tree.

Edit: I was just reading Order of thr Phoenix, and noticed that Sirius was surprised that Tonks wasn't on the Family Tree, meaning that if Dorea was Harry's Grandmother he definitely would have noted Harry's absence.
