As others in the thread have already said, Charlus and Dorea were revealed before Fleamont and Euphermia were, so many fanfiction authors simply jump onto fanon rather than extended canon when writing their fic.

That said, there are other reasons why some authors would choose to make them Harry's grandparents. Giving Harry an actual extended family through Sirius, Andromeda, and Tonks is one such example.
