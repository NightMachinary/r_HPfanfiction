Technically fits. But also it's probably not quite what you wanted -- this fic has an aged Harry (3 years older), whose younger brother was the BWL (cannon age of Harry). Harry is in Ravenclaw, little bro is Griffindor, everyone else (including Hermione) is sorted the same

Still a great fic, and even though it's abandoned it is worth a read. It's near the top of my "I wish this fic would be completed" list
