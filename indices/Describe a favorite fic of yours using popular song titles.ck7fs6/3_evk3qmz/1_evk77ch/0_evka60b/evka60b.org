It has a somewhat more rule-abiding version of Hermione. Other that, no bashing. I mean, if Harry ran off from the Order in canon as he does in that fic, you bet Hermione would be pissed. And she is less than pleased with public displays of affection, so her reacting badly to sex is not that OOC. I'd prefer a supportive, wingman Hermione over the characterisation the author wrote, no question there, but it is still bearable.
