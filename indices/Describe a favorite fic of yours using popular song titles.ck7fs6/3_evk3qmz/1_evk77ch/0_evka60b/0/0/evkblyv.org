The canon Order is useless as nipples on an air balloon. And their treatment of Harry is more than a little questionable. So being pissed at them is perfectly fine in my book as long as you don't make up stupid shit like love potion plots or mind control. Not sure about "saying the same thing", but each chapter has a different thing happen. The only reoccurring theme is trips with Lisa and her family.
