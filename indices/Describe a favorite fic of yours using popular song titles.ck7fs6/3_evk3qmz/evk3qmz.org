"Call me maybe"

To describe the fic

"Call Me"

A lovely subversion of the average post OotP summer angst. Harry finds a small letter with a phone number, he decides to call it and ends up on a date with Lisa Turpin. Summer romance from there on, no moping, no training montages, no helpful goblins, no bashing, just some light hearted fun. The adults are a tad too reasonable and due to the underage magic restriction, there is not a lot of magic happening.
