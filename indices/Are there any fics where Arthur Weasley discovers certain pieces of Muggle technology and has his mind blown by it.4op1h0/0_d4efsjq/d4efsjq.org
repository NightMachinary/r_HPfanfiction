linkffn(Arthur Weasley's newest toy)

It's a crack oneshot, but [[/spoiler][his mind is certainly /blown/ by the thing in question]]. It also includes one of my favourite lines in fanfic, for the sheer improbablility and silliness: [[/spoiler]["Besides, who's ever heard of a 'Mercedes' sign in black and yellow? Pff, ridiculous."]]

On another note, I'll see if I can find some more serious fics that fit your criteria.
