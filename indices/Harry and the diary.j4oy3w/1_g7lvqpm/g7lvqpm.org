He might have it in linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It's kind of impossible to tell right now. I suspect everybody in this story, but he does at least have a journal that is directly connected to Voldemort, and it definitely might be the diary.

The only other one I can think of is the fem!Harry one on AO3. It starts with a “M” but I can't spell it to save my life.
