[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12029172/chapters/27229608]] This is a mentor Snape fic and it is part of serie, it is really excellent but it gets lost in the third year, the first two years are excellent though. In this fic Harry talks to the diary for several days in a row and is possessed, I really recommend reading it, maybe that's what you're looking for. (Here Ginny still uses the diary but they don't have any kind of close relationship)
