In canon, Harry had the Diary almost as long as Ginny:

- Ginny had it from late August until mid November when she threw it away in Myrtle's bathroom after Justin was petrified. A few days latter, Hermione began brewing polyjuice in the same place, which she finished shortly before Christmas. The time to brew the polyjuice is one month.
- Harry found the Diary sometime in January next year after talking to Myrtle. Diary Riddle showed him the memory of how Hagrid was blamed for the first COS incident.
- On Valentine's Day, Harry's bag was ripped open and Ginny saw the Diary there. Also, Ginny wrote that poem without the Diary in her possession.
- In early May, Ginny broke into Harry's dorm and stoke back the Diary. The attack on Hermione and Penelope Clearwater followed immediately after. That was when Dumbledore was sacked and Hagrid sent to Azkaban.
- On May 29, the Diary took Ginny into the COS to force a final confrontation with Harry

So if you do a little math here, both Harry and Ginny had the Diary for almost 4 months.
