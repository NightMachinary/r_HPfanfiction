Yes! I read a HP/TMR fic (I'm pretty sure it was a slash fic. The whole thing was kind of weird) where Harry dies in the cave and becomes a zombie himself.

I tried to find it, but the author I thought wrote it definitely did not. It was sort of a dark, angsty romance fic, I think. Now I want to read it again.
