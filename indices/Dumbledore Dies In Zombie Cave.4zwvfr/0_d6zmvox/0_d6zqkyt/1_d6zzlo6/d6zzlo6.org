Thanks... I'd be more interested in an exploration of the consequences of such an event for people other than Harry, I think. With Harry devoured by the inferi, would Dumbledore still want to commit Suicide by Snape, or would he try to resurrect Harry before he dies? (Voldemort, by taking Harr's blood, anchors Harry to this world, remember.) Are there non-Dark ways to do that? Or would Dumbledore come up with a different plan, that doesn't involve Harry?
