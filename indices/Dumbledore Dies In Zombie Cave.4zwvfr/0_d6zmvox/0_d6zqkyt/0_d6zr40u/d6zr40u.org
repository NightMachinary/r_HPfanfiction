Was that the one where Harry's zombieness was an issue between them, where Tom tries his hardest to pretend it isn't and it totally is?

That was definitely a weird one. I can't think what possessed me to read it. It's definitely original though, for a Harry Potter fic, maybe that was why.

I can't remember what it was called, sadly.
