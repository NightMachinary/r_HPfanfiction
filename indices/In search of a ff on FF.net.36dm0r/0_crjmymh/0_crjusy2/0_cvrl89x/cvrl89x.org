Come on, I didn't say it was a GOOD fanfiction, just that I wanted to find it again. If it's any better to you he is 13 and says to be 16, because 'oh yeah, everyone thinks I look older anyway' and three chapters later 'the abuse of the Dursley left him short and skinny'. As I said not a good fic, not even well written, but there's a sort of sick curiosity when after years you think about it and can't FIND it.
