It means so much to me, I remember loving this fic so, so much, and because I have an awful memory, that really says a lot about how much I loved it. I don't think I'll ever be able to stop thanking you for this, hopefully I'll still love it as much as I did when I first read it! This really does mean a lot to me =)
