Fics that have less than 30k words, I don't download them, read them directly from the website. Updates too, using the favourites. I usually read the first chapter of a fic with 30k+ words to see if I'll enjoy the author's flow, grammar, quality overall. If the its bad, but the premise is still good, I download to EPUB and read on my PC till I get sleepy, then I transfer the EPUB to my cell. Everything about tracking what I've read, where I am and what the fic is about, is done either by memory or by the history of my folder, since its sorted by date.
