I don't read more than a maximum of two at once. I download everything I read and put it on my tablet, so that remembers the last page I was on. The only time I don't read on tablet is if (a) it's really short, in which case I don't need to mark of where I was in it; or (b) I'm converting a PDF; that requires format fixing so I read it as a document on PC and I just put a note at the top saying what chapter/page I was on.
