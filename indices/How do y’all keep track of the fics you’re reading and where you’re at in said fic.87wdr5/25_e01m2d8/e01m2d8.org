I use a bit of a mix. When I started Reading in 2013, I just used chrome bookmarks to keep track of fics, but without the summaries it was just a long list of names. In 2014 I switched to just keeping text documents of each fic like on an ipad note or something. Then When university started I kind of fell behind on reading for like a year. Then I found [[/r/hpfanfiction]] iirc, it was amazing and gave recommendations for things based on similarities more often than not. Since a majority of them were recommending ffn i used their website and eventually switched to the app to keep track and read everything on android. I have an ao3 account which I originally made back when i had irl friends who wrote nightvale fanfic. Nowadays i use baconreader to find a fic (or firefox on desktop) and then read in ffn or ao3 app or on firefox reader view.
