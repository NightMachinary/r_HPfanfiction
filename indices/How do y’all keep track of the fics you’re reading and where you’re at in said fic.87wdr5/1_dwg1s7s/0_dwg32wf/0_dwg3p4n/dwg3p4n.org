Hmm... well [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDwpHQdHGM9_QJtY296RdhmbnoE1vhlowB9DhNRTUhiu3WW6fl2aB4ZfCQ0Q7dJc6_N80OVq9cq6Bo/pubhtml?gid=1903722623&single=true][this is one example]] that I've come across of a sort of organization plan done on google sheets/docs. There's another one [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit][here]] that was done on google docs in a different style.

Something like one of those might be what you're looking for?
