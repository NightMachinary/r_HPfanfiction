I bookmark the chapter I'm on, and in the title of the bookmark, I add "- Ch #" just so I can quickly see where I left off. Not a great method as I tend to remove the bookmark once I'm done, and I forget what I've read or which story had which plot, details, etc. I know some people have some really great google sheets or documents to keep track of what they've read, what it was about, how much they liked it, etc. I'm sure you could make a similar case for stories you're currently reading.
