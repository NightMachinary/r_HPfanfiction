I don't read much FF nowdays (I always go like 1 year on, 2 years off on fanfic), but when I did this was my whole system:

I mainly find new fics by forum recs (inc. this subreddit) and favorites of authors I like.

If a fic catches my attention (interesting premise/targets one of my weaknesses/has generated a lot noise) I give it a try. Like 75% of stories get the axe here, since my standards are pretty high (and kinda weirdly specific) after so many years. If I can't get through the first chapter but I want to give the story another chance, I skim a couple chapters way down the line. This either leads to the axe or my future reading bookmark folder. And after the story gets into the folder:

If it's long (>60-100k) and complete it gets converted to EPUB, then goes to my kindle and calibre library.

If it's long and in progress, it too goes to the kindle, but also to my favorites list.

If it's short (<30-40k) I usually just read it on the computer in one go. Again if in progress, I add to favorites.

At any case, after those steps the link gets deleted from my bookmarks, since it tended to get bogged down a lot (at some point I had like 600+ links in there).

So basically my favorites list track the stories, but I only read on ff.net and ao3 anyway. I used to follow a small amound of LJ writers but they're not active anymore (GreenGecko come back!)
