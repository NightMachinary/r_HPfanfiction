I download new fics to my e-reader in a to-read folder, once they are read up until the current ending I either delete them or keep them in another folder to re-read. I write myself some notes about each fic.

Anything I like that I catch up to the author on, I follow using the fabric app (and read on there). My main problem is distinguishing between about 5 quite similar fics which are all in progress.
