Generally, if I really like a fic I'll read it to the end without getting distracted by other stories. If it's in progress, I'll favourite it and I regularly check my favourites list for updates. If I get halfway through and get distracted then I either remember or I forget it and therefore it probably wasn't worth continuing anyway.
