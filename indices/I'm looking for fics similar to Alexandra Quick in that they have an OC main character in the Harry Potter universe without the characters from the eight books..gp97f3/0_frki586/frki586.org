Currently working on one of these. I've yet to post the first chapter, but I have the first 50,000ish words written. I like to write a bunch before I post anything haha, helps me go back and edit for consistency.

Basic plot is the late Middle Ages, before the statute of secrecy, poor peasant girl is a muggle born who gets the opportunity to go to Hogwarts, but has to find a way to afford her supplies. Backdrop in the muggle world is the war of the roses. As she grows up she's forced to take a side in the war. I'm planning a 2 or 3 part series hopefully.
