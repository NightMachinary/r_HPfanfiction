Most of these will be next-gen; I don't know why there are so few OC stories set before the Marauders' time. Keep in mind that aside from AQ, next-gen stories with the canon kids tend to be better than those featuring OCs. A lot of these are a little rough in terms of writing.

linkffn(Muggle at Large) - weird but it was entertaining

linkffn(Briallen Bevin and the Snatcher's Cave) - a pretty standard American school fic, but not as good as AQ

linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) - very good. Probably some of the most memorable Quidditch writing in all of fanfic.

linkffn(The Belmont Legacy) - can't remember if this has canon next-gen characters, but I think it doesn't. Very good.

linkffn(Nimbus Albacore: The Curse of Blood) - I think this is all OC, main character is Filch's grandson.

linkffn(The Divide by Beedle) - not sure if this has canon next-gen characters, not that great but a light read.

linkffn(Hide My Name With Fear) - I don't even remember reading this but I have it decently rated, set at Hogwarts well into the future.

That's all I've finished in this category that's worth recommending, hope you enjoy some of them!
