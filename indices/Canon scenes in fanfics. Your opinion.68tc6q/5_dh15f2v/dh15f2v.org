I really don't like canon rehashes, especially fics that repeat words or phrases verbatim from the books. Direct quotes from the book, especially if it's something recognizable that I have read many times before just makes me annoyed and sometimes makes me drop the fic. I much rather you change, condense or skip the the scenes entirely, tell from another pov, or else briefly mention them or describe in ways completely different from the books.

Just don't lift paragraphs directly from the books. It's lazy, a sign of bad writing, a bad story and is extremely boring and frustrating to read. I tend to skim and skip chapters that focus too much on canon and tend to stop reading fics that have to much of it.
