Thanks, I mostly agree with you, and don't think my story runs the risk of repeating canon. At the moment I am writing the resurrection scene, and Harry is a very different person, with different reactions, which is why I can't skip or summarise it, but at the same time Voldemort is, at this point, still the same person he was in canon. So that left me wondering if readers found it acceptable if certain sentences from his dialogue were lifted from canon. As he would - up to a point - say the same things, rephrasing them feels to me like a poor imitation.
