I prefer a story to focus on what makes it different from canon. You do sometimes need to include pieces of canon just to remind your reader of the context, but you don't need to fully recreate the scenes.

Some quotes though are so iconic, I can't imagine not using them if you are writing the scene. For example, I don't think I could write the graveyard scene without using "Kill the spare!" The line is just so much more powerful than anything that I could write to take it's place and it is necessary to set the tone for the scene. The only way I wouldn't use it would be if I was going for a completely different tone.
