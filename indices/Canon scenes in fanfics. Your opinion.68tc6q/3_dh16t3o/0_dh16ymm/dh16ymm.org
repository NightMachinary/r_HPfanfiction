In my story, because Harry is a very different person due to his past, so describing his reaction as the scene unfolds is necessary, but at the same time Voldemort is the same person, and it feels natural that he is, at least in parts, going to say the same things. (Writing the resurrection scene at the moment.) But yes, I don't like canon rehash either, which is why I was wondering how to best approach this scene.
