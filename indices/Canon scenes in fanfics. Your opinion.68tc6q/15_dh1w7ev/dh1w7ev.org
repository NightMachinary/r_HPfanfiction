It depends on a nature of the fic. There are some fics that stay fairly close to canon and quickly go through repeated and less important stuff, focusing on differences and it works because that's what they do all time. Examples being On the Way to Greatness and The Changeling.

But, this won't work in fic where you normally has scenes described in details. It will feel jarring and disconnected. In those cases, the writer should do something to make the scene feel fresh, interesting. Maybe there are some slight differences because it's an AU that hasn't yet branched heavily. Maybe we have a different perspective on those events because it's a canon-compliant fic from a different perspective. Maybe it's an author's writing style that will make it interesting. In the end, it's important to not bore readers, but also to keep a fic consistent.

Also, while quoting dialogues is okay if the same things are beings said, quoting whole scenes is bad and writers who do this should feel bad.
