The Hermione troll scene is one of the most forced scenarios in fanons. I have read so many fictions forcing the scene, it doesn't make any senses...

I believe if a single event happened differently, the canon event never would occur. It was a plot device for developing the friendship between the trios. For example, if Hermione didn't sort to Griffindor or she ignored/never interacts with Ron or Harry didn't friend with Ron or didn't sort to Griffindor, the scene is never possible.

I have seen lots of time a Ravenclaw/Slytherin Hermione with the scene. And what I find most funny always Harry to save the day whether it's Slytherin Harry, Ravenclaw Harry, Hufflepuff Harry or Griffindor Harry; or a WBWL Harry, a big brother Harry or a dumbledork Harry or a weasel Harry.
