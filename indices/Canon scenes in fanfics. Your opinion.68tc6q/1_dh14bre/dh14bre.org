There was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/59j0is/the_deadliest_sin_in_fanfiction_wasting_our_time/][similar discussion]] a while back, and the opinions were mixed.

Personally I think scenes where things unfold exactly like in canon should be skipped, or if that's not possible, glossed over as you've said. Sure, it might make the fic more disjointed, and it wouldn't work if you were writing an original story, but we're writing fanfiction, right?

In fact that's what peeved me about "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux": it's such a great fic, but there's too much rehashing (occasionally even whole paragraphs lifted from canon). I guess removing these scenes would ruin the story's flow, so I can see why the author did that, but I still don't like it.
