If the scene is being narrated through someone else's eyes than in canon (which would almost certainly be harry since we see things by his eyes for like, 99% of the books) then I think it's important to write it in, because someone else will have different thoughts about what's happening. Perhaps summarizing a bit of the dialogue if it will indeed be exactly the same.

But there are several things to account for past that. For instance, is the scene going to happen exactly the same way? Is Harry the exact same character than in canon, and if he isn't, in what way will his thought of the scene differ? Will his thoughts cause him to take a different action?

I only support skipping if a) the scene happens exactly like in canon, or b) if after the skip, we are told what happened in a summarized fashion though a small flashback or more likely, a conversation that speaks of it
