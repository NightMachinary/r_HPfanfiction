If I find a fan fic that starts with a full page (or at least 90% of it) of canon quotes then I click the back button. If you are going to write a fan fiction then I think you should use your imagination to rewrite the necessary scenes. If you change anything in the story, then I believe that is enough reason to have to change everything after that point. It's the butterfly effect.

That all being said, I have read some fan fiction where they used the canon quotes and did a damn good job of it. I still think they could have been done with rewriting the scenes though.
