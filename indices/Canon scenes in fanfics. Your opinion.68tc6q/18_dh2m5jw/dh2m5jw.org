If canon scenes must be quoted put it in italics so those who glance at the scene can see where it begins/ends and skip to after.

If there's a change in the scene, like dialogue, give just barely enough context so the reader knows where it's coming from.

...

"One can never have enough socks --" "Bollocks." "Harry..." "You're really old, Headmaster. Everyone around you has died and you're telling me you don't wish to see any of them again?" "Harry, I am old enough that, in all's honesty I probably will soon."

...

In the above example (sorry for the terrible writing trying to write this on a bus) you know immediately what scene I'm referring to just from one distinctive line. No rehashing of the whole scene required.
