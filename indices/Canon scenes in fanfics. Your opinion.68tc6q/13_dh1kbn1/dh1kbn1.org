We already know canon, so just skip everything that remains the same. Basically a jump-cut, right to the conversation with Quirrel if that's where things will be different. I don't need to read about how to pass the chess board for the millionth time. Fanfic authors treat their audience like children who can't fill in the blanks.

Definitely no quotes though. If you absolutely have to re-tread canon for some reason at least put it into your own words. The only exception is the prophecy.
