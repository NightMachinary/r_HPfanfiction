I would say "Seventh Horcrux" handles this really well:

/Meeting Draco on the Train:/

I smirked. "So, you wish to join me. Your foresight is commendable, and I assure you that -- should you choose to be my minion -- I shall allow you a sliver of my eventual glory."

Malfoy sputtered in indignation. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys are not minions.”

/First Lesson with Severus:/

"Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Severus Snape demanded.

I said, "The Draught of Living Death."

Severus sneered. "The Draught of Living Death, sir. Ten points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor."

Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

"Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" he snapped.

"The stomach of a goat, sir," I told him smugly.

Severus' eye twitched with frustration. "Twenty points for smirking. What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

"There is no difference. Would you like to hear its third name?"

"Fifty points for your cheek!" Severus roared.

That year, I was determined to singlehandedly win the House Cup.

For Slytherin.

/After the Troll incident:/

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

/The Stone:/

I nearly fell over in shock when I spotted Quirrel. The professor was crouched in front of an ornate mirror, tapping the glass experimentally. I suddenly realized that his stuttering, his idiocy, and his horrible teaching were all an act.

Since I was covered by an invisibility cloak, Quirrel had yet to detect my presence.

"Avada Kedavra," I whispered. Too focused on the mirror to see my spell, he crumpled to the ground. Immediately, a dark mist rose from his body and wooshed through the flames.

"That was weird." A quick incendio charred Quirrel's corpse and I kicked it to the side.

"Now, how do I get the stone?" In the mirror, my reflection (an older, distinguished-looking professor) shrugged and smiled mischievously. Neither physical nor magical attacks had any effect on the mirror and I was about ready to slam my head into the thing when Dumbledore burst through the flames.

"Headmaster!" I exclaimed in surprise. "This isn't what it looks like. Y'see, I realized that someone was going to steal the stone and Quirrel attacked me and then he burst into flames."

I waved my hands around for emphasis. This is why I usually prepare my cover[...]

/Confronting the Diary:/

"Diary?" I shouted. "What in Merlin's name are you doing here?"

She (he?) hissed, "How dare you address me so disrespectfully? I am Lord Voldemort!"

"You're going to regret that name in a few years," I said, "and I'm the real Lord Voldemort. You're just my horcrux."

Diary sneered. "You're Lord Voldemort? No, I think I'm Voldemort.”

[...]

“You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man."

The Weasley girl smirked. "Of course, you could always join me. I might let you rule at my feet -"

"Avada Kedavra," I said, pointing my wand at the diary. The Weasley collapsed as the book glowed green and the soul inside screamed. The Horcrux was destroyed. Or released, or something like that.

It was a necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around.
