This was something I had to think carefully about when writing NFO. Certain scenes were going to overlap and while I didn't want to bore the audience by repeating it all, it felt like it would break immersion just summarising it in one sentence. So I tried to make sure that whenever I was repeating canon, I was careful to make sure it was adding something new - something harry might not have seen or noticed from his position in canon, for example, or ways of showing a different emotional reaction than he had. Where I could, I skimmed over it or cut to a new scene but tried to make it feel as natural as possible.
