My opinion is they're being a lazy writer. Doing it enough makes me think, "The author doesn't care enough about their fic so why should I?" and stop reading. You can rewrite scenes so the outcomes are what you need them to be even if they accomplish the same thing.

I check chapter titles and midway points of stories and if they're still riding canon rails I don't bother.
