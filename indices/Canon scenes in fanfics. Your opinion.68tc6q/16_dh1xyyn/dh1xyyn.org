I usually start a story off with a scene from canon so the reader knows exactly where the story is kicking off from, and where the divergence is. I'm not saying that that is a good way to do it, but it's what works for my writing style.

I do think it's important to not use text verbatim in the middle of a story. A reader doesn't want to just be reading canon. It's bad enough when a story is just a rehash with Daphne substituted for Character X, but when it's worse than that, it's quite pointless.
