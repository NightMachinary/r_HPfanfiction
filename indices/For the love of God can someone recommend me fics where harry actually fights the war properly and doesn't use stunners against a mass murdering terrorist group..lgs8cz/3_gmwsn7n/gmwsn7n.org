I completely understand what you mean.

Edit: I really can't stand that there was an actual war behind the scenes but we didn't get to see any of it.

There were refugees/ppl on the run, resistance groups, the ministry was rounding people up and accusing them of magic theft (what actually happened to these ppl?), propaganda, etc.
