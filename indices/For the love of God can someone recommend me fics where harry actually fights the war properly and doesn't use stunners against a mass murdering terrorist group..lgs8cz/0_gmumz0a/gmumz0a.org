If you're interested in reading about what was going on at Hogwarts during the time that Harry, Ron and Hermione were hunting Horcruxes, I definitely recommend A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor McGonagall. It's an amazing story and I love it. However, I have yet to find a good story with Harry. I prefer reading stories about the Marauders and Harry's years in Hogwarts, especially if they include Remus and Sirius raising Harry.

Though, there is one story called Second Chances by Breanie where it has Harry being raised by Sirius. However, the story gets darker as the war is looming. It's a huge story though and might not be what you are looking for. There's a lot of sexual content in that one.

I've been wanting to find a lot of AUs about the Second Wizarding War as well, but I think I am in the stage of fandom hopping. I've been in the Harry Potter fandom for far too long, lol.
