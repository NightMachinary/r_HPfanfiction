"Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother" and "Who Dares WIns" should satisfy your bloodlust somewhat. For a take on the war I feel is more believable and invokes a lot of imagery of an actual modern military and WW2, The Cupboard Series by Stargon1 is pretty good. Keep in mind for the Cupboard Series the war doesn't begin in earnest for awhile. but the preceding works build up pretty well for it.
