I dunno, that's not /that/ weird imo. The way I look at it, Harry has never even really met his mother. He has no memories of her beyond a glimpse of her sacrificing herself for him. I can definitely understand a logical "ewww" reaction but he doesn't have that biological imprint (I believe that it's called the Westermarck Effect) that tells his body that it's a poor choice - for the health of the species, that is - to find that lady attractive.

Edit:

I derped pretty hard here. I read this as Harry going back at a similar age to his mother, not 30 year old Harry seducing his 12 year old mother or whatever. That's totally creepy.
