I'd posit that the boggart can only replicate /psychological/ effects of magical creatures, and can't or doesn't cause actual physical harm even if taking the physical form of something dangerous. Like Snape.

Otherwise, Lupin's lesson was /horribly/ dangerous, even for Hogwarts. And I find that hard to believe.
