Surely it's something to do with the magic of a basilisk? Magic that wouldn't actually be present in any kind of recording since that's not what memories are.

edit: I mean okay so memories in HP also aren't what memories are. but magic I guess. I don't know, I guess that not many people will have ever seen a Basilisk's eyes, even in a pensieve.
