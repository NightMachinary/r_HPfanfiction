I agree that such a place is awesome, I merely posted it here because I read a fic a few months ago that had boggarts being the worst creatures to ever exist because they can take on the abilities of the forms they take. And that they are introduced at such a young age so that they know how to defend themselves, while having childish level fears in general.
