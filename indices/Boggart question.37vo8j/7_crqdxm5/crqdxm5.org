One could guess that a boggart takes on a limited form of the abilities of a creature it mimics. A boggart impersonating a basilisk might petrify you with a stare, or may be it would just cause your joints to stiffen.

One could alternatively guess that a boggart has a fear auro that is much weaker than the dread and despair aura produced by a dementor.
