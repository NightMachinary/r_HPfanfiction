How old are these characters, and how good are they at magic?

Outside of ambushes or chaotic running battles where anyone could be attacked from any angle, we see three kinds of duelling:

1. *The adolescent style.* Spell arsenals are limited and have to be cast verbally, which severely limits the rate at which they can be cast. (They may also require wand movements to be preferred more precisely.) Most spells don't end a fight even if they connect. Putting up a shield takes up time and all of one's concentration. The resulting style is jumpy and involves a lot of dodging. All students in Harry's year, including Harry, never pass this level in the books (epilogue excepted).
2. *The highly skilled adult style.* The arsenal of both offensive and defensive magic grows, and there are many more spells that end the fight if they connect. Although nonverbal casting is introduced in Year 6, mastering it to the point where it can be used effectively in combat takes much longer. When it is mastered, it is a game changer, however, because the rate at which one can cast increases greatly. (There may also be a concomitant reduction in wand movements and generally in whatever mental effort is needed to cast the spell.) Shielding and counterspelling become far quicker as well. Because of this, dodging, and movement in general, fall out of use: it is more effective to stand one's ground in a rapid exchange of nonverbal spells. Unfortunately, the way the books went, we have only one good example of two skilled adult wizards or witches having a pitched duel, and that's Molly vs. Bellatrix.
3. *The Uberwizard style.* Basically, what Dumbledore vs. Voldemort at the Ministry: rapid teleportation, large-scale combat transfiguration, animating creatures to attack and defend on one's behalf.
