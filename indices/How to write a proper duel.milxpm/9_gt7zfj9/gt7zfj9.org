A duel should involve motion. Do not just have the combatants stand still and sling spells at each other. Have them jump out of the way of attacks. Have them use the environment around them to their advantage. I would suggest rereading Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix. This is the best duel in the entire series in my opinion.
