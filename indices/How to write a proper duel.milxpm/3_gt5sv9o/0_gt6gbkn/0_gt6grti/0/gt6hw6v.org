Shields appear to be good at stopping or at least attenuating a very wide variety of curses, and Shield Charms is IIRC one of the first things nonverbal casting is taught for in Y6 DADA. Unfortunately, we only have one good data point for how a pitched battle between two highly skilled but not Dumbledore-level adults looks like, and it's between Molly and Bellatrix, who seem to stand their ground; and we never see what such a duel looks and feels like from the point of view of the duellist.
