Movement is extremely important, one of my peeves is stories where it seems like they just stand opposite each other screaming spells.

Rule #1 of dueling- Dodge. If you aren't 100% sure of the spell you'd be blocking /dodge/ or summon something to be a physical shield.

A sign of progression can be the switch from summoning to conjuring shields or animating.

If this duel is between two kids then I'd do just have them shout spells at one anothet, and show their progression in later chapters.

If it's supervised by teachers, have teachers give feedback on their performance. I always love having Snape do this- makes it interesting.
