I'd say don't write much about formal duels where Wizard 1 curses Wizard 2 who blocks and back again. If you do try to use any spell that could make it more interesting, flashbangs, disillusionment etc.

The best duels are ambushes that end really fast and tell us something about the emotions flying high. Harry VS Bellatrix par example where he only hits her with a single crucio, or Draco v Harry which is some flashes then Crucio into Sectumsempra, are better than half of fanfic duels like say in Lady Archimedes.

If you absolutely want to have a fight that shows skill and mastery you most likely need a third dimension, like Dumbledore using the Fountain of MB or getting Fawkes to aid him. Or DA vs Death Eaters with the prophecy in play.

I'd say a good idea would be an Eragon like duel, where the duelists fight with their minds and spells both. We know Snape uses legilimency to duel better, if your story improves legilimency and occlumency that's a great way to put them to use.
