Yeah, someone on this one told me I should â€˜recommend away' so I wanted to make another post and delete this one, but I'm on mobile so I couldn't. Then I saw the option to hide the post, but it looks like it doesn't do that. But now that you pointed it out I got on my computer and little did you know I can do it on it (I delete the second one).
