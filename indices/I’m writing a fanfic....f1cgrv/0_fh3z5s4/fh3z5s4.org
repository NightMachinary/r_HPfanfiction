Most readers of longer fanfics have a 'mininum length' that a story has to have reached before they can be bothered to follow it. Also depends on how often you update it. Did it take you 2 years of slow updates to get there? Then no thanks when its not even a quarter done.

I personally used to have a minimum of 60k vefore i started reading longer fics, with min. 2k words per chapter. Now i check 40k words fics because i feel like i have read everything else, so checking "newly updated" 40k every few days helps find new fics.

For short stories, recommend them here when you are a few chapters in. For novellength (as this one sounds as) above 20-40k feels like a good point. Above 40k means you take it seriously (who writes 40k+ if they dont feel like writing the story?)

So recommend away!
