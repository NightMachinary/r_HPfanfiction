To answer you question, I've updated my first five chapters (if not six) within a week and since chapter eight I update once a week on Fridays. My smallest chapter is over 1k words (the very first one, which was immediately followed by the second one). The second one is nearly 4k, followed by two 2k chapters and from that it grows exponentially until chapter 8 which is 11k. I'd say from then on my chapters are and will be over 6k.
