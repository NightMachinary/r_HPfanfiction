Interesting, I'll have to give it a look. Though, is the MC supposed to be French? Anthonie is not really a French name, if so. If you're looking for the equivalent of 'Anthony', it's normally 'Antoine' in French (eg, Mark-Anthony = Marc-Antoine). Google seems to say that 'Anthonie' would be Dutch or Swedish.

Just a small nitpick!
