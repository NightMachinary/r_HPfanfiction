It's kind of offtop but when I have read HP series first time in my life I was a child. And for some reason I believed that "as the seventh month dies" does not mean born in July, but instead it means an infant born prematurely. So I thought that Harry and Neville were both premature infants up until ~couple of years ago, when I was reading my hundredth fanfiction and I realized it actually meant July, not an incomplete pregnancy XD
