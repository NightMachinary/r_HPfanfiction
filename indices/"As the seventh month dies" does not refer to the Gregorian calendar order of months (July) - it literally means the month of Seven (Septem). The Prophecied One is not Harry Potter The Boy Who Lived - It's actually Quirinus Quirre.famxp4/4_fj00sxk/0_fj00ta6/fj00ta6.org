  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).
