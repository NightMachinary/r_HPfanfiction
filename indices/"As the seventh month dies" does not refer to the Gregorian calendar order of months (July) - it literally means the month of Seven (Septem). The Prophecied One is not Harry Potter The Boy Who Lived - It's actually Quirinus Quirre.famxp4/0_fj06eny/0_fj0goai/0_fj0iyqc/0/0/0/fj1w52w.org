Yeah, I don't want to say that that's the only problem with it, by any means! Just that I wouldn't necessarily look at it or judge it by the criteria of a book.

Eg, the passage with the trolley lady that gets brought up a lot, seems to me to be exaggerated for stage purposes. Kinda like how everyone's movements are exaggerated in plays, or stage makeup is much heavier in order to be seen far away, etc.
