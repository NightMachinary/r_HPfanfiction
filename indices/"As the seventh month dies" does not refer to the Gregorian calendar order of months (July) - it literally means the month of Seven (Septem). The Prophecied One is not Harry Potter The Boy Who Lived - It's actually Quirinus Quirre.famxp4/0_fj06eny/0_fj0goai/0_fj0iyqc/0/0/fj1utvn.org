I don't think the problem was in the general craft of writing dialogues etc., the authors were experienced professional drama writers. The problem was with the general plot and synopsis. The authors apparently never read the books (and just briefly watched films), so all those “book Ron × film Ron”, right, those are all wrong, squared. And not only that, the problems are not just nitpickings of Potterheads (of course, that too ... authors had no clue about how HP magic actually works etc.). Not only the characters of the play don't have much common with the original HP universe characters with same names. And when I say that all characters are all OOC, that doesn't describe the situation enough. You know Harry Potter, man who was constantly rejected by his parental figures? Yeah, that guy. He says to his son, that he didn't want him to be born. Do you remember, how whenever anything happens to any Weasley, all of them fall on Hogwarts like a red tornado? Yeah, those Weasleys. Do you remember Ron Weasley, who is considered by many as semi-Hufflepuff (when Hermione is semi-Ravenclaw and Harry semi-Slytherin)? Yeah, that Ron. So, when Rose Weasley gets lost, Ron Weasley, her father, forgets to come to her, because he finds something good to eat.

Not only all characters are OOC, the plot is a convoluted mess of multiple universes, littered with endless plotholes. After JKR in one of her blogposts (or on Pottermore?) clearly described that she is aware of many problems with complicated time travelling story, the authors fallen in all traps of that trope. Squared, again. Tons of time is spent with unsuccessful attempts to explain the mechanics of time travel, and the result is that any plot (if it made any sense, which it didn't) got lost in it.

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, the people who watched this play.”

Two huge threads of comments (with tons of spoilers, the protection doesn't seem to work now):

And my personal pet-peeve (for which the authors are not be blamed) is that Petunia is supposed die soon. My main stories are based on the premise that she survives and she tries to deal with her guilt. But that's just my personal problem.
