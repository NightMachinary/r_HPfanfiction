Wait! The actress for the trolley lady (Margery Mason) was also born in late September. As we know from the Cursed Child, the trolley lady is pretty much immortal, all powerful and she has a power the dark lord knows not (pastry bombs). Who her parents are, we'll never know, but I think time traveling was probably involved (trolley lady is older than Bathilda Bagshot). Maybe she's even the child of Hogwarts??
