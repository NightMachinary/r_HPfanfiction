There's only one I can recommend and that is /Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/ where in Harry's reality there is war and death and destruction and almost all the Weasleys are dead, and in Lily's reality Harry and Ron and Neville and a bunch of other people are dead instead. Harry then stops Voldemort in the other reality (Lily's) that he traveled to. Its pretty depressing and has around 10 chapters, but I hope its something along the lines that you're looking for.
