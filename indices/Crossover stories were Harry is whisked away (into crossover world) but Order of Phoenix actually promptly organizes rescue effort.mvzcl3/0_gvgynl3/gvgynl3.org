There's a lot of potential in this sort-of genre, especially if time displacement is involved: if one dimension has time moving faster or slower than Earth?

Harry vanishes when he's at a certain age and returns at a different age... or the same age.

If he were young, he may still be that -- people expect him to be like eleven when he's still five. If he were a teenager in Hogwarts? They expect him to return as his fourteen or thirteen year old self; instead, he's either an adult or an old man, having lived his life in the other world after giving up ever getting home.

If he were a kid at five but returns as a teenager or as an adult, when he was still supposed to be five? Spicy.

The latter two could be pretty good for drama, especially if he settled down and had a family with one of the natives there.

Last time Dumbledore and his friends saw him, he was a fourteen year old kid; now he's a dude in his thirties or forties, married, and has kids. Worse still, after living most of his life in the Other Place, and having built a life there, he only spent the first decade, maybe decade-and-a-half of his life on Earth. He probably wouldn't see it as his home anymore.

And friends? He could be friends with someone or others for twenty odd years -- far longer than the two/three he had with Hermione, Ron, et cetera.

Complicated. :D
