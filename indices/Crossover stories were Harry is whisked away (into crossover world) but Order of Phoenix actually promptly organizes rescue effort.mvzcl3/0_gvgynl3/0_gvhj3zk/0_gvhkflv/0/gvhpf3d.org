Well in my story, the opposite planned to happen. Harry is 8, when he is transported. D&D world is humongous collection of planes and realms, so it will take many years for Order of Phoenix to find Harry even with convenient plot twists, but I want Harry to get to Hogwarts in time. So Harry's otherworldly guardian, decides that boy didn't have normal childhood, with boy's agreement rejuvenates him into infancy of one biological year. Order of Phoenix searches him far and wide for almost ten years and finds him shortly before he turns eleven, while the time that passed in HP world is also chronological corresponds to Harry reaching age of 11, taking things back into their original pace once Harry is in Hogwarts. Though consequences of whole ordeal make Harry, Order of Phoenix and Wizarding World wildly divergent from original timeline, that putting aside further worlds interaction.

I think your should make a thread for your idea, effects of sudden time shifts on people is interesting topic on its own.
