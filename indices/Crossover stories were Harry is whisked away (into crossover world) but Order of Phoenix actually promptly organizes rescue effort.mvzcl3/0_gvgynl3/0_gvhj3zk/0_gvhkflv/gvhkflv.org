Oh yeah, I know. My mind just wandered a bit, heh. I actually don't think I've seen that many stories where people from his universe try to rescue him. There were a few where he was followed by people, though -- IIRC one had a batshit insane Luna follow him, and another had his "crack team" (Neville and the others) following him, but one where Dumbledore tried to rescue him and return him home? I'm intrigued to what you're planning. :D

IIRC I also had a plot bunny months ago (a year?) where Harry and Fleur vanished in the Second Task, but when they were brought back, they were practically an old, happy yet bickering married couple with a kid or two.

Maybe I should flesh out a prompt for people, in a new thread?
