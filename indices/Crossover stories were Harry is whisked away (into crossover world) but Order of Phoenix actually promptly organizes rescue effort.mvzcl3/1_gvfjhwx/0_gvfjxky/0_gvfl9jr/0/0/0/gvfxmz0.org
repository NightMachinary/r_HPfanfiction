Thanks! Though I don't think I deserve to receive it completely in blind, so here is synopsis of what happens in published chapters so far:

- October 31, 1981. Dudley frames Harry for stealing his Halloween candies. Which makes Dursleys lash out onto Harry especially viciously. In act of desperation, Harry rushes into his cupboard. But instead door leads to mysterious room with strange skeletal figure. It closes behind Harry's back.
- This happens due to coincidence of several factors: Halloween, seventh anniversary of Lily's sacrifice, Harry strongly emotional wish to be somewhere else accompanied by outburst of underage magic, and [Wish] spell cast by certain lich in city of Sigil, who wished for apprentice in form of lonely magical orphan who is unhappy with their current life and is not tied to the fate of D&D universe.
- Lich shows Harry his lost early childhood memories, and than using, still stable gateway, together with Harry visits HP's Limbo were he allows Harry to see his parents and strike the deal with them, as Lily didn't sense malice in lich's [Wish].
- Lich indeed doesn't have malicious intent towards Harry himself. He became lich purely out of insatiable thirst for knowledge. He wants kid as Harry as apprentice purely because he wants to add force major factor to his endeavors, thwarting whatever gods and fate have for him in store.
- Dumbledore detects that his defensive spells on Dursley's household were destroyed by sudden surge of unfathomable magic.
- He immediately arrives on location, finds source of disturbance and interrogates Dursleys. Realizing that he severely underestimated extant to which Dursleys despised and mistreated their nephew, Dumbledore is devastated as he failed to protect yet another Potter. He reminisces McGonagall arguing against housing Harry with Dursleys and decides to radically change his approach to planning his actions and to extend his circle of confidence, as his overreliance on using others in blind failed him yet again.
- Dumbledore investigates locked and decaying magic on cupboard door. He identifies it as powerful gateway of anomalous properties, magic that doesn't follow established laws and deduces that is gateway to other world. Stopping decay of gateway magic, he leaves and drinks himself to sleep in his office.
- Lich shows Harry around small part of Sigil and they use portal to get lich's homeworld and there they get into his base, where Harry is introduced to Lich's top henchmen-comrades: dullahan blackguard, vampire assassin and psion star spawn. All four of them were once human adventuring party...
- Dumbledore wakes up on afternoon of 1st of November. He immediately arranges meeting that includes himself, Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall, whom he decides to make his confidents from there on. He honestly and in details presents them with full Prophecy, Lily's sacrifice, his reasons to leave Harry with Dursley and what happened last night. He only omits Snape's role in delivering prophecy to Voldemort.
- Their plans include preparation of expedition and reopening of the Gates, forcing Dursleys to sell house to Snape, faking Harry's relocation to India, preventative strike against Voldemort's supporters in Ministry in order to prevent Voldemort from chance of restoring his power while core fighters of Order of Phoenix are away, more active investigation of Voldemort's past in order to find out secret to his apparent immortality. In order to maximize his new "thinking out of the box" approach, Dumbledore is even planning to recruit Muggle scientist to help the effort.
- Certain remorseful prisoner of Numengrad sees a vision, that signifies that his life is yet to bring him more surprises.
- Lich plans to give Harry for adoption to a childless couple of former adventurers, who owe him favor. But first he is planning to pull out a spiritual parasite he discovered in Harry. In order for procedure to be safe, Harry needs to defeat it in his subconsciousness. So he puts boy into sleep and with help of his psionic ally, creates virtual adventure in Harry's dream. (This dream is yet to be written, it is planned to be kind of tutorial that serves as exposition of differences between D&D and HP magic)
