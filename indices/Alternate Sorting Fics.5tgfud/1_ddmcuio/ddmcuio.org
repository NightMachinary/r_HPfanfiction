Here is a one shot that is complete crack: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7050721/1/The-Sorting-That-Never-Happened]]

There is also a great series on Livejournal that I lost the link, but maybe someone has? Fred and George Confund the hat something fierce and it goes nuts. Ron and Pansy in Ravenclaw, Neville and Hermione in Slytherin, Crabbe and Goyle in Gryffindor, and Harry and Draco in Hufflepuff. I remember it being a lot of fun and sticking to the main story points pretty well!
