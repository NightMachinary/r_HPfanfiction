I never found Jo's Post story explanation as to why they hate magic as fulfilling.

My head canon is that Death Eaters lead by Snape attacked the Evans home as a way to get back at Lily for choosing Potter. Vernon was over that night and watched as his Mother and Father in Law were Killed and he and his Fiance were tortured. The Order shows up before they can do Petunia and Vernon in permanently in particularly James, Lily and the Marauders and a few others. During the battle Vernon overhears Snape and James arguing. The DEs are driven off and Vernon is sitting there in the burnt out husk of his near wife's childhood home holding his wife after several near death experiences and the entire reason for it happening is standing in front of you.

My head canon of Vernon is someone who hates Harry on Multiple levels, one for being a wizard like the ones who nearly killed him, another for being in particular James and Lily's Son for being the one to drag him into everything and final for being forced to look into the face of the man who he owned his life too, while not enforced by a Life Debt like Wormtail, Vernon is a very proud man and knowing that he owes everyday to some man makes him steam especially since he now has to look at the man's son every day. As for the Normal thing, It didn't matter what he did, he was a normal man not a freak and no matter what he did he would ALWAYS be Normal and Nothing could change that
