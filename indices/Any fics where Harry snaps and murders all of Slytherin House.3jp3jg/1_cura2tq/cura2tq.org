Unspeakable Things, linkffn(6473434)

Department of Mysteries played a big role here. It trained Harry and Ginny into a killer couple. Luna had an interesting characterization. Later they wiped out most of the upper Slytherin years in self defense. This story has the highest body count of any HP fanfic I have read.
