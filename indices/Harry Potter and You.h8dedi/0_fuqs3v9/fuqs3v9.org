I started reading Harry Potter when I was 8 yeas old, and I started with Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was a gift from my favourite aunt. I think I read that book 10 times while waiting for the fourth one and then I went back and checked out the first two from my local library. Because it was the first one I read, Prisoner of Azkaban was my favourite for a very long time, and it's the one that brings back all those warm and fuzzy nostalgic feelings when I reread it. I always loved reading, but Harry Potter is what made me obsessed with books in general, and with fantasy literature in particular.

I started reading fanfic when I was around 12 or 13 years old, because I happened upon a dramione fic that intrigued me. For a couple of months I read all the dramione fics I could get my hands on, at least all of the Italian ones, as that's my native language. Afterwards I had a brief period in which I fell down the Snarry rabbit hole, followed by an intense obsession for the "Hogwarts/the marauders/ the professors etc. read the books" kind of fics. What's funny is that there were only a handful of the latter written in Italian, so I started reading them in English, even if at the time my English was horrible. But seeing as a major part of those fics were taken directly from the books, and I had practically memorized the books in Italian, I ended up practically teaching myself English while having lots of fun. I can credit my level of English entirely to the fact that I had read all the Italian fanfic I was interested in and went looking for more on the English side of FF.net

Generally speaking, my pairing preferences are very very broad, I read Het, Slash and Femslash, with a leaning towards slash couples. My favourite character is Harry, so I most often end up reading about Harry-centric relationships, but if it's well written I also read other pairings that have nothing to do with Harry.

I like stories that delve into the workings of magic, fics that expand upon/rewrite the magic system, fics that flesh out the culture/politics/society of the Wizarding World etc. I prefer stories where Harry is smarter and more powerful that in canon and I absolutely adore stories where Harry is a badass while not being overpowered. I love time travel fics/Harry is summoned to another universe fics/Harry is the Master of Death fics etc.

Just like you I found all the plot holes in the books and got interested in finding fics that would explain them, but I overcompensated and ended up reading a lot of heavy bashing stories of practically every character but Harry. I think that, as a rebellious teen, reading fics where a teenager like me blows up at every adult around them, is always right and is able to get back at the people that wronged them was very cathartic for me.

Nowadays I tend to stay away from heavy bashing fics, for example those where Dumbledore is an evil, mustache twirling cartoonish villain that murders puppies for kicks, or those where Ron is a greedy, backstabbing arsehole that hates Harry and is being paid by Dumbledore to spy on him etc. I tend to gravitate towards manipulative but not consciously evil Dumbledore (greater good Dumbledore), fics that portray Ron and Hermione as flawed characters (where their flaws are brought up and addressed but not bashed)etc.

I find fics by going to the author's profile of stories I loved and seeing what else they have written, scrolling through the bookmarks/favourite fanfic of authors I like and browsing the ao3 tag system.
