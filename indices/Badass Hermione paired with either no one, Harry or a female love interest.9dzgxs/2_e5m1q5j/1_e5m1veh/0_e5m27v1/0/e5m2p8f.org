  Actually, I don't even know why Malfoy or Snape are listed. They have tiny roles.

  I'm a little disappointed at how the author treats Draco, but given your stance on his character, I think you'll find it enjoyable.

That sounds much better than the description and tags would suggest, thanks for the info. Does Harry play any role in that story?
