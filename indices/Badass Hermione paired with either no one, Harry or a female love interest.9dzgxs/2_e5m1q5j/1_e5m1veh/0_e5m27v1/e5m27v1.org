As of right now, nothing. There were some very minor inclinations towards Nott, but nothing overt. Actually, I don't even know why Malfoy or Snape are listed. They have tiny roles.

I'm a little disappointed at how the author treats Draco, but given your stance on his character, I think you'll find it enjoyable.
