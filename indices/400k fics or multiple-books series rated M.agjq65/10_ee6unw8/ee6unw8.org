/Word Count: 230k/ (sorry only 50% of the length you wanted)

This is an *Self Insert*, with OP powers as Draco Malfoy's twin brother. The setting is a more [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier][grimdark]] than whimsical.

The MC has Aura from [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY][RWBY]] and Water Bending from [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender][The Avatar]]...

While things stay grimdark, it doesn't just get worse all the time for the MC.

The fic is also written from 3rd party viewpoints.

honestly I feel it's one of the better fanfics out there... but then again I like OP-Main Characters and trash like that.
