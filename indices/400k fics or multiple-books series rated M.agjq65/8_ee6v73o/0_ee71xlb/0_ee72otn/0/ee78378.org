I've started reading it two days ago, two-thirds through the first book and it is amazing. I'd hate to get invested in yet another amazing story which will never be finished, happens a bit too often...

That being said, I thought the last update was nearly a year ago, so the latest update only being 2.5 months ago does give me some good hope. Enough to continue reading it until I'm up to date, anyway, so thank you for that.
