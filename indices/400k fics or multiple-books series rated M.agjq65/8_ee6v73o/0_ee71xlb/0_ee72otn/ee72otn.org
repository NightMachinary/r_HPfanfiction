I don't think it is abandoned, at least afaik, the latest update was November last year, like 2.5 months ago. Admittedly, that's a fair amount of time, but the author has taken longer to update in the past, So I have faith it isn't abandoned, just slow to update. Given that each chapter is huge. (just 7 to reach 200k in the latest book) I can see why each update is slow to come out.

Will they write another 600k words and finish it? No clue. I hope they do. It is /that good/ that I would recommend reading regardless.
