Have you tried the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][Pureblood pretence]] series by Murkybluematter yet?

Neither slash nor a dumbledoor bash fic, The series is a fusion of sorts between the Harry Potter universe and Tamora Pierces' Song of the Lioness series.

Primarily following the life of a female harry, as she embarks upon her journey at Hogwarts, albeit in an AU were Voldemort decides to play the long game in taking over the wizarding world.

As such her parents are still alive, and she her self lives in a world were blood discrimination is alive and well, and as such only Pure-blood children are allowed to attend Hogwarts.

Harry, being half blood due to her mother, is barred from attending Hogwarts, and thus her dream of apprenticing under the world renown potion master, Professor Snape.

She, along with her Pure-Blooded Cousin, Rigel Black (borne to Sirius Black) concoct a plan to allow her to attend in Rigel's Place. Naturally, things only get more complicated from here.

Edit: Just thought I should mention that despite the T rating, It is not really a story for children, and will probably earn an M rating as the series progress.
