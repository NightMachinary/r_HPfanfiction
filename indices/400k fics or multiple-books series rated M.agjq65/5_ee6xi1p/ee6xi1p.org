One of my all-time favourites, it does a great job of mashing the whimsy of Harry Potter with some of the more mature themes found in Warhammer. Don't let the T rating fool you, it vascillates between comedy and life-or-death situations like a drunken spider.

It's also hilarious, so definitely recommended on that front.

Currently on book... Five, I believe.
