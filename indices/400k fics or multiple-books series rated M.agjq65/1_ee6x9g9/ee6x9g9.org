I feel like I recommend it literally all the time, but Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie. Also Last Year by Canimal and His Little Bird series but the Wanders'WanderingDaughter. The latter is not for the faint of heart or anyone who triggers easily. It's easily the hardest to read fic I've ever encountered. If you're looking for something heart wrenching but not with smut, check out Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness by Thanfiction. It's about as sad as a fic can get. Links below.

Unfortunately I can't seem to find a copy of DAATYOD anywhere except a random google drive account, which I'm not about to trust. There's a lot of conspiracy surrounding that fic and the author, so he deleted a lot of his works.
