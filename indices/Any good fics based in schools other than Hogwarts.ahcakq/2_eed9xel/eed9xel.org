harry and hermione finish their last year at mahoutokoro after the war.

personally I am not a huge fan of the harem styled summer before schooltime, but the worldbuilding in japan is amazing.

mahoutokoro itself, the banzai bazar, the train, everything gave me that feeling of wonder that I first had when learning about the british magical world.
