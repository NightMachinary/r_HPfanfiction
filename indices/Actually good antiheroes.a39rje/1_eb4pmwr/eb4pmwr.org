I actually like main character of Echoes by BlackDeviouseRose ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11763334/1/]]). It's semi-insert-ish original character who, upon realising where she is, didn't want to have anything to do with it, at all. She wanted home and her loving family of previous life, but it was unreachable to her and started slow descent into madness. Enter Cedric Diggory, who doesn't really understand the apathetic young student and decides to befriend her, worming his way into her life. I don't want to be throwing spoilers, but she is antihero in her own right, not wanting to help, not planning on doing anything, later only driven by her own goals that have nothing to do with rightness or greater good. You can also see that the construction of character is pretty solid there.
