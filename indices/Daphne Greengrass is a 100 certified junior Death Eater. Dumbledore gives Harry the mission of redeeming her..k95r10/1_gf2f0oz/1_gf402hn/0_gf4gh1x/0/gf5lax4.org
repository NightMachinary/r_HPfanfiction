Hm, it appears to have vanished. But basically it went something like this:

Daphne is either an actual DE outright, or chosen to be one in the imminent future. Because of prophecy shenanigans, Harry is under a love protection. To cause him actual harm, one person needs to get Harry to truly love them. Daphne is chosen for the mission: not just to seduce the Boy who Lived, but make him fall in love with her outright. This would allow her to interfere with the love protection and truly take him out. We see Daphne's mind on the matter, and she's firmly set on fulfilling the mission (no secret aspirations of switching sides, at least not yet).

There was a bunch of talks between her and Snape (who, at least as far as the fic got, appeared to be on the DE side) about various practical matters to get her to interact with Harry (such as Snape forcing them together in Potions). The fic didn't get past that.
