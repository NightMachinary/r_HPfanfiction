At the time of the one-hour ceasefire, the defenders had suffered fifty dead. Considering that there was also a large number of injured people, yet their defense had not collapsed yet, that suggests several hundred defenders.

The attackers are shown to have the numerical advantage. I think a low four-digit number (including the creatures fighting for Voldemort) is the most probable figure, I think. Fewer, and Voldemort would need to take a more active role in the battle than he did, but more than 2,000 are improbable either considering that the size of the magical community did not exceed a low to mid five digit number.

TL;DR: 250-500 defenders, 600-2000 attackers would be my guess.
