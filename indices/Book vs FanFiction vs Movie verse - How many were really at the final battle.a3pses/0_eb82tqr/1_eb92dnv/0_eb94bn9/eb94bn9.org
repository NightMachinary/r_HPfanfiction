Mostly because the Death Eaters had kicked them out of their home earlier. The clearing where Voldemort "kills" Harry is in fact the very same clearing Aragog inhabited back in /Chamber of Secrets/, and Voldemort unceremoniously ousted the Acromantulas while looking for a temporary lair. They didn't take it well.

Also, secondarily, their patriarch Aragog was blinded by Voldemort all the way back in 1943.

Also, thirdly, on two separate occasions, Voldemort released the Basilisk whom the Acromantulas considered their worst enemy.

All in all one understands why they were a bit ticked off.
