The thing about the Battle of Hogwarts is that basically everyone's in it.

Everyone in Hogwarts who was of age is involved, plus a bunch of not-quite-old-enough kids who sneaked back in. There's the House-Elves, of course. All the statues, suits of armor, ghosts, gargoyles and so on are also fighting for their castle (feel free to imagine Peeves killing off Death Eaters through the power of slapstick). I don't know what that amounts to, but certainly more than a hundred.

On Lord Voldemort's side are all his remaining marked Death Eaters (thirty, forty?), plus Greyback's werewolves, the Dementors, a couple of Giants. And also basically all the Knockturn Alley scum that gold and promises of power can buy --- Snatchers and so on --- to whom it is reckoned that he gave Death Eater robes (but not the Mark) to make his numbers appear greater. All in all he probably has about two hundred wizards and witches, and, I would say, about as many magical creatures.

Also involved are an indeterminate number of Acromantulas (I would say 300, allowing for the fact that most of those would be on the younger side and so cat-sized at worst) whose primary grudge is against the Death Eaters, but who, having only a very shaky idea that there are multiple sides among the humans, and a very big appetite, basically want to kill everyone.
