those are all of the ones that I could think of at this time or find links to on my phone and favorites. Some of them are old and will not be finished any time that I am aware of but damn if they aren't some finely written stories. Others are ongoing with some odd sporadic updates. Hope to see more people add stories that I am not yet aware.
