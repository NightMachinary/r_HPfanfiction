not so sure on the cunning aspect but Harry is for sure dark and cruel in "The-Denarian-Renegade" and its 2 sequeals (its a trilogy); its a cross over with the Dresden files but you can know nothing about Dresden and still enjoy it (I only read about a fifth of the first book before dropping the series and it all still makes sense). Harry ends up with a fallen angel co habaiting his head. Lots of violence, demonic powers, and hi-jinks ensue. Lots of killing some torture, plenty of comedic moments due to harry being part demon. It doesn't have harry at Hogwarts except for his third and 4th year and final fight.
