Cedric

"What? No, not fair!" I started crying when his spirit/wand-afterimage asked Harry to take his body back to his parents.

Sirius

Pure shock. I don't even think I cried, I was just so frozen about how suddenly it happened.

Dumbledore

A weird mix of really sad and "well he is the mentor, so duh!" (I was a young adult at this point and had seen enough "wise old mentors" die in stories to get a bit jaded.)

Hedwig

A bit sad and pretty annoyed because it did not have to be that way if they had just let her fly on her own. But so much other stuff was happening so fast there that I barely had time to be sad for her for long.

Fred

Sad and oddly relieved it was not Percy. (Because at least everybody could mourn Fred without mixed feelings, plus I am not a big fan of "redemption equals death". And, yeah, I like Percy better than the twins.)

Snape

Mostly shocked by HOW it happened. I had thought even Voldemort would not kill a minion he considered loyal. (Even if, yeah, his reasons made sense, at least. But why make the death hurtful and long for your loyal minion, eben if you think death it must be?) Sad, but only a little bit.

Remus and Tonks

Crying. From that point on I think I cried my way through the book. Crying because "but they just married." because "Remus should have SOMETHING good happen in his life, not die like this." because "damnit, poor Teddy, poor Andromeda!"... I also got a bit angry at them, because I found both of them going onto a battlefield with a baby at home really, really stupid. I thought only Remus should have gone, because Androneda already lost her husband and Teddy needed at least one of his parents.

Harry

"Well, this won't stick."

Bellatrix

"Well done, Molly!" - Followed by... "I kind of expected Neville to be the one to kill her, though."

Voldemort

Happy he was dead, not extremely happy by the way his death happened, but not exactly unsatisfied either. Just, he had to die, obviously, and this worked all right.
