Yes. I never liked the twins much.

I was disappointed in Percy when he acted like an idiot, but I somewhat could understand how it had come to that. I held faith he'd come to realise he was being stupid up to the point he indeed did.

The twins annoyed me from nearly the very beginning and I just most of the time do not like the whole "twins act as if they are basically one person in two bodies"-thing.
