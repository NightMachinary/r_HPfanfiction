Two reasons.

1) I read a lot as a kid but certainly reading Dumbledores death was impactful at the time. It was on the news like, it was a thing. And to have such an important character that I grew up with and shaped my childhood be killed off so ruthlessly. That hurt. It was the first time I remember a book hurting me. Which I think is important. Looking back it showed how much these books and characters meant to me.

2) In hindsight, reading these books as a mid twenties teacher, Dumbledore is a terrible teacher and a suuuper manipulative person and should not be in charge of kids so I'm kinda glad he got his comeuppance!
