I mean... Statistically unlikely?

Everyone on the good side doesn't trust him. They trust Dumbledore.

None of the Death eaters trust him. Bellatrix says that to his face in HBP. They just trust Voldemort.

So he's hated from every side, only being kept alive because of his puppet masters and walking a very thin line. As soon as he is of no use to Voldemort or Dumbledore, what is there keeping him alive?
