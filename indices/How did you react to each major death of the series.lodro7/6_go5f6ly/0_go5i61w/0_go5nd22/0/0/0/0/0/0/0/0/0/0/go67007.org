Oh absofuckingloutely.

What use was Snape as a spy during the second war? What did Dumbledore learn about Voldemort? The ministry was still attacked, there was no one defending it when Harry showed up. Harry was still getting visions. Bode died. Marchbanks died. Arthur was attacked. Malfoy still let death eaters into the school?? What did he do exactly to help the light side??

If he had died earlier, what difference would it have made to the Light Side? Honestly? Anything?

Dumbledore just would have told someone else about the ring curse and to kill him to pass the elder wand to them instead. Because I think Snape knew about Horcruxes? Even if he didn't know Harry was one and that's the reason he was useful.

Dumbledore wouldn't have actively killed him but he certainly wouldn't have tried particularly hard to save them. Same as he didn't particularly try with the Potters.
