In the same way one might care for a colleague...

But I don't think Snape cared for Dumbledore... I think he hated him. Certainly in my head he hated him.

I don't think Dumbledore had friends, or knew what it was to have them. So I think he cared for people because they were useful. Not because he loved them. Not in the same way you would love a friend.

But he wouldn't know that because he doesn't know what it's like to have friends for the sake of friendship.. know what I mean?

I think people idolised Dumbledore. Respected him, feared him, appreciated him, honoured him. A portion of those liked him, a larger portion were wary of him...

But Snape? Snape was indebted to Dumbledore. Under oath to serve him to protect Harry. Nothing Snape did was out of love for Dumbledore. So if Dumbledore cared for Snape it was in the same way one cares for something useful that you own. As much as Dumbledore believed that friendship to be real, it wasn't. He just thought that was what caring was supposed to be.
