Crabbe was a kid so yeah... Don't let kids die, no matter how bad they get it doesn't sit right. That being said, in his last scene he is flinging crucio's and avada kedavras left right and centre. He was very far gone so... I'm sad because he was young and caught up on the wrong side of the war. But also, not a nice guy so not that sad.

Snape was an asshole but he was an asshole who was just a puppet for more powerful people. So I don't like him but I do pity him.

I'm feel about the same level for both. Kinda, "oh no...oh well".
