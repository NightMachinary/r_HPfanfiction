Oh well... Errm... I choose death by treacherous fall and fire over slow and painful venom and bleeding I think...

Snape's life: -bad homelife, lonely childhood. -is hated because of his house, looks, personality etc. -leaves school and immediately becomes a solider for Voldemort. -Eventually leaves that and becomes... Loyal to Dumbledore? This is not out of choice though? It's obligation for Lily. And that promise was incredibly one sided. "What will you offer me in return Snape? Anything." He effectively becomes Dumbledores lacky, sworn to protect Harry in spite of anything. He doesn't like Harry, but he's under oath to let him not die. -Snape has no choice here. No way out. Then he is forced, under Dumbledores orders, to become a spy again for Voldemort essentially sealing his since there's no way he was going to survive that job.

He's never truly free at any point in his life. Never just out of oath or obligation to any person. He's always under the orders of someone higher. He deserved it, he made the oaths but still, that's sad really isn't it?
