He does nothing for anybody unless he gets something in return. Remus and Sirius are key examples.

Harry gets routinely tortures in the Graveyard and Dumbledore sends Sirius out of the room even though Harry "did not want Sirius to leave".

He then forcably isolates Harry over the summer, this includes only allowing his friends limited contact.

He continues to isolate Harry all year even though CLEARLY that's a terrible idea that anyone could have pointed out since it just makes the boy who keeps getting into dangerous situations because of his lack of trust in adults, not trust adults even more which leads to Sirius's death.

This is highlighted in the 2 chapter of HBP when Harry falls asleep at the window, not even packing because he doesn't trust that Dumbledore will even show up despite the letter.

Also, Snape? For Occlumency lessons?? Snape is supposed to be a double agent. So Harry coming to the completely natural assumption that he's opening up his mind to the dark lord would only increase Harry's mistrust of adults. And also SNAPES A DOUBLE AGENT and working for Voldemort at this point. Which means he has to report to Voldy at some point and will undoubtly have to tell Voldy about what he's doing at Hogwarts?? Why give the known double agent that job? It's just asking for trouble.

I mean... I get people have their own opinions of Dumbledore. Great, he's a fictional character, hold him to whatever standard you like it makes no difference in the real world. And everything Dumbledore does (doesn't do more like) drives the mystery and plot so I get it!

But morally... Nah... I do not trust that man at all. Everything he does he does for his own motivations over the needs of others and I will never like a person like that.
