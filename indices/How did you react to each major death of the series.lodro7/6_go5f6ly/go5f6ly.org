/Cedric/: Fine? How it affected Harry hurt more I think.

/Sirius/: I was confused? Because the door thing is never really explained so I assumed he was going to come back.

/Dumbledore/: shock at the time. But we all were when the books first came out. Now, after 20 years of hindsight I'm kinda glad.

/Hedwig/: I genuinely missed her death when I first read it because it happened so fast. I couldn't believe it at all.

/Dobby/: THIS ONE WAS MEAN

/Fred/: shock and absolute horror and I'm still not over it at all. Poor George.

/Snape/: Satisfaction at the time because he was such an villian throughout the books. In hindsight, just pity. I don't think he's a good person but jesus he had a shit ol life and death by snake is cruel.

/Remus/: Very sad at the time. Now, Remus is my absolute favourite character and I refuse to believe he is dead. Sad for Tonks but shes not a favourite character of mine so eh. Teddy though... And Andromeda, them I'm heartbroken for.

/Bellatrix/: Pure giddy glory

/Voldemort/: triumph. It was inevitable and the drama did build. The way it's done in the book is so mundane, it's lovely and poetic. In the film it doesn't have the emotional punch but it's very cinematic which you needed for the film.

/Saddest for/: Remus... I love him, im so so sad he died...
