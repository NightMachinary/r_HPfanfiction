- Cedric

Wow...he's gone...

Cedric was the first major death of a big book like this I had ever come across--I was eight years old.

- Sirius

I was floored. I read the book in three days and I was absolutely stunned. It wasn't easy keeping this secret from my mom and brother. I wound up telling my dad, who doesn't read series.

- Dumbledore

I was mad as hell. I wanted to make Snape /pay./

- Hedwig

I was shocked. It was unexpected. It was like stabbing me in the gut.

- Dobby

Mortified is the best word to use here. I didn't see it coming and I was deeply disturbed.

- Fred

This one hurt. This one hurt bad. I'm a twin.

- Snape

I wasn't surprised in the least. But the realization of what was coming when Voldemort began talking about the Elder Wand...yeah.

- Remus (and Tonks)

Back to back gut punches. The hell of war.

- Harry (kind of)

Saw this coming a mile away. That doesn't mean that I wasn't moved by Harry's quiet resolve to do it.

- Bellatrix

Justice!

- Voldemort

Finally!
