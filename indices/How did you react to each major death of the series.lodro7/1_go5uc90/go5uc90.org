Cedric - I was too young to register what happened and I was more upset about the fact that there was no House Cup that year. I might have started to figure out what a traumatic experience was for others only in Book 5 when Harry is haunted by nightmares of Cedric's murder. And the scene in the movie is quite sad.

Sirius - that was the hardest one for me especially that Harry is so full of despair at first and eventually he becomes so sad. I was kind of hoping that Sirius would show up in the mirror and I always believed that Book 6 will contain an angsty Harry.

Dumbledore - it was just really sad but also a bit scary because there were still so many questions left unanswered and Harry no longer had a mentor. I sort of suspected that he planned his death with Snape, however I was hoping he'd pull a Gandalf the White and had only faked his death.

Hedwig - I didn't really register it. It was too much of a minor character to care about her. Harry doesn't seem to think much about it either.

Dobby - that was probably the second saddest death for me. It's interesting that even after so many losses, Harry could still suffer so much when he lost a friend.

Fred - while this one is sad for Harry, I didn't really like the twins much so I didn't really care. I think it would have been more tragic if Percy, who had just returned to his family, would have died.

Snape - I wasn't really sad or anything but I was a little bit shocked about the gory death he received... and a bit excited because I was looking forward to find out what his story.

Remus and Tonks - were also hard to registered because among so many deaths, Harry just notices their bodies for a few seconds. I honestly felt sadder for Collin who adored Harry and all Harry could think while seeing his body was that he looked tiny in death.

Bellatrix - was glad to be rid of her. My least favorite types of characters are sadists.

Voldemort - a little sad because the story was over.
