I think Dumbledore was low key very manipulative when I replay events it seems like he wanted Harry to grow up to die in battle with Voldemort and kept him isolated. I blame him for Sirius death and Sirius not being proven innocent while alive. I think it's really suspect he didn't know what happened with Peter/Sirius and supposedly didn't go to investigate during all those years...other stuff...I think he had greater good in mind but a grey moral way of going about it.

Snape I think comes off pretty different in the books vs movies and in the books he's inappropriate and cruel with children who are like primary school age. He's a bigot and never renounced those beliefs. He was fine to let Harry and James die when he heard about the prophecy. Had Neville been chosen one he wouldn't have switched sides. He claimed he loved lily but did lots of fucked up stuff to his beloved's child. He was petty and immature.
