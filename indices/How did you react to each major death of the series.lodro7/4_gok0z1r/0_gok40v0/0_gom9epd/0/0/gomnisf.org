I was happy that he died. Brutal wise I didn't really see it as brutal. He was bitten by nagini. That's what happens to frank the caretaker at Riddle manor too. The cruciatus curse (torture curse) seems much more painful and we see that used throughout the series which seems much more brutal..I think the fates of Alice and frank long bottom are the ones that bother me the most after all these years.

Lavender brown falls off a balcony and Fred is killed in an explosion which both felt fairly violent. Though Fred may have died quicker as lavender is still feebly stirring after having fallen.
