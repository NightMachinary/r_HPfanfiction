I am ready to fight JKR on sight for killing Sirius and Remus. I cried reading about Sirius way back when it first came out. Fred and Tonks also make me sad I def cried for Fred. Also I feel like Sirius and Remus made no sense to kill off and was such a fumbled opportunity especially Sirius.

Cedric was sad but we didn't know him well.

Dumbledore I was kinda sad about back when book came out but now I smile thinking about it.

Snape I damn near jumped for joy.
