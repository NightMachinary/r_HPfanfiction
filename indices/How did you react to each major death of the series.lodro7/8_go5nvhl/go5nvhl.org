Sirius, Hedwig, and Dobby really fucked me up. I was genuinely sad, especially for Hedwig.

Snape I was super happy. Like, ear-to-ear smile when he finally died.

The rest, including Harry, I didn't really give a shit about. Rowling did such a good job of making Harry unlikable in Books 6 and 7, that I was a little disappointed when he got up. And Voldemort going down to a spell used in 2nd year was a huge "yawn"; I remember reading the final "battle" (hard to call it that) and flipping to the end to see how many pages were left, trying to decide whether or not it was worth investing the time in a story I'd come to care so little about.
