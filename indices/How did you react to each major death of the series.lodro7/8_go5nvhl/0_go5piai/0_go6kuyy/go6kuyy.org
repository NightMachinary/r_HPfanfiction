I don't hate them, except canon!Harry and Snape. But they weren't written in ways that made them sympathetic to me; it was bad character development.

Let's take your list, and exclude Dobby/Hedwig/Sirius and Snape/Harry, as I said those deaths I found upsetting/enjoyed their deaths.

Cedric: intro'd in PoA for a few pages, then appears in a fair portion of GoF, dies at the end. Not a lot of time to get attached.

Dumbledore: I am not a basher, but the guy did knowingly send an infant to an abusive household. Consider Harry lived in a cupboard, was barely fed, never got a single present, and was constantly emotionally and occasionally physically (? we're not sure, JKR was understandably evasive on this) abused. In the real world, Voldemort or no, DD deserved a prison sentence.

Fred: Weasleys were a dime a dozen. Never felt much attachment to any of them except Percy and Arthur. Felt like I was reading The Weasley Family Chronicles and not Harry Potter at several points in canon. And frankly, for having 8 members of the family fighting, losing only 1 wasn't that devastating.

Remus/Tonks: I might have felt bad for Remus if JKR didn't have our last image of him be as a new father trying to abandon his wife and son in the middle of a war. Tonks, well, again - newborn son at home, and she decides to go fight a (seemingly) hopeless battle. Heroic, maybe, but also negligent. Teddy deserved better than these two.

Voldemort/Bellatrix: did anyone NOT expect the two main baddies to die at the end? Anyway, when they finally were killed, again, it was incredibly unsatisfying. Bellatrix, arguably the 2nd or 3rd most dangerous magic user in Britain, offed by a pudgy ginger housewife. ðŸ¤® Voldemort, killed by a nonlethal spell so that our "hero" didn't have to grapple with ANY morally grey areas. Even if Voldemort was nothing more than a cardboard cutout of a villain, that was a really weak end to his reign of terror.

All in all, I don't think I felt much in the way of emotion from anything past GoF. I read all 7 books as an adult, 1 book per day, during spring break my junior year of college, so maybe I was just expecting a higher quality of storytelling than JKR is capable of. She's an amazing children's author (PS/CoS/PoA are still some of the greatest "sense of wonder" books I've ever read), but absolutely shit at any sort of YA/adult narrative. She didn't have the ability to write for her audience as they grew up.
