I saw the movies before I read the books but when I did, Cedric's death didn't really faze me much. Around Sirius' death there was this general air of sadness and despair that I just couldn't shake off for some time. And I kind of didn't register Hedwig's death at first. I just thought "wait what just happened" and had to reread it.

Dumbledore's and Fred's death was sad, Tonks' and Remus' too but Dobby hit me the most. I was literally sobbing when I read how Harry dug his grave.

I was cheering when Bellatrix died and felt a sense of calmness when Voldemort finally went too.
