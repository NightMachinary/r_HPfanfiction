[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night]] Draco/Hermione This story is poignant and beautiful. After the war convicted death eaters are re-homed by the ministry, their minds erased, and given new identities and new lives as muggles. Drake (formerly Draco) struggles to find meaning in a life where he can't remember anything, he doesn't fit in, and he doesn't know why. Hermione is assigned as his case worker, essentially, to make sure that his memories do not come back and that he is adapting well.

People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. This story has one of the most realistic takes on Draco I have ever seen, he's petty, he's an asshole, he hurts the people around him, and Hermione's hatred runs very deep.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385/chapters/3134746][47 Days to Change]] This story says slash but there isn't any. There was supposed to be some ~eventually~ but it never got that far and it was discontinued at a decent ending point. Harry goes back in time with the hopes that changing Tom Riddle's childhood will make him not turn to dark magic. Unfortunately, the evil in Tom Riddle goes far deeper than Harry realizes. This is the only story I have read where Tom Riddle is characterized accurately. He is brilliant, deceptive, charming, and straight up evil. It also has time travel explained in a really unique and fascinating way.
