Here's what I currently have labeled properly on my kindle, plus some from my favs list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3217498/1/A-Higher-Law][A Higher Law]] (Remus/Hermione, marriage law I think)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony][Tears/Kisses/Goodbyes on the Balcony]] (Jily, very long, 3rd one in progress and recently updated)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3924523/1/Innocence][Innocence]] (Sirius/Hermione, fun read if kinda annoying in a few parts)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] (Draco/Hermione, it has trailers and fanvids on youtube)

[[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1539][Reason for Life]] (Hermione/Sirius, requires a log-in but FF.Net has the censored version of her stories. I recommend all her stuff)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Marauder]] (Hermione/Remus, absolutely brilliant, I love it, you might cry)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10239915/1/Visions-of-Sugarplums-Danced-in-Their-Heads][Visions of Sugarplums Danced in Their Heads]] (Not a romance, but it's great. Involves Harry and Severus and what-ifs)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10725232/1/Key-Limes][Key Limes]] (AU Jily. It's shortish, it's funny, it's sweet)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8574349/1/The-Trick-of-Time][The Trick of Time]] (Hermione/Sirius, time travel)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance/Revolution/Resolution]] (snape mentors/adopts Harry. Long, I think it was really well written, serious AU. The 3rd one is unfinished/abandoned, but on the author's LJ are the last few chapters and it does wind down enough for closure)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When A Lioness Fights]] (Hermione/Snape. Hermione's a spy. Really long, I remember enjoying it and sacrificing sleep in favor of chapters)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] (Hermione/Snape, Harry/Draco, virginity does interesting things to magic)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul + sequels]] (Harry Potter w/ Multiple personalities. Really long, Harry+Draco, AU 3rd year+)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living with Danger series]] (AU everything basically. Extremely long series, but well worth the ride)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny][Roundabout Destiny]] (Extreme AU, Hermione merged with an OC, really interesting read.

My tablet is dead so I'm not going through what might be saved on there...

And I only just realized that 'The Trick of Time' and 'The Last Marauder' are by the same author.. I probably realized before and forgot, but...
