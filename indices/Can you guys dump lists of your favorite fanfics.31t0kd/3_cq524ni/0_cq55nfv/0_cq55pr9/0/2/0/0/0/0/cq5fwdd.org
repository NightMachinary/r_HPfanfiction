On Tumblr, some of us will tag with whatever we can think of that's used in at least part of the fandom, that way when people are searching or browsing tags, it shows up. I hate some of the ship tags, but they work. Though whoever decided to tag their James/Sirius stuff with 'StarBucks' and nothing else was frustrating.
