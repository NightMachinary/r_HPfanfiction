[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]] are all *highly recommended.* These are in a class all their own. Some other wonderful fics are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] (quasi-Peggy Sue/dimensional travel, Harry/Tonks, sort of), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]] (Harry/OC, dimensional travel), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] (Harmony, dimensional/time travel), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] (Hermione/Bellatrix via time travel). Those are all absolutely excellent.
