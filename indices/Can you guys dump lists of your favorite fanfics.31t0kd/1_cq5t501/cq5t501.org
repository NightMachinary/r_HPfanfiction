My favourite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. "Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies." Very well written and laugh out loud funny.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] seems to be back from the dead. Not complete but I think it's worth it.
