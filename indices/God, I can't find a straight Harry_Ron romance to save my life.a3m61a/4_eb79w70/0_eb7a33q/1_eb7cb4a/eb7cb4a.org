If someone links a subreddit where the fics asked for is made for, your reaction is to get snarky? What is wrong with you?

And before you or anyone else starts calling me a homophobe or something similar i just want to state that i have no problem with people asking for Slash fics on this subreddit. Just want to point out that if you want a fic and there is a subreddit made for the exact thing you're looking for, your best bet would be to look there.
