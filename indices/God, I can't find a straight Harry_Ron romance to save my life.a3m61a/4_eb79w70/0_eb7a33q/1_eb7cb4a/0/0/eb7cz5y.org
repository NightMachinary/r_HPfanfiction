Ah well, I don't really care how you interpeted the comment. Point is, He/she suggested a subreddit for the thing op was looking for. I don't really care how many subs either has. as i said before, no problem with people asking for whatever they want on this subredit. But to get mad when people offer their help is just stupid.
