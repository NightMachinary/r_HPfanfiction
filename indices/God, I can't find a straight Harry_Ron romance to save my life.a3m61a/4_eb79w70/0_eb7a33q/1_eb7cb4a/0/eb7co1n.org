  If someone links a subreddit where the fics asked for is made for, your reaction is to get snarky? What is wrong with you?

There's a vast sea of difference between "You might also want to ask in [[/r/HPSlashFic]] they might be able to help you as well" and "This is the wrong subreddit!".

  want a fic and there is a subreddit made for the exact thing you're looking for, your best bet would be to look there.

Not really. This subreddit has 26k readers, the other one has 1.5k. Seems like a good idea to ask for fanfiction on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] .
