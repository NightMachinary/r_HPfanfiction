There's really no veela allure that Fleur can turn on and off whenever she likes.

The only thing that's described is that her beauty turns heads wherever she goes, be it at the Great Hall the first time she's introduced, during the Yule Ball (somewhat), during book 6 when Ron just stares without tact (Ron will be Ron), and during her wedding where her beauty and radiance makes it seem like the heavily scarred Bill has an unblemished, handsome face.

That's it. There's no exotic allure or veela force-field that compels boys and men to ogle her and lose all higher brain function.
