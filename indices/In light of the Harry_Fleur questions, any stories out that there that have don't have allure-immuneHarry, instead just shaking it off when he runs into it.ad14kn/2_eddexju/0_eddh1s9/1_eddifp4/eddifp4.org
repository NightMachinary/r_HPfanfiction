My comment was about Fleur herself, not full-blooded veela. Fleur turns heads because she's incredibly beautiful, not because of anything else.

[[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] has replied to the assumption of full-blooded veela having an allure - there isn't one. When a multitude of full-blooded veela sing and dance, they cast an area-wide influence spell. When those veela stop dancing, there is no longer a spell in place, and the effect of the spell stops, giving the impression of an "allure".
