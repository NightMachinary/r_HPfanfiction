I've witnessed men make ridiculous boasts to beautiful women on more than one occasion. No magic required. Add in the fact that Fleur is /supernaturally/ beautiful and I think that her good looks are entirely sufficient to explain certain men saying stupid things around her.

The enchantment effect and the "she's so beautiful I must impress her" effect are described in completely different ways in the books. The enchantment is like a switch, turned on and off by the music and the dancing. While it is ongoing, every man who can hear the music is enchanted; Harry is affected equally to Ron.

The "she's so beautiful I must impress her" effect is not described as robbing a person of their willpower or sense. Harry feels none of this effect even though he is just as susceptible as everyone else to the musical enchantment. It's not that he is able to resist the "beauty" effect, he just doesn't feel it at all. Meanwhile, Ron demonstrates both behaviours.
