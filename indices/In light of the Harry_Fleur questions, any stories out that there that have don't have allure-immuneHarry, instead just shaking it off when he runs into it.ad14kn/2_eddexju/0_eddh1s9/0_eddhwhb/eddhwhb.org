The veela's enchantment is a magic which is cast by singing and dancing, it's not a kind of magical field that veela have around them either permanently or under their mental control. Mr Weasley is able to protect himself from the effect by plugging his ears, and while Harry notices that the Veela are supernaturally beautiful from the moment they appear, he is not magically entranced until they begin singing and dancing. Similarly, the moment they stop singing and dancing, the enchantment ends.

Separate from the power to enchant men into stupidity, veela are also supernaturally beautiful, which also causes men to say stupid things in their presence, but which is on a completely different scale to the complete loss of willpower when under their singing/dancing enchantment.

Fleur has the supernatural beauty. Whether she also has the ability to enchant men through singing and dancing is unknown.
