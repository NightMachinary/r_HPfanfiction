  but if not for his father, Ron would have jumped to death during the World Cup because he was entranced by the veela dance.

I think you may be misremembering the scene a bit:

  The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.

  And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea... but would it be good enough?

  “Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione's voice from a long way off.

  The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.

  Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.

  “You'll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their say.”

  “Huh?” said Ron, staring open-mouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field.

  Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. “Honestly!” she said.
