If I remember correctly: Neville is the BWL, Harry's parents are still dead and he is raised/abused by the Dursleys. Neville is basically the same as he is in canon whereas Harry is a genius and was sorted Slytherin. Fic begins with Harry brutally torturing/murdering the Dursleys after the end of second year.
