I vaguely recall one where he called himself a chronomage. He was definitely able to time travel and I think he could age or de age someone's body. He de aged himself so that he was "really" young again, no just an old man in a young body, and I think he de aged Sirius to pre Azkaban healthiness. Can't remember the title off the top of my head though.
