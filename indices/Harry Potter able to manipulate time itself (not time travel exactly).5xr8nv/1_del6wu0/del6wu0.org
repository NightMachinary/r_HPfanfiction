There's this bit in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/realignment-hp.351838/][/Realignment/]] but it's sadly just one showcase spell.

  “James, they've got at least fifty wizards out there.”

  “Fifty?” He rolled his shoulders. “We might need to use some tricks then.”

  “I didn't think you had any left.” Clara was peering into some mirror, from the glimpses Tom got it seemed to show the street and the wizards. “They're getting into position.”

  “Well get ready,” Tom was watching his wand twist with horrified fascination, there was more power gathered then he'd ever even dared to imagine. Whatever magic Bond was doing was titanic, immense energies balanced on the end of the narrow length of elder, he had the Elder Wand! Bond didn't stop for his revelation. “Cause this may feel a little weird.”

  Clara was enveloped in a bubble that's edges were turning slowly grey, then she blurred. Spells lanced from her wand at an impossible rate, blasting the wall away and then the Germans. They were completely unprepared for the onslaught, hundreds of beams pouring out as the world around them turned hostile. Clara raised monsters from the cobblestones, twisted the German's bodies, and set half the road alight with blazing green fire.

  Tom's fascination with Bond's magic, some sort of accelerated time, wasn't enough to distract him from the toll it was taking. His hand was shaking, tremors racing up his arm as Clara cut a swathe through their enemies. The anti-apparition jinx fell and so did Tom, dropping heavily to his knees. She slowed into visibility for an instant, then he bore down on the magic, keeping it going through sheer force of will, and she sped again. Tom's vision went grey around the edges, but he kept going until Clara looked back then burst from her bubble.

  She pulled him up roughly, angrily. “Spinnst du oder was?”

  Tom swayed against her. “Maybe? You know I don't speak English- German whatever.”

  “Typical.” She gripped him by the shoulder and they were gone from Paris.

  His headache was back though. Tom lay in the darkness, trying to think about what he'd just done and seen. On all his previous excursions he'd been desperate to try the magic Bond showed. The construct, the rock shield, apparating, the bubble was nothing like them. He looked to his bedside table where his holly wand rested, he couldn't imagine using it to rip a sphere of the world free from the river of time. Not yet.

There's is also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/471497/chapters/818755][/Time v.3.0/]], but it's a /Doctor Who/ fanfic, not HP.
