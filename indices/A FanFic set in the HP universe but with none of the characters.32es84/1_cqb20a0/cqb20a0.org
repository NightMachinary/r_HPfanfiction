It is not unheard off, but still very borderline acceptable for many people.

I mean, think about it: People who like Harry Potter want to read more about Harry Potter and his friends. Not about your OCs.

The story better be really really good and have great character development of its own in that case since you are essentially just writing an original story at that point.
