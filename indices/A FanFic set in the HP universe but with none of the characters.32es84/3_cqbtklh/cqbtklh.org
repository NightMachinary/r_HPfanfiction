für das größere wohl is one of the best fics I've read for Harry Potter, and the only canon characters in it is Karkaroff and Grindelwald, and they doesn't even play that big of a role.

As others have said, Alexandra Quick is also OC only, and thats also a great read. So while uncommon, it can be done very well.
