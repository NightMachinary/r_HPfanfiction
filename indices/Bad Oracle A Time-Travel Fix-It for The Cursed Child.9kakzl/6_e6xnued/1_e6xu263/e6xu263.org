  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them.
