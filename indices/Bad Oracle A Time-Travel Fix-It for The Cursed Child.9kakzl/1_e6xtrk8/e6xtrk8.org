I have been following this fic since it started and have really enjoyed it so far (Although I did read it on fanfiction.net so I did not know about about the time travel or Lily when I started reading it).

The story follows Harry, Dumbledore and Snape as a random girl appears out of nowhere knowing too many things about them and claiming to know a way to defeat Voldemort. They have to decide if they should go along with this strange random girl's plan. She also likes to go around telling Harry, Snape and later Lily details that other people like Dumbledore never told them which creates some interesting situations.

It has a good balance of being both entertaining at times and having a more serious tone at other times. I have not read cursed child so I don't know how accurate Delphini is to her character but I like her in this fic. Snape is also well portrayed and is not a super nice well adjusted person that he often is in fics that include him as a main character.
