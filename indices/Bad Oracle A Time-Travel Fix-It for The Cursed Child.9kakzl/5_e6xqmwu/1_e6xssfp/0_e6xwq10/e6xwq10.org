You have author's notes for flavors, tags are for finding shit. No one is going to search for Delphi/ruins everyone's day. Half of your tags are redundant (Order of the Phoenix would be enough, there's no need to tag CC if you already have the CC fandom tagged).

At least on Tumblr the only people who are subject to your tag spam are your followers, who obviously don't mind since they are following you. On archive all they do is clog up the search results for everyone else.
