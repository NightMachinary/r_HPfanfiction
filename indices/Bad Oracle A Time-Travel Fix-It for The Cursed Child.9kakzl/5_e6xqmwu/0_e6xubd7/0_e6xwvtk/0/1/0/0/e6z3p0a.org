I don't ship people with Bellatrix, I advocate a more nuanced depiction of her than "evil Black Sister who joined Voldemort because she was so evil". It just is a better, less trope-y story.

The only two ways I see Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Bellatrix happen are massiv AUs, or under very specific circumstances which I haven't seen written so far.

And unlike any other Death Eater, Bellatrix is actually a capable fighter and a threat, so she isn't just a turd with a silver mask. She is cool evil, like Darth Vader.
