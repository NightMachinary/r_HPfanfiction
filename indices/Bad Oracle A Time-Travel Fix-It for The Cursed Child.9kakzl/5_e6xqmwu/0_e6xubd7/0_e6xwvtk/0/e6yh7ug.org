Almost anything can be done in fic.

Doing it /well/ is another matter entirely, of course.

A post-1981 Lily/Snape pairing could work, but it would have to contain an unattractive, non-whitewashed Snape and include an incredibly dysfunctional mess of a relationship for me to buy it.

(Come to think of it, any pairing involving Snape should probably be incredibly dysfunctional.)
