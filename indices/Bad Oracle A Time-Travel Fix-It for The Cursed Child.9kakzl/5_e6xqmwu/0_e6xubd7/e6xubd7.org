The timeline before 5th year is unchanged, Lily is resurrected in a way that makes sense for the fic. Lily and Snape are not together (at least as of yet) and their interactions between each other are varied in tone. She is not happy with him for various reasons but he is also the one of the few people she knows and who is around.

I do agree that this fic is likely not for someone who really doesn't like Snape though. He is not whitewashed here, but it does seem to be somewhat of a Snape redemption fic.

It is entertaining and a good fic otherwise, I do recommend reading it.
