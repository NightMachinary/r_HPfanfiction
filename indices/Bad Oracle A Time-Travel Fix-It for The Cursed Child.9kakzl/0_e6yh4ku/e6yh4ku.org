I thought it was engagingly written, fast-moving, and a lot of fun. I'd like to see more CC fixes because I think there are potentially many alternate takes on it if you think outside the box. And all of them will be better than the play.

I've written one myself but it's hard to get eyes on the page because there's so much resistance to it. I guess people think that if you've written fanfiction for it, it's because you like it, when actually the opposite is the case. I've taken to describing mine as a 'transformative work'.
