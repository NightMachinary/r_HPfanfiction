It's pretty original concept/direction wise, capably written and the limited scope prevents it from taking spanning eight years with twice the word count of war and peace only to peter off without an actual ending. I genuinely like this fic, top-marks though in an admittedly limited category. (There's an obscene amount of Harry Potter fanfiction though I doubt there's more then one wonky, Crused Child time-travel fix-it, especially with the given approach.)
