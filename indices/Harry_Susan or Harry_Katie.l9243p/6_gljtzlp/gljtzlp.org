Harry / Katie is one of the coolest ships he has, but unfortunately there are very few Harry / Katie stories that are not total whoring. Usually Harry owns a huge harem, including the Quidditch team, and that is all of Harry / Katie that you currently encounter. It's fucking annoying.

​

+I'm seriously considering putting Katie in place of Astoria in my fanfic.+

​

Edit1: I've read a lot of Harry / Susan fanfics, I'll collect them and post them later.
