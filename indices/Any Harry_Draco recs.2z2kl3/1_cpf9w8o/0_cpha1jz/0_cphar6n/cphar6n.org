It's one of my absolute favorite fics of all time!

This is the story of my life, haha. Find a good fic, stay up half the night to finish it. I remember constantly refreshing schnoogle hoping for a new chapter of IP, and then subscribing to her and Cassie Clare's mailing list and monitoring my email like crazy the whole time. I swear the chapter updates only came at 10pm on a school night.
