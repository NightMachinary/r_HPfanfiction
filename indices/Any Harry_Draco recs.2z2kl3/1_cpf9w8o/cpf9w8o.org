[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP.html][Irresistible Poison]] by Rhysenn (hogwarts age)

#+begin_quote

  This is the prequel to another fic, Haven, which was turned into a trilogy. Origins is by far my favorite of the three stories in the series.

  It takes place during Hogwarts and tells of how Draco fell in love with Harry before Haven started. She doesn't give an official summary for Origins other than that, so here is the summary for Haven:

  After a whirlwind romance with Draco Malfoy that ends in an explosion of clashing political beliefs, Harry Potter graduates from Hogwarts and takes a job with the Ministry. He hopes that Draco wil not join the Death Eaters and will come to him in time, and he doesn't guess what Voldemort has in store for him.

There were also a few H/D Big Bangs done after books 5-7 came out. I really enjoyed most of the fics and art. Here are each of the challenges. Most should be Hogwarts age.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.
