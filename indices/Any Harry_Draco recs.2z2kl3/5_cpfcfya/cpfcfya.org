If you're hoping for something with a larger focus on plot than on the shipping, you may like Lightning on the Wave's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]].

It's a full seven-year Hogwarts story [complete, 3.05M words]. The first few books don't even touch the main H/D ship (beyond a hint or two), and are instead more focused on Harry's personal struggles that arise from the way his parents (who are alive in this universe) treated him as opposed to his twin brother (the Boy-Who-Lived in this universe).

There are appropriate trigger warnings everywhere, especially in the latter 3 books where things get much more violent. Additionally, the author goes out of their way to specify where potentially triggering scenes occur in each chapter, so it's easy to skip if needed.
