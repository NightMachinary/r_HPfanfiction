linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) There is less focus on getting to the end confrontation or setting up a big evil villain and more on Harry's crazy adventures and life in general. Although with lots of worldbuilding and great characters. It's super long and unfinished, but I very much enjoyed the long epic journey even if not all the plot lines are resolved in the end.
