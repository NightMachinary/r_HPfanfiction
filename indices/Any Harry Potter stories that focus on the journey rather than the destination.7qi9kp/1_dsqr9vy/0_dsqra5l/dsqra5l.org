  Daphne Greengrass isn't the person that she was at Hogwarts. She's changed for the better. However, due to her lifestyle changes, her day-to-day has become a bit mundane. Work, Study, Sleep is the never-ending loop that is Daphne's life. Until one day, while at work, she comes face to face with the least boring person in Wizarding Britain. Can he spice things up a bit?
