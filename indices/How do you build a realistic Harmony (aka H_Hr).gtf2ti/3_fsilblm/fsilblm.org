I think that there are two major canonical barriers to Harmony, and your story needs to find ways to crack or circumvent them.

First, Hermione needs support and validation in her ambitions. Harry, in canon, doesn't care deeply about good grades, or House points, or wholesale freeing of House Elves, or learning all that there is to know. He's not /driven/ in the same way that she is; once Tom is gone, he'd be happy to settle down into quiet obscurity, but Hermione will want to rise to the top and change the world. Something needs to happen that alters or bridges that gap.

Second, Harry needs someone to help him smile, or preferably laugh. Hermione is a planner, an overachiever, but she doesn't easily laugh, or even relax. Perhaps it's no surprise that they were closest together in Deathly Hallows, on the run, when being serious was the order of the day - but that's no way to live once the war is done. So, either something needs to happen that makes Harry less broody and more resilient, or Hermione needs to let her hair down and joke around with him more.

Solve those two and I think you have a solid setup.
