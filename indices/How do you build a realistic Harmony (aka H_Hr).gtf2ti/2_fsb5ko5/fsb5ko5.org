I think it is - based on what we see in canon - probably the most natural pairing in the series. I'm not particularly enthusiastic about H/HR in fanfiction because I think it is frequently done in ways that - let's be honest - are rather over the top, but it is the only realistic relationship in canon.

Harry and Hermione have an enormous amount of respect for each other in canon. She is the only one in the whole series who is at Harry's side for all of his adventures, with the sole exception of when she was petrified by the basilisk. That kind of loyalty shows deep affection. Harry, being more withdrawn in general, still defends Hermione with vigor when she is attacked/insulted, relies on her, and trusts her completely.

I think if you want to make H/HR realistic in your fanfiction, start with the presumption that if you are writing your characters close to canon, and most of your work is done for you. I don't *hate* the Weasleys, but Ron and Ginny were very much shoehorned into their pairings with HR and HP in canon. You can see this is if you go back and look at fanfiction the mid 2000s, before HBP was released. H/HR *was* canon back then, lol.
