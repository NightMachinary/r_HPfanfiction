  She is the only one in the whole series who is at Harry's side for all of his adventures

My favorite HHr moment in the entire series is in GoF, the morning after Harry's name was pulled. If you ever needed any more proof of Hermione's unwavering loyalty to Harry, here it is:

  When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to find that Ron's bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast. [...]

  He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione. "Hello," she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. "I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?" [...]

  Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story *without question*.

I'll never forgive the movie for shamelessly retconning this and making Hermione abandon Harry and even snap at him. The idea here I suppose was that Hermione didn't know how to handle Ron and Harry not being on speaking terms so she awkwardly tried to appease both, rather than having Harry's back who was all alone facing the resentment of the whole school.

What I think this shows is that in 2005 the movies were already all about setting up Ron&Hermione whereas, like you said, in 2000 the books were kinda speaking a different language if you were to have asked many fans at the time.
