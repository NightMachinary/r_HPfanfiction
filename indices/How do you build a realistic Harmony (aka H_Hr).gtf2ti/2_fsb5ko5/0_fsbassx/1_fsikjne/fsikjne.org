You're not wrong about Hermione's importance during Ron's jealousy spat, /but/ in that very episode, Harry finds that Hermione's company, in the absence of Ron, is not very fun. He craves fun and laughter like air. Hermione's contribution, reassuring him and feeding him and counseling him, is honestly more motherly than romantic - which is a kind of love that he also desperately needs, but not at all the same kind. He couldn't be happy, I think, in a long term relationship with someone who doesn't make him laugh.
