Yeah, you're totally right. One of the most painful realizations I've had to make is that Harry and Ron are each other's best friend, which perhaps doesn't really jibe with this fan-created notion of the “golden trio”.

Hermione is also a much better friend to Harry than he is to her. In canon I'm often frustrated with his lack of appreciation for everything she does for him, and failure to apologize when he's been a jerk (PoA & OotP).

And lastly I personally would prefer spending time with her to Ron. That might mean less time goofing off and decidedly more time studying in the library but I'd take that over a friend who bails when I desperately need support.

But that's just me. I'm not Harry. So I can respect his needs are different and his need for humor has certainly been cited a lot when discussing this topic. So I'll admit that HHr is maybe somewhat flawed, but I also never got the impression that Ginny was so much better. Not enough screen time perhaps and Harry's rather sudden falling in love in HBP with the whole chest monster business was clumsy to say the least.

And as for Ron and Hermione, I think the main reason I hated it was because the books are entirely from Harry's PoV, which I think is detrimental in some cases. If the books had PoV-chapters and we actually got to spend some time with Ron and Hermione and see the world through their eyes for a change and perhaps even saw them get together I think it could have worked. Plus, I wouldn't have felt so left out as a reader. I loathe the little moments in 6&7 where Harry notices his two friends' affection for each other. At one point JKR even explicitly states how seeing them hold hands makes him feel lonely and isolated and left out and by extension so did I as a reader.

As a counter-example, though, I often bring up Avatar. I find it uncanny who similar-ish the dynamic between Aang, Katara and Sokka is, yet in that show HHR basically happened and Aang loved Katara despite her being “less fun” and sometimes motherly. So I think it's an interesting case where other writers think differently about similar character archetypes.
