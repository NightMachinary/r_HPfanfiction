I suppose you might say that Ginny ticks all the boxes for a character whom Harry would be expected to like, but it's all in hints, whereas what you'd expect for such an important person in his life would be involvement in most or all chapters of each book. His love interest ought to have huge amounts of screen time, and only Hermione meets that standard.

I quite like Hinny in principle, but after reading extensive fics about it, it's easy to forget just how little she appeared in canon.

And yes, Harry doesn't enjoy Hermione and Ron's bickering-all-the-time relationship dynamic. Frankly, neither do I. Apparently it works for some people.
