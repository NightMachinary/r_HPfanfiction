I mean, it's a valid option. There's a lot of variables that depend on where you want your story to go, including:

- Harry and Hermione have much more of a shared history, given their childhoods in the muggle world

- They were both bullied for being different, whereas the Weasleys are pureblood (poor, but still not victims of bigotry)

- Both of them are from small families and were isolated from their peers as children, making large crowds (like the one that lives at the Burrow?) likely to be uncomfortable for them

- Both H/HR are famous in their own right (BWL and "Brightest Witch of a Generation"), so the fame issue isn't a problem (unlike Ron, who is jealous, or Ginny, who was starstruck).

That's kind of what I meant - just going off of observations from canon, it's pretty unlikely that the Weasleys would be able to make it with H or HR. That's not to say that H/HR are "SOULBONDED STAR CROSSED LOVERS OMG" - i mean, most people don't marry someone they met in middle school. But the foundation between H/HR is way stronger than any other canon character we see.
