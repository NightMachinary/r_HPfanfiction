  I think it is - based on what we see in canon - probably the most natural pairing in the series. I'm not particularly enthusiastic about H/HR in fanfiction because I think it is frequently done in ways that - let's be honest - are rather over the top, but it is the only realistic relationship in canon.

I agree with this 100%. They are the only realistic relationship in canon. Out of all ships, they have the most foundation to be a healthy, long lasting couple. Friendship, bravery, and love. Trust and understanding. Grounded in reality. That is HHr for me.

It is sad that the "popular" HHr fics tend to miss the point of HHr entirely; my favorite of those fics are probably not very popular. But then again, HHr are realistic and realism can be "boring" to teens writing OP edgy wank fests, or to people who don't truly recognize what makes HHr so wonderful.

You only have to change so very little of canon for HHr to happen. Focus on their deep bond and just ...give it a tiny nudge. And there you have it.
