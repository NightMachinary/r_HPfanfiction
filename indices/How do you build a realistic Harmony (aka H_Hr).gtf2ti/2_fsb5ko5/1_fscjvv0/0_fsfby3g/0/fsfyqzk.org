  Then she dates a bunch of guys - including Harry's roommate (yikes) - to â€˜prove' to Harry she's ... a girl? Do I have that right?
#+end_quote

I don't think you do. More like proving it to herself and finding out how to be a girl. I am not saying that the Hermione's advice was good one, because I don't think it was, but at least that's what I understood she meant.

  ... Ginny ... cries all over him and needs his support for her losing one of the Twins.
#+end_quote

??? Could you quote to me which exact paragraph of JKR text you mean? I don't think there is any meaningful interaction between the two in DH at all. Certainly not after The Battle.

Concerning Ron's bashing, you are absolutely right, the common accusation of Ron in Harmony stories that he left them during the camping trip is in my opinion nonsense (I have mentioned it in my story linkao3(20141410)): we are talking about extremely Dark Art material, saying that Ron broke under his influence is as stupid as accusing Ginny from committing all those crimes in her first year. It just doesn't make any sense.

  ... how even Luna was there to support Harry after Sirius died
#+end_quote

Was it hidden blaming of Ginny that she didn't help Harry? I don't think it would be fair. I see it as that Luna was able to help, Ginny (and BTW, Hermione or anybody else) was not. Big deal.
