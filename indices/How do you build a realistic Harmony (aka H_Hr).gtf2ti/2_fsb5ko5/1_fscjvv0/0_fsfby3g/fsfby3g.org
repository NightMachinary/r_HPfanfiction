See, I'm not sure about that premise. I understand being turned off by H/HR fanfics - hell, I almost never read them myself, even though I was rooting for H/HR from the first book onward. But I've tried some Hinny fics, and they usually end up simply replacing Hermione with Ginny - to the point that suddenly Ginny is smart and capable. From my own (albeit limited) exposure, I'd say Ginny gets the Mary Sue treatment almost as much as HR does.

Looking strictly at canon, you're right that Ginny doesn't get much screen time, which by itself makes it a terrible narrative decision to pair her off with the main character. But what we do see of her is not great. She spends the first 3-4 years tongue-tied and starstruck. Then she dates a bunch of guys - including Harry's roommate (yikes) - to 'prove' to Harry she's... a girl? Do I have that right?

Meanwhile, Harry's going through some traumatic stuff. Like, a LOT of traumatic stuff. Luna comforts him, Hermione comforts/supports him. Ginny celebrates quidditch and is upset that he breaks up with her - to protect her. Then, in the final battle, after Harry's lost the last familial tie he had (Remus), died himself/was resurrected, and finally avenged his parents, Ginny .... cries all over him and needs his support for her losing one of the Twins.

I look at her a lot like I see Ron - both of the youngest Weasley kids are *normal teenagers*. They're interested in kid stuff, like sports, goofing off, and getting out of doing homework. I think, if I were a wizard at Hogwarts during this time, I'd probably be a lot like them! However, in the story of how a heroic orphan and his best friend save the world, Ron/Ginny come off as woefully inadequate. A lot of why they get bashed is because they act like normal kids while Harry/Hermione are acting like heroes. It makes it hard for me to swallow them getting to enjoy a happily-ever-after for them when they did so little.

None of that is to say I am trying to change your mind about Hinny. You like what you like, buddy :)

EDIT: Wanted to mention your comment RE: Luna, which is what got me thinking about this whole thing, and how even Luna was there to support Harry after Sirius died.
