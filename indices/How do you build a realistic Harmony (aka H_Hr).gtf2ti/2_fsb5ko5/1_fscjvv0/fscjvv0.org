  I think it is - based on what we see in canon - probably the most natural pairing in the series.

Perhaps, but only because there is so little about other female characters (namely and especially Ginny, but even Luna is not doing much better --- she never gets out of being a caricature of herself, so we never learn about her true self), that it is hard to create meaningful relationship with them.

Yes, I also agree that friendship is necessary foundation of any romantic relationship, but almost all Harmony stories have their relationship so non-complicated, that reader have tendency to fall asleep. Hinny relationship must be much more built up (because we really know too little about Ginny), but perhaps because of that, their relationship in all stories tends to be much more dynamic and interesting. Which is to say, I think it could be done well, but it so much never is, that I have tendency to avoid Harmony stories.
