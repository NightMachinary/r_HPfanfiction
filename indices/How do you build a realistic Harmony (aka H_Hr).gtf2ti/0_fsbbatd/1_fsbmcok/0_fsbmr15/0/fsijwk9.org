I recently came across linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift); Slug Club is another opportunity to strike while the iron is hot. Hermione is already in turmoil, reconsidering her relationships, and hey, if she wants to spite Ron, then dating Harry, who is actually a realistic prospect, will twist the knife much deeper. Asking Cormac just looks like her judgement is compromised. Yes, it's supposed to send a message of "Even going out with this awful slob is better than you!" but how much more devastating would it be to instead send the message of, "Well, if you're going to be a jerk, there happens to be a potential boyfriend right here who's supportive and brave and loyal and oh, also rich and famous." And she also knows that Ron has envied Harry before. It's far more of a gut punch.
