It is simple...keep everyone else...specifically the Weasleys and Dumbledore...in character and not awful people. Ron and Hermione fight all the time...you don't need to dial it up to 10 to nullify that romantic relationship. Ginny is essentially a background character that pops up from time to time...not an an obsessed lunatic trying to get him to bathe in love potions. Just keep her in the background. Molly is a loud, loving, overbearing, overprotective person who sincerely loves Harry and isn't trying to manipulate him into marrying Ginny so she can get his money. Don't even have her in the story or limit her to the background.

The main problem with H/Hrs reputation is that most of the biggest stories lean into these tropes so it's spawned myriad copycats to the point that it is the ships predominant formula. I'm not saying they can't be entertaining but they are not realistic.

Of all the non canon ships H/Hr has by far the most established canon context and history at it's disposal to tell a realistic love story.

Edited to add this:. Don't have Harry and Hermione telling each other and gushing about how much they love and rely on each other. Show us. JK basically spent 7 books showing us how well they work together....that is your template...just add a bit more snogging. ðŸ˜Š Seriously...just refer to canon...it is all there.
