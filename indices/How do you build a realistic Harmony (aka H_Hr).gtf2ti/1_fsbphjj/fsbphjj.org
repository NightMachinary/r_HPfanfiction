What I find to be unique about Harmony is that they truly admire and validate each other. Hermione is amazed by Harry's courage and his sense of justice - doing what's right, even if it costs him his life. Harry is one of the few characters who don't seem annoyed by Hermione's know it all - vibe. He truly thinks she's amazing and resourceful, and can shower her with genuine appreciation.
