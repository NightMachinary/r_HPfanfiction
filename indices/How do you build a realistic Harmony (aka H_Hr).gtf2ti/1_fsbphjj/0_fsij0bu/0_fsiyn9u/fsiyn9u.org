Well, Hermione can be annoying, so no wonder. What I like about them is that I feel like Harry admires her intellect/contribution in an inclusive way- more like "great that you bring that to our table", while other characters could respond bit more negatively and focus on differences. But I really like Harmony, being an annoying know -it -all myself, I enjoy some pinkish glasses there
