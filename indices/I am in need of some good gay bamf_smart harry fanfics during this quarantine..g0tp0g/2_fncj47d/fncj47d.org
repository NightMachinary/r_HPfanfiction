Both of these are time travel and while the first one is bordering on grey, neither one really qualifies.

Of A Linear Circle - linkao3(11284494) - A big long series that's been updating regularly for nearly three years (and part 8 has three weeks left to go). You can skip part V as it appears to be on hiatus (but isn't really part of the main story anyway).

Gelosaþ in Écnesse - linkao3(2352896) - Very sweet, this one is more focused on the relationship than the first one.

And then a crossover...

Of Wizards and Heroes - linkao3(4148136) - MCU. I don't remember much about this one beyond the fact that I liked it tbh. It is a highly regarded fic tho?

... I'd link you more but I don't read much slash :x
