[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/322299]] In Pieces by Dyson Rules Drarry: Harry returns to Hogwarts as the new DADA teacher to find that Malfoy is haunting the castle. I don't normally like paranormal fics but I've read all of Dysonrules stuff and haven't read a bad one yet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7034761]] Teachind History (is old news) by you_light_the_sky In which Tom is the DADA professor at Hogwarts, secretly recruiting followers for his future army, and Harry is the worst Divination professor ever, accidentally messing up Tom's plans. It's not complete yet but funny and still worth the read.
