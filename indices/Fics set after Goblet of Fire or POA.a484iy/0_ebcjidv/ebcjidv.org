Honestly, I could probably give you a years of reading material just from alternative Goblet of Fires, though they all get much of a muchness after a while.\\
I don't know what you're like though so I'm just going to link a few and hopefully you will find something interesting. I'm assuming as you've said after POA as well that Fourth year fics are fine, also these are ones that I have enjoyed. That does mean that not all of them are the greatest thing written if you get my drift.

In regard to the Black Queen series have a "Hey, this series is a bit dark and slightly disturbing in places so not everyone's cup of tea" warning.
