There's "No Longer Alone", where Harry is adopted by the Tonks family after an AU end of the third year. Basically, Harry gets fed up with the constant fights between Ron and Hermione and instead starts to hang out with Katie Bell and her friend Leanne instead. The first nine characters are mostly family focused, the ones afterwards pay more attention towards Harry's friendship.

The story loosely follows the stations of canon but has a very different narrative focus compared to book 4. For example, Harry visits the World Cup, but only sees a few matches in the group stage and early knockout phase. The riots at the end happen, but Harry is not there because Narcissa warned Andromeda that Lucius is up to something.
