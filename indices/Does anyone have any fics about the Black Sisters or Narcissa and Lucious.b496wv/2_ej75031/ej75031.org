So not what you are asking for. But I often get my Black sisters fix from watching YouTube music videos.

Also there's some Harry Potter ASMR videos out there. I don't think anyone's done any of the black sisters. I feel comfortable saying this is some objectively good Lucius Malfoy ASMR. Highly recommend.
