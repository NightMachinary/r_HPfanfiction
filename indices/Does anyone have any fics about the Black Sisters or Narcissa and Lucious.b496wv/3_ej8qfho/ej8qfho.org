Slow burn Narcissa/Lucius but it's quite worth the read. It goes all the way from Narcissa right before she enters Hogwarts all the way to when the Dark Lord is first defeated. I really, highly adored this and there's even a sequel of sorts, although it focuses on Draco after the Second War. It is Draco/Luna which is a pairing I never thought about but it's written so masterfully and Lucius and Narcissa are mentioned a lot as well. The sequel's really a nice take on the post war time, with how now everyone hates the Malfoys/other former Death Eaters and how Draco is also traumatised from the war and feeling conflicted towards his family bc he loves his mom but isn't quite able to forgive his father. I could not recommend this enough. Features a quiet/cold Narcissa who's still ruthless and cunning and loving and the backbone of the Malfoy family and an ambitious Lucius.

Series of oneshots featuring the Black sisters, when they're young, when they're at Hogwarts, when they're married, etc. Really shows a nice dynamic between the Black sisters and also has their pairings as well (Lucius/Narcissa, Andromeda/Ted, Bellatrix/Rodolphus I guess haha).

Also another series of oneshots featuring the Black sisters but it's still such a fun read that I'd recommend reading both series. They each have their own charm â™¥

AU where Lucius is married but his wife dies shortly after Draco's birth. Narcissa becomes Draco's caretaker. Really a fun read although it's not finished. Narcissa is young and charming and gorgeous (and does she know it!) and Lucius is a cold, intimidating, grumpy bastard and it's done so well! Really all of this author's work is just amazing!

A while (a year?) ago, I went through all the stories marked Narcissa/Lucius on ffn and ao3 and read most of them (as long as they didn't include an abusive Lucius which I just don't find believable or incest haha). These are some of the best ones I can recall rn.

If you tell me what kind of characters you like, I could be more specific too! Because there are charming/outgoing/cunning Narcissa's and then there are silent and yet powerful and independent Narcissa's and there are powerful/charismatic/ambitious Lucius's, and then there are reserved yet charismatic Lucius's.
