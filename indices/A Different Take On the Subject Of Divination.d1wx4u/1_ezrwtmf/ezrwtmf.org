My theory is that The ministry of magic has been running a centuries long Smear campaign to discredit the branch of magic that is Divination. It can actually be used by everyone if they are taught properly.

I also feel like there may be some fundamental differences in the thought process of people that are good at transfiguration and what it takes to do Divination after all Both Dumbledore and McGonagall are both masters of transfiguration and seem to be the main ones that we see Looking down on it even going so far as to think about canceling the Class when there has to been a reason that it was taught at Hogwarts for hundreds of years.
