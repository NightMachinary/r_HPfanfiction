I always liked the idea that initially Divination was taught closer to it's D&D counterpart, where it was more of a general subject dedicated to magic used to divine thing (ie: to learn the truth of them), of which the future was only a part of the list. So spells like the Four-Point Spell would've been part of that branch of magic, because you are using it to learn which direction is north. But then, say at some point during the 16th or 17th centuries, there were a consecutive number of Divination teachers hired who heavily favoured the predicting the future part of this branch of magic, and so the focus of the subject was alterd accordingly.
