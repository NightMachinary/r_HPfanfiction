linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) by Seselt.

I love the prose in this, it draws me in. Seselt's style of writing is phenomenal, in my opinion. Add in to that a plot that I love, which is basically summed up as "Time-Travel Hermione becomes a Pureblood and goes to Slytherin and tries very hard not to mess up the timeline while trying to save the world." Both Hermione and the original characters (both fanon OC and actual OC) are really well written too.

Sadly, the fic was marked as complete with the most recent update, and yet it doesn't wrap up a bunch of questions most people had. It really didn't feel like an ending to me.

Even if it is complete, and not just marked that way while the author works on an epilogue, I don't even mind that I'll never get the ending I want. Because the fic is just. That. Good. At least, it is to me. So I would love another 100,000 words, because I want it to go on that much longer, and also I'd love to see an ending, or at least a sequel!
