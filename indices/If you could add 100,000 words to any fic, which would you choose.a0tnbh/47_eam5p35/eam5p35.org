The Rahkesh Asmodeus Seriers, i.e. A Second Chance At Life, Changes In A Time Of War, and A Magical World. Simply the best damn story out there, even if it's so AU some hesitate to call it a Potter fic.

Also Harry Potter And The Nightmares of Futures Past, the first fic I ever read, I hear the progress bar is at 94%, so I'm hoping for a Christmas miracle!
