GOD OF THE LOST.

I don't know who else remembers that one but the author not only didn't finish the story, they took the whole thing off the internet and doesn't want anyone to read it anymore. I was sad for ages.

It's such a good story that it could have been non-HP and I still would have been hooked, which I guess may be why it was taken off the internet in the first place but still :(
