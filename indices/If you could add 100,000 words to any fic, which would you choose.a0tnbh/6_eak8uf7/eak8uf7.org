*What you leave behind -* /By Newcomb/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]]

​

A fanfic which immediately caught my attention and made its way into my top 20 favourites. It has great characterisation (especially Cedric!), riveting plot, and its amazingly written. Unfortunately it has not been updated in over 3 years. *However*, I have periodically private messaged the author (who has also done other very enjoyable fics) asking for any update on the story, to which I received a reply saying that the story will eventually be continued (which allowed me a sigh of relief).

​

The main points of divergences to cannon as mentioned by 'Romulus Agustulus' on DLP is that.

1. Arianna did not die in the fight between Albus, Grindlewald, and Aberforth.
2. Harry is born a year earlier.

It is still a work in progress so I still have high hopes to see this story completed!

​

Also check out the other Fic the same author has written. its called *The Lesser Sadness*. Another story which is fantastically written and I eagerly await to see updated!
