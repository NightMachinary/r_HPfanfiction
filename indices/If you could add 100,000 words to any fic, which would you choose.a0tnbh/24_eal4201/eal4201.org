Dragon Pox by Melverne linkffn(5436066)

It's an amazing kidfic from the era before Mrs. Figg was canon-ly made a Squib, and features an amazing cast of characters like Mrs. Longbottom, Amelia Bones, and Mrs. Abbot, along with their assorted children. Basically: "The Old Dame Society Sets Things Right". It's a little heavy on the abuse the Dursleys do to Harry, which isn't my favorite thing to read about, but other than that it's a charming story that stopped updating much too soon.
