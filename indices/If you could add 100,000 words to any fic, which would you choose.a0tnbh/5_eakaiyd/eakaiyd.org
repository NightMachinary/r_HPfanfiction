Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)

There is an entire fic missing between the second last chapter and the epilogue. I wanted to see more of Dark!Ron and Dark!Hermione helping the new Dark Lord Potter ascend into power. There were also other scenes in the epilogue that could also been fleshed out upon like Dark!Neville's speech in the Wizengamot and how he still manages to stay free after proclaiming his support for a new Dark Lord or Dark!Susan taking over the DMLE and imposing her will. I go back there once in a while just in the faint hope the author updates. There is so much set-up in that fic and then it adruptly ends just before it gets to the interesting parts
