I was rather impressed by linkffn(Forging the Sword), which appears to be abandoned. 100k words could do a lot there.

Nightmares of Futures Past would definitely be my top contender, except that the author continues to give assurances that it's still in progress, just hindered by his ongoing recovery. So I'd save my wish for a different one.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is not bad either, and updates only very slowly, although the more recent chapters haven't felt like the high point of the story.

Actually, are we limited to Harry Potter? I'd be rather interested to see that much added to linkffn(Saruman of Many Devices)
