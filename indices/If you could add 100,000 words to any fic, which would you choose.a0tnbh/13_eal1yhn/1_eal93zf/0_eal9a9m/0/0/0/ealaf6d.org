Huh.

Google knows about it, with story id 5053251, but then ff.net says Story Not Found. The author has taken it down, it seems.

If you missed the most recent chapter, Snape devised a potion to renew Albus' body and overcome the time delay curse, based on the three elements that Voldemort used to resurrect himself, but all willingly given. The blood of his enemy was his girlfriend's, because she's actually Voldemort's daughter. And it worked, and it looks like everyone can live happily ever after.
