You might try SSHENRY's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=5097][Summer of the Serpent]] and its many sequels. North of a million words, it's canon compliant (mostly) through 6th year and a classic that's still fairly readable after eight or so years, if a bit of a Mary Sue treatment of the character.
