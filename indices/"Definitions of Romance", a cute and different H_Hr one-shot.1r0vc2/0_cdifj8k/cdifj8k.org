Description from the site:

/Everyone said they were the least romantic couple in the world. A love story: HarryHermione./

Remembered reading this ages ago and decided to share. I thought it was pretty good. This sort of a relationship seems to suit Harry and Hermione better than poetic declarations of undying love and such.
