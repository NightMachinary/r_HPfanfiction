Personally I don't think that Hermione would be the best Minister of Magic. I really do think that she is to, "Extreme". I think she'd be better as an advisor to a half-blood Minister who has knowledge and experience in both the Magic and Muggle world and had a Pureblood advisor as well. Or at least a Magical raised Half blood who cares about preserving magical tradition. I just really think that Hermione would be overly radical as Minister and would try to change too much with little care about tradition. Sure plenty of the magical world needs updating but heedlessly diving in would just alienate people and cause bigger issues.
