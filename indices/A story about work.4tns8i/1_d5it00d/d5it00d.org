There's a few in my faves. There's a great incomplete where he's a big game hunter. There's a black comedy where harry's a thief and politician which is tautology. There's hermioen and the marriage revolution which follows their ministry careers.

And in my head there's one where he runs a pie shop in new york and works with a snarky detective to solve murders while having orgies with models who love how he smells like food that they can never eat.
