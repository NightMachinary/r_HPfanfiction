I thought Dumbledore was furious at the notion of dementors around Hogwarts, and refused to let them enter the grounds? It was the ministry that kept forcing them on the school, so he agreed to let them guard the gates to the grounds as a compromise. He was really angry when they came onto the quidditch pitch though.
