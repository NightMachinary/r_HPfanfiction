Hmm...good question. If the rails of the canon were followed up to the point where a good!dementor acting changes things, then I'd assume no, it's not widely known.\\
The wizarding world is pretty racist after all, but even if they weren't, most people would assume that the grief-causing, scary black hooded figure that sucks people's souls out is an evil thing.\\

Maybe in this scenario, if Dumbledore is aware that dementors are actually fairly benign, perhaps that's why he would be tolerant of having them at Hogwarts in third year. Having soul-sucking monsters around to keep a mere murderer away doesn't make much sense otherwise...
