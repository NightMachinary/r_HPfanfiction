Dementors aren't really well-explained in canon, because their description contradicts what they actually seem to do. It is CLAIMED that they suck the happiness out of people and steal their happy thoughts and emotions, but what we SEE happening is that they appear to draw all of your bad memories to the surface. Are they feeding on happy memories or bad ones? Are they feeding on the EMOTIONS, or the memories themselves?

If Dementors worked exactly the way we are told they do, then people being attacked by them would logically become euphoric, dazed and overwhelmed by all of the positive and happy memories that are being drawn up out of them. They would only become depressed and emotionally destroyed after being heavily preyed upon.

I suspect this is mostly Rowling not doing a good job of explaining things and also probably not fully thinking about the consequences of what a Dementor attack would actually look like. But the apparent problems with Dementors has caused some authors to speculate that what they're actually doing isn't really what we are TOLD they are doing, so the option is definitely there to tweak them. Presumably what they are actually doing to people is lost or distorted knowledge.
