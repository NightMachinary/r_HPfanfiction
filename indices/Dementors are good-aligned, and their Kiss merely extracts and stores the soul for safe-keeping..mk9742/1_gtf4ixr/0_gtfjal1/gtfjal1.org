The way I take it is that there is no “drawing up” of memories. They feed on (and thus suppress, maybe flat out take for long term exposure) your happiness and happy memories. With those suppressed or missing, your bad memories are more prominent.

TLDR: I believe that their aura isn't one of sorrow, it's one of no happiness and thus it /seems/ sorrowful.
