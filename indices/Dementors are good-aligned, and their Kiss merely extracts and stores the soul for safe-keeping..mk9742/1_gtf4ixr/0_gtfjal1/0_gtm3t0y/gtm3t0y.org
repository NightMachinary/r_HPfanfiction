I cannot possibly imagine why you would believe their aura is merely a "no happiness" zone. Harry ACTIVELY hears his parents being murdered when a Dementor draws near. Other people also seem to be overcome with despair or experience various kinds of audible hallucinations. If a Dementor was merely a "no happiness" existence then somebody could sit next to one on a train doing a crossword and be perfectly fine. A no happiness creature wouldn't be water-boarding you with your worst memories.
