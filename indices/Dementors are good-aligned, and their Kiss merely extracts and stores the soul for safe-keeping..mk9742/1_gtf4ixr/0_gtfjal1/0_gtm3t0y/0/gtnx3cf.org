I know that the logic isn't airtight. It doesn't have to be since, /magic/ and /headcanon/. I'll try to rephrase what reasoning I do have though.

I think that the reliving of horrible memories isn't caused by the dementors directly, it's more of a side effect. As the dementor feeds on happy memories and emotions, their opposites become relatively. For those people that have /really/ negative memories, that is overwhelming. So, with this headcanon. Harry doesn't hear his parents being murdered because the dementor draws up the memory, it's because he temporarily can't remember anything positive to take it's place.
