There is one I'd probably call my absolute favorite: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). linkffn(The Skitterleap) is also pretty good.

For AUs that follow canon a bit more closely, or are point of departure fics I recommend: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; What You Leave Behind; Forging the Sword; By the Divining Light; Conloadh's Song; Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone).

For outside Britain, there are the Alexandra Quick stories set in North America in, I think, mid-2000s early 2010s: First is linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

I'm sure I will think of more later.
