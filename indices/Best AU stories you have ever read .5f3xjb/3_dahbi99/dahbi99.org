Well, almost al of the stories I read are AU, so could you give a few more qualifiers? Slash or Het or No Pairing? Character of focus? Total AU (canon characters in medieval times, or the muggle world, or whatnot) or divergence (what if Snape hadn't joined the Dark Lord, what if the Potters' had survived, what if Harry was a Slytherin)? Time frame (Riddle Era, Marauders Era, Trio Era)? Etc etc.

I just had an "I read WAY too much FanFiction" moment...
