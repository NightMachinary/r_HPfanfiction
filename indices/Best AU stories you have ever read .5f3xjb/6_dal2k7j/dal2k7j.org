I think my favorite AU ever (and it is /very/ AU, which I honestly don't typically enjoy...but this one is amazing) is Runaway Love by WhtChoc. It's a Marauder's AU, but there's no magic...I think the reason I like it is that it does something very different with the characters, but at the same time those characters still /feel/ like they aren't completely OOC.
