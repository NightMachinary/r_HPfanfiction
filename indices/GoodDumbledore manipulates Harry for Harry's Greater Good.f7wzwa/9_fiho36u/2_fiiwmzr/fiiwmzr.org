'Making the most sense' is a bit too strong IMO - narratively in the books, I don't get that impression myself, and it'll at least be up to personal taste.

She can be made to make sense, of course - and it's not /wrong/ to have Ginny as the pairing for Harry. At the same time, she's also not the only choice, and there's a lot of people who would disagree with her as the most logical choice as you seem to portray her.
