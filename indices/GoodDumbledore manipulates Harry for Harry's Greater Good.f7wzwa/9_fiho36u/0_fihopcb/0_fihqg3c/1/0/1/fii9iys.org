lmao that's fair

Still, I didn't say "about half" out of nowhere, I remember there was someone who actually counted how many times Harry commented on someone's physical attractiveness and it was about half toward boys, half toward girls. Now, of course that could just be JK Rowling's own opinions showing through, or aesthetic attraction, but it stands.
