Oh no. I can definetly see the spark between them. I am simply refering to the personal spark. Let me explain.

I first watch the movies before reading the books. So the scene in which Harry and Hermione dance was always stuck in my mind. It was my favorite scene and I wholeheartedly believe they should have ended together. So I read all the books with the mentality that Harry should have ended up with Hermione and it stuck. I did not supported Harry being with Ginny for this reason.

So I do not see that spark between them. On the other hand, I read this fic that has Harry and Daphne Greengrass being together. It was so beautiful written with a great plot, character development, and romance that I "saw" the spark between them even though they do not even interact in canon.

I hope I explained myself properly. If not...have an upvote!
