Yeah, the movies go a long way towards ruining that. But they're both jocks who love to fight. Neither is particularly sensitive or emotional, in fact both are rather blunt and sarcastic. Remember that in the books, Ginny is described as beautiful and it's intimated that she has large breasts. Which, well, Harry is a teenage boy.

Movie Ginny looks nothing like Book Ginny, just like the Movie Hermione looks nothing like plain faced Book Hermione.

But the spark was definitely there. When Harry started getting interested in her, it was pure lust. That's really what 'spark' is in the end. That passionate ignition.
