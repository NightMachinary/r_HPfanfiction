AU where Dumbledore is always just trying to make things fun and exciting for Harry but bad things just keep happening.

--------------

"I'll make Hagrid a professor, they'll love that!

...fuck, it's only been one day and they're planning a Hipogriff execution."

--------------

"Heck yeah, I managed to get the tri-wizard tournament at our school! Harry's gonna love it. He won't be thinking about Voldemort or his troubles with the Dursleys when he's too busy having fun with his pals watching the games!

....okay cool, he's in mortal danger again. Because of a cup. Great."

--------------

"Okay, I know all this Horcrux stuff I've been working on is really gonna bum Harry out after last year. Maybe I'll just try not to intervene for once and see what happens...

...oh his favourite family member is dead? Amazing. Just so, so cool."

--------------

"Alright, I'll just be real with him for once like he asked. And in the meantime I'll get a fun old potions professor he'll be sure to like and give Snape the Defense against the Dark Arts job he wants so he'll be nicer to Harry. That'll be great. What could possibly go wrong?"
