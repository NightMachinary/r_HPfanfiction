I gave Blaise just an example of Harry making friends outside of his usual circle. Is Blaise a canon bigot? I can't remember. I mentioned him because I have read some fics that give him a proper background and is either a suave rich kid or someone that tries to escape his mother's reputation.

The point is Dumbledore wants Harry to have good friends that could be useful in the future.
