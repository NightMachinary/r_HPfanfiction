You certainly don't have to abide by canon in fanfiction, yes. That said the prompt is missing an adjective of "good" or "changed" before Blaise Zabini. If you're providing a prompt, the default basis should be canon. It's Harry Potter fanfiction, after all. It is speculative hence why I used the word "likely". It is proven that his mother married many men who then died mysteriously.

Good fanfiction should certainly not be a canon rehash. But god forbid detailing the changes you would like made to canon for the purposes of a prompt because as we all know, Blaise Zabini is one of the good slytherins along with the Ice Queen.
