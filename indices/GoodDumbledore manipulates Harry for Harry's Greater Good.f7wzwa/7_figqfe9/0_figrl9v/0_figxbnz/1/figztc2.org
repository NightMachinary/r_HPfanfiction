Its one of the things that I love of Fanfiction. Side characters can be more deeply explored giving the canon world more life. Like Daphne Greengrass. I think she is mentioned once or twice in the books but she has become one of my favorite characters thanks to the fandom.

I do not like Malfoy one bit in canon but in the fic Novocaine by StardustWarrior2991, I really like what the author did with him. He shows personal growth from his 'My father will hear of this' to a more independent actions on his own and creating a life outside his father's influence and expectations.

I really hope authors will continue to add to the fandom to keep the world of Harry Potter alive and not stagnant.
