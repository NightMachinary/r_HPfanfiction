Canon blaise was at least a coward. Likely a bigot. However he has no real characterization. So its likely you could alter his trajectory with early intervention. Also, his mother killing her husbands is not proven canon, but speculative. A fanfic writer could write it as a woman just extremely unlucky in love, or she was cursed.

I dislike when people feel like they have to abide by canon entirely. You can justify sweeping changes by using the butterfly effect. Or by showing moral progression of a character facing facts and learning against his bigotry. Look at Draco Malfoy in Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel. Its so dumb how people want to lock in characters to their canon mindset. As if you come across a child in real life who was raised to be racist, and he cant change.

This is a fandom you can change and tweak the very foundation of the universe. You can expand upon magic, invent branches of study. But god forbid you change a canon character or expand upon them from what we are given in canon.
