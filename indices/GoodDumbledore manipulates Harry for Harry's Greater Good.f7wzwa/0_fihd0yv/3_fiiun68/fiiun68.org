Kinda depends on the cultural context that the WW is portrayed as, and how binding it is. Eg, making it very old fashioned like medieval/early modern nobility (ie, lots of arranged marriages and betrothals) and being able to be broken to an extent, it's much more acceptable.

But yeah, presenting it as a /good/ thing is usually a bad idea :|
