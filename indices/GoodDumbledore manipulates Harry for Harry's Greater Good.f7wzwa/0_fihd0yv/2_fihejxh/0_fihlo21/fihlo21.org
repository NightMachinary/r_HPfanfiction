If there's not consent from both parties in the contract, it's simply not acceptable to me.

I mean, it might be fine for Fanfiction, I don't really give a damn if you like marriage law fics - read and write whatever floats your boat!

But if you're writing a truly good Dumbledore, I'd personally stay away from marriage contracts that don't involve consent.
