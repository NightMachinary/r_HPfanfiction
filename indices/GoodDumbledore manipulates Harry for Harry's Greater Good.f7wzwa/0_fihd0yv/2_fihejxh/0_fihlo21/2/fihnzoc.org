I am sorry if I offended you. I did not meant to imply that consent was not necessary in any relationship. Any marriage contract made for the sake of money and 'purity' is wrong and should not exist.

Rape is a horrible thing, but I am not refering to an ironclad contract that forces two people to have sex whether they want to or not. I meant a contract that is about MARRIAGE. I am refering to the marriage contract in which both parties love one another and simply make the contract because they want to.

Anyway, the marriage contract example can be completely ignored. It is afterall just an example. I am looking for fics in which Dumbledore manipulates the world for Harry's greater good.
