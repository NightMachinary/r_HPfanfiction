  If there's not consent from both parties in the contract, it's simply not acceptable to me.

If there's not consent from both parties in the contract, it's /not a bloody contract/. If there's not consent from both parties to the marriage contracted for, the marriage isn't valid and therefore doesn't count as performance under the contract.

So, so, so, so, so many marriage contract fics are written by people who probably don't understand what contracts are and /definitely/ don't understand what marriages are.
