May be true of legal contracts in modern real life for the most part but from I've seen from fics, "Marriage Contracts" are typically contracts made by guardians to arrange marriages between their wards, usually without the consent of the ward. Arranged marriages definitely existed in the past and still exist to an extent in the world now. "Marriage Contracts" may be a bit of a misnomer, but arranged marriages are definitely a thing.

There's even canonical evidence that indicates that contracts (in the HP world) may not require consent on the part of all parties. Harry was placed into a binding magical contract by the Goblet of Fire. Of course that may be different because it was a magical artifact and we don't see much elsewhere on contracts in the magical world.
