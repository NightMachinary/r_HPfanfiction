It does not have to be that way. I remember reading a Marriage Contract fic in which neither Harry or the girl wanted to be in it because they were rivals and 'hated' each other but everytime one was in trouble the other was quick to help or beat everyone senseless to protect them. Their parents or guardians agree to put them in a marriage contract and they were happily ever after. I just can't remember the name. Which is why I added it to the examples.

Anyway, it was just an example in how Dumbledore could manipulate the world around Harry to help him have a happy life.
