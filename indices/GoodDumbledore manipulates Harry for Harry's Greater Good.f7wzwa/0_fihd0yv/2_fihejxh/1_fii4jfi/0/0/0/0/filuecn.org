I was thinking of one where Harry and Daphne were caught up in a marriage contract from the past. It was written several generations back that if two first born of both families fit these really specific circumstances it would trigger the contract. Somehow they triggered it and the goblins sent out a notice. They go from Gryffindor vs Slytherin to being forced together to actually loving each other.
