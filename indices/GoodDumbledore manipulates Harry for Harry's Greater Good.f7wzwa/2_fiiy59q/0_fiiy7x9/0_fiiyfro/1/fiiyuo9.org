I am not understanding what you are trying to say.

What I am looking for is a Dumbledore that cares about Harry, so he uses his positions of power to facilitate Harry's life. Even though he has to kill Voldemort, Dumbledore wants Harry to survive and not be sacrificed like a lamb, so he subtlety prepares and trains Harry.

I am not confusing manipulation with love.
