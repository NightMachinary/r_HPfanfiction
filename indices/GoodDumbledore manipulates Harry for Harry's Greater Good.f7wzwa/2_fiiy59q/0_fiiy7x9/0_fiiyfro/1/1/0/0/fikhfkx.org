Oh, I'm less saying this for you, and more for others reading. It's not something we should be teaching others and acting as though it's "goodness", it's not.

Hey, lurkers, it's fine to indulge in stories like this if you like the conflict of it, but lets keep in mind that if someone is ever manipulating you because "they know best" and "they love you", realise it's a form of abuse, and shouldn't be seen in a positive light. Xx
