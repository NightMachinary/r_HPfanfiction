Number one, age wasn't mentioned for said prompt, so that's a moot point.

Number two, "informed" is the part that matters for children. You don't own children. They are not your property, despite people being under the power trip and acting as if they are.

Your job is to teach them how to handle the world, not puppeteer them.

"Because I said so" is not valid, and not only that, using forms of manipulation on them rather than explaining the situation and reasons for outcome, teaches them that it's okay in adulthood.

So yes, any way in which you spin it, some aspect of this is part of a valid critera. Although I may joke, I'm not going to go to my child and say "you have to do ___ because I said so, you have no place to challenge me, end of discussion." I'm going to go "it's important that you do ___, and xyz are the reasons why."

That's, you know, how people learn?
