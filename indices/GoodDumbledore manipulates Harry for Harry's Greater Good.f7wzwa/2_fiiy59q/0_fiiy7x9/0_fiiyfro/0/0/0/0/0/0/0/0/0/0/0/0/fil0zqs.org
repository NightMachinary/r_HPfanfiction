Making investments with money that is not yours is absolutely not morally justified.

My daughter gets backpay from SSI for being special needs. I had to put that backpay in a special account for her, in her name, and am not allowed to touch it unless it's needed for her disability, or an emergency where she may go without food or shelter-- putting her in direct danger.

There's a reason I would be financially responsible for spending that money on stocks and shares or some other form of investment.

/It's not my money./ It's *her* money. It's my job to give her a stable home where she is free from physical and mental abuse, shelter, clothing, and food. It is my job to prepare her for the world in which she will eventually need to manage herself. It is not my job to choose how money that is her's needs to be spent. To think it is, is egotistical and controlling.

Additionally, it is not moral to purposely put a child in a position where you know he will be bullied by an adult, just to get the outcome YOU would like. The fact that you think that's not morally questionable makes me worry for your children.

Requesting such stories, as I've said many times, is 200% fine. My issue, is classifying "manipulation" as "love". Many people get abused because they confused obsession and manipulation with love, it's something we need a clear understanding that these things are not the same.
