There's no lying or lack of scruples in actions like a trustee making sound investments that increase the trust size, as the OP suggested. Nor is it necessarily unscrupulous for a headmaster to put pressure on one of his teachers whom he knows might be prejudiced, to make that teacher do a better job. Encouraging politically useful friendships, well, that depends on how it's done; there are plenty of ways an author might depict it that are legitimate.

So, maybe the OP's request is fine, except you'd rather he hadn't referred to the proposed actions as manipulation?
