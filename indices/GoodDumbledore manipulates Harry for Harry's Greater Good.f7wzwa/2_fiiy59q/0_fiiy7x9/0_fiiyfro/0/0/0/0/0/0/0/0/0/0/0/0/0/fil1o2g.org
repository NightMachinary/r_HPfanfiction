Actually, it's normal and legal for trustees to invest the contents of the trust, so long as they don't have conflicts of interest like investing in their own companies; just ask Google "can trustees invest?". And many fics make Dumbledore Harry's guardian in some fashion - after all, he had Harry's vault key - so it's quite plausible that he was legally justified in acting as a trustee.

The OP didn't request bullying, he requested something like Snape putting pressure on Harry to do well. Bullying is what happened in canon and was not aimed at helping Harry succeed. Reading a variation on it where Snape is still harsh, and still prejudiced, but is being made to rein himself in and actually do his best to teach, could be quite interesting.
