Where do you draw the line between manipulating someone for their benefit, and trying to help them?

If one of my children is getting upset, and I keep my voice soft because I know it's more likely to get through to them and result in a good outcome, then I'm attempting to steer their actions, without telling them I'm doing it. Is that manipulative? Is it wrong?
