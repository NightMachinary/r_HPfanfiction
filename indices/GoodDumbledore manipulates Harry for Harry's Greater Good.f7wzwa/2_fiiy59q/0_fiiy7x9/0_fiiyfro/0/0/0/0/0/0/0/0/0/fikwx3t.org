So... If I read bedtime stories to my children because I've heard that statistically that's associated with being better adjusted later in life, then I'm being evil, unless I sit down with my toddler and explain that we're going to read a story to help them be happier as a teenager?

Sometimes it's ok to just help someone out without them realising you're doing it. Especially if it's someone in your care.
