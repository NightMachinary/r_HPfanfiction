That is true, and the wizarding world may work differently, but I was more referencing the law as an example for the morality of it.

Investing has risks. If someone gives my daughter a million dollars, and I take a chance at investing it, I'm also taking a chance at losing it all. I'm (not as seriously, but still) gambling with money that isn't mine.

My grandmother set up an account for me when I turned five for college. My mother spent it, going down to Florida for a job interview which paid well, intending to return the money to my account.

She didn't get the job. I didn't have college paid for.

Morally, investing is only seen as "good" as long as something comes from it. But, let's be real here... many, many times investing can lead to nothing.

So, is it morally justified to spend your child's money? I would claim that, in most cases, no.

Look, I just want everyone to be happy and free from abuse, and I genuinely worry when people confuse love with things like manipulation. Hell, I have confused it with love at one point in my lifetime, and it can lead to extreme ramifications that I hope no one ever experiences.
