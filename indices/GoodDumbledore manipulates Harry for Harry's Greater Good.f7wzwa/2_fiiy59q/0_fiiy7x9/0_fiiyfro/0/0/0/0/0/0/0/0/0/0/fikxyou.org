The whataboutisms are strong with you, and I can see that no matter how many times I explain this concept to you, you're going to come up with something new to try and make a false equivalency.

Reading a book is not manipulation.

Manipulation - the action of manipulating someone in a clever or unscrupulous way.

Unscrupulous - having or showing no moral principles; not honest or fair.

In what way is reading a book showing no moral principals? It's not, because you're using the term "manipulation" towards things that are not manipulation in order to try and get me to swallow your justification.

Social interactions are nuanced. If you're lying to someone in order to get someone to do something, that's manipulation due to the fact that you are breaking a moral code to do what you want.

If you are just reading a book to a child, you're not lying or breaking any ethics by not offering every bit of information upfront. There are no negative rammifications of doing such without informing them why.

And, as has been your MO thusfar, I'm sure you're going to come up with another whataboutism to try and contest this, but I really need you to understand something, as I'm done explaining it:

Lying to someone, or potentially compramising someone's mental health or wellbeing, in order to get what you want, is not "helping". It's manipuating, and manipulation is not love. Just as obsession is not love, rape is not love, and compromising someone's right to their own life is not love.
