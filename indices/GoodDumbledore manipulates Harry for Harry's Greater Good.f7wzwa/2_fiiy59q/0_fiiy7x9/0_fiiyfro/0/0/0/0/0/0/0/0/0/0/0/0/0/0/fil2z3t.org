Actually, it's not legal to invest it, as I'm personally a trustee and have asked if it were possible to invest and was given a firm "no".

And, since you mentioned google...

#+begin_quote
  Trust fund assets may be invested *only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.*
#+end_quote

In which, you would need the government permission, and it would need to be shown that your beneficiary /needs/ the investment to survive or thrive.

Harry's vault was, in canon, not used to even support him. As far as we know, the Dudleys took on the entirety of financial support. Now, we can obviously play with this with fanfiction, but in terms of argument, this would be an entire fan-made issue.

Would I argue that some of OPs requests are indeed, not manipulation? Yes. But there are some that, if not flat out manipulation, are teetering that edge.

My whole point is that the romanticism of manipulation doesn't sit well with me. Seeking out fics where Dumbledore is a kind and caring guardian to Harry, fine. Seeking out fics where Dumbledore is teetering the edge of morally justifiable acts and pronouncing it "love" isn't so healthy.

I actually enjoy very dark (psychologically dark) stories that make you explore these themes, but to write them as something good and acceptable isn't healthy.

I've read marriage law where it's very apparent that the entire ordeal is fucked up, and I've also read marriage law where the marriage ended up happy in the end, so the morality of the law isnt even worried about.

Guess which ones i'll recommend others to read?
