It's... it's less actually manipulating Harry into doing what he wants (which would be bad) and more manipulating (as in, planning) events around him so Harry gets to have a better life (which is kind).

Bad: I'll make sure Harry meets Ron Weasley on the train so I can use Ron to spy on his life, mwahaha >:)

Kind: I'll make sure Harry meets Ron Weasley on the train, because I think they'll be friends and good for each other :)
