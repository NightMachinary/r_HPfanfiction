I'm afraid such Dumbledores are exceedingly rare. There's only one fic I can think of, and you have to put up with Harry/Ginny too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877). How this Dumbledore weaponizes Alchemy and manipulates those young people is a little scary.
