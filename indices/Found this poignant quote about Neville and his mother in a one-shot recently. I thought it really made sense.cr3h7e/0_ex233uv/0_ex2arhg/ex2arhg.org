I don't know why but your comment reminded me of something that Robin Williams once said on the Graham Norton Show -

"Let him have his dreams. Don't you screw up his dreams! His feet are big too, let him dream!"

This YouTube clip provides the context - it's pretty hilarious and yet a weirdly appropriate reply to your comment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

God, I miss Robin so much.
