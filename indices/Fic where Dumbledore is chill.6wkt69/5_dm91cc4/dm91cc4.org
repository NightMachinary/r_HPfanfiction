There's certainly more than a few. The times when he's not is when the fic is about Harry or whoever doing their own thing independently of Dumbledore where his interests conflict with Dumbledore's. And that does appear very frequently since fanfiction usually diverges from canon, and in the canon Dumbledore's plan is more or less exactly carried out by Harry and everything works more or less perfectly.

But Dumbledore is especially an antagonist where there is time or dimension travel because Harry and co are on the look out for him. I'd say that the best example of this where Dumbledore is very chill and on their side is linkffn(Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always).
