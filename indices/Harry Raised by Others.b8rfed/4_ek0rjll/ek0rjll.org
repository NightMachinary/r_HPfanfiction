Here are some lesser known ones on AO3.

- *the dogfather* by Hollimichele. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487]]) - Upon finding him at their doorstep, the Dursleys surrender Harry to the police and he is adopted by a loving Muggle couple who've been wanting a child for years. With no blood protection, Death Eaters track the Dursleys down off-screen and possibly torture and murder them. Sirius reads the headlines of the Dursleys demise and breaks out of Azkaban earlier than canon to find Harry. The rest is a wonderfully fluffy fic that manages to tackle the first year in fewer words than The Philosopher's Stone (this is quite the achievement when you check the word count on many canon re-writes of first year fics). This version of Harry raised in a loving home has basically spoiled me off most of the edgy fics that push his childhood abuse up to 11 for cheap gravitas.

- *The Phoenix Burns Brightest* by AnyaYanko. WIP. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]]) - A new fic that got updated just a few days ago. Harry's first burst of accidental magic happens at four and apparates him miles away from Surrey. The muggle police are called to investigate, Dumbledore comes to check up and he's horrified at how the Dursleys are treating Harry. He takes Harry and raises him himself in seclusion, temporarily stepping down from all his positions. It's very promising, the author has made it to the Diagon Alley shopping scene quickly, always a good sign for a WIP fic that's rewriting first year. This Harry is brighter than canon, having been raised by Dumbledore himself. He's confident, thoughtful and loves his father figure dearly and Dumbledore loves him just as much or more. There's foreshadowing throughout about the troubles to come, and that makes the fluff all the sweeter IMHO.

The next ones have Mature or Explicit ratings on some of their fics, but are long series and the explicit scenes are normally between his caretakers or between Harry and his love interest when they are in their late teens. I'm including them more for other people reading this thread, because I think they're quite excellent fics.

- *Stealing Harryverse* series by copperbadge. Abandoned in the Middle of 3rd Year. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991387;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991389;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991396;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991398;https://archiveofourown.org/works/991401;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992265;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992288;https://archiveofourown.org/works/992558;https://archiveofourown.org/works/993712;https://archiveofourown.org/works/994963;https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000039]]). Sirius and Remus steal Harry from the Dursleys, against Dumbledore's wishes. They raise Harry and the story takes us through the first three books with some quite marvelous changes to canon that I wish had been more popular in the fanfic community. One particular idea the author has is that an adult accompanies Harry through his end-of-year adventures, and the adult is the one doing the heavy lifting bringing Harry along only because he has a certain skill needed (eg Parseltongue to open the Chamber, etc). So Harry gets to be the hero but the adults don't look like shit for abandoning him either. I think the author planned for 4th year, as Harry's loss of innocence, the adult helping him on that adventure would die. Such a loss that the author lost interest midway through the 3rd year. Wolfstar slash pairing is the main source of the explicit scenes.

- *The secret language of plants* series by Endrina. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225;https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138;https://archiveofourown.org/works/10181825;https://archiveofourown.org/works/12821004]]) This series is fucking brilliant and really should be better known on this sub IMHO. Snape takes Harry from the Dursleys and tracks down Remus to raise him. Eventual slash Severus/Remus happens. Harry is given a loving childhood for a few years until the Ministry raids their little home while Snape is away. Remus is subdued like an animal and Harry is ripped away from his parents traumatically and forced to stay with the Dursleys. This trauma changes his magic, he hates Hogwarts and all the teachers, and refuses to do magic in class unless forced. From such a sad start comes some amazing ideas I've never seen anywhere else in the fandom. The Slytherin students set off socialist, feminist and other agenda revolutions in Hogwarts all on the same night, Harry learns how to break all of Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration while dancing with his WalkMan, and Seamus shows Voldemort why there's no snakes in Ireland. Eventual Harry/Draco, but this Draco read the writings of Karl Marx and realized that "house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights." so he's cool.
