There are lots â€˜Harry raised by others' fics, the trick is however to find one that also has an original plot. Too many such promising fics end up regurgitating canon plot rails, which gets really boring after a few hundred times.

That being said, I do have a selected few fics that has Harry being raised by someone else and has an original plot:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry is blind and raised by good Dursleys. He never went to Hogwarts, but he gains some serious powers later on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Grindelwald had raised him for several years. He shows up at Hogwarts for several months in Year 7 and left with Ginevra. Very unique ending.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and an BAMF archeologist. She, not Harry, is the true hero in defeating Voldemort. The interesting part about her characterization is that she's very much recognizable as her canon version.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry becomes a cat animagus at a very young age, runs away, and is taken in by the Grangers. This story still follows canon too closely for my taste, but its sequels, linkffn(12088294;12076644), are entering completely new territory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): A very unique Harry raised by Umbridge fic!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Finally, a Harry raised by Sirius. This is a major AU in which a more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore had to evacuate his remaining followers to France. Harry and the Weasleys thus all went to Beauxbatons. After 18 years, they are ready for their revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhart found Harry on that doorstep and took him in. This Harry is very cunning, and Year 1 ends very differently than in canon.
