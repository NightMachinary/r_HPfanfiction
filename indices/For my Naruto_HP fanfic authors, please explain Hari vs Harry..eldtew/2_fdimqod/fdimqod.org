Hi, (this is completely unrelated to your question, but it's always bothered me) just wanna say that Japanese names don't work like English names. Their names have meanings and "Hari" isn't a Japanese name, if Harry was raised in any Japanese enviroment his name would be different. "Hari" literally means needle. So, don't make "Hari" be a thing cause it literally makes no sense.
