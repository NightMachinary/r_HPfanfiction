The A's are completely different. The one in Hari would be pronounced kinda like "mama" mixed with "Hah" like a sigh. The A in Harry is pronounced like "Hay" or "Day". And the l/r difference adds to it as well obviously.

For a real life example, my name is Arabic and even when I tell people how to say it, they usually say it wrong because they can't hear the difference. Much like the r/l thing, there are sounds in it that are unpronounceable to most English speakers. If I tried to explain the difference between the actual and English pronounciations to you, you probably wouldn't understand, but to me, a native speaker, someone fucking up my name sounds like they're saying something completely different.
