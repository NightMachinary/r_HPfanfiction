The A in Harry is not the same A in Day or Hay though. It's closer to being the A in mama if that's the example you want to stick with.

And, I'm Nigerian and my name is never said right by anyone who's not a Nigerian and specifically from my tribe. I make allowances for it because I understand some tongues can't wrap around it.

And after reading someone's earlier post and seeing that the difference in pronunciations isn't so big, I have to conclude that the stressing of saying Hari in Japanese crossover fics seems kind of pointless when they are practically near the same in British English. And yet the other characters don't pick on Hari for saying their name differently. I guess my main gripe is that Hari seems like a douchebag every time he corrects someone on his first name and yet when they say Potter, he's silent. It sounds like the author is just using pronunciation as a way of making Hari seem....edgy?
