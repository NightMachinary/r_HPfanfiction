The A in Harry is pronounced nothing like mama lmao. The English pronounciation is Hay-ree. The Japanese word Hari is pronounced very differently, (Hah-/r/ee) like I and many other people have said.

And yeah, the author was probably doing it to sound edgy, but in a timeline where Harry grew up speaking Japanese in a place where everyone else also spoke Japanese, I can see him having problems with how English people pronounce his name the same way some of my irl expat & immigrant friends/relatives do. Keeping Potter as a last name is pretty dumb though anyway.
