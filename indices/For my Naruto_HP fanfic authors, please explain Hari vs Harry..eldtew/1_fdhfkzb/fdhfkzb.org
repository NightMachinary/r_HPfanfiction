There's a big difference between an English 'R' and a Japanese 'R' - it's more a cross between R and L. It's instantly obvious if someone I'm talking to has watched the sub or dub of an anime because of the way they say the character's names. I find it entirely unsurprising that Hogwarts students would default to an English 'R' even if they did get the 'ah' vs 'ah' correctly.

I wouldn't say the difference is harsh, but it is very noticeable.
