I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), does a reasonably good job in having Harry developing a business empire, and it's a key plot element. This Harry had spent several years in the Starwars Universe while the time in his original universe passed far more slowly, so he gained a significant competitive advantage when putting SW technologies against those puny Earthly ones.

In its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), he, Hermione, and Luna ended up in the Stargate Universe. Despite them possessing both Force and Magical powers, they still faced an uphill battle, as Goa'ulds and Ori were more than a match for them.
