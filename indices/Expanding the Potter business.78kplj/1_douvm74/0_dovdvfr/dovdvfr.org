On the other hand, very few time travels exploit the option of making a killing in Muggle financial markets.

The only ones I know are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855;10871795). Even then those actions are only marginally mentioned.

I made a thread about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t1jum/hermione_was_thrown_back_25_years_to_1976_what/][Hermione time travel to the 70s]] a few months ago. Apart from all the actions she could take against Voldemort directly in Britain, she could also settle in the US and play the financial markets there. This way she would have minimized her impacts on Magical Britain and let events there play out in a more expected fashion, while building a massive private army using some of her profits in America. She might as well create a new reputation as the “Dark Lady of Harvard”.
