I use [[http://zim-wiki.org/][zim desktop wiki]]. I write out ideas in it then make a page for each fict. Each of those pages have subpages on backstories, timeline, rough and refined outlines, terms I may use [AU ficts are murder!] and random inspiration. It's easy to set up, use, and it's portable and small so you can take it anywhere. Available on linux and windows [not sure about mac though].

I used to do the one doc thing [I still do for original work because it's usually collabs and those are easier to maintain in one document] but really it get's annoying when you ahve twenty pages of plans and no content. AGH
