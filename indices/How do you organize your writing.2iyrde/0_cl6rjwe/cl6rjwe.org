Generally speaking I'll have:

a) A planning document

b) A separate document for each chapter of the fic (they need to be separate docs to upload to FF.Net anyway)

c) A master doc which is all the planning and all the chapters, which acts as a back-up.

I tried the single doc approach with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]], planning and writing all the chapters in a single large document, and by the end of the fic it was getting ridiculous. The document (on Google Docs) was taking ages to load up fully.
