I use Google docs as well with multiple files for planning, character descriptions, chapters, and helpful information such as British slang, spells, and other reference material. Then there's an idea mapping app I use called Simplemind to see the bigger picture, which saves in the cloud like docs.

It's really nice never having to worry about saving files or losing anything.
