One overarching folder (fiction), subfolders (the fiction)

If I ever write more than 10 fics I'll make subfolders for each series I've written for and move my current subfolders into the new ones, a la the fanfiction.net organization.

Which I have saved on dropbox so I can work on it from anywhere.
