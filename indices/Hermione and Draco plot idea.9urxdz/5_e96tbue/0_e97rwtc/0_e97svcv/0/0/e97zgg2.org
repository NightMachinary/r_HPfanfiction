I only said that OCs should be named accordingly. Of course, you're free to write about a florist in Kings Cross Station who's in love with Mrs Figg, but please don't call him Tom Riddle, or even Voldemort.

It bores me to death when the main idea for a fic consists of turning canon characters into their opposites.
