Draco fought for his Dark Lord till the very end, he tried to capture Harry for him during the Battle of Hogwarts and reassured a Death Eater that he's on his side. This doesn't sound like a redeeming story to me.

However, I'm not surprised that Draco's is considered a redeemable. Nowadays criminals and rapists are being pitied while their victims are mocked and laughed at. So that fits very well.
