I was told by this sub that Draco is "redeemed" in canon despite never really coming across as such or facing the consequences of his actions. And frankly, I find any postwar story with him in unbelievable (he belongs into prison for war crimes, using unforgivables and treason for one), so I thought about finding a way in which you could take canon Draco (first year in this case) and write a story in which he is slowly steered away from pureblood supremacy. But if you are willing to argue that he is irredeemably evil, well, I won't argue against that.
