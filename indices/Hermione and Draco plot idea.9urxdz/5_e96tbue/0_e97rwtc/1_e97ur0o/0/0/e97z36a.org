Again, I'm not saying that he should be open about it. That's why, in my proposal, he'd act like a stalker. And even after getting a truce with Hermione, he'd want to keep things secret, afraid of the consequences. When Hermione tells Harry, he is scared shitless. When he begins to develop feelings for Hermione, he is scared, scared of his father, but even more scared of himself. He should not be doing this, should not feel that way.

(Perhaps ironically that Hermione, his kryptonite, would be the one to eventually break him out of his shell).

Also, Draco is a coward with a sense of self preservation. The Basilisk could be used to break his father's hold (he unleaded that while I was in Hogwarts?), or the Sirius episode (this is how Death Eaters are treated? They have to endure THESE MONSTERS?)
