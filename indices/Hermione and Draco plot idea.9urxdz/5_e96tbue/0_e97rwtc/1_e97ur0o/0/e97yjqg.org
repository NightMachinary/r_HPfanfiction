One of Malfoy's main features is his cowardice, it would make it impossible for him to break away from his father. His complete worldview is based on the protection of his father. Malfoy would never give up this protection. He'd never been seen without his cronies, who'd use their fists to protect him. He'd lose this protection if he would turn against his father.

Don't get me wrong, of course, you are free to write what you want.
