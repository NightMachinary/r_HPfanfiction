Now, it is no secret that I have a higher opinion of a stranger's bowel movements than of Malfoy.

Your idea is one of few ways I can see a Hermione and Draco relationship actually happen IF the Mudblood and Buckbeak incidents do NOT happen.

The ideal approach here would be for Draco to question things after his first year. If Muggleborns are inferior, why is the top student Muggleborn? Why was the Dark Lord defeated by either a Muggleborn or a Halfblood? So he asks his mother, who points out that it is just a lot of BS, quoting her niece (Tonks) as an example. Halfblood and yet the only known metamorph.

So Malfoy thinks some more and decides to keep an eye out during the next year. He watches Hermione in class, gets a list of the books she checks out in the library and so on. Throughout his stalker episode, he realises that Hermione is not nearly as bad as he imagined. Still an annoying know-it-all, but not magical trash as his father insists.

At the end of the year, he talks to his mother again, who is only glad to nudge her son away from militant pureblood supremacy. Maybe she introduces him to the Tonks, or takes him to Heathrow, just anything to prove that you don't need a pure lineage to achieve something in life.

At some point, Draco tentatively reaches out to Hermione, they strike a truce. They talk in the library, become friends, yadda yadda. At some point, Hermione tells Harry, who is more than a little confused and remains sceptical for quite some time but does not throw a tantrum.

It would be important to show some of the old Malfoy as well, the easiest option here would be a feud with the Weasleys. Maybe even go for some Marauder age parallel where Hermione ends up defending Malfoy when the twins cross the line with a prank or something like that (just without the Mudblood part).
