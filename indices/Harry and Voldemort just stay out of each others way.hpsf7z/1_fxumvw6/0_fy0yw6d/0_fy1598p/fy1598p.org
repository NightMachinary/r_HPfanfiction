In DH, Hermione, who has read the book, explains that the 1st chapter about making an Horcruxe focus on the importance to create a suitable receptacle for the soul. The diary and the locket are not resistant to damages because they are Horcruxe, but because Voldemort enchanted them to be nearly indestructible before putting part of his soul inside.

Since Harry is a living being who never received any of these enchantments, his body is no different from any other wizard his age (outside of the whole "blood burns enemies thing).
