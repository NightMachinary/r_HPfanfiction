Early in the first book, there's a line where Pansy Parkinson is taunting Parvati for sticking up for Neville and says, "Never thought /you'd/ like fat little crybabies, Parvati", which to me kind of suggests that they knew each other before Hogwarts. It's not much of a leap to conclude that the Patils are purebloods themselves, given how snobbish Pansy seems to be. Fanon has been built on less, at least.
