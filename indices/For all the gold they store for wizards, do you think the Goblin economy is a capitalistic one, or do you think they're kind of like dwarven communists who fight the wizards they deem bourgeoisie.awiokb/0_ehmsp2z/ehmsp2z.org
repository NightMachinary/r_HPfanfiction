Why would human social conventions apply to a non-human species? Their idea of property rights and ownership has nothing to do with the modern UK legal system, muggle or wizard.

If you look at Discworld's worldbuilding, the species closest to HP's goblins, the dwarfs, are greedy buggers who hoard gold so they can return their parents' investment in raising them to adulthood. After they have earned enough to "free" themselves, they can then leave home, enjoy whatever hobbies or interests they like, and marry out of their own choice. It's a cultural thing.

From the outside, humans only see greedy short folks who love the shinies.
