in Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone they are pretty communist. You can only own the artifacts you yourself made; everything that's not artisanal is produced collectively, and after someone diew, everything they owned goes to communal ownership. Only trifles of sentimental value are inherited. Their position on ownership is also why they are angry at humans keeping goblin - made artifacts, insisting that they can only rent them. Great fic, but abandoned. linkffn(6769957)
