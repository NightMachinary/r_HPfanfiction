Communism does not produce growth and in the long run will probably not work due to their 'clever nature'.

Due to their clever nature, Communism will probably incentivize goblins to not work hard and that is ultimately bad to a society.

Any creature that practices rational self interest, such as a goblin, will prefer the nature of capitalism then communism as growth is correlated with effort.
