  why not a flying invisible tank
#+end_quote

Getting a tank won't be easy. In 91 or 92, the Warsaw pact surpluses were just starting to be sold. It would require a hefty sum and despite my misgivings about Arthur, I don't see him counterfeiting money with magic or condunding Muggles for his pleasure. And the Soviet equipment was made with small (1.65m) tankers in mind, so it might not be the best choice for the Weasleys.

Operating a tank is also rather difficult work. Unless it is an Strv-103, you'd need a few people to operate it. You can automate loading and forgo the radio operator, but if you want efficiency, you need separate drivers, commanders and gunners and other than the S tank, you cannot unify that into one position. And I don't think that Sweden was selling its stock of those. Driving it is also more difficult than a car due to the size and limited visibility. Trying to steer a flying object through a few vision ports is suicide.

And frankly, a flying tank is kinda pointless since only the front is properly armoured. The bottom is barely able to resist mines if you are lucky. Certainly not what you want to expose by flying. You'd be better off shrinking an artillery piece or an anti tank gun and flying that around in your pocket on a broom.
