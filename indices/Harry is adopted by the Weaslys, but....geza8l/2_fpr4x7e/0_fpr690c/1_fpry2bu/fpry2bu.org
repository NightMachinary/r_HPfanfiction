You see you're forgetting something with your logic here though, the most important thing, and the only rule that matters.

The Rule of Cool.

Wear some flight goggles, ride with the hatch opened, and you can drive/fly a tank just as efficiently as a car.

Even the bottom of a tank is bulletproof, and going by the feats of canon, the blasring charms we see are about as strong as hand grenades, if that.

A T-55 is basically an "I win" button for the story.
