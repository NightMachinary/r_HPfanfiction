  Even the bottom of a tank is bulletproof, and going by the feats of canon, the blasring charms we see are about as strong as hand grenades, if that

Pettigrew blew up an entire street with one spell. And even if he hit the gas main, if a spell can go through 6 feet of street and earth, it will have no trouble with 20mm armour (that's how much a T-55 has at its bottom).

Maybe the commander's hatch, but you cannot steer from there (it has neither the controls nor is a rotating driver's position a good idea). If you ride/fly with the driver's hatch open, you will still see way less than out of a car's window because that big turret is behind you and to your right. It will probably be a bit more than what you would see from a commercial airplane, but those have a whole array of instruments and it moves according to the laws of physics (you are always looking where you are going).

  A T-55 is basically an "I win" button for the story.

Fiendfyre would cook you in one. Apparation allows people to simply leave. And you can always do the Finnish thing and lob a Molotov at the engine deck, which is a lot easier with invisibility spells, teleportation and levitation charms.
