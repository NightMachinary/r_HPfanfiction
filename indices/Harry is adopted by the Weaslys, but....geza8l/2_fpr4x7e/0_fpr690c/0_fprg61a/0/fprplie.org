He is quite ignorant of all things Muggle, yet that alone could be explained by his upbringing in a magical family. But despite his interest, he refuses to simply buy an encyclopedia or something like "technology for dummies". Deliberate ignorance is not a good trait.

His attitude towards all things muggle reminds me of imperialist attitudes towards the natives of whatever they happened to colonise, especially his wonderment at any and all advances. He is genuinely surprised by even simple concepts, making it clear that his expectations were insultingly low, especially given that he regularly makes trips into central London. He would see so many marvels of technology each time, is interested, but a 4 year old would have a better understanding from the picture books in Kindergarten. His plug connection is just one example.

Also, he did nothing to reign in his family's treatment of Fleur. But that one is as much on him as on Bill.
