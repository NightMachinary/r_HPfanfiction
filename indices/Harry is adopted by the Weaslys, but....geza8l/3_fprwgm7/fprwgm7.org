" Hello welcome to our orphanage " said the lady at the front desk, " we are here to adopt Mr Harry Potter " said Molly " oh really? Are you sure? His parents have already died and he was taken somewhere else but the left him and does seem strange " the lady said. " Yes we are definitely sure " Arthur said confidentially " very well, " the lady said " Harry! " She called " Yes? " Said a skinny boy with round glasses and black hair " these people would like to adopt you " she said " ok... I'll just go and get my things then " he said. After a minute he was back " well... if you find him too much trouble then remember to bring him back " the lady said with a smile, " he won't need bringing back " Arthur assured her " bye Harry " " bye ", and they left.
