  - Year 4 would be a little easier on Harry because it'd be easier for Harry to convince Ron that he didn't put his name in the Goblet.

Or would it be harder? Ron has always felt overshadowed by his brothers, and now Harry /is/ his brother -- overshadowing him yet again.

Plus, could there be some growing resentment in the background? With Harry so happy to have a family he wouldn't mind the reasonable amount of chores at all, and it could lead to some issues with the others. Molly/Arthur giving Harry extra focus because he needs it to build the relationship could also be a sore point, him "stealing" their parents.

Anyway, I could see the Ron thing going either direction here. Perhaps the biggest issue yet as the fledgling new family, due to unsaid stressors building up over a few years.
