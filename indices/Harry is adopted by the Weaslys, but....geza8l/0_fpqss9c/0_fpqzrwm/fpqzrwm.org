I would not mind a longfic starting from this, tbh. Wholesome father-and-son bonding is wholesome.

I'd imagine this would lead to the following changes eventually:

- Ginny is bound to be less shy around Harry. It wouldn't exactly be a romance at 12, and might never be, but they'd probably be on decent terms by the time Ginny gets the diary.\\
  That, in turn, might change the whole setup of Chamber of Secrets - Ginny acting all secretive at that point would be odd. Heck, she might even show the Diary to someone before it ever gets written in.
- I'd imagine Sirius would be even more worried when he sees that picture in the Prophet that causes him to break out of Azkaban. After all, both Harry and Pettigrew would be in it.
- Year 4 would be a little easier on Harry because it'd be easier for Harry to convince Ron that he didn't put his name in the Goblet.
- No Dementors in the summer before Year 5. It's hard enough getting away with that in a mostly-Muggle neighborhood, it'd be impossible if Harry was around the numerous Weasleys 24/7 (and the Lovegoods living nearby).
