Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort)

Has a very manipulative Voldemort character.

He does spare Lily when she says that she'll do anything, gives her the mark and slowly turns her into a dark witch. Snape's fully loyal to him as a result. He spends a lot of time managing the different factions inside the death eaters to switch from killing the mudbloods to using them as curse fodder. He also manipulates the public to reduce support for Dumbledore.
