Stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][*lorien829*]] fit this especially *Bridges* linkffn(8541644) , *Resistance* linkffn(2746577) and *Shadow Walks* linkffn(6092362).

Try *An Assault on the Senses* linkffn(1260207) for something humorous.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8/5][*Come Together*]] also fits. It was written way before the last books where published but still takes place postwar.

Zero bashing in any of these.
