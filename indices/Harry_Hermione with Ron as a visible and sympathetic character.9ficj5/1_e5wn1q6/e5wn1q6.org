I remember an AU 6th year story where Harry nearly got beaten to death by the Dursleys over the summer and Ron and Hermione spend some time with him in Diagon. They find out about the abuse (Harry is badly injured after all), Hermione tears into Dumbledore for the whole mess and a lot of supportive conversations between the trio take place.

Eventually, Harry and Hermione are together and Ron supports them, +but I cannot find the story on FFN+.
