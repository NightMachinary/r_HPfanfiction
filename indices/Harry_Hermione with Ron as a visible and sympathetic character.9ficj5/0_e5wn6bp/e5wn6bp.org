[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), is a very unique postwar fic, canon compliant until the end of DH, and things really got interesting after chapter 5. It's also the first H/Hr fic I've found that depicts Ron (and Ginny) as heroes.
