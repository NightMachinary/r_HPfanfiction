Nah they exist. You've got Starfox's recent writing, Harry Potter and the Lady Thief, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5). Without spoiling too much, Harry and Ron are still the best of friends in the story and Ron actually dates Luna throughout it (opposites attract thing). In this story, I actually think they toned down Ron and muted some of his flaws, but perhaps his pairing with Luna and not being as close to Hermione changed his character.
