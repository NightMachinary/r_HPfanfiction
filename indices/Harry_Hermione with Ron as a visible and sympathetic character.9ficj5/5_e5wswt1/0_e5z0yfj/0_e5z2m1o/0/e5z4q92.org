I have noticed, however, starfox has a huuuuuge hateboner for draco. Draco rarely escapes the story unscathed. In fact, the two recent short stories, Petunia Evans Tomb Raider and Returned, Reformed, and Really Trying are notable for ending without draco dying (though in RRRT, he does get it pretty bad).

He hadn't died yet in Lady Thief, but theres still time for that.
