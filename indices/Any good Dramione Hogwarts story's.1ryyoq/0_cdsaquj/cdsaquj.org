I have plenty of Dramione recs! The first fic that came to mind is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][Bracelet]] by Akashathekitty. Have you already read that? It's the first thing that came to mind with Dramione, redemption (ish, it goes both ways), and Head Girl/Boy.

Fics with Dramione at Hogwarts (for at least part of it) with redemption but without that Head Boy/Head Girl trope:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] by Bex-chan This is an interesting fic that begins in sixth year and develops into a parallel AU of DH. This fic does take place during the war, and contains small to moderate amounts of violence, emotional truama, and visible battle scenes. Although this fic is not complete, the author has nearly completed the story--it's only missing a few chapters.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5095119/1/The-Dragon-s-Bride][The Dragon's Bride]] by Rizzle. This is one of my personal favorites. It's a marriage fic, where the pair end up together by accident and have to work out their problems from there. It's an AU that takes place at Hogwarts, at the end of their seventh year.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] This is the very first Dramione fic I ever read, and it's still one of my favorites. It's passionate, smutty, sad, and a great read. Honestly, if you haven't read this story, you need to, unless you just don't like smut (which would be unfortunate, because Dramione as a ship has some great smut). The author has begun writing a sequel to this story, albeit very slowly.

Each of those stories do have smut in them. In the Bracelet, Dragon's Bride and Isolation, it's only a few scenes. In Isolation and Dragon's Bride, the scenes can probably be skipped over without loosing too much of the plot. Even if you dislike smut, I really hope you'll give one of these a try! (And if you'd like any more recs I can try to think of some, or add others in different genres!)
