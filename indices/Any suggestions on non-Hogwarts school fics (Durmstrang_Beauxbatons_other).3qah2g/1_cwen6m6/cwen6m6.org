There's always [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][The Irish Choice]] where he leaves Hogwarts for an OC school in Ireland.

I'm hesitant to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4060448/1/Defender-of-Beauxbatons][Defender of Beauxbatons]] because it's both a) Super!Harry and b) abandoned, but damned if it's not entertaining.
