I should have warned that, also i should probably mention that the auther has a puplic draft up on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][Dark Lord Potter]] that goes all the way til Jule Ball fourth year. Just know to acces this site you need accounts, legitimacy and prove you aren't gonna steal it. (Has happend) Also these chaptors are a draft, and it can be slightly seen, so treat it as a beta for whats to come. (The auther has recently become a bit more active) Here are a few links to some DLP modderators explaning the shutout. I will personally recomend going through the hastle.
