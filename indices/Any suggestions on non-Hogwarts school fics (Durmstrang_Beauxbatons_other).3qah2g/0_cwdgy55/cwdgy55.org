linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by The Santi) is a classic that you really should read. In my personal top 5, and at least in the honorable mentions of other people lists of best fanfics ever. It has, arguably, the best OC in fanfiction and has plenty of great moments and parallels to canon. And while some complain that Ron and Hermione are portrayed badly in this one, I think it's of their best portrayals of them ever.
