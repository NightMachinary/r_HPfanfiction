Hmm...you're not getting much luck with responses to this, huh?

From the title, I'm guessing you were hoping for someone to lead into the classic 'Have you no sense of decency?' line, right?

Oh well, I'll try and make up a short bit. And then see if someone else makes a short bit, and then another, and another...

Ron Weasley, clad in green robes that clashed horribly with his red hair, stood next to Umbridge, a dictation quill floating in front of him, scribbling away as it recorded Umbridge's ear-grating monologue.

Outwardly, he sneered at the trussed Harry, playing up the role of a Weasley who had turned, just like Percy did; inside, however, he was grimacing, feeling as sick as he had the day he had staged the argument that let him get into the Inquisitorial Squad.

Ron shut his eyes and mentally filtered out the High Inquisitor's irritating voice, his mind drifting towards the elaborate ploys that had inserted him into the Inquisitorial Squad.

The pranks, visibly crueler and more humiliating than normal. A disapproving letter from Mum, guaranteed to be caught by the Squad members intercepting letters. The staged argument with Harry, the worse one with Hermione (boy, she could act). The retorts towards Malfoy taking a different tone.

Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad had been taken in completely, of course. They let Ron (Him! 'Former' friend of the Boy-Who-Lived!) into their little group. He served them well, reporting on the Gryffindors and repeatedly getting them caught in the act.

Funny, that. How every time they were led towards an act of kissing or casting in the corridors or whatnot, they missed someone who vandalized a Decree, or broke into Umbridge's office, or something else considerably more serious.

Ron opened his eyes again; Umbridge was just getting to the end of her speech, and was just beginning to fire loaded questions at Harry.

It was lucky, the Weasley reflected, that Umbridge seemed to have a thing for having red-headed boys do her paperwork; when these 'committees' started, he had been promoted to her secretary in Hogwarts, effective immediately.

This put Ron in the perfect position needed to fulfill the Gryffindors grand scheme; he had up-to-date information on who was loyal and who was not, what Squad members would be where at what times, who could be trusted in Hogwarts, and who would betray Harry...

...And this. Every time Umbridge spoke, Ron dutifully saw it written down, cross-referencing it with earlier inquisitions, finding every single falsehood and contradiction that came out of the toad's mouth.

/Give me six lines written by the most honest of men, and I shall find something to have him...her, the toad, hanged,/ Ron reflected.

He couldn't count the laws Umbridge was breaking; that bit was Hermione's job. But he could expose every little part of Umbridge and her Squad, reveal each and every crime and wrong they had committed while acting so high-and-mighty.

Still, looking at Harry, who had been humiliatingly chained to a stake and was now trembling with disgust and fury, Ron wondered if it was all worth it.
