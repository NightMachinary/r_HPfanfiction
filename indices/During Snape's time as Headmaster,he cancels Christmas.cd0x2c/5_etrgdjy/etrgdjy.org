Someone needs to come up with a song that starts out, "You're a mean one, Mr. Snape, you really are an eel, ..." but that would be more Fred and Georges' forte, and they're not in Hogwarts anymore. Maybe Ginny might have written to her brothers about Christmas being canceled, and then Hogwarts students who tuned into Potter watch might hear such a song, and everywhere Snape slinks throughout the castle, someone surreptitiously plays the song. Maybe the twins create and distribute records of themselves singing the song. But would Snape actually slither and slink about the castle, literally stealing Christmas? He might just order the house elves to do it.
