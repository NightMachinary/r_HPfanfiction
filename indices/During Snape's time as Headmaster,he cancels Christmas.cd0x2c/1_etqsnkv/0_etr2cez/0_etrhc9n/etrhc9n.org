I've read the occasional SS-centric Christmas Carol, and the past is usually Eileen, probably because Lily would introduce a big can of worms from her appearance alone disrupting the typical flow of such a story (Present being Dumbledore, and future being... well, nobody specific). Past generally does have scenes involving Lily, though.
