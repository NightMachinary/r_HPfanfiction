Now that you mention it... it does seem strange that I'm not aware of any such thing existing.

Spacebattles (and I assume Sufficient Velocity and Questionable Questing) have 'Quests' where the readers vote on the MC's actions (and sometimes on other things) but I don't know that I've seen any properly done out Interactive Fiction with all the branches written.

I'm not sure what the +proper+ entertaining premise would be for that either? Do you abandon any pretense and do it as a 'choose your own adventure' where you run Harry's life like an SI?

Or... do a Hogwarts mystery story where you have to investigate some strange occurrence?

Or maybe do it like one of those text based adventure games where you move around compass directions and have a 'map' of Hogwarts that you explore?
