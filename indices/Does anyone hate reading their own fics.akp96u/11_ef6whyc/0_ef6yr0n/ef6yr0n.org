I have a complicated relationship with my longest fic of the ones I've written. Like the first 2-4 chapters are crap, IMO. The timeline's completely wrong and compressed to the point where it actually making sense would require violating the laws of physics, the actual sequence of events is boring, and the character development is next to nonexistent. But it has some other chapters that I'm particularly proud of, especially one or two near the very end. But over the whole course of it, character development seems to be something that I utterly failed at with pretty much everyone except my main character.

Multiple times over the years I've sat down to try and rewrite it, but I can never get something I'm satisfied with.
