Personally, it depends on the story. Most of my published stories are shorter (3k-5k) so it's a quick little read that I can find grammar issues with but fix them as I read. I enjoy going through and seeing how my style has developed.

On the other hand, my longest (and more popular) story is straight trash. I hate it. I think the plot is awful and see tons of plot holes. I got favorable reviews and people seem to enjoy it which is the only thing keeping me from taking it down.
