Robst is an ok example. The first thing that popped in my head was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11002763/7/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magic-of-Life]]). Such an interesting promise, a starting point that I rarely see in fanfics. It introduces certain characters far earlier and in a different context. Steers Harry towards certain interesting skills and ideas. But it is so poorly written.
