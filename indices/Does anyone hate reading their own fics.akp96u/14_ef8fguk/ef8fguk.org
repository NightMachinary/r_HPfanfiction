It's such a back and forth with me. When I have an idea for a fic and I'm write it and feel very satisfied with everything, I'll read it the next day and absolutely hate. Then I'll revisit it a month later and then really like it again. It's definitely a thing that I haven't gotten over, which is why I only ever posted one.
