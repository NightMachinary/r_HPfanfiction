I like rereading my fanfic stories; though I do have to force myself not to rewrite things. I am proud of the works written by my inexperienced hand. They are by no means exceptional, but readers of 'free fanfiction' should not expect that. Reviews and comments from those who have read beyond the story summary and past the first few chapters have generally been favorable. Writing is a craft, like anything else, and skills will develop with dedication and practice. JKR provided some insights into writing: [[https://www.jkrowling.com/answers/]]
