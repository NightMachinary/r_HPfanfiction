Nothing is ever going to be as good on paper as the vague idealized story you have in your head. When you write it down, you come face to face with the reality that writing is a skill you have to work at, and that having read a lot of books doesn't magically turn into knowing how to write one. But the more you do it, the more rough edges in your work get smoothed away.

Grammarly can help if what's bugging you right now is mechanics. It's not perfect, but it's better than a lot of beta readers turn out to be.

And, yeah, I hate reading my old stuff. A handful of short things I can take, but by and large once it's complete, I'm done with it. Because every story you write improves your craft, something 2 or 3 years old is painful to read, at least for me.

Perky people suggest seeing the shift in your skills as proof of your improvement, and perhaps that mindset will work for you.
