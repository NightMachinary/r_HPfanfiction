Same! I love reading my older works over. I have a persistent universe and it's good practice to remind myself of what's happened in other stories before adding a new one. Sometimes I'll run across a reference that will inspire a new story. Sometimes I even dare to pay myself on the back with how a scene or bit of dialogue came out.

In the words of Mama Ru: If you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love someone else?
