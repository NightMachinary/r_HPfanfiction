Well, start by realising you actually wrote a story, which means you wrote more than most people do. You may or may not have the talent, I wouldn't know, but you have the drive and desire to follow your dreams, big or small.

That's an accomplishment. I say be proud, and if you are inclined to, listen to wise counsel of a good betas and other writers to improve yourself.
