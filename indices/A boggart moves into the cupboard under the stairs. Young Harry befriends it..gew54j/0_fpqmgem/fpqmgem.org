Forget shapeshifting. Legilimency! He doesn't have to change his body, he putters around with their perception a bit. Dursleys abuse? They think they are doing it. Harry just alters their perception to let them think they are doing it.

It could go even further. Harry shows up at Hogwarts, very jaded from all the legilimency, having seen what people fear and hope for. Then Peeves shows up. Senses a kinship with him and bam! Harry is now an apprentice to peeves. Learns how to do poltergeist stuff. Year three has Dementors, and they don't like him, since he's either a void area to them, or Peeves outranks them in the pecking order of spirits/wraiths. Maybe because he's sorta like them AND mortal, and they don't like that. Insert some Patronus stuff, and then Harry becomes super crack'd envoy of chaos. Legilimency, Hope, and Poltergeist?

Imagine funneling the Patronus effects through legilimency into say... Neville's parents. Or horcruxes.

Throw on some Spirit-Y name on it.
