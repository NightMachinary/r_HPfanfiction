It's been years since I've read them, so take this with a grain of salt, but I remember the first one having an ending definitive enough that I was genuinely didn't see any point to it having a sequel, so if I'm remembering right, it can definitely be read as a stand alone. That said, I think the sequels are worth reading, and while the third one doesn't come anywhere close to ending conclusively, it at least doesn't cut off on an cliffhanger. *side eyes Rent a Hero*

*Edit, 'cause I don't think I phrased this very well:

The sequels absolutely have a point and meaningfully continue this Harry's story, and they do it without needlessly tacking on some new, unrelated conflict. It's just that the first fic in the series ends in such a way that it's not immediately clear how a sequel could do that, and it's kinda impossible to explain how it works without just straight up spoiling it.
