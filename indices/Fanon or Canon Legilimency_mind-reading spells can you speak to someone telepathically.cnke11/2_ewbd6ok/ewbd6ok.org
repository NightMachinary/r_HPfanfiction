It's not altogether clear that Voldemort's "speak to everyone" trick was done through speaking in their minds; the voice is described as coming "from the very walls of Hogwarts", so more likely, I think it's an Heir of Slytherin thing.

But I see no reason one couldn't abuse Legilimency to send speech through.
