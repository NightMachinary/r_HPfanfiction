One of the points Snape makes about Legilimency is that "Time and space matters." It seems that Legilimency generally necessitates some form of mental contact between individuals for it to actually work.

Its often said that eyes are windows to the soul (soul being a poetic term for mind/personality in modern syntax). Eye contact appears to be necessary outside of extreme cases like Harry-Voldemort, and even then he is arguably the most accomplished/experienced user in the world at the time. So I doubt the Hogwarts battle case fits what you describe - its more likely some sort of broadcasting spell in the vein of 'Sonorus' or something attached to school itself.

As for mind speech, legilimency traces roots to 'read' and 'mind' (i.e. legil and mens from latin) and doesn't itself account for sending information as much as receiving or taking it from the other. If speech is possible, its likely an entirely different branch of magic or spell.
