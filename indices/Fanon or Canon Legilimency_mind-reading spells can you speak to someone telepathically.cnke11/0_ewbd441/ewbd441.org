As far as I know, a master occlumens is able to show the intruding legilimens whatever they want, so some kind of communication should definitely possible, but I do not think it is as easy as "speaking", more like transmitting a picture or an emotion.

And didnt Voldemort speak and just used an extremely overpowered voice amplification spell?
