This. Two people skilled in both arts could establish silent communication with each other, sharing mental pictures of what they want without the need to speak. Not telepathy in the sense we usually think of, but fulfills a similar use case. This is also how Snape<->Voldemort communication is usually presented -- with Snape, instead of talking about what he has "discovered", simply opens his mind to the Dark Lord to allow him to see his report directly from his mind.
