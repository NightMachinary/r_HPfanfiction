While I love the books, there are enough plot issues in canon for me to not enjoy next gen fiction, and Cursed Child just obliterated what little interest I had in it. A major down point is that Ginny was not developed well enough as a character for me to enjoy that pairing, but I also am not a fan of Harmony which is the most common alternative.
