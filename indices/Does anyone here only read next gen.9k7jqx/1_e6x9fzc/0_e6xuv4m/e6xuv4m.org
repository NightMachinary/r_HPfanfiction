Fair enough. I've read and seen cursed child and I hate the story immensely. But Ive shipped rose/Scorpius since the day the last book was released, mostly because I like the idea of dramione but it's non canon enough that I feel like I can't suspend my disbelief enough to really get into it. Plus Rose and Scorpius was heavily hinted in book 7 which helps. Potentially dumb question but I've never heard of Harmony, can you give me a rundown?
