It's funny that you feel this way, because I'm the exact opposite. I've only read and enjoyed more general next generation stories (like Inter Arma and Hogwarts Houses Divided). There aren't too many quality fics that I've found so I tend to stay clear of them in general.

I tend to stray for more post-epilogue fics rather than next gen. Pretty much all of Northumbria's works (which I guess is technically next gen. but it's my head canon of post-DH) are brilliant. They give such a color to so many canon characters post-war in a very realistic way. And it completely ignores Cursed Child, because many of the stories were written pre-Cursed Child. God Cursed Child sucked.

But I also got into fan fiction through my interest in Dramione, so I started out reading fan fiction with very AU fics. If it's not something you're into, I don't necessarily think you're missing out on anything special. I'd say the best works are the general stories that do stray into canon territory but make their own world.
