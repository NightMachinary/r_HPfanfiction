I have zero emotional attachment to next-gen.

They are all OCs anyway, and writing decent OCs is very hard.

But I can understand people have different tastes.

As the OP wants good Trio centric fics, here are my recommendations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is IMHO the best by far in this category.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Harry and Ron are sticking with Hermione despite her committing some serious killings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], linkffn(3557725): Superb Trio fic that has been unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): They are actually in a romantic relationship, and hand to fend off attacks by zombie battleship BismarckMort.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This fic is set in a non-magic sci-fi AU. If you can get past that, you will find it a great read. The Trio is freaking awesome here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6807742/1/Just-The-Three-of-Them][Just The Three of Them]], linkffn(6807742): A cute one shot canon rehash with them in a real relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4778694/1/To-End-In-Serenity][To End in Serenity]], linkffn(4778694): The Trio relationship is well written in this time travel, but Dumbledore and Snape bashing is way overdone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): Great plot and Trio interaction, bad grammar and spelling.
