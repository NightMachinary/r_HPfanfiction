[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828161/1/][Our Little Secret by Kerichi]] Pretty good Rose/Scorpius fic that avoids /most/ of the annoying tropes of the pairing. Importantly, Draco and Lucius are fairly in character which is nice. A great author in general tbh. It's the beginning of a trilogy and has a ton of spin-off one-shots that are good, but stands entirely on its own. I'm a big fan of the one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11320678/1/][Mastermind vs LaVeela]], but it doesn't really make sense without the main story.
