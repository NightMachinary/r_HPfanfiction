I get what you mean - I only read canon compliant because I also can't imagine things going differently and my immersion is ruined if I constantly think "but that's not what happened!" as I read.

So I only write post Hogwarts, missing moment and prequel stuff. I don't actually read much fanfic but when I do it is almost always post Hogwarts stuff.
