I literally use an app to save all my favorites lol...its called pocket, it saves webpages which is super helpful! But anyway, curiosity is not a sin (linkffn(6618236)) is one of my favorite multi-chaps, Adrenaline rush (linkffn(5809450)) is my favorite one shot. I have so many more but last one would definitely have to be [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613&showRestricted][Ignite]] by Slide. I love well-written fics though so anything where its clear that the author put a lot of effort into and I'll give it a shot. Do you have any favorites that you've found?
