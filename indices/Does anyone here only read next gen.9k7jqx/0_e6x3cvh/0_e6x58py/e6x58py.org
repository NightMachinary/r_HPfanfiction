Of course, theres DEFINITELY something for everyone! I'm definitely not saying GT-era fics and their readers are bad or anything haha. I'm actually bummed that I'm missing out on so much good writing. But I will say, I found a Ginny-centric fic recently via this sub where she was sorted into slytherin and its really good! So maybe that'll be my stepping stone to a broader range of fanfiction :)
