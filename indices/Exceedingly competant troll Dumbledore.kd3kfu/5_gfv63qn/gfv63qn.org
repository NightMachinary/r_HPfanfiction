I've wanted to write a fic like this for a long time, but can't get it to work for me. In my version manipulative Dumbledore is on full display useing his prestige,a time turner, & reputation to shape the wizarding world to be sillier. Deeds I'd attribute to Dumbledore include giving Fudge his green bolwer hat (right off his own head), designing the Wizengamot robes, hacking the Hogwarts wards & changing the school song.
