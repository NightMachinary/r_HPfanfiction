Oh it doesn't. Bashing can be a way to just scratch an itch for a character you may dislike. I personally see Albus as a manipulator, but for good reasons. I feel like he lost touch a little bit there, and started to see the future as a whole instead of the strokes that make it, and I can definitely see an Albus who strongly opposes changes to his plans to an unhealthy degree. Sadly, that's what was probably needed at the time. It doesn't mean I like it. I can enjoy a good Albus bashing story, but only for his canon actions. I'm fine with exaggerations to a point, but if you're gonna bash a character, do it right. You know.
