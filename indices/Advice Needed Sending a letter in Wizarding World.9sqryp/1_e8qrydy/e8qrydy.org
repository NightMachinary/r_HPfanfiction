Are you referring to someone being unable to track the owl to the particular location or choosing a method that can work internationally?

In GoF, Harry sends a letter to Sirius via Hedwig when he is in hiding and Sirius sends his letters via tropical birds. It is a similar situation so I would like to think they would consider the same safety measures. But since it is Harry and Sirius, it is possible that they don't.

I beleive a variant of a disillusionment charm on the owl could work, and of course not mentioning Snape's name in the letter.
