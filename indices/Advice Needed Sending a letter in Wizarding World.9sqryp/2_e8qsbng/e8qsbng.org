If there's a chance of setting things up ahead of time, they could arrange for a postbox at a very busy place and a way to notify the other that a message has been sent using Protean charms on a coin or something.

If Harry is sending blind, then he has to give Snape the clues publicly, but in a way no one else could decipher, like referencing his Aunt Petunia.

If it's just a message and nothing is important about the letter or package itself, then he could send a Patronus with directions to wait until Snape is alone to deliver it. In the books, Arthur sends a Patronus messenger to the trio about the status of the family, without knowing where they'd gone. His message also warned them not to respond, as they were under scrutiny.
