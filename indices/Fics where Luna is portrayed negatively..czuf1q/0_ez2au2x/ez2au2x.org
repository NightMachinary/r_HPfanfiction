The closest ones I can think of are jbern's /Bungle in the Jungle/ and its sequel where she's only pretending to be Loony but has really wide emotional swings.

If your definition of a negative portrayal includes sad and depressed, there's /Friends/ by the psychotic house elf (formerly glue and tar). Really well written, super dark.
