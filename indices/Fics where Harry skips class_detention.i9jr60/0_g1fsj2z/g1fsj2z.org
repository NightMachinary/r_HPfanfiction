Some 10 or 15 years ago, I read a story that did this. I can't recall the title, sadly.

But since I played through that scenario often myself, to answer your question: Dumbledore isn't, of course. However, Dumbledore might not always be in control here. There is still the Board of Govenors, and then keep in mind the most relevant year for this would be OotP and Umbridge's detentions, and she has an authority that can overrule the headmaster's. Her authority on paper would be backed up by physical authority, like the Aurors they send to retrieve McGonagall or Dumbledore.

So a sequence of events that goes like this: Umbridge assigns detention --> Harry refuses to show up --> Umbridge expells him --> Harry refuses to leave, ends with Umbridge sending Aurors to drag him out. /Outside/ of Hogwarts, he is then subject to Ministry law, and since he hasn't completed his education, just like Hagrid, his wand will be snapped and he will be forbidden from doing magic.

At which point he could probably live with the Weasleys, so no need for the Dursleys, I guess, but his future is surely ruined.

.

Anyway, it doesn't have to happen like that, it's just a speculative (if realistic, IMO) outcome. But the point is that there might actually be a reason for not going all out, beyond an inability to conceive of defying authorities in such a way.
