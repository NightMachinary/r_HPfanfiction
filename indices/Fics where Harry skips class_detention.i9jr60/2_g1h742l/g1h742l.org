I remember one it was called /Enough is Enough/. Although it's incomplete and abandoned

After finding a muggleborn girl crying about losing points Harry decides to take a stand. He calls a house meeting about a boycott and they agree. They get the Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs in it.

Next morning after only Slytherin rises to go to class they all kinda just stop everything. Nott proposes Slytherin join in the boycott and the entirety of Hogwarts just boycotted class
