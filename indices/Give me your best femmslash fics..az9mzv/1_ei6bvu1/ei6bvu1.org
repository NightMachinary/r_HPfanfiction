If you ignore anything past chapter 23, Dignity in Fear is great. By far the best depiction of emotions I have read, but Harry falls a little short. The story really sucks past 23 though when the author turns it into an opinion insert about LGTB-allies and Lupin gets away with shitty behaviour because he is gay. And Harry is completely ignored because the author dislikes him.
