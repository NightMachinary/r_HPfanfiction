For a supposedly post scarcity society like the Magical World, there shouldn't be material poverty to begin with. And yet, we could observe evidence of severe poverty in Magical Britain. I think one of the main culprits was their use of gold as currency. By tying potentially infinitely high productivity (magic at will) to a very limited amount of currency in circulation, they all but guaranteed long term deflation and thus unending economic depression.

Maybe that was part of the Goblin conspiracy to keep Wizards well below their potential after all.
