Ah transfiguration. One of the hardest subject to explain with the lack of information given. JKR didn't seem to think overly much about her magical system.

What I think about transfiguration, how it should work to make it a working system :

1. When you transfigure you only give a physical object the form of what you want and think and possibly a behaviour as how you think it would act or how you want it to act. For example you will transfigure a mouse that will either act how you think a mouse would act given your knowledge or acts how you want it to act (maybe harder). With this in mind I also think there is 2 way for magic to work. Either magic copy a mouse somewhere (which would be a bit to easy in my opinion) or better, the outer look would be a mouse but if you were to cut it, it would either revert or show some undefined mass of matter without all the precise working innards except if you knew exactly how it is (and even it wouldn't make it alive). For the same reason it would be possible to make a clock that shows the time correctly as you know what it is supposed to show but I doubt it would have all the gears and inner working except if you knew how exactly it is and the more complex the object would be, the harder it would be to make a working object. For example for a piano you would have to know how the strings make the sound and how they behave over time given heat, humidity, stress and other things. The harder and more complex the object, the more the result would be a weak, somewhat working, copy of the original goal. That would also explain why transfiguration seems to be considered as hard and dangerous. It would require skill, concentration and finesse.
2. The duration of a transfiguration is limited to the power of the caster, the complexity of the desired transfiguration and the innate resistance of the subject. For example inanimate to inanimate wouldn't be too hard but I think that living being would have some innate magic field or some magical subconscious self-awareness that would want to automatically revert to its original form except if using a lot of power or tricking the being into thinking it's something else. This is why transforming a table into a chair wouldn't be too hard as the table hasn't inner conscious or unconscious self but a mouse maybe. And again it'd be easier with a mouse than a human because of the brain power that define the consciousness self-awareness power. If you're strong enough to overcome said being magic or to trick the awareness it would hold longer or better (a human transformed in a really convincing chair would impede the magical awareness as a chair hasn't a mind and an animal has instinct that would flood said awareness). Coming back to duration, Crouch Jr. transfiguring his dead father into a bone would probably be easy enough as it's an object in one block, without too much complexity transfigured from a inanimate object. Bonus as there is already bones in a human body. It would hold for quite some time. Enough for nature to process it (animals, natural decomposition, ...) enough that when it would revert there wouldn't be enough left to recognize it as a body. For the same Crouch, transfiguring Draco into a ferret certainly should need quite some power or/and skills. It seems the transfigured Draco had not the mind of a human but of a ferret and its instinctual want to flee and hide with all the inner red alert would impede into the want to go back to human. That's also why I think transfiguring someone into an animal while making it keep its thought process would be hard and that there is a special branch with Animagi that transformed themselves voluntarily but also into only one other form (like giving your mind/soul/whatever an other form subconsciously accepted without wanting to revert).
3. Conjuration, size and weight: what happens when you vanish, conjure or transfigure things with massive (in percentage) size or weight difference. Where does matter come from or go to? Is it magic transformed into matter, air into matter or matter summoned/banished to another dimension with a reserve of energy/matter (a bit like the Pym particle works in the comics). We can see that Rita Skeeter transforms into a beetle and we can agree that the size and weight difference is huge. So it's possible but how? In any proposed cases, I think again that it would be hard to make an eternal conjuration/transfiguration but you can make it hold longer with significant more power and skill (if you're more precise in you transformation, the details will convince the form that it is what it is). Maybe with rituals, runes, potions, whatever you could make it hold while using ambient magic of maybe force the object to accept its new form as its original one. For living conjuration maybe it's the same as transfiguration and only creating something with the face and behaviour of what you wanted or maybe an invocation from somewhere (which wouldn't be nice if said creature had a family). I prefer to see it as a creation (more or less flawed) than an invocation.
4. Gold, precious rare material in general and food. I think food, as seen in a lot of fics, would only be a temporary transfiguration/conjuration without the correct necessary nutrients making it a best pointless or at worth dangerous (if it reverts while in your body). With this idea even food to food could be dangerous if a certain nutrient is sent in the incorrect processing part of your body to revert to something else after. As for diamond, gold and other things, I think the complexity of said material (all the specifications like behaviour under heat, electricity why it's solid and resilient, resistant and all) would make it really hard to make it happen (diamond would maybe be seen as false) and even harder to make it last. Wood may be more complex in a way but I think it would be easier to create maybe for the same reasons as why naturally some elements are rarer than others. It would also maybe require too much power. That would maybe also explain why the wizarding money IS of bronze, silver and gold. Because it can't be conjured or transfigured into consistently (economy would collapse). That's also why the Philosopher Stone is such an game-breaking item.
5. Living being wouldn't be alive? As said in 1. it would only be a copy with similar behaviour but it wouldn't create a soul. The complexity of thinking behind creating a living being with all it entails, thought process, wants, choices (too many things to describe but you get the idea) autonomous and all would be impossible in my opinion. Or necessitating a lot of trial and error, skill, power, time and maybe more than one person. Still without a soul... That's why portraits are copies and not living things and maybe (IF it was true) Hogwarts of the Sorting Hat could develop a sentience or even sapience over time but if so it would only be because of the presence of so many magic and magical minds and life to emulate, imitate, take snippet of and overall integrate over time... lot of time... like hundreds of years. But even I don't think they would have a soul. BUT, what is a living being. With the possible coming of "living" AI in the future, what can magic do?

Bonuses:

1. The Philosopher Stone and by extension alchemy would be a mix of transfiguration, potion but also the mundane way of seeing the world physic and chemistry. The more complex analysis of the world with atoms and maybe some magical tiny components as well as higher energy manipulation would make the complete, real, timeless transformation from a matter to another possible. The energy required to make such transformation wouldn't be attainable to a wizard without a catalyst that would deliver and maybe also help in its manipulation (not to go nuclear). Let's just hope this stone isn't the same as in FMA.
2. Aguamenti. To me this spell either takes water from somewhere else (and purify it) or it (as in a lot of fics) condense and manipulate the ambient humidity (making it hard to use in a desert). This would allow it to be drunk without side effect.
3. Refilling spell (after seeing another post about it) is the worst. You can't conjure nor transfigure food but you can refill a wine bottle? Meh nope. This spell isn't thought through enough and shouldn't exist in the way it's been given to us. To me it shouldn't work on food. Or at least without the consequences mentioned earlier.

Guh this was damn too long to write and I'm sure I didn't think of everything of forgot some details. Anyway that's the way I see the transfiguration/conjuration in HP work. I hope this was more or less clear.
