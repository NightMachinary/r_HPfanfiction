Hm... I've always interpreted that passage to be that the imprint is the translucent physical form blundering about, a literal visual echo of the person, and their soul /is/ within them (or controlling it from limbo somehow). The whole thing has always looked rather vague and ill-thought-out to me... I think it's worth remembering that Voldemort cannot return as a ghost because his soul is in such a dreadful state.
