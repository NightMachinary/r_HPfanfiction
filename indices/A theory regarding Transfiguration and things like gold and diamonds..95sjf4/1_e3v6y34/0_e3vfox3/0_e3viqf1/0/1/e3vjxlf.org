I see. Are you thinking of a protego type defense or some kind of counter spell cast prior to the fight? I'd imagine with a stunning spell or something of the sort, creating a shield or casting a counter would be easier because of the reflexive reaction to the light of the spell.

However, if all you need to cast spells is the flick of a wand like Dumbledore, I don't see how Voldemort could tell the difference between Dumbledore trying transfigure him and performing another type of spell.

Though, if skilled wizards can detect spells forming in battle like Dumbledore could detect Voldemort's spells in the cave, then I suppose the light would be meaningless, as their reflexes would be trained to react to the spells they detect.

I dont think Dumbledore nor Voldemort could successfully leglimens one another to detect the spells that way.
