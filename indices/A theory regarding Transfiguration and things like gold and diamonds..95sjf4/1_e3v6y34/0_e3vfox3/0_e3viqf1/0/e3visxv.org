I think transfiguration can be blocked and/or shielded the same as any other spell - the only spell we're told is unblockable is the Killing Curse, and that property is especially highlighted as noteworthy. While there /may/ be other unblockable spells, they're certainly not common.

Just because a spell does not travel through the air, it does not mean that it cannot be blocked. Most Charms in fact act directly upon the target without travelling to it, but I imagine they can be blocked too.
