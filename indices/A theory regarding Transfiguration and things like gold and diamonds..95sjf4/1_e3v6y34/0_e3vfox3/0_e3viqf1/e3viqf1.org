Why do you think Dumbledore didn't try and transfigure Voldemort in their duel? Dumbledore is a master of transfiguration. Do you think Voldemort could counter it as it happened or something like that, because even an incomplete transfiguration can be devastating in a fight. I haven't been able to come up with a satisfying head canon to explain this.
