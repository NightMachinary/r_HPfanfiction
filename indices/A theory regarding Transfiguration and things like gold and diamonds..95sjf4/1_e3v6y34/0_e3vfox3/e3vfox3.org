One must distinguish things which are exceptions to Gamp's law from things which are simply outside the scope of transfiguration. There are far more than 5 things that transfiguration cannot do; the 5 exceptions are things that it /should/ be able to do but can't.

Transfiguration concerns the transformation of physical things into other physical things (including to creation of physical things from nothing, and vice versa). Magical acts outside of that definition are not exceptions to Gamp's law, they're just not Transfiguration.

A soul is not physical and therefore Transfiguration cannot create or change souls by definition, rather than as an exception.

As for why people don't use transfiguration as a direct offence, I think the answer is simply that transfiguration is very difficult and most wizards struggle with it. There are therefore always easier ways to directly attack someone. Why turn someone into a frog using difficult magic when you can blow a hole in them using easy magic?
