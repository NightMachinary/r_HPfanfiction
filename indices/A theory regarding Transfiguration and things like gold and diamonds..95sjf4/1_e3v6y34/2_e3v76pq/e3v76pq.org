I suspect there is an innate psychological quality in wizards and witches that, much like the psychological resistance to eating members of your own species, impedes the ability to perform certain tasks.

It isn't that they don't consciously want something, but that their unconscious mind resists certain behaviors and intents.

But then again, I've always suspected the reason wizards and witches can use magic in the first place is that they are suffering from something akin to a mental disorder. This makes their minds capable of controlling and channeling magic, it gives them an irrational mindset that is responsible for much of the problems that show up in the series.
