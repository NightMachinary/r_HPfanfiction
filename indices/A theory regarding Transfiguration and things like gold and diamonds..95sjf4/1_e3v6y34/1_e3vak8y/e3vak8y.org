We do see people transfigure humans in such a way as to be potentially damaging (Crouch's body was transfigured and we know you can transfigure living humans as well). So I think that's definitely a thing. The reason people might not do it in combat is that it may be complicated/difficult to do so quickly.

Vanishment on the other hand might not work on a human.
