What about partial animal transfiguration then? There are many examples in the books of whiskered snuffboxes etc. Is that a snuffboxes that can move and has some characteristics of a mouse, or the other way around? What would the insides be? If a first year student makes a failed transfiguration and his snuffmouse is something in between... will it have the insides of a mouse? Or will it contain tobacco? We know that the even a partial transfiguration can take on the characteristic of the original item. Also what happened to Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle at the end of the OotP contradicts that human transfiguration is too difficult to use in a battle, since the DA made him sprout tentacles and other things in a matter of seconds. I don't think you can make such definite statements when the source material says otherwise.
