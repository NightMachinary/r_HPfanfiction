I'm afraid I don't quite understand the point you're making. What aspect of my post is the existence of partial transfiguration supposed to challenge?

One imagines that the exact status of a partial transfiguration will be a matter of fact which varies from example to example i.e. it all depends on how partial the transfiguration is. A snuffbox into a mouse may have tobacco insides or mouse insides depending on how close the student has come to a complete transfiguration.

But either way, I'm really not getting what conclusions we are supposed to draw from this with respect to the nature of transfiguration. For me the only real take-away from this is that it emphasises how transfiguration is divorced from Muggle understanding of biology, because of course according to Muggle understanding, a mouse which is half-snuffbox should die very quickly.

Re: Malfoy sprouting tentacles, I'm pretty sure that was an unintended consequence of Malfoy being hit by so many different spells which interacted in unpredictable ways, not a transfiguration.
