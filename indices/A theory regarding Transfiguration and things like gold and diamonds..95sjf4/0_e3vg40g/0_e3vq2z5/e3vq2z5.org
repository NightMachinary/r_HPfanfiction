  but you cannot transfigure objects which require human creativity to produce such as a beautiful chair, a book, etc.

It could be argued that the quality of the transfiguration could alter the 'beauty' of the final object. I think we see examples of more talented witches and wizards having better finishes on the objects. Patterns and such on well done transfigurations whereas poor transfigurations retain a finish that reflects the original object. Dumbledore's conjured chairs in OotP are described as 'a squashiy chintz arm-chair.' As conjuration is part of transfiguration I think that it shows that human artifice carries over to transfiguration. Instead I think if you look at the failings of witches and wizards to cast a shield charm we can say that perhaps magic is really hard and can often be forgotten if the spells aren't practised, especially if the spell is considered difficult. We are also told that transfiguration is one of the hardest subjects. Perhaps its just too much effort for normal witches and wizards to create their own much in the way I could make my own furniture but I would much rather buy some. Perhaps a chair for example is practically worthless, you are instead paying for the service of the person making it. Their time is valuable whereas the creation isn't.
