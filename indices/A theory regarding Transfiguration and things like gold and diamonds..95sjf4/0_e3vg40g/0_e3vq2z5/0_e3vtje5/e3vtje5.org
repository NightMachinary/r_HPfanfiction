Right but when the person performing transfiguration is the person being creative then you're not magicing creativity out of nowhere - it's coming from the caster, an artist using magic to produce an artistic work. The exception proposed is not that transfiguration cannot be used to make beautiful objects, but rather that it cannot /replace/ human artifice.

For example: a wizard author could use transfiguration to put words onto a page instead of using a quill, but they could not just conjure up a new book without going to the effort of actually writing it.
