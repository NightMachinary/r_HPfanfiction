I agree that gold cannot be transfigured and therefore represents one of the exceptions to Gamp's law; I also agree that the reason for this is that it is valuable.

However, I disagree that the exception to Gamp's law is the more general "valuable things" rather than just "gold". I think gold occupies a special place that other valuable things do not share. For a start, we have seen Voldemort conjure silver. Secondly, we know from PS Gringotts scene that gems in the wizarding world are much larger than those in the Muggle world - presumably, magic has been involved in their creation. At a more fundamental level, however, is the observation that pretty much everything has "universal value". There are very few goods that cannot be sold anywhere in the world. If it was not possible to transfigure "valuable things" then you wouldn't be able to transfigure anything.

Further, I would be hesitant in identifying human society as the origin of gold's value in the HP world. The HP magic system is not Discworld; things don't become true simply because a large number of people believe them. That way lies "wish magic" super Harry fics, where Harry's ignorance of the nature of magic suddenly becomes his greatest strength, because he's literally too stupid to realise he can't do something and therefore magic just lets him do it.

That's not the way the HP system works - magic is repeatedly presented as a thing that can be studied and investigated, with its own complex rules, and where diligent study and deep knowledge is reflected in practical ability to cast magic. Even if writing a fic advertised as AU, I'm not sure why an author would /want/ to change the magic system to make stupidity and ignorance laudable characteristics which grant you power.

Magic is not scientific in the sense that it more or less completely ignores all physical laws, and moreover flies in the face of the scientific worldview (magic is dualist and anti-reductionist), but magic /is/ like science is so far as there is an objective truth to it - it's not all just in the wizards' heads. With that in mind, I would say that gold is valuable because the system of magical rules attributes it with that property, not because humans do. It's not the case that if humans stopped valuing gold, it would suddenly become transfigurable. (And indeed, if you wanted to go a step further you could suggest that the reason why humans consider it valuable is because magical law makes it scarce).

(With respect to knowledge, I think this is too general an exception as well. For example, you could transfigure something into a rabbit and then dissect the rabbit and thereby learn about the rabbit's biology, because you don't need to know the biology/chemistry of a thing in order to transfigure it. I think the exception is rather "products of human artifice". I.e. you can create natural objects and generic ones like chairs, but you cannot transfigure objects which require human creativity to produce such as a beautiful chair, a book, etc.)
