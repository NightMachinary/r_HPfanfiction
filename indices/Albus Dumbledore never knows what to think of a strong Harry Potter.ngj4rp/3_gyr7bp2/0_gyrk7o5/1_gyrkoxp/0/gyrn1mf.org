Of course Dumbledore only had speculation, since Canon doesn't have any case of (recorded) living Horcrux until Voldemort. It doesn't change the fact that the whole plan of having Harry sacrifice himself was to give him a chance to survive, and that the alternative was certain death.

Here's what Canon say about it:

  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his

body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died

for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives,

so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

“And you knew this? You knew -- all along?”

“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore

happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the

creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble

​

I won't deny that Dumbledore took some discutable decisions in Canon, but he made it pretty clear that he wanted to protect Harry. So you can either believe what he say in Canon, or decide that he lied and build a whole foundation of Fanon just to make him a bad guy.
