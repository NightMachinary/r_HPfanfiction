I'm someone who thinks Dumbledore could've intervened a little more, but the Fidelius Charm wouldn't have prevented Voldemort from touching Harry and Harry certainly would've died before he turned 18, so everything wouldn't have been 10x betters

Dumbledore doesn't know Harry is a horcrux until the 2nd book. He knows Harry has to die in CoS. 2 years later he's feeling triumphant that Harry has a chance to live. So "raised him as a pig for slaughter" is off the mark. "Kept him alive to die at the right moment" is a little more accurate, but not entirely.

  But if Harry had had a happy life do you think that he would accepted to let himself get killed by Voldemort?

Let's see what Harry says...

  Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it.

The answer to your question seems to be yes, Harry would still walk to his death if he hadn't grown with the Dursleys because not living with the Dursleys wouldn't have prevented his friends and famiy's murders.
