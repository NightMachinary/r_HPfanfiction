  No good man would ever fuck up someone's life like that and nurture them like a lamb for slaughter, hoping that maybe they would survive in the end based on mere guesses.

Voldemort is the one who fucked Harry's life, Dumbledore was the guy who tried to mitigate the damages. Did he do a perfect job? No, but at least he tried.

- It's because Voldemort killed his parents that Harry is an orphan.
- It's because there were still free Death Eaters that he had to grow up with shitty relatives
- It's because he is on the top of Voldemort shit list that he was forced to take part in the war
- And it's because Voldemort made an Horcrux out of him that he had to sacrifice himself

Take Voldemort out of Canon and Harry has an happy life, take Dumbledore out and it would be impressive for him to even survive long enough to attend Hogwarts.
