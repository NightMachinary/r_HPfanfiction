"Strangeness" is an odd way of putting "torturing/traumatizing fellow orphans and killing another's pet".

Also, you're still conveniently not addressing the fact that Dumbledore knowingly placed and kept Harry in an abusive environment when he could almost certainly have found a solution. /He/ placed Harry in that environment, and in so doing took responsibility for his wellbeing. Between gambling on abuse producing the right sort of dysfunction or gambling on it somehow producing a loving and heroic person, the latter seems a far worse bet to me, even if the former isn't particularly smart either.

Further, who's to say that only one dysfunctional outcome was of use? He could have planned for several different ways Harry could turn out.
