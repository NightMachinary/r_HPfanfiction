You sure showed that strawman who's boss!

Your original argument was "Dumbledore didn't start planning for Harry to die until the end of book 2." I have countered that his canonical actions and inactions are more consistent with him having decided Harry would have to die substantially earlier, at least if one presumes Dumbledore to be anywhere near as competent as he is portrayed in canon.

Simply put, the decisions Dumbledore made between 1981 and 1997 mean that he cannot be both as competent and as benevolent as Rowling intended to portray him unless he was operating under severe limitations not evidenced in canon.

He could have been incompetent in the "not intelligent" sense, incompetent in the "mentally ill and/or senile" sense, or seeking to sacrifice Harry for any reason from "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one" to "Once Harry's out of the way and Tom's mortal again, I can defeat Tom."

My personal take is that he saw Harry's sacrifice as the most expedient means of ending the war for good and minimizing the loss of innocent life, but was happy to see that Harry could possibly survive sacrificing himself. I also view him as having a bad case of hubris, not trusting anyone else with power or information even when they needed that information, being a bit of a control freak, and not really taking counsel from others (quite possibly because he still sees most of them as the children he remembers them being).
