Where does this idea come from that Tom was abused/bullied/neglected? We see exactly zero evidence of that, but rather that even as a primary-schooler it was /him/ doing the bullying. Snape's background is far closer to Harry's than Riddle's is to either of them.

I didn't say that Harry's upbringing was perfectly tailored towards a child soldier, just that it was better suited for that (ten years of constant reinforcement that Harry had no value, for example) than for producing a healthy adult. Harry's upbringing taught him that he was worthless and unloved, while also making the wizarding world seem like his salvation. Also, the lack of any special training or preparation (aside from memory-watching in book 6) argues against "child soldier" but for "child martyr" - after all, if you know already that it's going to come down to Harry vs. Tom, but don't bother trying to give Harry any prep beyond standard Hogwarts classes, that's a pretty strong sign that you're not intending/expecting Harry to win.

  There is no reason for Harry having to die other than horcruxes. You may not have heard, but there was this prophecy...
