I'd disagree with you on that. His actions and inactions prior to that are far better at grooming a child soldier and/or martyr than they are at producing a healthy, well-adjusted individual. We know for a fact that he knew Harry was being neglected and abused at #4 (or, if one stretches for a charitable interpretation, that he was willfully ignorant). There is no way someone of his skill and knowledge couldn't find a way to improve things with minimal effort.

Even if Dumbledore didn't know about Horcruxes specifically, he had already determined back in '81 that Harry was going to have to die and built his plans and decisions around that.
