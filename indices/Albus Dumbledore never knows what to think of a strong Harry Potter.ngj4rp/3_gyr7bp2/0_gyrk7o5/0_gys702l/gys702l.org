...I think the convoluted plan really didn't do anything to help Harry live, it just helped the book last a year.

Now, I don't think Dumbledore wanted Harry to die, but I think the text does point to him thinking he had to die until Goblet of Fire - where its clear that he is thrilled that Harry now had a lifeline.
