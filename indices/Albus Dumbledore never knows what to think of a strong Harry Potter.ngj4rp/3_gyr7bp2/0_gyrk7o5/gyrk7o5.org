  Furthermore, Dumbledore never wanted Harry to become powerful. Harry was not supposed to become stronger than Voldemort. He was not supposed to win. Harry's role was to be as Snape put it, "a pig for slaughter". He was meant to die.

I fucking hate this argument because it's just wrong. If Dumbledore really wanted Harry to die because of the Horcrux, he could have killed him at any time after Voldemort's return (maybe even before).

But he rather decided to created a way too complicated plan, going as far as predicting Harry's moves month after his own death, just to give him a chance to live.
