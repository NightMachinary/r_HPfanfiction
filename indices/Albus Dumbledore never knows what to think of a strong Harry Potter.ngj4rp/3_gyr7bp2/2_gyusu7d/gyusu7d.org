I like the first part of this comment, but I disagree from "Furthermore" onward.

Dumbledore was trying to arrange things so that Harry would /live/. He was glad that Voldemort used Harry's blood, and he set him on the path of the Hallows, because he knew Harry would have to face the killing curse again, and he wanted him to have the chance, however slim, of surviving again. And the plan worked! Harry died and returned!
