I think one of the most accurate depictions of bad Dumbledore is that he is scared of powerful wizards due to him not knowing whether his wand killed his sister (he's scared of his own power most of all). It's fucked him up.

I think they also say he /desires/ power, and is attracted to power, or at least is scared that he is, because he fell in love with Grindelwald. there is a bunch of guilt and unhealthy feelings of self hate that have become something different over the years: controlling his environment, having quite a lot of authority to keep people in check but not power for himself (or at lest he tells himself that), and you have him thinking that if Harry is this powerful and/or using the social capital and economic power within his grasp then he must be leaning to far on this false dichotomy of ‘light' and ‘dark'.

And honestly, I think that it's believable in essentials. He really hasn't had too many people talking sense at him for a long time, because they're in awe so they let him think and do what he wants (except people like Lucius Malfoy and friends, but they aren't healthy disagreement and discussion, they're actually terrible people) and he probably hasn't had counselling for the ‘I fucked/fell in love with an aspiring genocidal dictator and I liked it, what does that make me?'

I think it would be refreshing to see something else, but unfortunately I see too much truth in this interpretation here so even if I tone down the megalomaniacal cartoon Dumbles, he's still going to have control issues. Because he really thinks he's the only thing between ‘power hungry' tiny arseholes (students) and the thirst for power or whatever

And, you know, kids aren't very good at making consistently good decisions all by themselves. That's just a fact. you need to help them with that, to develop those decision making skills and social understanding; but I still argue that Andromeda Tonks was /right there/ and could have taught him how to be a person better than Petunia Dursley.
