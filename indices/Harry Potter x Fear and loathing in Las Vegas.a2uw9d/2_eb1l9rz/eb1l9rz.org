[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6739776/1/Death-Eaters-at-the-Malfoy-Estate-The-Collection][Death Eaters at the Malfoy Estate]] is a crack fic with some heavy drug use. The basic premise is that during his younger days Snape was the potions master (i.e. "cook") for the Death Eaters. It has plenty of absurd and humorous moments like /Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas/ does.
