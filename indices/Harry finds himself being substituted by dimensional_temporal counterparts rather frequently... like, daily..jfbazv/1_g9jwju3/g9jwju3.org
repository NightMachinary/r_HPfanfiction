I had an idea a bit similar to this some time ago. Harry is hit by an unknown curse at some point. As a result, he randomly swaps "soul" with a parallell Harry from a different HP fanfic universe. The canon universe gets the kind of hijinks you mentioned, while canon Harry gets thrown into various confusing realities, some which are sort of plausible in different circumstances (Slytherin!Harry) while some aren't at all and something truly wacky must have made it so (Evil!Dumbles).
