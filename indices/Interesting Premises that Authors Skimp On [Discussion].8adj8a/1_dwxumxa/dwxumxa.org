I'm so glad I found this sub, and honestly this is a thing I've noticed in a lot of fics. I feel like there are two kinds of AU fics: the kind that just wants to see how things would have been materially different, and the kind that's willing to really investigate the change and what that would do. I tend to prefer the latter, because /everything/ has consequences, and "different from canon" does not need to (and frankly should not, IMO) mean "kinder than canon."

With the former, to use your "harry raised by goblins" example, I can kind of see why you wouldn't want to "waste" 15k words out of, say, a 40k word fic on just how different Harry's upbringing was. The point of the fic may not be the cultural differences between Muggle Britain, Wizarding Britain, and the Goblin clans. The point is more, "How would Harry have approached the second Voldemort War if he'd been raised in a culture that encouraged ruthlessness, cunning, adhering to the letter of one's bargains, and had a lot of cultural baggage over a lost war?" And showing more than scattered scenes from his childhood and first through third years would likely take too much time away from that driving question.
