It's something I see in a lot (a lot!) of fanfiction that would be ruthlessly edited in original fiction, and that is great tracts of (usually very dull) unecessary backstory. Backstory that is similar enough to canon that the readers already know it.

Neil Gaiman famously said (and I'm paraphrasing) that if someone tells you that something's wrong with your story they're almost certainly right. When they tell you how to fix it they're almost certainly wrong.

In the case of the OP I suspect that something in the writing (I would guess the level of background detail) is slowing the pacing and getting in the way of the story. Remember /The Story/. 'Letting events play out' is not always a good idea when it comes to storytelling. If nothing happens for a day or a week or a month, sum it up in a sentence and move on.
