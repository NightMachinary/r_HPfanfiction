But the underlying point is that if unecessary detail gets in the way of the story proper, maybe it shouldn't be there. Or at least not so much of it. And it sounds (and obviously I'm guessing as I haven't seen the story or the review) as if that is what the reviewer is saying. They might not be right and these things are always subjective but it's always worth thinking about.
