I think you've misunderstood me. I'm taking issue with stories that have an interesting premise that ends up being skipped and simply gestured at vaguely using flashbacks after time skips.

Like the idea that Harry is raised you goblins, and yet the next chapter after that the story immediately jumps to him entering Hogwarts. The purported premise, the thing that drew me in (hypothetically), has been skipped and I find its a shame. I'm not interested in having canon events rehashed to death, I'm just annoyed with stories skipping the interesting non-canon premise they present.

I think [[/u/Taure]] put it best in a comment elsewhere in this thread. A lot of the time the problem is the real premise of these stories is Powerful!Harry and the premise was a weak excuse to justify it. :/
