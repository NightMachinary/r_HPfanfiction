I think it's not so much "what the author cares about" as it is how much people (here and on fanfiction.net) seem to hate "canon rehashes". Type for "Stations of Canon" or "rehash" in the search bar of this sub, and you'll find a hundred people protesting that they do not want to "hear about The Troll Incident for the 3748th time", and that if you find it inevitable to feature The Troll Incident in your AU, you should just skip it and tell us, post-time-skip, what few details differed from the canon version.

That is not a sentiment I at all agree with; I loathe stories that begin in third year, add a flashback to first-year two chapters in, jump forward to sixth year at chapter ten, then have the characters time-travel back to fourth year... It's done to seem clever and innovative but just gives your reader a headache and prevent immersion into this new timeline. There's a reason the canon books didn't start with /Deathly Hallows/, then flashback to /Order of the Phoenix/ and convey the events of /Philosopher's Stone/ through a series of out-of-order Pensieve dips.
