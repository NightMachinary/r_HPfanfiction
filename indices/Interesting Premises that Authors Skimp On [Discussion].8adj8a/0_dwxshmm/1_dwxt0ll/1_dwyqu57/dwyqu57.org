Honestly, stories which put a lot of emphasis on pre Hogwarts stuff are generally bad, either because they are mind-bogglingly boring or totally unrealistic, even in a world with magic. A 7 year old will not be doing much interesting stuff, especially if he is raised by responsible adults. Maybe the adults do interesting stuff, but certainly not the kids, unless you want them ridiculously overpowered.
