I don't really mean skipping canon stuff that's often rehashed (I agree it's such a boring thing to do). I mean something like this (random example):

Story premise: "Time-travelling Merlin raises Harry". Ch. 1 consists of Merlin taking Harry... and then in the next chapter the story jumps ahead like ten years to Hogwarts. Or "Harry is raised by goblins" but then we skip from them taking him in to him getting on the train.

If the premise hooked me I'd be pissed since Hogwarts is nearly always a forgone conclusion, the interesting bit for me is how things are different leading up to it. Having all those details told after the fact often kills my interest immediately since the difference-maker has already come and gone.
