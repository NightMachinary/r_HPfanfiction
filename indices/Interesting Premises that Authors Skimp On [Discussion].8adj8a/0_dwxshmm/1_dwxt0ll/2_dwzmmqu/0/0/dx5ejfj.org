As much as Harry Crow is a bad fic, it actually explored how the goblin culture shaped Harry. The goblin culture might've been badly thought out, but its influence was visible there.

It didn't go for showing us upfront Harry's living in goblin society and that was a good choice. By getting to "fun stuff" quicker it was actually bearable in contrast to another crappy and cliche fic about Harry being adopted by goblins - Vault of Stones which wasted a lot of time on presenting us the background of goblin (and dwarven) society before the plot even really started.

I'm currently reading too much stuff anyway, so I haven't checked your fic, thus I will get back to my eternally-planned-fic as an example.

The main divergence is that Susan Bones' was born at the end of July so Voldemort targets her (I thought of the idea when I was annoyed at yet another fic writer thinking that Bones in the Order were Susan's parents). This (along with some smaller changes to the story and bigger changes to the setting) results in a completely different situation for Harry.

His parents are pretty well known with James taking Quidditch carrier and Lily becoming researcher, he is friends with the Surviving Susan, father of his other close friend - Neville is the Minister for Magic. Dumbledore visits their house from time to time.

This situation creates a pressure for Harry, he feels that he have to match those around him. He feels that he has to achieve something - the quicker, the better. He is annoyed when he is mentioned just as Susan's friend or son of his parents. He wants to be noticed for who he is. Both this and being raised in normal family shape him significantly. He is not the same person as the canon Harry, because his circumstances were completely different.

But I won't have a million of scenes of Harry growing up. The action proper will start at the beginning of the August 1991 and then almost immediately jump to the beginning of the school year. To focus on those would kill pacing (which will be already strained because muh infodumps on magic).

It's because the fic is about Harry who isn't the famous hero but wants to be one (in contrast to canon) trying to rise to that position (ok, the fic is actually about my worldbuilding ideas). Not about how he got to the stage where he wants to attempt that. Not about how Susan a Girl-Who-Lived changed Britain. That can be gleaned from the introductory scene and later information. It's the secondary element, a background. Harry isn't even the character whose circumstances changed the most, but there won't be a 100k words about how butterflies from my changes caused characters lives to derail heavily as a result of Susan being the chosen hero.
