  As much as Harry Crow is a bad fic, it actually explored how the goblin culture shaped Harry. The goblin culture might've been badly thought out, but its influence was visible there.

Let me give a comparison that is in part unfair, but in another part it's the best comparison I can think of. In HP cano, we get to /see/ some of Harry's childhood. JKR didn't go into excessive detail, some of it was just told via narration. But we nonetheless get to see just /how/ the Dursleys treated Harry. The (or /a/) problem with Harry Crow, for me, was that we don't see a thing, we only see the end of result of how their relationship ends up. Well, confession time, I dropped the story within a few chapters. But that aside, Harry Crow jumps from "goblins get Harry" to "Harry's going to Hogwarts". It failed to do any exploration of the dramatics of Harry's childhood that established how he interacted with the goblins, it served it all up in brief mentions afterwards.

  Vault of Stones which wasted a lot of time on presenting us the background of goblin (and dwarven) society before the plot even really started.

  But I won't have a million of scenes of Harry growing up. The action proper will start at the beginning of the August 1991 and then almost immediately jump to the beginning of the school year.

As I said, I'm against belaboring unnecessary detail. Over exploration, wasting time, shouldn't be done. The WIP story you mentioned doesn't seem very ripe for pre-Hogwarts stuff; from the way you described it it seems like his development would almost /have/ to occur near school time. So I don't think it's an example of skipping over an interesting premise in the way that I was thinking of. The premise sounds interesting and wouldn't make sense if you ended up skipping over how Harry goes about making a name for himself. Then it would be an example of what I'm thinking about.
