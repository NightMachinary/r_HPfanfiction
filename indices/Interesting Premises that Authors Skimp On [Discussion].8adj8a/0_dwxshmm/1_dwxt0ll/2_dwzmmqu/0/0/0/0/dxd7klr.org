  The (or a) problem with Harry Crow, for me, was that we don't see a thing, we only see the end of result of how their relationship ends up. Well, confession time, I dropped the story within a few chapters. But that aside, Harry Crow jumps from "goblins get Harry" to "Harry's going to Hogwarts". It failed to do any exploration of the dramatics of Harry's childhood that established how he interacted with the goblins, it served it all up in brief mentions afterwards.

It heavily expanded on those mentions later on, which is probably why our perception of the matter was different.

And after the second part of your post I'm sort of at loss when it comes to what can be really seen as the example of skipping on the premise. I will probably have to take the look at that fic of yours.
