Most such stories I see just change who raised him and spend basically no time exploring what exactly was different and why that changed things. Most often I see a direct progression to Hogwarts. It's not that I want stories to belabor unimportant pre-Hogwarts stuff, but to give it at least some focus beyond vaguely mentioning it was different.

Like my situation is a bit different since the intervening years directly influence Harry's perception of the world, his attitude towards magic and what he wants to do in life, so it made sense in my head to spend a few chapters on the plot development in this section so I can try to make sense of why things aren't the same as in canon. This obviously isn't necessary for every story.

As I said in the OP, time skips and flashbacks shouldn't be dismissed, they have their use. I just wonder if the way a lot of people use them in this case amounts to little more than merging all these stories into an amorphous blob where the true premise is actually different than what you would assume going in (an excuse for Powerful!Harry)
