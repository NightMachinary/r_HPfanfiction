But oftentimes it's better to see effect of that, I've read too many fanfics of the "somehting was different about how Harry was raised" genre that were stuck for many, many words in pre-Hogwarts where nothing significant happens.

An important element of my forever-stuck-in-planning-phase fic is how the changes I made influenced the situation Harry was raised and how that affected Harry going forward. But I will only have one chapter showing Harry's home life and his environment before he goes to Hogwarts. Because showing it would ruin pacing, and took away the impact of some scenes.
