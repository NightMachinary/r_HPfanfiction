Oh that's no doubt true and in the goblin case - might as well come out and admit I was talking about that Robst fic, "Harry Crow" - it reaches absurd levels where within like 2 or 3 chapters we learn that McGonagall and every non-goblin don't know Shit about Transfiguration because they're doing it wrong. Harry comes in as a Transfiguration god; instant drop, lol.
