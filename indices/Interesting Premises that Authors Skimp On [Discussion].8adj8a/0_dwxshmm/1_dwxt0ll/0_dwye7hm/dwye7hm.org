  Story premise: "Time-travelling Merlin raises Harry". Ch. 1 consists of Merlin taking Harry... and then in the next chapter the story jumps ahead like ten years to Hogwarts. Or "Harry is raised by goblins" but then we skip from them taking him in to him getting on the train.

See, for the author in both of these examples, the true premise of the fic is likely "powerful Harry at Hogwarts". Merlin and goblins are merely plot devices - a means to an end.
