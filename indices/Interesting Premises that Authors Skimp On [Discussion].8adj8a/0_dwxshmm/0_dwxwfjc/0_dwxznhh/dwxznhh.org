Yep, that the sort of thing annoys me as well. I suppose that's why my AU fic changed so much from canon. Once I could really see how much would have to change once things like Harry running away, him living on the streets and Lucius having really been Imperiused into being a Death Eater (etc.) happened, it felt pretty freeing. Canon events are okay and all I guess, but it's just more interesting to write things in a way where everything isn't slavishly ticking off a checklist of events.
