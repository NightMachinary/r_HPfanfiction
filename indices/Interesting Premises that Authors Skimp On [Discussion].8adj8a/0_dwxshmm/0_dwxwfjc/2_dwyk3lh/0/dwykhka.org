I just felt like like nothing matters, and that is something I dislike in fics.

And I was in 200'000 words or so, because people kept recommending it. That is PS, CoS and a good chunk of PoA of a story that I didn't really enjoy.

If you can't capture me in approx. 2.5 books, I don't feel like it's my fault because I invested to little. It might be that my taste is bad, but I gave you like 17hrs of an average reader's reading time (maybe 7-9 hours of my time), that is quite a lot.
