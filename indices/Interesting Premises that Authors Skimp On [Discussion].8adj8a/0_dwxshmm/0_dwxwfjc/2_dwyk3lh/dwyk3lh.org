Too bad you stopped, things get more off-rail later on. But my point is, if those canon-except things are going to happen (and of course they shouldn't; canon divergence is always good, especially after First Year), I'd /much/ rather they happen /Animagus/-style than offscreen and then be mentioned chapters later in flashback.
