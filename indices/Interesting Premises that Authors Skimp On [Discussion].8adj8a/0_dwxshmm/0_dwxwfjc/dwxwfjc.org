Yes, but there needs to be a balance. I'm fine with the troll incident. Or with Harry duelling Draco in CoS. Or with Harry going shopping in Diagon Alley after receiving his letter. Or with the challenges of PS, and even with Ron getting KO'd there.

I'm not fine with *all* of these happening. Rehashing some events from canon, but if your story only ever differs from canon in some minor additional details then I start to feel cheated, and the author should consider doing it "Iris Potter", "A long journey home" or "The life he leads" style. All of the stories have a lot of "canon, but"-stuff happening /before/ the story starts.

For example accidental Animagus does this badly. I'm just skimming through it, but here are some examples:

- Ron enters the compartment because "All the others are full"
- Harry shoots down Malfoys "some families..." offer
- Same sperch by Dumbldore pre-sorting
- Snape is the exact same dick
- Harry gets on the Quidditch team via the remeberall, and draco snatches it from Neville, who hurt himself. Same thing as canon, only on the ground.
- Draco tries the duel
- Hagrid gives away Flamel via "thing between NF and Dumbledore"
- Harry's broom gets jinxed during his fist match, Hermione thinks it's Snape (but does nothing), and Haary catches the snitch.
- ...
- It goes like this all the way until it's revealed that Harry is a parselmouth in a duel against Malfoy initiated by Snape and Lockard when Malfoy summoned a snake. (I stopped reading threre)

This makes this story feel so /incredibly/ low-stakes and boring, because nothing the characters do /matters/. Sure, Sirius is free, but it changes nothing but some fluff anyways. I'm not saying flashbacks would have helped here, but the alternative isn't good either.
