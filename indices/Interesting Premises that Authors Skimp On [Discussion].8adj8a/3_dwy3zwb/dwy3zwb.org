Sometimes when I'm writing, I'll feel like the story is getting bogged down when I try to go through all of the details on an event. When I first started writing, I struggled with getting away from chronicling every waking moment. Harry woke up, had some toast, got dressed, got on the bus ... and on and on. So sometimes when I'm writing about an event and I feel like it's dragging the story down, I'll do it in a bit of a flashback or more likely as a conversation between two characters.

I don't think of it as skipping to the good stuff, but rather keeping the story moving forward.
