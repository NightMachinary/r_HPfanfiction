  why should anyone re-write what's already been written? if they want to tell a story about what harry (or whoever) would do after something's happened, why should they start the story before? they're interested in the consequences, not the minutiae
#+end_quote

That's not what I said, it's the opposite in fact. That they skip most or all of the preamble and leap to the consequences ends up with them rewriting canon with minor differences. The only consequences amount to things being easy because Harry/whoever was made OP.

  you clearly dislike these stories and it seems that you're just trying to validate your opinion. you don't appear to want examples of good stories that employ this AU technique (for e.g, linkffn(an unfound door)). you literally used harry crow as an example. that's just a terrible story that's also not aged well.

Well aside from your mind reading, I'll further disagree by pointing out that I never said I don't want to read stories that use time skips and flashbacks to get to the consequences. The point here is that if my intention in this thread were to look for both kinds of stories, the OP would basically be "Hey send me some good stories", which is so vague a request as to make it worthless unless one has never read an HP fanfic. I.mean, here's a relevant bit if my OP:

  Time skips and flashbacks have their place of course,
#+end_quote

Many stories retread canon (and if we cull the one-shots and two-shots, possibly most of them do so you some degree. I didn't ask for plot retreads (though I thank you for linking several stories), I was complaining about how a number of stories seem to state a premise that they mostly skip over. Worse, the consequences they prioritized over the minutiae end up being either canon retreads or canon but where Harry and co. make solving their problems look trivially easy. Harry Crow is hardly the only offender here, it was just a random fic that came to mind since it's a textbook example of this.
