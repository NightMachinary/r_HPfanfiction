No. If she were actually a major character in the series who was in on Voldemort's Horcruxes, sure. Ginny is literally a step away from being a Susan Bones/Daphne Greengrass style character where any fiction with her is really just writing a fandom approved OC. That's one of the biggest reasons people hated the epilogue pairing, Ginny's identity in a lot of peoples minds was just 'Ron's sister.'
