I'm not sure you read the last book because Neville straight up attempted to kill Nagini in front of Voldemort which would have caused Voldemort to kill him in a very painful way, but chaos broke out and Harry rejoined the fight which sidetracked Voldemort. I don't really think Bellatrix could have made him piss himself if the threat of pissing off Voldemort didn't.
