Fanfiction isn't normally that sad. Some on the opposite end of the spectrum (meaning it's even money you'll laugh out loud) include:

/Where in the World is Harry Potter/ (first of a trilogy) by nonjon [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]]

/Harry the Hufflepuff/ (first of several in a series) by BajaB [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

/The Best Seven Years/ by Blutaiger (Calvin and Hobbes go to Hogwarts) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years]]
