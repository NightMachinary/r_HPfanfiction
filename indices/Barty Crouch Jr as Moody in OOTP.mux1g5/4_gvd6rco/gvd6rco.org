Similarly to Vaccei, I recently started planning an OOTP canon-divergence story and I've been struggling to think of how I can change up the canon plot (keepin' things fresh and exciting ya know).... This idea is perfect though. I'm definitely going to incorporate it. Seriously, thank you for posting this.
