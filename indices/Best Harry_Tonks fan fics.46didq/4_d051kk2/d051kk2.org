linkffn(Renegade Cause). Quite long, almost too convoluted and complex, but still a very enjoyable read. I'm hoping the sequel is still in the works, but I'm not holding my breath.

I'll second Chelseyb as a great Harry/Tonks author. linkffn(Coping Methods by chelseyb; Catalyst by chelseyb) are probably my two favorites.
