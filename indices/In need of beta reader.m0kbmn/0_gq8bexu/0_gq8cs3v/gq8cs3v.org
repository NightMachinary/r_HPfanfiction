My story is HP fandom about frack having a twin

At first, Malfoy's twin named Margaret dislikes Harry as much as her brother does. Over time, however, tho she develops and Draco begins to see that his sister is developing a love/hate relationship with Potter that slowly shifts to more love than hate. Feelings are mutual. There will be some character death however nothing too large. This is my first pic so please be sure to leave suggestions down below. This won't have too crazy of pairings tho you will see some F/F and M/M. I wrote this because I couldn't find one like this here.
