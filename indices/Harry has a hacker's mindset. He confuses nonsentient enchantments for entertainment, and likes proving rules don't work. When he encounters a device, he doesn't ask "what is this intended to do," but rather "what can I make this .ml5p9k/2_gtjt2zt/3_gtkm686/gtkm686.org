There was another Harry Potter/Pokémon crossover I was super obsessed with - one where a kid tried to summon Pokémon into the HP reality via a spell to his DS, and ended up turning everyone into Pokémon-human hybrids. Harry was Mew(?), Ginny was a Vulpix, the twins were Sableye, Ron was a Cyndaquil, Molly was a Mawile. Problem is, I can't remember the name of it. Does anyone else know it?
