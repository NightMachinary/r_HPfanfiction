No. Harry Potter was not raised by RMS. HP is the magical equivalent of RMS!

Through the sharing of new magic's fundamental calculations and notes and using distributed spell casting, he and his friends will CRUSH the magical fascist Deatheater scum! Through the power of much tested friendship, a lot of hard and boring arithmancy and splintered fingers from wand and staffmaking trial and errors, together they must succeed!

Why did magic get so tangled up in itself? Spellmakers have been greedy, selfish and short sighted. Wizards and witches are paranoid and secretive on top of that. Families keep their home grown magic to themselves. Magical sects and cults keep their own council. Wand and staff makers only pass on their knowledge to carefully hand selected pupils who are magically sworn to secrecy with powerful bonds. On top of that, much of the original artithmantic formulas for many spell and much magic has been lost to time, negligence and burnings by both muggles and magical alike.

Is it any wonder that when Harry asked his arithmancy teacher for the spell source for the simple Lumos and she rebuked him and wagged her finger at him that he got upset, not only for himself but for his friend Hermione, whom he knew would also be very interested?

When Ron damaged his wand and Harry came with him to ask Ollivander to teach them how to fix it they got a stern talking to. While Ron seemed to be chastised, Harry was pissed off. He would get to the bottom of magic, and NO OLD FINGERWAGGERS WOULD STAND IN HIS WAY! And whatever he would learn and make, he would share!

Much carfuffle, finger wagging, raised eyebrows, stern talking to, dangerous proprietary guilds and Deatheaters who are furious on principle that this weak and pathetic new kind of magic is taking root in the muggleborn community!
