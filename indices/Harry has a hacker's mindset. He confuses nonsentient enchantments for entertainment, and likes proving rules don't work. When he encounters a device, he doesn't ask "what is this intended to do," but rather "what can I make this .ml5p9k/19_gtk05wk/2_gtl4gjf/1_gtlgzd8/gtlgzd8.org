There's a Ginny one with a similar concept to Magical Metamorphosis. She decides she's just one of the Weasley boys, not a girl (I think Molly refuses to entertain that "nonsense"), quite early on. At Hogwarts, she sleeps in one of her brothers' dorms until discovered by an authority figure and when sent up to the gjrls' dorm, the stairs collapse, which she takes as total vindication. I think it was Ron's dorm and the other boys were confused but mostly accepting?
