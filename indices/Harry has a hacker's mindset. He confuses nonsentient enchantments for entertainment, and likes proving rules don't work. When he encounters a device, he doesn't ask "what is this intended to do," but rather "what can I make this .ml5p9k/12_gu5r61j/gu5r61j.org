The people in Harry's dorm must've thought he was insane the night after the 'incident'. In-fact, most rightly could've called him off his rocker. When Harry had stormed into the clinic of the school, and professed that he'd heal an amnesiac patient with Alohamora, absolutely nobody believed that boy could do it.

The boy was staring at him with wonder, confusion, and perhaps the slightest fear. Harry gave this no mind, as he lifted his wand, and placed it to the side of Neville's head.
