In two of the stories i'm working on, Harry owns a chain of restaurants(actually, more than one but the others are just investments while these specific ones were his idea). Technically, automats. House-elves run a kitchen in the back and in the front people walk along the line, choose what they want, then pay the cashier in one while the other story has them pay at the food slot.

The idea came to me when i was trying to figure out ways for Harry to grow his wealth while watching a Doris Day movie and trying not to grumble every time they gaussian blurred her(she was getting old and she didn't want her crows feet to show). A scene in the movie happened in an automat and that pinged for me. They're so old there's like only one in the US and it became the perfect way to bridge the gap my darkness!harry sees.
