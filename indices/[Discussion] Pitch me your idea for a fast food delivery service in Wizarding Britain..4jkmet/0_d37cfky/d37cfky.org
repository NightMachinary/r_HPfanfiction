Hm. "Floo-Food", delivery through the Floo Network. (If you don't have a floo connection, you're better off apparating to the shop and getting it yourself instead of waiting for an Owl to reach the shop.)

They have all meals in stasis, pre-heated, and simply duplicate them when needed, so it's always the same (the best!) quality, and always fresh, and they offer a very wide selection of dishes. Some of their employees do nothing but travel the world and sample exotic dishes, then stasis them to sell them at the shop.

Some people claim that it's a bit too perfect, and that getting the exact same dish each time that particular dish is ordered is boring, but most customers agree that the vast selection makes up for that. They have had some lawsuits from other magical restaurants for copying their dishes, and stick to muggle cuisine nowadays.
