Yeah, AO3 benefited a lot from being founded by one of the biggest BNFs of all time, who also happened to have a huge circle of friends with a large number of aca fans, lawyers, webmasters/coders, and others with professional-level experience in fandom and related issues of copyright law who were willing to work pro bono for a cause they cared about. Your average joe-schmo fan is unlikely to be able to mobilize that level of resources and experience to help dot the i's and cross the t's.

As great as the site is, I notice fimfiction seems to be supported by ads and Patreon donations, for example, which I imagine puts it on much riskier ground, legally speaking, than AO3, if the MLP copyright holders were to decide to go after fanworks.
