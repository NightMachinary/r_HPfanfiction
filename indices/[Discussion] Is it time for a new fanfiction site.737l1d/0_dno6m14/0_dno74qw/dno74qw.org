Yeah the zero money rolling in part is what gets me. I'm an experienced web developer and like to think I could make an awesome next-gen fanfiction site, but I just don't see how I could monetize it effectively given the legal grey area fanfiction exists in. While I don't think I'm particularly greedy, I'd like to get something tangible in return for the effort I'd put in; at the very least, covering the hosting costs.
