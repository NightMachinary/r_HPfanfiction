I've found the AO3 search system to be pretty atrocious. Like, the default is searching using the top 10 tags, but if your character you want to find isn't on the list, and you don't know the precise spelling, you're going to have a hard time finding any story. And of course the tag system is atrocious, and since there's so little quality content over there it's not really worth it to search through the minefields.
