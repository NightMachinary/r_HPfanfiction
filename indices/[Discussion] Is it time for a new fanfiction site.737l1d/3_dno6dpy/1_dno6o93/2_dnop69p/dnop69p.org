AO3's search definitely has a higher learning curve than the FF.net system, but I love being able to drill down to find specific tropes I'm in the mood for. After 10 years on the site, I'm so used to AO3's tagging and filtering system that I find it nearly impossible to find anything I'd want to read on FF.net. The categories are simply too broad.

I just scroll past the fics that abuse the tagging system with dozens of tags. If you find them really annoying, you can hide additional tags by default in your preferences.

My biggest complaint about the tagging system on AO3 is that there's no way to mark primary vs secondary fandoms, characters, pairings, etc. I think if that could be differentiated when posting and searching, it would reduce some of the tag abuse as well, because there would be less incentive to tag every character who appears in the fic for so much as a single mention if people could search based on "[character] as a primary character" instead of the current system, which only allows them to search "[character]".
