I tend to think any sort of "official" list of recommendations is probably going to be a wank magnet, just because people have different tastes and one reader's trash is another's treasure. I prefer to rely on individual reccers, and really love AO3's bookmarking feature because it enables reccers to add notes about what they liked, and even additional tags (under-tagging can be just as big of a problem as over-tagging on AO3 when you're looking for something really specific). Once I find a few good fics in a new fandom, I often find more good reading just by trawling through people's bookmarks than visiting the main fandom tag.
