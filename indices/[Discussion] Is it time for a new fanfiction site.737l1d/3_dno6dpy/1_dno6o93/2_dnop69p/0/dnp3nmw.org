Agreed, the search is horrid. I feel like I have to wade through so many crap fics to find good ones. Considering how heavily people tag their fics, it should be mandatory to say your fic is unbetad, so that I can exclude them from my search. I wish there was a forum that highlighted well-written fics. Both Schnoogle (Niffler's Recommend) and Ashwinder had curated forums dedicated to just this. Though this goes back to who is being employed to do this, etc.
