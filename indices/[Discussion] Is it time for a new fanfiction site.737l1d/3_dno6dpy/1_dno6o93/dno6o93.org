The page states it is in beta for 8 years now. Apart from that the search is.. strange. Maybe it is just me or I am just not used to it, but self generated tags can be hard if you do not know exactly what you are looking for. And are the tags there also the genera category? hmm yes not bad, but not what I excpect from a search engine
