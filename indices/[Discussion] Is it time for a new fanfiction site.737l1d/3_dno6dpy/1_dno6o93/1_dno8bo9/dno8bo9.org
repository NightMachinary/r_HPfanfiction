The self-generated tags can get out of hand. I've run into some where it seems like half the fic is in the tags like a Tumblr post. I'm old, so I didn't grow up tagging the shit out of my stuff, so mine are very minimal. I find the search to be robust enough to get me a list of what I'm mostly looking for and then I can scan the tags for more detailed info.
