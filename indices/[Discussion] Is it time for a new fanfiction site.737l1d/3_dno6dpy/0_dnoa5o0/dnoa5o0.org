The problem that I have with tags in AO3 is that too many fics obuse the tag system and tag everything and every character they can possibly think of making search difficult. Unless it's something obscure or less popular, I tend to get pages and pages of completely irrelevant results because every pairing and character is included in the tags.

Also, is there a way to filter out crossovers? I don't read those and tend to get way too many of those in the results. Especially ones that for some reason tag 10+ different series and all the major characters and pairings in the series that don't even seem to be in the fic.
