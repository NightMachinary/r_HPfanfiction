If you're looking for something to template forum use in a fanfiction site setting on, perhaps check out Dokuga? It's primarily a site dedicated to sesskag (an Inuyasha ship) fanfiction and fanworks, but the forums are highly used to keep the fanbase connected even a decade or more after the series has ended. I feel that the forums play a key role in keeping the community from dying off despite how long it has been since any canon material has been released.

They also has a yearly fundraiser to help keep the site afloat, and I feel like that might be a good template to go by in how to fund and maintain a fanfiction website. Perhaps messaging the moderators/admins on their processes would be helpful in figuring out a model for your hypothetical website?

Similarly, perhaps going to some of the other archive and fansites and doing similar 'interviews' with those that run them and how they do so would be helpful in finding your own method for you and any team you put together to run with.
