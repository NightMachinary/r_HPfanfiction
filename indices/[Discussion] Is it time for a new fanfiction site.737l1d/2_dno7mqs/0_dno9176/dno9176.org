Thank you very much for this feedback. Getting a group together who work with a passion on it could be a challenge. Good search engine: Well thats my major wish as a reader, so I know that is an important one, which needs to be though through thoroughly. Enhanced file management: That is a good point, which I am kind of aware, but yet I do not know much about the requirements, as I am not a writer. Will have to look into that more. Easy favorite's organization: So you want to make multiple personal favorite lists? That sounds like a good idea, and will not be hard to implement. Thank you
