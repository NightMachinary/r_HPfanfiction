Fopr favorites, perhaps a system to put them into categories and subcategories would be nice. For example, you could add a story to your 'Harry potter's' folder, and then a subfolder for 'Super!Harry' favorites. Something that makes it easier to look through and see what type of story it is and perhaps why you favorited it to begin with.

If the user could self-label the 'folders' or lists, that would be great as well.
