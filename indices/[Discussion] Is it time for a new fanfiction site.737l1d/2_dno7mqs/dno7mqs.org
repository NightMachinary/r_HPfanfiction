I mean, I feel like almost anyone would agree that a new and stable fanfiction site with good moderation and updates would be a godsend.

The issue with this is that you aren't the first person to present the idea, and we've even had websites pop-up, with some activity. People have been tossing the thought around for years, with little to no results to show for it. It's left a lot of people sort of wary when it gets brought up again.

That said, if you feel that you can in fact get a group together to build and, more importantly, maintain a website tailored to modern fanfiction writing and reading, then by all means do so. Fanfiction.net hasn't been significantly updated or renovated in over a decade, and AO3 (being the other top popular modern site) is more useful to readers than writers, and even still it has issues with tag standardization and search-ability as a result.

My best suggestion would be to get something workable made up, get a mock-up going (one that DOESN'T look like it's 15 years out of date design wise), and go from there. Take suggestions, enter a beta-stage, and really take the time to go over feedback and build off of it. If something doesn't work, even if its a feature YOU personally like, revise it. You're making a tool for the masses and not just yourself. Likewise, don't remove or alter key features just because the masses complain, if that feature makes the rest of the site better overall.

--------------

Personally, I would advocate the following as being key to possible new fanfiction-based website that would be key.

- Increased functionality for the *writers.* Almost every fiction site currently available has piss-poor tools available to the writers themselves, beyond basic upload capability. There are no writing tools available, no customization tools, etc. And websites that DO have some of these feature either bury them deeply under other menus and features, or implement them so poorly that they're unusable regardless. Make it easy to upload works, or to write works on site and publish them from there.

- Enhanced file management. Make it easy to upload files, store files, edit files, or even change out files. Say I accidentally upload the wrong file for a chapter; make it so I can within a few click change out the file with an updated version without having to jump through 32109 hoops to do so.

- Good search engine. This may require some standardization of tags. Perhaps implement a system where new tags can be implemented if enough of the community agree to them; say the HP fandom for example. We start with some standard ship tags like Drarry or some such, but someone suggests Drapple because its in one of their stories. Perhaps the community can vote to implement the tag. Regardless of how its done, you'll need something more flexible than Fanfiction.net's but not as chaotic and user-driven as AO3's clusterfuck of tags.

- Easy favorite's organization. Make it easy for me to group together my favorited stories, and to find them. Perhaps a filing system and personal tagging system. Something that means I'm not just scrolling through a giant aggregated list. (Fanfiction.net's system for this is awful and I hate it vehemently).
