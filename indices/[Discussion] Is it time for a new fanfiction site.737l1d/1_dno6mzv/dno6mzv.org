There are several problems with running a fan fiction site.

The first is legality. Who has creative control of the work? What happens if the original author demands no one publish fanfics of their work? How do you manage this across multiple countries to ensure you don't get blocked in one and fragment the community further?

The second is draw. How do you draw authors to use your site instead of established ones? Will the new host last very long? Fanfiction sites have a history of suddenly shutting down, losing countless stories. If you suddenly become totally disgusted by the smut and trash people are posting, or if you get tired of dealing with ungrateful authors, or the cost of upkeep becomes too high, will your site disappear like so many others?

The third is management. How will stories be curated? Will they have a bloated tag system like AO3? How do you ensure stories get put in the right genre? Do you use volunteers or paid staff? What happens when the community demands a feature down the road and you don't have time to implement it?

There's already so much fragmentation within the community. I had your idea once too, and then I started looking into FFN and AO3. They had to overcome so many problems to get where they are and they still aren't perfect. Maybe you could help them out and be the savior we need?

I'm not saying don't do it. AO3 and FFN might benefit from better competition. But it's a massive undertaking. (That said, I'll help if you want it.)

Edit: I believe AO3 is under GPL and hosted on github. Maybe contributing through there would be the best help to the community?
