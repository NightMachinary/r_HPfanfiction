So Checkmated was very much a curated site focused on Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny. In order to get a story up, you had to submit it, after which it was reviewed to see if it met their criteria and then it was put in the queue to be picked up by a volunteer beta.

The site volunteers had their own forums and there was a forum to discuss/debate incoming fics and authors. With the queue system, any beta could pick up any work, but writers often found betas they liked to work with and one of the forums was dedicated to calling out these specific relationships so your work wouldn't get picked up by someone else.

Now, this site was around before the series was finished, I started reading/writing HP FF in between GoF and OOTP, so the forums were rife with speculation and it was also a place to discuss character relationships and fan fiction works. For authors, you could also have what we called "Shameless Plug" threads where you could post about a new work you'd put up. For mine, I had a whole series of works all in the same Potterverse, but I wrote them out of order and I got a lot of questions as to which order they go in, so I used the forums to keep that up to date.

The forum aspect is one thing I kind of miss. This sub fills some of that gap, but it's not quite the same.
