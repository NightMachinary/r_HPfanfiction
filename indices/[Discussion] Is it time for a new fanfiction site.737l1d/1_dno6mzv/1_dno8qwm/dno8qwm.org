This is really making me miss Checkmated. That was a pretty well-run site with a really dedicated group of volunteers. Every story had to be accepted and beta'd by one of their volunteers and I know this caused some drama, but it was a much better alternative to the wild-west of FF.net back in the day. I used to beta for them and I met people who are still RL friends, including my current beta reader. Their forums were pretty good, too.

I was so sad when the site went away. All of my reviews just went /poof/.
