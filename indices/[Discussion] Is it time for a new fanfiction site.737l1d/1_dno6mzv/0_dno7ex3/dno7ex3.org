This reply is gold, thank very much. The creative control should be always given to the author in my opinions, but I get the implications of that. Legally, you can help yourself a lot with the correct erms of use and legal notice, but yes this will still be continuous work, but so it is for almost all content publishing sites. The draw is probably the most important. Do I want to pay for the system for 2 years if only a few are using it... hmm Curatiors... thats a point where I have to say I do not know the community well enough to decide. Very good point to think of! Major feature implementation could work well with a donation/headhunter system. But need carefull explanation. The fragemantion is a vital point actually, a new site shoud not divide further but one site to rule them all, one site to find them, one site to bring them all and in the darkness bind them... wait taht was something different... but I think you get what I mean.

I will have a closer look at the systems and community of FFN and AO3
