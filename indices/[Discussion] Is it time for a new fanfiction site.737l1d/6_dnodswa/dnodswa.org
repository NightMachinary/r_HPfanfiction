Over the years I have found that the sites with more options...just annoy me. I know its oddly counterintuitive, and I hate that I cannot filter and sort better on FFN.. but the descriptions and tags and pairing lists and everything else just clutter up my brain and I find myself going back to simpler searches...

As for whether a new site can make it today... not if you are concentrating on Harry Potter. You have to jump on board the next Fan Fic hype train and get a bunch of authors to post their stuff to your site, which they would probably do in addition to posting it on FFN.

That means that FFN will keep its users, and only a handful of new users will make their way to the new site. The only caveat being if your site allows higher content ratings and directs people to read the "Full Version" on your site. I've seen this happen a few times, but generally users will follow the link for THAT story...and just end up going back to the site they have preferred for several years.

Now if someone can make a "google" for fanfic sites, that indexes all the stories and ratings and pairings, and allows you to search them all at once...
