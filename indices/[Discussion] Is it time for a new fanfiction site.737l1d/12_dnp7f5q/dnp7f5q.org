That would be a lot of effort on not only yourself but others who are willing to help you. Would you really be willing to take the time and energy that it takes to create such a site? Note not being rude here, just merely curious.

Because if you are I'd be all for it, but it doesn't really seem like that good of an investment when you will not get any money or anything like that out of it.

If you and others are willing to take the time and energy to do this, it will probably take quite a while I'd imagine to set it up, but if you are willing to do this I'd be more then willing to use the site.
