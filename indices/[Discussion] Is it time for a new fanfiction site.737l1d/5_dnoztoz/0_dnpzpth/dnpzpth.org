I agree with this.

Netflix used to base recommendations off how people rated the movies they watched out of five stars.

Now they mostly base recommendations off what movies you actually watch and what movies you actually finish.

Rather than a rating system, a good fanfic site should have a good recommendation system. "Hey, you and these 14 other users all finished Story A, and 11 of them went on to finish Story B, too. Why not try Story B?"
