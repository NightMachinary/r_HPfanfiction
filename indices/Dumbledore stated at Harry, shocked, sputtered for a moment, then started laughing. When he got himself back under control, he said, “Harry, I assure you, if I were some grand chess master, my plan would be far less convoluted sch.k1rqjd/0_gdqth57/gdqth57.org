"You made me fight a bloody Basilisk in my second year!"

"I made you? No, Harry, it was /you/ who made the decision to go to the Chamber of Secrets, accompanief with naught but your friend Ronald and a teacher you knew was a fraud. Those actions can only be put on /your/ head."

"And what about Sirius, huh? You wanted him gone so I could grow unloved and weak by the Dursleys! Even after you knew I knew about his innocence, you didn't grant him a trial!"

"Of course, Harry. Just let me use my almighty political power to grant a trial to someone whom absolutely everybody is convinced is guilty of treason, mass murder, and more. I am sure that will go well for all of us."

"You could have used Veritaserum for the trial! Or your memories of seeing Pettigrew! Or hell, our for that matter!"

"Veritaserum does not force you to tell the truth, only a version of the truth you believe in. Harry, if I wanted Sirius Black gone from your life, I'd just kill him. And if I wanted you "weak and unloved", I'd have sent you to an orphanage, where I know wizards are treated poorly by the other children."

"And what about the tournament, huh? You-"

"Magical contract. Again, if I wanted to test you, I wouldn't need to let a /Death Eater/ enter my /school/, polyjuiced as one of my most trusted friends. I would just have put your name in myself."

I could go on and on, but I'm bad at conclusions. So cheers!
