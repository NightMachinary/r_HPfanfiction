Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery by semprini on ffnet is quite good. He takes on the post in 6th year I believe - not sure if your looking solely for ones post-hogwarts, but if your open to still in Hogwarts, this is one of my favorites and it's part of a series (there are 2 more after this one)
