I guess Core Threads might not be the best to compare to because he doesn't get near god level like he does in Core Threads. He's closer in terms of raw power (possibly exceeds) to Sun Source. This is a spoiler but not a huge one: he takes on both Dumbledore and Voldemort at the same time, and doesn't die. So it's like that, maybe heading more Merlin level. Still a pretty great ffn in my opinion.
