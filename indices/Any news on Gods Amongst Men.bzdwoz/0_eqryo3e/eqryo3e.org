I've read both of those stories, but never read Gods Amongst Men. Does he really get that powerful to be mentioned along side Core Threads(where he has Death as a literal aspect of his mind), and Sun Source(which has him be able to do frankly impossible things WITHOUT magic)? If so, could you maybe give me a hibt of the power he wields.
