Wow, okay so I just went and read In the mind of a scientist and damn that's a great fan fiction. I'm almost done with Madness at the gate already haha. Good call, though one of my only complaints is the low amount of magic. Obviously Madness at the gate would have less but even Mind of a scientist it was mostly potions, science and some magic. That was one of the things I loved about the stories I mentioned, is the high amount of magic described. I havent read Mage of Krypton, I'll check it out! Like my previous sentence mentioned, does it have a lot of Harry using magic or mostly other powrda with a little magic? I'm sure ill read it either way, just curious.
