Well, in Mage Of Krypton he learns some wandless Kryptonian magic that runs a different system to HP magic. While not as flexible as HP magic in my opinion, it is unique in it's use. I won't say anymore, but apart from me not liking him having no resistance to magic(while everyone supposedly has some, but the author decided that for some reason a Superman that can use magic is more vulnerable to it than even the average Superman. What?!?).

I did enjoy the story for a good bit. I might go back to it one day if I can ever get over such a stupid, and obvious plot weakness. Meaning that it was placed there just to give him a stronger weakness to magic. Which I think is both stupid, and makes no sense since his vulnerability comes from him not being able to use it in comics.

Getting back to the question(sorry for the rant), yes the story does delve into magic quite a bit, and even different magic systems. He is quite powerful in this story, but I left right as Voldemort, and ??? started collecting ??? in ??? which I believe the author purposefully did to exploit Harry's weakness-which-makes-no-sense to magic.
