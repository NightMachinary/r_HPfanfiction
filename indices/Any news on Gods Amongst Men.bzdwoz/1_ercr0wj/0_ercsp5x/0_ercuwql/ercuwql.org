In the mind of a scientist. Harry is a genius in science to the point that by the time he fights Voldemort, it's so easy that he only draws his wand once. He uses his knowledge to improve himself physically by a huge degree(think spider-man levels), and is just massively intelligent. It's sequels are crossovers with Stargate, and then Mass Effect. It's just incredible how powerful he gets by that point(enough to hurt Anubis who is partially Ascended, and was able to destroy four Hataks at once, and steal the last one. He did that on his own). If you want OP Harry, and an enjoyable story, this is my suggestion.

Mage Of Krypton is my go to Superman Harry stories. I think it's at the fifth, or sixth book at this point, and Harry is Superman, but that doesn't automatically mean he wins every fight. It's grounded more than you'd think without downplaying the pure physical might of Harry.
