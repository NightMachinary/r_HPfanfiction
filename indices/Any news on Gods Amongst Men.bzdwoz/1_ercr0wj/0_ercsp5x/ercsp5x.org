Well mostly because I'm still fairly new to fanfiction so I still haven't gotten the tropey stories out of my system. Most stories that are not OP Harry just bore the shit out of me, because otherwise (purely in my opinion) they're the same as any other magic fiction I've read, which then makes if feel pointless to me. I do cringe at many moments throughout a lot of these stories though, especially parts where angsty teen Harry tells off someone in a way where they just sound like a teenager.

I can't find ITMOAS, what does that stand for? For an original, OP Harry with a crossover, I recommend checking out The Other Krptonian. Here it's done well and the crossover is awesome.
