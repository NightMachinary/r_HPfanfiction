I just read the first few chapters, and I have to ask. Why do you like this so much? It is so tropy, and cliche that it hurts to read. It has the goblins don't get remembered trope, it has the goblins falling all over themselves when treated with respect trope, it has Harry who is basically a strong male fanon Hermione in spirit, it has getting rid of the Horcrux makes him super Harry trope, it has Harry making millions from the Basilisk trope, it has Fleur, and Gabrielle needing saving/being damsels in distress being saved by Harry, and others that I have no reason to list since you get the point. Why, why do you like this crap?

Core threads is very unique in a lot of ways, which is why we can ignore a lot of the tropes. The same goes for Sun Source. Gods Amongst Men has no such redeeming quality. It is a story i've read many times when I was new to HP fanfics, and was an angsty little shit. While I can see myself maybe being in the mood for such stories from time to time, it's very rare these days. If I look for a godlike Harry these days, I want it to be interesting. Like maybe a crossover done right, or a unique magic system. Maybe the strangley rare scientist Harry, as in an actual scientist, not just a smart, because the author says.

With all these options, why do you read that fic in particular? Why not ITMOAS. A little tropy, but very unique, and a story i've read many times including the sequels. How about Seventh Horcrux. Again tropy, but something that this community in general agrees is hilarious. Both also feature a OP Harry. There are many more, but you get the point.
