Closest I could think of off the top of my head: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] both have some great heist-ish elements. Without spoiling anything too much, Bungle involves a diverse magical team on a sort of archaeological expedition running up against serious defenses. Black Comedy involves vigilante raiding of Death Eater's homes for fun and profit.

Just wondering OP, would you consider the trio going after Bellatrix's vault a heist?
