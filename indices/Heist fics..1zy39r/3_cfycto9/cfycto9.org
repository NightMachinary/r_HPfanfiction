  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

This is currently a WIP but it has several heists and there are more still to come. If time travel, lunar harmony and some bashing don't get your hackles up this should be very enjoyable, as the tone is somewhat similar to A Black Comedy.
