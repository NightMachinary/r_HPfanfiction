I know of two OC fics that take place in Egypt, heist-like in /The Mummy/ and /Lara Croft/ way respectively--[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=148616][Black Sands]] (which isn't yet abandoned) and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=261430][Saharan Lies]] (which probably is); and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][my fic]] which I feel silly for linking again so soon, but it's partly inspired by /Ocean's 11/ and features in-Hogwarts heists.
