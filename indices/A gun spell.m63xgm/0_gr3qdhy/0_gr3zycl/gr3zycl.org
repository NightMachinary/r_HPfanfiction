Depends on how that hex and magic in general works in your universe?

Is it a magical construct that disintegrates a column of material on impact? Protego or shields that disrupt magical structures (if those exist) might counter that.

Or maybe it conjures an object from thin air? Conjurations tend to be reversed or undone entirely by powerful wizards.

Maybe using a "real" object, as in "not created or transformed by magic" might be beneficial. Like, in my head canon, magic can /either/ quick and dirty force an object (or a part of the world) into a required state (match to needle, rags to clothes, wood to chair), /or/ permanently change the very being of the object/materials, so that it doesn't change back later, at the expense of "magic energy", time, or some kind of ritual.

So under these rules, undoing or disrupting a conjured object is as "simple" as overpowering the magic that holds the object real, same for reverting a transfiguration unless it's permanent. Magic is forcing the reality to change, and reality /really/ doesn't want to be changed and wants to go back.
