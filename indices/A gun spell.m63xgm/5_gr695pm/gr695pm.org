A far better option is to enhance guns with magic. If Arthur Weasley can charm a Ford Anglia to fly and go invisible, it should be a lot easier to make guns that:

- have vastly expanded magazines
- have magically cooled barrels
- are lightened and recoil free

But why stop here? Why not create magical bullets that can carry Unforgivables, especially Avada Kedavra? Now your magically enhanced gun will be able to fire killing curses:

- at 500 RPM, or at least twenty times faster than spelling it out
- without emotional component
- at least twice the range
- far more accurately because no need for complex wand movement
