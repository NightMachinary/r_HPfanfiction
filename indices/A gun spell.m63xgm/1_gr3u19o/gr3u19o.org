That's a tall order---unless it's crack (no pun intended) illustrating how impractical it is.

The biggest advantages that guns have over spells are rate of fire (if automatic), effective range (due to being easier to aim), and maybe projectile speed (assuming spells move slower than bullets). linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) explores all these well.

The spell you describe seems to be a very complicated way to lose two out of three of those advantages without gaining anything in return over and above an actual gun. Unless you have non-canon magic that, say, specifically targets firearms and has a large area of effect, if you are able to disable someone's gun with magic, you can probably able to disable their wand, or even the whole person.
