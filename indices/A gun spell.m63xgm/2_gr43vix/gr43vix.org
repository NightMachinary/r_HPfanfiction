That sort of does happen, although never explicitly. Often a standard tactic in fanfic fighting is to 'banish' conjured or summoned projectiles such as pieces of rubble at their opponent. A typical example might be 'summon a marble block to stop a killing curse, it is shattered on impact so banish the shards at your opponent' which is effectively a magical shotgun blast.
