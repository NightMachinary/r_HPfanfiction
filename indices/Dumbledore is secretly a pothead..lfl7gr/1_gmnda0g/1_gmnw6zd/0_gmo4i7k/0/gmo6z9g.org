Haha I would like to write my dumbledore similar to this, but the very beginning of my first chapter has my voldemort commiting an act so vile against house dumbledore that it might be hard to to write him as being so upbeat and cheery.

If your curious what I'm having V do to dumbledore so early, I can PM you with a clipping of the text. I kinda wanna see what someone else thinks of it anyways lol
