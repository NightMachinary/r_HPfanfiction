Cool. How much do you want? I'm still working on the first chapter, but I can send up to 5092 words, which is where I'm currantly at. Im actually writing as we speak lol. If you want to read it all that's fine, and likely helpful. I always reread my work a lot to catch errors and inconsistencies, but another pair of eyes is always nice
