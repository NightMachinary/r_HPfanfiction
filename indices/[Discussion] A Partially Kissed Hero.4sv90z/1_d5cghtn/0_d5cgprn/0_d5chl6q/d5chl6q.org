Terribly evil!Dumbles (literally moustache twirling), over the top evil!Snape, a plot that is nonsensical and utterly incoherent /at best/. Time travel which makes absolutely zero sense. A weird section about how Muslims are evil. Stupid fairy shit. And those are /the good/ parts of the fic.

When a friend of mine got his wisdom teeth removed, the painkillers made him think the trees were out to kill him (a frightening proposition since our part of the country is one big forest). This fic makes that hallucination seem reasonable by a sober man's standards.
