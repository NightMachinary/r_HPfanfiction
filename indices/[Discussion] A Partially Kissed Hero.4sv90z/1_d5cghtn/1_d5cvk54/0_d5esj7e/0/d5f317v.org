Well, about the latter - depends on a case. Good archer can do some tricky things that are impossible with a gun, like firing in arcs to hit something behind the wall or delivering something (a letter or 20g of TNT in arrowshaft, with pressure sensitive detonator in arrowhead).

So if you need something like this - bow rules. On the other hand, in actual combat, any modern rifle is a better option.
