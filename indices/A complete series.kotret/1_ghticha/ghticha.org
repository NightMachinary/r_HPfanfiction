White Squirrel's linkffn(Arithmancer) series is complete. Bear in mind that a lot of it is focused on world-building and imagining what magic could be made to do, with the plot as an important but secondary concern, especially in book 2. But the world-building is interesting in its own right. (Harry doesn't own a snake, and is not in fact the main character.)

The linkffn(Backward with Purpose) series is also complete; at one point there was some confusion about book 3, but IIUC it was brought to a quick end and then folded into book 2. The first book is reasonable, but The Book of Albus is the one that really impressed me.

And linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is not /quite/ complete, but is close to the end and updating regularly. I've read a few different Severus/Lily stories, and this one's my favourite of them. It really gets inside both their heads, especially Severus', examining his strengths and his flaws. He gets a lot of things wrong, even with the benefit of experience, but his loyalty to Lily is constant.

(Sorry, none of these have pet snakes. The Pureblood Pretense has one, but isn't complete.)
