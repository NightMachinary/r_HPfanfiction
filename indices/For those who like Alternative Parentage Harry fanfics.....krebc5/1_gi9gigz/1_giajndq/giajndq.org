From this list, only 'Harry Riddle' and 'The Veiled Truth' are completed.

'Riddle's Son' was updated last August.

'How Like Hatred' isn't completed, but the author does this thing where they write out and post a whole 'arc' so to speak, so you aren't left with cliffhangers and get a mostly satisfying experience.

'the parseltwins' is regularly updated, last updated two days ago.

'enigma' was last updated in December and seems to get regular long updates.
