Ah it's been so long since I've gone through my Drarry fics. :D

linkffn(4726251) / Must Love Quidditch by dracosoftie (that author has lots of other good drarry)

linkffn(11331493) / So Worth the Yearning For by digthewriter (who has other drarry stories)

linkffn(7402541) / Bollocks by faithwood (has other Drarry stories too. this one doesn't have much in the way of much smexiness, but it's cute. other faithwood stories do, tho)

linkffn(3712739) /Polyjuice Pastime by Cheryl Dyson (wish she continued giving herself to birthday gift... also a good Drarry author)

linkffn(8108376) / Learn to Love by SoulMalady (family Drarry - Draco with Scorpius falls for Harry)

Blah, not done going through favorites list, but falling asleep. :D Enjoy those!
