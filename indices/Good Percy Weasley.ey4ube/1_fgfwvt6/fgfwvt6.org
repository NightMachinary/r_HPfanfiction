Someone else got you the answer. If you like Good Percy, also gonna recommend one of my favorites, linkffn(12181042). It's (I think) canon compliant about what Percy, Fleur, Bill, and Audrey get up to during the war, basically setting up a way to save muggleborns. Really good story, really intense. Warn that there is some smut going on but it doesn't overwhelm the story like some smut stories can.
