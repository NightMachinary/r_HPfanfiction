  Instead of trying to have Barty impersonate an auror for an entire school year, intact an insanely elaborate plan entering Potter into the tournament where he could die multiple times, only to kidnap him in the end, why don't you just have Barty kidnap Potter on the Hogwarts express at the start of term?

  Scott...ya just don't get it, do ya? You don't.
