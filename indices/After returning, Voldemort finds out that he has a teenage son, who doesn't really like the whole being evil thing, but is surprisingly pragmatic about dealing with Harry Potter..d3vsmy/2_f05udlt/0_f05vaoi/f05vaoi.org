I just watched the Austin Powers movie where Doctor Evil and his son Scott constantly disagree on how to properly do stuff, and imagined Voldemort in the same situation. Delphi would work too, but I was thinking someone who would be a little older than Harry and a young adult by the time Voldemort returns so that we can have scenes where father and son are trying to manage the Death Eater movement but disagree on stuff.
