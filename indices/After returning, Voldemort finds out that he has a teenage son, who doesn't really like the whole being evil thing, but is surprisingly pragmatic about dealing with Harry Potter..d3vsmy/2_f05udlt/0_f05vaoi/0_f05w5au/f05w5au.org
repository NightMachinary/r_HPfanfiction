Voldemort would never admit it out loud but he enjoys the fact his son often disagrees with him, and not a feeble disagreement but a ruthless calculated disagreement filled with logic and reasoning's, Voldemort had actually enjoyed debating in Hogwarts as a youth, and while he did enjoy the sheer terror he admitted in his followers he greatly enjoyed having someone who shared his brilliance and someone he could bounce ideas off and someone who would not just grovel. I mean nobody had suggested to him before to just wait till Dumbledore died of old age before starting his next attempt at power.
