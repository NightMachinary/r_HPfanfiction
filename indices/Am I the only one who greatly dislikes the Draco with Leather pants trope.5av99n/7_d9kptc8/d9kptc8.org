Heh, for a moment I thought you were referring to fics where Draco literally wears leather pants (there are many, and I hate most of them).

As for the trope itself...no, not really. In the hands of an excellent author that trope could certainly be spun the right way. I do get what you're saying, though, but in the end it really depends on the talent of the author writing the trope.
