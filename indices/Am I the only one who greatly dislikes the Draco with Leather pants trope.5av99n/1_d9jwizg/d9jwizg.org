One can generally assume that any question on the Reddit that begins with, "Am I the only one who...?" will

a) make everyone roll their eyes b) return a lot of "No, same"s.

Obviously many people dislike that trope. While I wish more people would literally write "Voldemrot" wearing leather pants, we can safely assume that you are not alone in disliking the slimming down of negative character traits.
