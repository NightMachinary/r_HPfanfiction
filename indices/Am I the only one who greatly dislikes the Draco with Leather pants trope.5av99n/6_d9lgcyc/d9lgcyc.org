What I've never understood about the need to make Draco OOC in order to shoehorn him into a romance (seriously, he's a piece of shit) is that people could literally just use Theodore Nott and not have to write him out of character. Most of what we know about him is also true of Draco:

- Son of a Death Eater

- Slytherin

- Pureblood

The only other things he doesn't have in common with Draco is his mum is dead and he wasn't played by Tom Felton. He's otherwise a blank slate.

Any story that puts Leather Pants on Draco could just substitute Nott with minimal extra work.
