I don't mind it as long as the author does it well and explains it well. Just like any troupe, there are exceptions to the rule. I can tolerate Draco redeemed much more than Snape because Draco really was just a brainwashed kid, but Snape was an adult and an asshole and a terrible teacher. I've never read an LV pairing because the idea alone it's such a turn off I won't even try.
