  He never changed his mind. He never saw the light. He just wanted to save his own ass.

You do realize that he was 16-17 during all of this, and at one point his /parents/ were being held hostage? Despite what you, the reader feels about Lucius and Narcissa, remember that Draco, the character obviously loved them. Also remember that he knew damned well who Harry and Hermione were when they were brought to Malfoy Manor. He did what he could and waffled on identifying them which is what bought them the time they needed to escape. I always felt that his portrayal in those last two books was quite a bit of character development. As far as "saving his own ass" goes, that's what most people would do, let's be honest. Harry's rush in to save the day mentality is really the abnormal one here.

And yeah, in the epilogue he and Harry share a polite nod. I really don't see how you read so much into that. He didn't speak, he didn't even emote. There was nothing implied about his current attitude towards anything whatsoever in that nod.
