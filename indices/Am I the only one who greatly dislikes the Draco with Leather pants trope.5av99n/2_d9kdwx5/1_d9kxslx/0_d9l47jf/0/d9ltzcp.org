I think we agree for the most part? haha Your assessment of his character is more or less what I gathered. He was raised in a very secluded social group, who felt a certain way. He was a snotty little brat of a kid and did what snotty little brats do best. Then he started to get older and there were expectations that he wasn't prepared for.

I never saw Draco as this great evil in Harry's life. They disliked each other and both of them were petty little assholes at times. The books are written from Harry's POV and therefore of course it seems like it's Draco's fault most of the time. I'll admit that Draco may have "started it" a bit more often in the interactions we see, but it's pretty obvious that Harry wasn't some innocent little lamb being preyed upon. Harry was also an obnoxious little snot in his own ways, it's just he's the protagonist of the story and so it was always portrayed differently than the antagonists.

In the end, I think Draco did learn some lessons. Maybe he didn't make a complete 180 on his world view, but in my private little head canon I like to imagine that he came out of the experience a little more mature and aware of the "bigger picture." I kind of like it that way, as well. Maybe he doesn't spend his free time cuddling small muggle children but he's at least got a bit more of a worldly view on things.

That's one reason I love Draco as a character. He, more than anyone else in the books has /potential/ in character development. He has this opportunity to be a wonderfully complex and intricate character. We don't know what kind of person he grew to be in those 19 years after he left Hogwarts with his parents. I never bought into the "redemption" nonsense because Draco doesn't need to be redeemed. He's not some mustache twirling villain who's burned villages and raped innocents. He was a kid who believed what he was taught without questioning, and then learned a hard lesson as a result. I don't think he'd ever become what a lot of people consider a "good guy." He'd always have that edge, that aloofness, that deep-seated desire to be better than others because when you're raised with a particular view on life it's really difficult to shake, even if you know it's wrong. In my imagination I see him softening his views on muggleborns and muggles in general, but still not jumping full in on the love-fest, so to speak. An "I can live alongside them, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be best friends with one" sort of attitude.

But yes, Draco is a much better character when the author isn't treating him as evil incarnate OR making him morph into some bleeding heart cuddle bunny because he 'saw the Light' or some nonsense.
