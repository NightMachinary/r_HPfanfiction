Yup that's pretty much it, but at a certain age that just makes him quite pathetic.

At least intellectually he he should be able to make the connection to the real world at some point (even if he doesn't understand pain, suffering, etc on an emotional/instinctual level), but it never seems like he does. When innocent bystanders like Cedric Diggory (who could and should be a great asset to wizarding bloodlines - he's a champion after all) get murdered by that psychopath it should mean something... but he never catches on.
