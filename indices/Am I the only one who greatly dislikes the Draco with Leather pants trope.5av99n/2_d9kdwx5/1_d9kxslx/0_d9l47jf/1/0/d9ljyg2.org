Oh he is very much pathetic by the end of the books, he hasn't really done anything to make him develop, he's just the spoiled kid who got kicked in the mouth and is confused by what the sensations that his body is sending him and reeling from the shock of it and not sure what to do as he doesn't seem to have the sense of self needed to make the decision as to how he should react to them.

I very much enjoy when an author takes the challenge of expanding on his development and actually makes him think about it all.

What I do not like is when someone gives him a long ass lecture about why all of his beliefs are wrong, mary sue style, and he does a 180 on his way of viewing things. It ruins the entire story and the author should stop writing that fic and realize they are writing trash when they do what is equivalent to pulling back the curtain and yelling at the audience. It is bad and lazy writing.
