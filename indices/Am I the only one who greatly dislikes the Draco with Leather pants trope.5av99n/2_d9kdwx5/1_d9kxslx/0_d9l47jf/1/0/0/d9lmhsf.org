  What I do not like is when someone gives him a long ass lecture about why all of his beliefs are wrong, mary sue style, and he does a 180 on his way of viewing things.

I don't disagree... What's even worse though is just not addressing it at all and making up some bullshit about him being misunderstood or hiding behind appearances and secretly always having been in love with Hermione.

Clearly if you want to write about Draco as a protagonist there needs to be some kind of course correction for his character (no-one wants to read about a racist dumbass protagonist... okay, almost no-one). I think you're on the right track that he needs to be confronted with realities and ripped out of his sheltered existence.
