If you are going to bring him over to the 'light' sure, or you can give the reasons why and detail them out and make him actually not flinch at their applications, be competent and a little sadistic. He can be a wonderfully dark character depending on how you write him. It's mainly about the balance, if you have more than one competent person on each side with actual power and influence, then you have a story where things get an audience that will stick around to see who walks away alive and bloodied.

Making one side overly competent and the other cartoonishly dumb doesn't do anyone any favors Unless they like to read boring stories where they overcome things without any hardship.
