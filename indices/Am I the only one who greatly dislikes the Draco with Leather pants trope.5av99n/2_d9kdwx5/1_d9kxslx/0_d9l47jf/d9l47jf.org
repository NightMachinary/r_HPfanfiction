JK wasn't the best at tending to all the characters development in the way that a great author should. A lot happened in the last book and you don't really get any good amount of mouth time from Draco, and the epilogue tells us nothing beyond that a lot of people had a good amount of sex and had kids because of it.

For me, Draco was just a scared kid who's family got taken for a ride by a loony, but his parents drank the cool aid because it was similar to something they had in the wine cellar in bulk, this was just a new vintage.

At no point do we see him do anything of note that could be considered helping them bring down voldy, hell, he gets berated by one of his former underlings for being incompetent. He's floundering because he's been taught all his beliefs in a marble room with fine silver on the table and silk to cover his morning wood, but no substantial exposure to anything close to the reality of the things he keeps saying. 'You'll be next mudbloods!' Is a perfect example of this. The cat that everybody hates is dead (frozen petrified, not dead), and the guy who wants to make him miserable is sad because of it. There is no blood, no screams, no open wounds with bruises around them for him to see, just 2 things that he hates, hurting or gone, and he proclaims that all shall be next that are like them, unclean, impure, and time goes on.

Years pass and he rides the coattails of his father's power, which exists because of voldemort. He lords it over people, badgering them, calling them names, might get in one or 2 fights, but nothing happens serious. Then he gets handed a badge and told to do it more like a good boy and go further than he has been, so he does.

Still no blood or actual consequence beyond his toys and privileges taken away.

Oh his father is in jail? He'll be out soon, the dark lord is back, the one who gave his father the power that Draco grew up with, and now that he's back, it's sure to grow more when people see he's back in the open.

Then he's given an immposible task, kill a god, or the closest in his mind. What else could defy his Lord? And he's scared and trying all these things to do it, but ends up failing, someone else does it and gets credit, and suddenly life starts to lose it's luster.

He failed as his father did, and no one wants to hear about it this time.

People actually start dying, families ripped apart, damaged, there's actual blood this time.

Shit.

Parents locked in their own house.

No.

No glory for their efforts for their Lord.

Stop.

Left on a shelf with other broken things.

Wasn't supposed to be like this!

And then Potter comes and knocks down the proverbial door and kicks a few hornet nests, Draco gets called to fight again, doesn't do very well, and in the midst of the final battle he gets walked out of the conflict with his mother holding him. Taking him away, while the monster who lied to them with honeyed words is still banished.

They recover, and keep their wealth.

Time goes on, and as always, we are British, appearances must be kept, we are the Malfoys, Draco, walk tall.

You are better than the others, don't let them forget it.

They bring the old vintage up from the wine cellar and pour a fresh glass.

Well that got a little away from me, but yeah, Draco didn't really learn anything on screen or page on focus, and saying he did after the writing is over, is just really bad and lazy form. To me he got finally saw a lynching and was horrified when all the things he grew up with didn't match what he dreamt then to be and cried to his mom and dad who took him away from it.
