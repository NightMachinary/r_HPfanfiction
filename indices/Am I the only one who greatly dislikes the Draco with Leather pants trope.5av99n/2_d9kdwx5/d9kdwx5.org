Short answer:

No.

Long answer:

No, you're not the only one who dislikes that trope, and I can say why I dislike it -- it renders a story spineless and ruins what could be a truly great character.

That probably sounds crazy, but it's true. Draco Malfoy could be great (not necessarily Good^{^{TM}} ) character to read about ... as long as he isn't OOC.

In theory, Malfoy could work as a love interest. Yes, he could be a lead in a romance story, the genre that I despise the most in this fandom. And I despise it because to make people like Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape or Voldemort/Tom Riddle or whoever palatable, they are always turned into whitewashed Heathcliffs where their defects are quirks to brood over or unhealthily romanticize.

That's the coward's way out.

Draco Malfoy is a stuck-up bully and a bigot. He wants a sizable portion of the magical population, Muggle-borns, to die. The only reason he turned his back on the Dark Lord was because Malfoy and his family were personally endangered by Voldemort.

He never changed his mind. He never saw the light. He just wanted to save his own ass.

Even his mellowed attitude in the epilogue comes off as one of middle-aged "let's tolerate the lesser people," at best, especially if you ignore all the (often contradictory) interview and Pottermore George Lucas-ing.

Now take that Malfoy, the real one, the spoiled, bigoted, cruel, bullying asshole and make him into someone that could be understood instead of misunderstood; make him change himself instead of changing canon; make him raw and human and flawed, and /then/ you will have a story where he's worth reading about.

Redemption can work if you don't flinch at the ugly stuff.
