linkffn(living with danger)

this is 5 books long and around 2.5million words total

It's Remus saving him first but Sirius comes along and they raise him together with their wives and a couple of other children from the series (no spoilers). It's really good from memory although the description that's about to be linked is a bit cringe and definitely not the original one haha.
