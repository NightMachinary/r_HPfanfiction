I'm more focused on the actual "Harry broke the fucking law and should be kicked out of school for it aspect" not the "a magic terrorist might come back" aspect. Besides considering how many powerful wizards like Dumbledore exist, I'm not even 100% convinced that if they'd gathered a bunch of stupid powerful wizards that they couldn't have gathered and destroyed the horcruxes themselves
