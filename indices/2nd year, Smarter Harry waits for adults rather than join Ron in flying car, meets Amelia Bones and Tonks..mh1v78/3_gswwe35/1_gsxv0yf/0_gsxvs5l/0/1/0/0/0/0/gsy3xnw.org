Seriously? Wow I did not remember that first part. In that case they probably wouldn't do it because arresting hundreds of wizards at the quidditch game would be problematic so they just wipe the memory and move on.

Hermione definitely would've been expelled had she been caught. But she wasn't caught. Hagrid also should probably go to jail but Dumbledore interceded on his behalf and got off with a broken wand the first time and I'm pretty sure didn't get caught later on. And Snape possibly would've been pardon but died before he faced a jury
