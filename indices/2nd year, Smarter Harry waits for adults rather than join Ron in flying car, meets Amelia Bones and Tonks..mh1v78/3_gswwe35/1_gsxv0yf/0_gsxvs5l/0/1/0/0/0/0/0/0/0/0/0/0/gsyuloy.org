The way I see it is a range of severity. While yes Bagman and the other wizards broke the rules, it's a relatively easy fix. They know who they're mind wiping. Like you said, they've got an actual system for dealing with this kind of thing. Some idiot accidentally shows the muggle selling tickets magic, quickly obliviate them no harm no foul. We see this in Fantastic Beasts 1 when Newt accidentally shows Jacob magic and is prepared to obliviate him, almost like this is a common occurrence. However Harry and Ron didn't just accidentally show a spell to a specific muggle that someone can quickly obliviate. They flew the car over the heavily populated London in the middle of the day. The ministry now has to figure out how many people saw it, who saw it, and track those people down to wipe their minds. And they have to account for who saw it, who they might've told, and whether or not people will believe them and possibly spread the word. If some homeless guy sees than it's not a big deal. But if a respected government official sees it than your secret world isn't gonna be a secret for much longer. This is why it's expected that this be made clear to all 11 year old wizards, arguably making it irrelevant if Hagrid actually told Harry. If the wizarding world had been exposed that day, I highly doubt the courts would give Harry a pass because the giant who picked him up forgot to mention that showing magic to muggles is a big nono
