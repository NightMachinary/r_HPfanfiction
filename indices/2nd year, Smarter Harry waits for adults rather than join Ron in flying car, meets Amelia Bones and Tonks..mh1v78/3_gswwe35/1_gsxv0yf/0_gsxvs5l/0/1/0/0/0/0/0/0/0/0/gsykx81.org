I imagine "don't do magic in front if muggles" would be one of the first things you learn when entering the wizarding world because it is so very important that they remain secret. When a muggle develops wizard powers it's probably one of the very first things the wizard who comes to their house will tell them because 11 year olds are dumb and learning that they have magical powers would be something that they would absolutely tell their friends about unless it's made abundantly clear to them that it's illegal and they will be in a lot of trouble, real trouble not "oh it'll be okay as long as I don't get caught". Exposing the magical world isn't like sticking your hand in the cookie jar when your mom's mot looking. They would definitely stress the real world importance and real world consequences for exposing magic. Harry would absolutely know this because there's no way that this wouldn't be one of the incredibly important things that Hagrid would stress when Harry learns about the Wizarding World. It's kinda like copyright where the rules are made clear and if you don't abide by or remember them that's on you and you will still be punished
