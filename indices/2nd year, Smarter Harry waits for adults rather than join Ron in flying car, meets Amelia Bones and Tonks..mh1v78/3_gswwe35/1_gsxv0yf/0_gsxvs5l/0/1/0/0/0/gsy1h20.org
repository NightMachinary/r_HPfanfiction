  As for the Quidditch World Cup thing, yeah hundreds of wizards including a number of ministry officials totally deserve to go to prison for defending themselves against Death Eaters.

Not what I referred to.\\
They constantly, before the death-eater attack, had to obliviate a muggle because people kept doing magic stuff and mentioning magical stuff in front of him.

Honestly, most of the cast would either be expelled or in Azkaban if we went hard on 'following the law to the letter'

Hermione? expelled and lucky if she avoided Azkaban. She literally used time-travel to set free a mass-murderer in the eyes of the ministry and law.

Hagrid? totally deserved Azkaban. Raised a dragon in his tree-hut around children and send two kids into an Acromantula-nest, the father of the nest which he raised in Hogwarts around children.

Snape? Death-eater and used an unforgivable curse on Dumbledore. Azkaban with no parole even if Dumbledore asked him to use it.
