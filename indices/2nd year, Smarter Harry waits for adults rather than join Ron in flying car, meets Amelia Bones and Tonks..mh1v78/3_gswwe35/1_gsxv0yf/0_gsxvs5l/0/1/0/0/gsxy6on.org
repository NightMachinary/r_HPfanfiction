I assume you're referring to when Fred and George stole the car and broke Harry out of the Dursley's house. And if so then yeah probably. But they weren't because nobody saw them (that's a big reason) and the three who did, the Dursleys, all already knew. That's why they broke him out in the dead of night when everyone is asleep

As for the Quidditch World Cup thing, yeah hundreds of wizards including a number of ministry officials totally deserve to go to prison for defending themselves against Death Eaters. In that case they would worry about people's safety first and worry about wiping people's memories later. It's been a while since I read the books but I don't remember any muggles being there
