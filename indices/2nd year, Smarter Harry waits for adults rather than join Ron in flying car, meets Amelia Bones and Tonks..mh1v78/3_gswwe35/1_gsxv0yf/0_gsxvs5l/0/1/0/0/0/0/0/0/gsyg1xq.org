I would disagree. They broke rule number one for wizardry consciously with no method of fixing the problem. Arthur gets into a lot of trouble at the ministry for this. For a real world example and keep in mind this doesn't match up exactly but I is the same principle. If a kid were to sell weed or alcohol on school property, they would likely get expelled. They probably won't go to juvie if it's a first time offense but they will get expelled. It's the same principle. From the way it's presented, the penalty for showing magic to a muggle is expulsion. They know the rules and the consequences, they broke the rules and must face said consequences
