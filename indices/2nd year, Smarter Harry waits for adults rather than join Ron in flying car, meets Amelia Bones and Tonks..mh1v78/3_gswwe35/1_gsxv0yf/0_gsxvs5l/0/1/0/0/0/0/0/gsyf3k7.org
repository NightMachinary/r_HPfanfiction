It was when they first arrived at the campsite - when they're paying the muggle, a wizard shows up and obliviates him and says that they've had to obliviate the guy ten times a day to keep him happy, and that Ludo Bagman is running around talking about magic related things without any concern for anti-muggle security.

They have a committee dedicated to coming up with excuses for magical incidents and Voldemort rampages all over without muggles catching on to magic being a thing, I don't think that one flying car is really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. They certainly can't have been the first kids to break it, and expelling a twelve-year-old kid for their first offense is kind of overkill.
