Yes it's absolutely something that everyone should be told when they're introduced to the wizarding world, but you're making an assumption that Hagrid told Harry all of the really important things he needed to know about the wizarding world, when there's no evidence that says he did (or didn't) tell him about the Statute of Secrecy and the consequences of breaking it.

We know that Hagrid left things out when he introduced Harry - he didn't tell him how to get on the platform, for example - and he in fact broke laws right in front of Harry and told Harry to look the other way. He busted into that shack and gave Dudley a pig's tail when a) you shouldn't use magic on a muggle like that, regardless of whether they know about magic or not, and he doesn't undo it and b) he's not supposed to have a wand to use magic with at all because he was expelled from Hogwarts. Hagrid sets the example for Harry that it's okay to break laws in the wizarding world.

And again, if it's such a major thing that a twelve-year-old should get expelled immediately for it, then by your logic, Bagman and all of the wizards/witches at the World Cup should have gotten into legal trouble. Sure, arresting hundreds of wizards at the Quidditch World Cup would be problematic, but they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, right?
