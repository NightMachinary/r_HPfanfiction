I don't think we're ever going to agree on this, but I would disagree that Harry knows the rules and understands the consequences. He's only completed his first year at Hogwarts and really doesn't know all that much about the magical world and how it works.

Harry's possible punishment for multiple infractions of the underage magic law in combination with showing magic to a muggles in his fifth year was expulsion, yes, but that's not the same thing as what happened in this instance. I don't think it's ever been explicitly stated anywhere that showing magic to a muggle is grounds for expulsion.
