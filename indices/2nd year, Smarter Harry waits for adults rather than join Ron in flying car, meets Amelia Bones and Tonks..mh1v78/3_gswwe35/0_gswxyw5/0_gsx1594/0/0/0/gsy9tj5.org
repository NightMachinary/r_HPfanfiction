I don't really agree. Mr. Weasley got in trouble because he had an illegally enchanted car. And he knew more than most people that it was illegal because he was the head of the department in charge of regulating such objects. Ron and Harry may have inadvertently drawn this to the Ministry's attention, but the fact remains that he broke the law and it was his fault. You can't really blame Ron and Harry for his wrongdoing being discovered. He ought not to have done it in the first place.

The worst thing they did was decide to take the car, knowing that magic isn't to be done in front of muggles and overlooking solutions that should have been obvious to children of that age, especially Ron as he was raised in the magical world. He ought to have known there were other means of magical travel that would get them to Hogwarts or thought of using Harry's owl to ask for help, even if Harry didn't know or forgot about magical options in a panic. Even Harry could have asked someone at the station for help getting to Charring Cross (since he would be able to speak to muggles without a problem) where the Leaky Cauldron is and they could have asked someone like Tom about what to do.
