I'm not saying they shouldn't have been punished at all - just that it doesn't make sense for the professors of Hogwarts to punish them for a transgression that (for the most part) didn't occur on school property or have to do with school rules. What they did do on school property - damage a tree - isn't expulsion-worthy in my opinion, which is really the only thing the school had the responsibility to punish them for. How they get punished for transgressions that happen off school property isn't for Snape or any of the professors to decide.
