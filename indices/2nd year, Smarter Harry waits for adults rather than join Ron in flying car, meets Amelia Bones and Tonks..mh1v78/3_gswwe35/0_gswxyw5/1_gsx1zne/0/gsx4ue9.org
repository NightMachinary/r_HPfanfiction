But Hogwarts isn't a normal school and no one ever really gets punished as harshly as they would if it were an IRL school. It's shown time and time again that no matter what anyone does, they don't get expelled (except for using magic outside of school when underage, but even then you have to have broken it multiple times to get expelled).

A good number of students - not just Harry - did shitty things that would have gotten them punished, suspended, or expelled from school in real life - and they never get suspended or expelled. As far as I can recall, the only actual expulsion in the books that's mentioned is Hagrid's, and that was after he got framed for Aragog killing Myrtle.
