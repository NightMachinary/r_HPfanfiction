My personal headcanon for Parseltongue is that Herpo the Foul is the creator of it. We all know he created the Basilisk and the Hocrux Rituall and it's not a long shot too think that me made his Basilisk his Hocrux. And then he needed some way to speak to it to control it and made some kind of extra soul magic thingy where he would get the ability to speak Parseltongue. And then it was just kept in the Bloodline so all Eureopean Parselmouths like Salazar and Tommy are descendants of him.
