The only reason I can understand this sentence at all is because when I googled it a reddit 1v1 Hagrid vs. The Mountain came up. I've never watched game of thrones. I was so so confused

The Mountain has disowned his father and brother, Fezzik and is ashamed of his giant heritage despite the fact that he has benefited from it. The Hagrid family would gladly accept him back despite his cruelty and practice of the dark arts. Rubeus Hagrid is still proud enough to call him his son.
