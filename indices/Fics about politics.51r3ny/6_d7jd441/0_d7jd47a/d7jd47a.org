  â€œThis will lead to another Time of Burning, mark my words; because the reactionary Muggles who figure out that they're being targeted or hindered in any way by magic will think to solve the problem by eliminating magical beings rather than attempting to secure magical allies themselves. This will in turn only tempt elements of our own society who wish nothing more than bloody conquest and a return to a darker age into action. When you take away the ability and rights of any people to self-govern, you leave them only with violence and hate to air their grievances."
