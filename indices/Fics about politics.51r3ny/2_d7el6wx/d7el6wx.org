While this is one of the most AU stories I have ever read, Strange and Invisible history (linkffn(6723584)) certainly fits the bill. We get a glimpse of a very old-fashioned wizarding world, where political allies are everything. I'm reminded of a few things, one of them being Hitler and the Third Reich. Once they align with another country (don't want to spoiler anything!), I am reminded of like the Romanovs in the late 19th century. I don't know why, but that's just the first thing I think of.

This story is 99 chapters long, and there is a sequel to it called Influence of Souls, which is also 99 chapters. However, this story is not complete. Please bear this in mind! I have not read the sequel yet, but I plan on reading it after my vacation.

I will be happy to answer any questions you (or anyone else) may have regarding this fic.
