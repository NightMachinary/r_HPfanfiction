Oh sorry I didn't see this message until today. I think the author is a little trigger-happy with the CP warning. What the author is referencing is Hermione is like 11-12 years old and being spanked by her parents. It's not written sexually or anything at all, just normal spanking, but Hermione is absolutely mortified at being spanked at that age.

Much later in the story, there are references to two characters having sex who are aged like 14-16. They are married and only have sex after they are married. It is not explicit, just mentioned before and after the fact. They have sex to ensure their marriage is consummated and they cannot be forced apart. This is a big part of the 'politics' of the story, where children have arranged marriages to secure two families together for political reasons. It is very clear in the story that they marry much younger than originally intended for certain reasons. Once you start reading it, you will understand. I just don't want to spoil anything for you! =)

If you have any more questions, I will be super happy to answer them!
