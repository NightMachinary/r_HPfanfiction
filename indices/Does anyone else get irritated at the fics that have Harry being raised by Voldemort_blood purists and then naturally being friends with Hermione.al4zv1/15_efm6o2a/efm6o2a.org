Well, yes and no:

Because IMHO even Voldemort knows that talent trumps blood purity (otherwise he'd have had a pureblood potions-master and not Snape who was a half-blood!)!

Hell, that friendship is an advantage not only because it helps with grades and homework (note: I am not talking about outright copying, but working with her helps shortens the time spent on it!), but also because it helps maintain a cover ("Looky here, I like muggleborns! I am a good guy, right?")
