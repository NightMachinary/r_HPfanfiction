I can kind of see a redemption fic along these lines:

1. BloodPurist!Harry becomes favourably disposed towards Hermione---perhaps to the point of admiration---before finding out that she is a Muggleborn.
2. Getting severe cognitive dissonance from this, he concludes that Hermione /must/ be at the very least a half-blood, so he spends a lot of effort trying to "prove" that to her, to the point of stealing a blood sample and getting some sort of an inheritance test done.
3. Having failed to find any evidence of recent magical ancestry, he graduates to the "one of the good ones" excuse, and so on.

And so on.
