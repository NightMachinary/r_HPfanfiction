I generally avoid those types of fics, since they tend to read like authoritarian-rightwing propaganda thinly disguised as a fanfiction, *or* Harry's upbringing had no bad side effects whatsoever and /here are all canon plotpoints version 2174743 for you, have fun/.

If Harry is raised by Voldemort (and therefore also influenced by people like Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, Antonin Dolohov,...), then him being friends with Hermione is simply OOC for this version of Harry. Following this, you get all the same problems usually connected to OOC. Logical inconsitencies, doublethink, idiot balls,...

On the other side, if Harry /doesn't/ overcome his adoptive parent's lessons, then we read about a undeniably evil character, unless the world compensates for his ideologies by bringing forth an alternative universe in which they are reasonable (I'd like to note here that I have yet to see this. Its just a theoretical possibility in my eyes). In most cases it devolves into an edgy cringefest of Harry being supercool while endorsing or performing acts of extreme violence and hate.
