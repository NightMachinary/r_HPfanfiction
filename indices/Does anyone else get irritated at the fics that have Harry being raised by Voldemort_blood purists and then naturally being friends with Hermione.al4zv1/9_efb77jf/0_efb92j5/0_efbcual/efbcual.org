Or just people who want to better understand the kind of warped mindset that leads people to that lifestyle.

In modern society, hate crimes feel so intuitively wrong to us that it can be hard to wrap our minds around how people could act like that and still think of themselves as the good guys.

I haven't seen a decent version of that in the HP fandom, but I've read other excellent stories that handle the subject well.
