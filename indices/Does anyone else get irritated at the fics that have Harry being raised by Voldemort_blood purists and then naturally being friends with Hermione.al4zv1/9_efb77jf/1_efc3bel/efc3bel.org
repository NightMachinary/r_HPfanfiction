If you're going to write a Harry that was raised either by Voldemort or a Pureblood Elitist like the Malfoys or whomever; who hate Muggleborns/Muggles/Squibs/Et Cetra, than Harry should hate them too; and not just half attempt it, and give up on it half way through the story; by making him become friends with Hermione.
