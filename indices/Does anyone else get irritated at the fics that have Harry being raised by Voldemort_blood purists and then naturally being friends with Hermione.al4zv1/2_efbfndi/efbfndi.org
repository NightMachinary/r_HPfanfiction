In most 'Harry raised by Voldemort' fics Harry is against Muggles but not against Muggleborns. Many fics go with the idea that Voldemort (himself a Halfblood) used the Blood Purists as a means to an end but never gave a whit about their ideology beyond how it could be used to manipulate them.

In other cases, Voldemort/the Death Eaters only get hold of Harry after he has been raised by his parents/the Dursleys for a while, so Harry already has a foundation of non-extremist ideas to shape how he judges the people he meets. That makes him more likely to recognize Hermione's strengths rather than continue to blindly dismiss her.

TL;DR I only get irritated when the fic is badly written. There are ways that plot can be done well so that Harry's views make sense in the story.
