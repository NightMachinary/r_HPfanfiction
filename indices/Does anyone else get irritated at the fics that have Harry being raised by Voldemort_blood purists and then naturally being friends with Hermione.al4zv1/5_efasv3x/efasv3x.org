I have seen fics where Darkside Harry openly uses the word "Mudblood" at Hogwarts, and when Hermione tries to tell him off for his language, he mansplains at her that it's part of his culture's traditions, a culture that is currently being watered down by whiners like her who take offense at everything.

...Yes, it's irritating.
