Shapiro makes sense if you've never engaged with the actual complexities of the topics he hand waves about. I always found it ironic that he goes on about "facts don't care about your feelings" and yet his whole spiel about why abortion is bad comes down to showing pictures of a fertilized egg developing and slowly looking more like a developed person, and the saying "This is glob of cells", a clear attempt at motivating agreement with him based on emotion (namely, that people shouldn't want to prevent the development of somethinf that will look like a person eventually). And this is just a clear example, there are doubtlessly more.
