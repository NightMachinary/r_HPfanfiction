I am not familiar with every single thing Ben Shapiro has ever said nor this video. So if you have the video, please post it. I don't recall him being purely emotional when trying to convince someone about the evils of abortion.\

edit: you mean this? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDmwPGrZkYs]] I think there's nothing wrong with this video. He is obviously very emotional, but I think you might have to be deliberately obtuse to ignore that its an 8 minutes video that also has plenty of arguments against abortion, including, yes, an anti-sorietes paradox argument about the arbitrary cut off dates for abortions.
