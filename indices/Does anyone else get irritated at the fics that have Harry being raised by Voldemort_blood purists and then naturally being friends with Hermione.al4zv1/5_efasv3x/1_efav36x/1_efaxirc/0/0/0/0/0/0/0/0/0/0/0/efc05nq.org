But they are. Most states (something like 41 or 43) ban abortions (barring danger to the mother) between. 22 and 28 weeks along. The changes you're referencing are not all uniform (One example in New York does not overturn a generality) in extending the length (see New Mexico's changes) and are about protecting abortion rights as it becomes increasingly likely that the now vehemently right wing SCOTUS is present and would like to over turn Roe v. Wade. Hell, even in the NY case the point is that the ban past 24 weeks is problematic when at, say, 30 weeks the fetus turns out to be unviable outside the womb.

In general, the point is to make it a public health issue to remove it from the legal question given it's status as a right may well be up for grabs soon. You are engaging in propaganda, even if you don't realize it. This information is easily accessible:
