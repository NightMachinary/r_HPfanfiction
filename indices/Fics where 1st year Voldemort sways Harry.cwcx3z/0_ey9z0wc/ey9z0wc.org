Voldemort walked over to the incapacitated Harry, contorting Quirrell's rapidly declining body in inhumane ways. He flicked his wand and Harry rose from the ground, planting his feet firmly on the ground. He reached out. His hand on Harry's arm, conveniently covered by clothes. He pushed. Harry moved slightly. Voldemort let go. Harry moved slightly back. Voldemort pushed again. And again. And again.

"W-What are you doing?" Harry asked fearfully.

"Why Harry, can't you tell?" Voldemort asked with a shit eating grin. "I'm swaying you."
