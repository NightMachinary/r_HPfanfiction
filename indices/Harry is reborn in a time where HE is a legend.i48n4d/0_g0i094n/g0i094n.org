There is a trilogy by belcris that the third part is in the far future. It starts with

Linkffn(harry potter and the sun filled days by belcris)

Then

Linkffn(harry potter and the dark signs)

And finally what you asked for

Linkffn(harry potter and the future uncertain)

They are some of the first fics I read long long ago. I dont remember how compliant they are to DH or even if they are compliant to HBP, but if I remember right they are pretty well written and have a decent story.
