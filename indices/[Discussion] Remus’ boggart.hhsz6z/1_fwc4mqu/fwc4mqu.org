He fears the moon because he could attack someone he loves during his transformation, which the moon signifies for him personally. You also have to take into account that at the time he was teaching that class, he hadn't met Tonks yet in a romantic way and he wasn't yet close to Harry at that time. So maybe by the time Remus and Tonks did get together, his boggart may have changed. Like Molly's did at the beginning of the war. Your boggart changes as you grow and your fears change. Something that you feared when you were five should be different by the time you are twenty. The moon just symbolizes all that fear for him because he associates the transformation with moon. Lunar cycles and all that.
