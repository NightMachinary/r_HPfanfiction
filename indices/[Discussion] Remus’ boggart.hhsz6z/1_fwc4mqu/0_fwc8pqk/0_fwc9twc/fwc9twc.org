No not really. Neville fears Snape which is literal but Harry fears fear. Not the Dementor. He fears them because they bring about his worst memories, not the actual being. The Patil sister fears the snake but does she fear the snake itself or the bite? It's not always the literal. Sometimes it's symbolic. The moon just happens to be the visual part of being a werewolf, the waiting every month for the moon to be full, the fear of what's to come, and the promise of the transformation. To Remus, the moon is the threat. How often has he had to check his calendar or the sky itself to see how long he has till the monster within comes out to play? Hermione's greatest fear is McGonagall telling her she has failed an exam which symbolizes her fear of failing as a witch in general.
