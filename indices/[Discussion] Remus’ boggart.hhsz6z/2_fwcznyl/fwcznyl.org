Well I always though that the moon was specifically used to be vague and mysterious, not accurate.

(In books it did not even look like a full moon. I remember them discussing what profesor Lupin fear is and Ron asking why he's afraid of floating ball.)

Someone being mauled by literal werewolf boggart isn't discreet and does not leave much room for interpretation, it would spoil plot too much. Also it was a scene from a child's book so violence like that couldn't really be randomly included in a classroom full of students.

Also someone raised a point that Remus did not know Harry nor Tonks. It may be turned around: Remus already lost everyone he cared about. He had no one who could show as victim to describe his fear. He was alone in this, only him and his moon induced wolf. So the boggart could be theoretically werewolf snarling at him. But he never sees it from that point of view - the last thing he clearly remembers is always the Moon.
