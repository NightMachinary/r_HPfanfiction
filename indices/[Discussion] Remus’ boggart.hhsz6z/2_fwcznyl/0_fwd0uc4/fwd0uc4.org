Maybe his greatest fear isn't hurting other people but loss of control over himself and his life.

The only time we know that he came close to attacking a human was where someone/something made it possible. Sirius playing Snape, Pettigrew apearence shocking him and making him forget the potion in his rush to reach Harry. All circumstantial and pretty rare considering how careful Remus usually is. How good he is at managing everything after years of transforming month after month.

But that don't negates the fact that being werewolf destroys his life. How nerve wreaking is looking into calendar and seeing the full moon looming? How many times he did not get any Wolfsbane Potion and lost night to the madness? Or woke up in shredded place, blooded, skin full of fresh claw marks that will scar?

Maybe it sounds selfish but self preservation is instinct that you never know how strong it is till you find yourself in pain or mortal danger.
