Hello,

I would recommend the following two: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13439553/1/That-Was-Part-of-the-Plan][That Was Part of the Plan]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10948791/LysandraLeigh][LysandraLeigh]] + follow on. This has a lot of world building and detail in it -- it is sitting right now at a shade under 670,000 words and only a year has past.

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][Black Luminary]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8129173/YakAge][YakAge]]. It has a excellent twist to begin with and the author is slow to reveal information that mean you just want to keep reading. There are few FanFics that can do this. Only problem is it has not been updated in awhile (23/AUG/2019) and it is frustrating me as I want to know more.

At the moment I go to fanfiction.net every day and hit refresh (many times) to see if either has updated.
