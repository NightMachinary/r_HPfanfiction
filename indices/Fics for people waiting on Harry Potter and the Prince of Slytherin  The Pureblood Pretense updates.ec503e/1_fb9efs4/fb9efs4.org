Have you ever read the Alexandra Quick series? It is quite a step away from the OC of the HP universe and the extended FF universe, so it reads like an /extremely/ unique story. I hate to cheerlead so much for it, but the author has been doing bi weekly updates of the 5th book in the series for the last few months as he totally finishes one book before releasing a single chapter, so you never are left on a cliff hanger.
