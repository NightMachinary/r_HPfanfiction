Alex can be FUCKING annoying. I read it a few years ago and I don't remember much, but I do remember wanting to bash my head against the wall because she just made the same mistakes over and over again.

Great story, if you're able to enjoy a story without necessarily liking the protagonist.

That said, it's good to know the 5th book is out. Means I'll have to start rereading the series.
