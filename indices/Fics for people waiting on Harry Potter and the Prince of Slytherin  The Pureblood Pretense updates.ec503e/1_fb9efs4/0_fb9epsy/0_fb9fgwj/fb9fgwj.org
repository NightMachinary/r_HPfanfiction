A few words of of warning (no spoilers though): there are basically no Mary Sues. Don't expect one. The protagonist will have so many flaws that you might think something is wrong with the story. There isn't. This is a deliberate choice by the author. Don't expect too many parallels between HP and AQ either, despite similar sounding backstories and point of story departure. They are there (as any good fanfic will have) but the story in no way relies on those parallels. Finally, the cast of characters is totally OC, so don't wait up for Hermione Granger or Scorpio Malfoy to make some kind of grand cameo, it won't be happening. This is fan fiction in that the universe is mostly the same and is about a child beginning their schooling and introduction to magic around 10-11 years old.
