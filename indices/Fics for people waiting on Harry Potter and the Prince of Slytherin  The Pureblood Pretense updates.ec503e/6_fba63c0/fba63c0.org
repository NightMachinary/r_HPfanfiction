i think POS is one of the best written, the author is really good at drama and tension. a huge drawback is because it is WIP a year in real time was basically spent reading many updates which pushed the story forward what felt like 5 minutes at a time in longbottom manor which was extremely tiresome. (this happened at the same time that Intensity by Mauraderlover7 had a few chapters of draco snape angst that felt like it took 6 months to resolve (a really dreadful period for reading WIPs in my opinion)

the pacing has picked up again so its back to number 1 in my WIP favourites list
