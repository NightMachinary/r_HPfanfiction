Well there is a story called I Have to Say I Do by potter8668 where Harry raises 2 month old nieces he didn't know about (james had a sister).

JacobApples has a couple of stories where Harry raises Teddy. The Disorder of the Phoenix where 7 years after Voldemort's defeat Harry, Andromeda and Teddy are taken back into the past (5th year). Eventually becomes Harry/Tonks. What We Lost has Harry, Teddy and Andromeda raising Teddy (eg the no time travel version of "Disorder"). And Laughing All The Way to London has Harry and Teddy going back to the Marauders era where Harry ends up with Narcissa.
