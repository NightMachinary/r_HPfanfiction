This is the main issue. In Harry's time, there are more girls than you can ship. The Marauder Era has Lily (and the Black sisters if you want to include the 60s as well). That's it. We don't even have a dozen "name only" characters to choose from.

Well, on Ao3 there are 5000 pure f/f stories (no slash or het pairings) out of 190000. That's 2.6%, which is above even the highest estimates for the percentage of lesbian people. On the other hand, gay relationships have a 38.4% share on Archive, which is a massive overrepresentation (3% max). Heterosexual relationships make out 27,9%, which is way below the actual numbers (all sources agree on above 90).
