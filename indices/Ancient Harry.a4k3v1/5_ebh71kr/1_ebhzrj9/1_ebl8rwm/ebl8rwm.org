You should be fine with the third one if you know that Lex did not start out as evil, and until the fourth one you will be fine if you know that Xander is one of Buffy characters, a rather important one to the plot, and is basically someone who fought against supernatural threats despite being normal, who has something of a protective instinct for those close to him, and who manages to find some way, for the better or for the worse, out of any situation (so basically actually a good person to take care of Harry if you think about it).

There's some other, but altogether minor, stuff that references Buffy before the fourth one, but you will be fine without knowing anything about them really.

The fourth one, however, is a straight-out Buffy soup with some other stuff for flavour, so depending on how quick you are at recreating the world of something in your mind from scratch you may or may not just end up sitting there confused.
