The Potter's Protector series by mjimeyg

linkffn(7665632;8804823;9628789;12022968)

In Potter's Protector Harry is neither immortal nor ancient but the next 3 stories make up for it.

They are crossovers, we have Buffy (first and fourth story), Marvel (second through fourth story), Smallville (third and fourth story), time travel, dimension travel, harems, and a fifteen million year old Harry (but he only likes to admit to ten million) by the second story.
