Ah, my bad, I hadn't read it in a while, so I forgot that was factor. As I was re-skimming to determine amount of slash, doesn't seem as well written as a fanfic. I think I rescind that recommendation, I read it back when I wasn't as discerning as I am now. The author made it 'pg-15' so I think it's non-explicit after ch. 17 onward if you do venture into reading it.
