So basically Harry is an insane and powerful dark lord over the course of centuries, willingly surrenders himself to see what the ministry will do, chills out and messes with everyone then leaves and goes off to do dark lord things again. Has a funny little partnership with Voldemort and I believe a plot point is how he became crazy and his childhood but I didn't get far enough into the fic to get there
