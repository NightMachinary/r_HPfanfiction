Did you actually read it or did you just skim it? Because in some of the most important plot-points Harry is entirely wrong (like being fooled by his nemesis for the whole story). I'm completely baffled by people who come out of that fic with the idea that it is a story about a protagonist who's always right, when in reality he fucks up constantly through his smug arrogance.
