eehhhhhh. you have a really good point there.

yes, I did read Methods. It was my first fanfiction, and probably the reason I got hooked. I mentioned it here because IMO, the conflicts are mostly resolved by harry trying to FIGURE OUT how to overcome his obstacles. A lot of precious pages are spent explaining how or why things played out in an ealier scene, what plans people had, what motivations were present etc.

To Me, this story is about many strategies, some of which are very smart. I might be an idiot, but hey...

The story does contain a rationalist superior to Harry, who constantly makes him feel like the slowpoke of the pair (which rubs badly with his arrogance). Harry does make plenty of mistakes that bite him right in his arrogant ass, But I feel that makes for a better story. A story with a supergenius Harry that always outsmarts his opponents and explains his superiority like a Bond villain would be exhausting to read.

PS; I don't want to imply, that you would recommend a Bond-villain-Harry story i'm just using exaggeration to get my point across :D
