It's a natural projection of a stereotype. Things we can assume about Daphne from the seven books only:

- Pure-blood in Slytherin; raised a haughty noble or is able to survive among them
- Slytherin House traits; personal ambition at the very least, self-centered worldview and questionable morality aren't unreasonable
- Quiet; she sees almost no screen time in six Hogwarts years in spite of being in Harry's year (contrast with Pansy)

Reconciling all of those things with an Ice Queen stereotype is fairly simple. On top of that, melting the ice queen is common enough male fantasy and is an easy way for authors to generate teenage drama without a whole lot of effort. Makes for a bland story, but both writers and readers seem to enjoy it.

Writing Daphne in another fashion requires a lot more work and explanation and probably easier done with pure-bloods from other houses. That doesn't mean she can't be interesting; Ice Queen is how /other/ characters perceive her. Under that personality she is just as much of an individual as anyone else. Why she acts the way she does and her own personal goals are what can make her interesting since they can be literally anything and still jive with canon.
