Let's assume they did keep their titles, but after the statute of secrecy they weren't given any new ones. As the person you replied to said, the aristocracy makes up 0.5% of Britain's population. That figure is when new positions in the aristocracy, like knighthoods, are still being given out. So we have no reason to think that wizards would have a higher proportion of aristocrats in their population, and it could very well be lower if any families died out. Estimating the population of wizarding Britain at 3000, if 0.5% of them are aristocrats...that means only 15 aristocrats total. Not even 15 families, just 15 people. So the Malfoy and Black families, and maybe one more. That's it. (Of course, a sample size that small is meaningless, but it was interesting to think about all the same) There is no point to an aristocracy if there are no other members of it.

Also, had there been an actual aristocracy with titles that Malfoy was a member of, I think he would have pulled it out to lord it over (heh heh) everyone else at the drop of a hat. We would have heard about it on the Hogwarts Express itself, probably .
