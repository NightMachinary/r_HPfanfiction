Since the UK didn't have the universal franchise, meaning only people of a certain station or means could vote, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918][until the 20th century]], and even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1884][as late as 1884 only 60% of all males had the vote]]. In 1831, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832#The_franchise][Britain had about 16,5M people, but less than 500K of them had the vote]] - and if you had properties in different counties, you could vote multiple times.

I don't know how you can claim that there wasn't a close link between upper class and possession of de facto political power when /less than 5% could vote/.
