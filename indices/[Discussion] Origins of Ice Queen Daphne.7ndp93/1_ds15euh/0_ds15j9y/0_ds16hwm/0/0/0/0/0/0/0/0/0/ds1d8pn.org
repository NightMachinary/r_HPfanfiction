Are you actually claiming that the wizards wouldn't have a nobility, and yet argue that their own upper class would be based on the same criteria as the originally noble [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class_in_the_United_Kingdom#Upper_class][muggle upper class]] (peerage, gentry and hereditary landowners)? You can't have it both ways. Either they follow muggle standards, and have a (mostly) noble upper class, or they have an upper class [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_British_Class_Survey#Elite][as defined nowadays]] ("Elite", around 6%).

In any case, there's not much if any case for Wizarding Britain having been formed as a democratic society with a universal franchise from the get go.
