The idea that a society that split from muggle Britain in 1692 wouldn't have some sort of nobility at least at the start seems very, very weird. Especially since Pottermore states that a Malfoy was courting Queen Elizabeth I - something he only would have been able to as a noble, and a high-ranking one at that. I know some imagine that the purebloods all went egalitarian and democratic as soon as they split, but we have no sign for such a revolution taking place.

And even if we assume that somehow, no noble titles were continued, the idea that there is no upper class - a defacto aristocracy - is not very compatible with canon. Just compare how the Weasleys live and how the Malfoys live.
