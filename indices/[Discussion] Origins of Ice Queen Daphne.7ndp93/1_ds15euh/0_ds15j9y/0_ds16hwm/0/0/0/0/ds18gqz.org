My understanding was always that all the "noble" wizards had gotten their titles from the muggle royalty. Yes, the Malfoys were noble before the Statute of Secrecy, but under the muggle system, and presumably nowadays they're more ashamed than anything else of having held a title from a /muggle/.

And yes, there /is/ an upper class, the issue is just that people keep assuming purebloods are /literally/ nobles with Lords and title-inheritance rules and vassals and rings and all such nonsense.
