  I don't know how you can claim that there wasn't a close link between upper class and possession of de facto political power when less than 5% could vote.

Because the upper class is much smaller than 5% of the population. It's closer to 0.5% (estimated to be around 36,000 people in modern Britain, or 0.6% of the population). And that includes all the minor nobility too. The core of the nobility - the ones who have titles attached to significant amounts of land - is around 1000 families.

Social inequality is not the same thing as the class system. By the late 1600s the merchant classes were already supplanting the traditional nobility as the holders of political power, buying rotten boroughs with the proceeds of trade to secure themselves seats in Parliament. The House of Commons had gained primacy over the House of Lords. The feudal system was long gone, and the government of England was highly centralized and administratively sophisticated compared to its European peers.

Yes, Britain was still a long way from real democracy, especially as the House of Commons was as yet unreformed and so elections were not really free. But just as social inequality is not the same thing as the class system, nor is democracy the same thing as having a classless society.
