I maintain that it's far more likely that the wizards would have kept their aristocracy instead of abandoning them. It's historically and culturally ignorant to assume that there would have been the equivalent of a French Revolution in Britain in 1692, or some egalitarian "we're all equal" drive. Yes, they split from the muggles - but similar splits in history didn't result in the nobility shedding their titles.
