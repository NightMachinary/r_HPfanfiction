FYI this is a very American view of class. I don't think any British person would ever:

A) Connect the idea of being upper class to the possession of de facto political power, though they have a greater association than other classes.

B) Think that you can just form a new aristocracy, since the entire concept is based on a reverence for tradition and historical precedent.

Being upper class is not wealth, nor is it power. It's something you can tell within 30 seconds of speaking to a person, without ever having met them before and knowing absolutely nothing about who they are. Being de facto in control of the country does not make one upper class. For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair was and is firmly middle class - something which he would have been reminded of at formal state occasions, when he would find himself about half-way down [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_precedence_in_England_and_Wales][the order of precedence]] in the seating plan.

In many ways, the laughability of forming a "new aristocracy" is exactly why we are supposed to deride the Black family for coming up with titles for themselves. New aristocracies come around when inherited titles are the same thing as political and economic power i.e. in feudal societies. The titles carry weight not because of tradition but because of the actual power they provide. Over time the titles accumulate tradition which can survive the end of their political relevance.

But British wizarding society is manifestly not feudal. They have an elected Minister and an institutional civil service which mirrors modern forms of government. Their economy is not agricultural, political position is not derived from land ownership, and neither is military power as individuals do not raise levies to fight based on land ownership.

It would in fact be extremely strange for wizards to create a feudal system of government when breaking away from Muggle society in 1692, since feudalism had been functionally abolished in Muggle England in 1290 with the statute of Quia Emptores and was finally killed off in 1660 with the Tenures Abolition Act. Not to mention that England had just been through a civil war resulting in the execution of the monarch and the establishment of Parliamentary supremacy.
