I'm saying (and have been doing so quite consistently) that wizarding Britain would not have a nobility. They would no doubt have a social elite, as does any society. But that elite would not be a nobility/aristocracy. That the idea of a "de facto" aristocracy is a contradiction in terms, because aristocracy is a concept which is completely distinct from being a social elite.

Let us remind ourselves of the position which you put forward which began this conversation:

  The idea that a society that split from muggle Britain in 1692 wouldn't have some sort of *nobility* at least at the start seems very, very weird. Especially since Pottermore states that a Malfoy was courting Queen Elizabeth I - something he only would have been able to as a noble, and a high-ranking one at that. I know some imagine that the purebloods all went egalitarian and democratic as soon as they split, but we have no sign for such a revolution taking place.

  And even if we assume that somehow, no noble titles were continued, the idea that there is no upper class - *a defacto aristocracy* - is not very compatible with canon. Just compare how the Weasleys live and how the Malfoys live.

You are now trying to shift the goalposts so that it appears that your position was simply that wizarding society would have a social elite (a trivial proposition which no one would contest). But your actual position, which is the position I have been arguing against, was that this elite would take the form of a nobility or "de facto aristocracy". And for the reasons elaborated above, that is simply historically and culturally ignorant.
