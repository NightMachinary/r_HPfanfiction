I do not know!!!! I have reread the harry potter ebooks and I typed in daphne greengrass in the search document bar and she is only mentioned one time during order of the pheonix when they are taking their OWLS. But besides that there is literally nothing else about her. Also it is weird how everyone makes her a high arisocrat because she is a pureblood, because RON is a pureblood and he is a normal boy in a poor home!!! I think that is stereotyping purebloods by their blood which is ironic? Why would Daphne or any other purebloods not be normal kids in a normal loving home like the Weasleys, who are also purebloods? Yes stories that just base purebloods off of the Malfoys and make everyone the same as that annoy me. :( I make them varied and normal, like the Weasleys.
