There was 'Greengrass Queenie' name on the list of students from Harry's year in Rowling's notes she had shown back in 2001. Only one Greengrass except Astoria was mentioned in all of the books. Daphne Greengrass name was called in fifth book during OWLs, so perhaps some people thought that Daphne is Queenie. Her nickname /may/ derivate from that.
