I really don't think she became a character with a fan following until:

1) After all the movies came out, there was a lot of inconsistency with characters in the movies over the years, but the later movies started showing a blonde Slytherin girl. She was unnamed officially but most people assumed she was Daphne (Pansy was already identified, the other other Slytherin girl Harry's year was Tracy Davis)

2) But Daphne became the most popular after DH and the Epilogue came out. Draco married Astoria elevating the Greengrass family and thus Daphne. She became a blank slate, a wealthy, blonde Pureblood. Because she had no canon personality, people were free to make their own.

It's definitely a more recent phenomenon. I've followed HP fanfic and the fandom since around 2000 or so and Daphne wasn't even mentioned until recently, and her popularity exploded.
