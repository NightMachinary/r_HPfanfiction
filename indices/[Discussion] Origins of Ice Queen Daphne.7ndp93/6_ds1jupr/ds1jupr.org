Cause you want someone with an aristocratic edge and she's the best Slytherin at this point. Her sister married Draco so there's that sense of her family is old and pure blood. Add in that most people feel ice queens would be in Slytherin. Can't really see a Puff as one, maybe a Claw.

So you're stuck with Slytherin for your dangerous romance. Could do Pansy but the hoops you have to jump through are tough. Millicent isn't overly pretty so people ignore her. So you have Daphne or Tracey and Daphne Greebgrass is such a cooler name than Tracey Davis. Plus it's canon her sister gets with Malfoy. You can get a lot of good stories from that. Helps she's never mentioned outside of sorting so you can do anything with her.
