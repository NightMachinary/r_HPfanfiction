Sorry in advance because I have not read All Part Of The Plan, so I just rec female lead fics in general. Female lead as in anyone who is female, including a gender-bent Harry? If so, then may I shill my own fic:

linkffn(13512039)

There's also linkffn(13514676) though it hasn't been updated in a while because I concentrated on *A Different Perspective*. Also, while the main focus is on Lavender, the POV switches between her and Harry.

I also find linkffn(13510736) quite interesting and Silently Watches is a fantastic author, so I have very high hopes for that fic.

linkffn(13540525) is very interesting as well and I am already curious to see where it will go. Quite different.

I hope you find something here!
