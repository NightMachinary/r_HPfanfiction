I really enjoyed the Confectionary Chronicles series (the bot didn't link it) and Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise. I can confirm that no supernatural knowledge is required to read Confectionary Chronicles. The Iris Potter story: normally I don't like snarky Harry but it is really well executed here.
