Confectionary Chronicles is delightfully fun. It's apparently a crossover with Supernatural, but I haven't seen a single episode and know bugger all about the show except that apparently there's a cool gay angel in it played by Misha Collins and they met Death a few times. It's got Arithmancer vibes in that it's basically Hermione being reasonably awesome and fun.

Mistakes and Second Chances is pretty interesting - Fem!Harry and Fleur are weird magicals and kick arse.

Future's Past is basically a Victorian Romance Novel in prose, but with a standard spunky Fem!Harry who doesn't care for social norms and definitely would've been a fan of Anne Lister going back in time to meet Orion Black.

Charlotte the Great and Powerful is an interesting fic and there is honestly absolutely nothing else to say about it.

Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise is just fun angry Fem!Harry shouting at things and being generally thorny in the side of everyone who irritates her wherever possible. I enjoyed it greatly. Also, really interesting tournament changes! :)

I can probably come up with a few more, but they'd be more along the request in the title than the clarification in the description.
