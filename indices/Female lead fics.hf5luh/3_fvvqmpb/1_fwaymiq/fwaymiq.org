I had veered away from the pureblood pretense because the sparse descriptions I had heard of it had rung of the kind of pureblood felating nonsense that too many fics have. One of the main conflicts of the HP series is that of blood. Or, more precisely, of those that believe in blood superiority. These bloodpurists are framed to a tee as the bad guys.

But, because they have privilege and money, which people want, stories seem to delight in redrawing them as paragons of sense and propriety. Some stories take this to the point where they take characters and redesign them as purebloods eliminating aspects of their character for a asinine desire to make them "wizarding royalty."

I had dismissed these stories as not worth reading. I considered them to be full of petty twistings and justifications for characters to be the way that they are. I predicted tropes galore and an overrelience on making other characters two dimensionally bad to make the main characters look good. To my chagrin and delight, The Pureblood Pretense decimated that expectation.

Now, tropes are present, but in a good way. They are present for the same reason that they are commonly immitated in the first place, because when implimented well, the narrative repercussions are interesting and engaging. Best part of all, no bashing. Characters are characters rather than caricatures. The main characters stand out on their own merit rather than by the behest of other's incompetence.

Harry (or Rigel) is exceptional, but not overwhelingly so. Her talents are isolated even to the detriment of other abilities. She is not an effortless socialite and repeatedly bothers her friends with her flaws and behaviors. What she achieves is believable due to the work you also believe she puts in. Honestly, she doesn't have much of a life she works so hard, but she has to, and it's a damn good read. What exceptionallity she does have that isn't due to her own efforts is excellently implemented. Most importantly, it never comes across as wish fulfillment. at least not to an unacceptable level. The most unrealistic thing I can remember is that she manages to achieve a massive workload that is beyond her age competently without any repercussions. Could an eleven year old really study and practice multiple feilds of magic effectively while completing her year of work as well as work years ahead of her as well as several hours of potion work as well as keeping up a masive front? Maybe, but i imagine it would wear her down alot more than it seems to. This is a minor quibble in front of more positives than I have time to write right now. It's good, please read it and support the author.

It put me in the shoes of reading the HP series. I'm rediscovering a world and characters as they live and develop in a magical world rather than just playing around with the conventions and tropes of a well tread fandom. This stories popularity is well deserved.
