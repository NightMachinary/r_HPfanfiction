I just recently finished the Pureblood Pretense series, and I'd say it deserves more than a passing mention :). It starts off fairly simple - Harriett and her cousin Arcturus Black switch places so they can go to their preferred schools - but it gets ever more complex as you keep reading. She's a better student than canon Harry, exceptional even - but when you're pretending to be someone else, standing out becomes a real problem. She has unusual magical power, but that comes with a trade-off of reduced control and serious amounts of accidental magic - and then she turns thirteen, the age where magical cores mature, and her power grows out of control and becomes unusable without suppression jewelry that has dangerous side effects. And /then/ she finally gains proper control of it, but only after a horrifying experience of weeks of claustrophobic imprisonment and torture, and she ends up with a foreign intelligence in her head that might or might not be on her side in the long term.

Tom Riddle is interesting, too. This version didn't launch a violent war, instead opting for politics and legislation to achieve his goals, some but not all of which actually turn out to be reasonable, but if anything he's been a bigger threat to Harry's life than the canonical Voldemort was.
