From NZ myself. We briedly looked at sex ed at the end of primary school mostly looking at what's what and that's when I was eleven. A female Harry would not get a lot of education on it before Hogwarts and I assume that it doesn't matter how many times a teacher tells you what's happening is normal and what to do that if the people you live with call you a freak for it and verbally abuse you for it thigs would be pretty tough. I bet the most commom advice given to young girls is that A) its completely normal amd happens to all girls and B) if you have any questions or worries to talk to an adult about it such as your mother or elder sibling. For a female Harry she wouldn't have anyone to talk to and being told by the Dursley's it's not normal would have an effect on her.
