What exactly are you aiming to write, or more specifically what do you envision as the main conflict? Will it be the PM vs "Backward magical society" or PM trying to shield his citizens during Voldemort's reign of terror? Do you intend to include the Muggleborns being sent to Azkaban, turning the prison into Voldemort's concentration camp?

Tom Clancy's early works (Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin) would be another good inspiration if you are familiar with these books. They also deal with an unknown danger that is slowly revealed through intelligence gathering and political intrigue and these are some of the ways the PM would work, trying to find out just what he is up against.

While I have no time to write a collaborative story I would be happy to assist you with questions regarding canon, provide feedback to your plot and discuss ideas with you.

PS: The whole minister meeting was is 96. 97 was Voldemort's takeover.
