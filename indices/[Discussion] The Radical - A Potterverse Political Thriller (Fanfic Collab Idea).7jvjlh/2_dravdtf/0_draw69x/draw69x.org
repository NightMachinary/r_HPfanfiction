I was going for several conflicts, namely of the PM looking for a way to both ward off the Death Eaters while simultaneously undermining the Wizarding Community to rob them of their sway over the Muggle population. All while trying to make a name for himself on both sides of the magical divide, of course.

Anyway, I appreciate the offer. I was indeed considering giving the story some major spy elements, so a Tom Clancy spirit wouldn't go amiss here.
