It depends on the wards. There's one which makes the building look like a ruin IIRC, making any on-sight military operation impossible (you don't see walls, doors, windows and so on). Airstrikes and artillery would still work but maybe Hogwarts is not the best place for that (You could still level Death Eater Manors that way while telling the pilots it's just an exercise, attacking a random ruin).

One Ward disguises the magical hospital as out of commission shop. It would be nearly impossible to work around that kind of stuff or really easy, depending on if it is a simple illusion that stops when you get through or a portal that requires magic to pass.

There's another one which hides the Leaky Cauldron, making it unappealing for non-magicals so they don't even enter the place. I see no obvious loophole.

The Fidelius charm is perhaps the most tricky one. It hides a thing and only the secret keeper can disclose it. We don't know what happens if you tear down the walls neighbouring such a place. Do you go from House Number 11 to 13, do you end up in nothingness, do you work around the secret and what is happening inside the hidden space. Depending on the workings it would also make any action against that place impossible. There's no canon explanation so you as a writer have to make that call.

You can make stuff unplottable but in theory you can spot the blank spaces on the map and just tell your people to go to a point south of it and then walk/drive/fly north
