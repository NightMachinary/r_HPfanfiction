One of the biggest assets would be the rejected Muggleborns who could work for the MI5, gathering intelligence in the magical world (at least pre-takeover) and later still do magic (warding government buildings, magical first aid).

Depending on how close you want to stick to canon (and staying 100% true is not something I would recommend) you could have Ted Tonks escape Voldemort's Gestapo and work for the PM, with his wife Andromeda, who was raised as a pureblood and has a lot of insider knowledge, following later on.

An active involvement from the PM in the final battle would be another thing to consider. Due to the wards, you can't exactly deploy the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment to Hogwarts, but teaching a dozen Muggleborns how to set up several .50 cal on the Astronomy tower and getting a team with LAW-80s there would go a long way to take out Voldemort's meatshields from 500 yards of relative security (try aiming with a wand across that distance).
