Don't worry, I know this thread just amounts to little more than me dipping my toe in the water.

And of course, a 'Proposal' flair would have suited the purpose much better.

I'm glad, however, that the idea is getting the reception it gets. Speaking from personal experience, I know how easily certain story concepts can earn oppressive silence - if not outright vocal rebuke - from long-time fans, so I think a little water-dipping was well warranted.
