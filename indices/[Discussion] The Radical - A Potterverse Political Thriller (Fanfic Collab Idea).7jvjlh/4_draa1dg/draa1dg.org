I really like the idea of this story. Your semi-intro was also intriguing and I'd likely pick up a story like this, if I hadn't seen this thread, first.

It's nothing against you personally, but it sounds like you're trying to get a beta-reader for a story that hasn't been written. There's nothing down. Nothing for me to follow.

This isn't really even a discussion thread, unless the discussion is about whether or not Harry Potter meets House of Cards is an interesting concept (hint - it totally is).

I suppose what I'm really saying is: you've given us nothing to do and, even if you had, no reason to think you'd finish it. Please absolutely come back when you have something real and don't mistake my post or the lack of response to your thread as disinterest in the idea itself.
