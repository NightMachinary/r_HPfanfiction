These are one-shots but still good!

linkffn(High Hopes by ShayaLonnie)

Summary kinda speaks for itself but you've probably heard of ShayaLonnie. They have many, many highly rated fics for the HPfandom. Sad that this one doesn't get as much love.

linkffn(Heterochromic by Webdog177)

This is NOT a harem! I know it says that but it is NOT. Not conventionally anyway, there aren't any scenes were Daphne and Harry even get along. I assure this is purely just Harry x Astoria... Just read this masterpiece to understand. This is the fix that made me greatly appreciate this pairing even if both Greengrass sisters are blank slates for fanfic writers.

Of Course there's also linkao3(Vow of Control) which just don't. If your in the mood for smut, smut, and more raunchy smut. Then here, but it does bridge into harem-ish (Harry having sex with other females). The idea of it is actually pretty good but the author (I want to say MayorHaggor) clearly just wanted to write a dom Harry. So, um, sorry useless rec. Teehee.
