...It kinda makes me want to see a fic where Harry hooks up with a disowned third sister (maybe a squib or werewolf older than Daphne by a year or something).

Hmm...

Queenie Greengrass (to reuse a name from JKR's notes) was Astoria and Daphne's older sister. She was either a squib and disowned/shipped off somewhere or became infected with lycanthropy and disowned.

Harry hooks up with her by chance, not knowing her history. When it comes out they're dating, suddenly the family wants Queenie back for the prestige of the "Boy-Who-Lived" maybe marrying into their family, or they try to pawn Daphne off on him as she's a "younger model" not burdened by being a werewolf or is magical/not a "useless squib".

She tells them to kick rocks, naturally, and Harry supports her.

Astoria would be confused and a little horrified: she never knew she had an older sister.

Daphne could have many routes:

- She could be on board with 'replacing' her older sister for Harry
- She could be against it, and be horrified
- Either way, she may or may not have known about her existence
- Maybe she only had vague memories of her and thought she'd been mistaken
- She could be supportive of Queenie's relationship
- She could be against it, not seeing why Harry would want to date someone like her, but have nothing against her older sister herself
- Envious, as she always had a thing for Harry at a distance

Et cetera.
