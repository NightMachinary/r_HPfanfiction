In a related sense people tend to write manipulative Dumbledore and have Harry figure out his scheem right at the start of the fic, Then Dumbledore tries the same thing over and over to get his plan back on track, only for Harry to yell at him until he goes "dart foiled again, but I'll try again for the Greater Good."

That's just so confusing because they're simultaneously making him out out to be this manipulative genious but also incompetent and repeatedly stopped by teenage rage like ???
