don't know about that its just ive read quite a different range of stories and Ive never come across Ron as a competent villain. I think when they make Harry the villian.........he's still portrayed as menacing. Ron dosent seem to have that. Hes usually seen in 1 of 3 ways

*1. A terrible boyfriend and friend but still basically harmless.........*

*2. He's evil but is being controlled by someone else and is really just a minion*

*3. Hes the villian but is too stupid to be a real threat and once people start fighting back hes preety much done for.*

Ive never found a story where he say convinces everyone Hermione is the abuser and gets her locked up and turns almost everyone against through nothing but his own wits or intellect
