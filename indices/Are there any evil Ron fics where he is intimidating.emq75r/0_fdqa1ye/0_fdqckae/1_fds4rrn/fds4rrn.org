I feel like this is possible with an evil Ron. Hermione's been shown multiple times to be out of tune with people's feelings, like with Lavender's rabbit. Not that she's a total sociopath, or that Ron's always empathetic, but he seems more easygoing and can more easily gain popularity, so I can see him having the people skills to flip this on her.
