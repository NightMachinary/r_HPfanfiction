Not evil, but definitely intimidating, powerful and a really interesting take on Ron in linkffn(13170637) Fate. I really like the story's character interactions and it's the best fic I've seen at taking a lot of plots and running well with them. 2M words and hasn't gotten boring at all. Definitely try it.
