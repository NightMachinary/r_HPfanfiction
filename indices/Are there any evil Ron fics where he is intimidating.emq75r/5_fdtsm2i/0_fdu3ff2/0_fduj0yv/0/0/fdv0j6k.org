Not really a dark lord. I don't imagine him having followers of any kind. Someone so individualistic that the idea of someone dedicating their life to him would feel disappointing.

You know how some villains chose the needs of the many over those of the few? He would be the kind of person to encourage each person to chose their needs over the collective always, no matter the damage caused.

What is a dark lord anyway? Does that sound like a dark lord? Idk.
