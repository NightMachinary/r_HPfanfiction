If I add a companion, I think Ron will chose someone who is fundamentally different from him and looks at the world from a unique perspective. Would also probably create more engaging dialogue than two similar people.

Hmm... I wonder about the time I should set this in. If I do way post-Hogwarts, it'll probably become too original a story. Philosopher's stone is just too young. Maybe an AU where Hogwarts is like a college? Something else?
