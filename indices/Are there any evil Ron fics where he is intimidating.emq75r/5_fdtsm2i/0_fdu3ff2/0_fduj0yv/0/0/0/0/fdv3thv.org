I imagine it has something to do with the way he was brought up. Upping the disregard of Ron a little bit from canon, his personal needs were never even a consideration. Spending a younger life constantly catering to the needs of others, he has developed an unhealthy dislike against anyone doing anything for others. Of course it's a bit extreme but dark people are a bit extreme, aren't they?

Yeah, he definitely likes to experience many things but not in a methodical way. Say if there was a serial killer going around drilling holes in people's heads(ID:Invaded reference), he wouldn't just drill a hole into someone's head to experience it. Instead he would prod and test the serial killer to reveal the complete nature of it's mind. Why does it do what it do, what does he think, etc.
