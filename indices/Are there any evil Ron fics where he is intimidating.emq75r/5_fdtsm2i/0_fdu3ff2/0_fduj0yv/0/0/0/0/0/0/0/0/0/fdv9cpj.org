I would say it's not nessicarily about what's interesting......it's who he would best bond with

A dorm mate would possibly lead him to finding out similar ideals.

A flat mate would he really want one? I think it depends which blends more with his psyche

He could want some one separate than him who can challenge and who he can convert proving his way is right but what if they prove him wrong is that too much of a risk

But someone like himself from the start like my Colin idea would also prove he isn't alone. He is not the strange one because here is someone who shares his beliefs proves that he isn't alone

Not as fun maybe or challenging but they would provide some measure of peace that he is right
