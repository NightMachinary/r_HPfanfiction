It's basically any type of physical assault. Things that can fall under this category are stuff like war prisoners, torture, the character in question losing fights (sustaining injuries), abuse/neglect, hospital stays... Etc.

I do tend to read a lot of fiction based around some of these concepts because I find that specifically in fanfiction, the character dynamics and underlying tones of darkness bring a certain tone to the story that by glossing over these details, can get left out. I'm also very interested in reading these because I find them more interesting the the avg teen rated stories. That being said, they're not for everyone, and I've had click off more then a few for going over the top on the whumpage elements.

Edit: Adding this link as an example of bellatrix!whumpage (its also an EXCELLENT story [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/65319]])

Cheers!
