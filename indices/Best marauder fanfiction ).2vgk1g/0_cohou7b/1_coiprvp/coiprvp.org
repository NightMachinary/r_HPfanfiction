I just read through the entirety of this story in about three sittings this weekend. Just...wow. As someone who has been reading fic on and off since pre-DH, this is the best fic I have ever read. It captures a lot of things so well: living with chronic pain, having friends experiencing abuse but being unable to do anything about it. The characterization of each of the four boys is completely on point, and as they're 11 to 13 year old boys, the actually ACT like 11 to 13 year old boys do.

I have twitter notifications for the author (@AgainstTheMoon) in the hopes that she will resume writing this instead of her fic in another fandom. One can dream...
