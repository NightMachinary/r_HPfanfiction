Oh god, so much truth to that. At least this one isn't completely abandoned. Fun fact about Against the Moon: the first 80 chapters were written in one year. She was at one point posting a new chapter every other day. In 2014, the author published a total of two chapters. :(

She has a chronic illness that prevents her from typing, so a lot of the later stuff is voice dictated, which is mind blowing considering how good the writing is. Its not easy to write or do anything with serious health problems, so I can understand the story falling out of priority after the flurry of activity in the first year and a half.
