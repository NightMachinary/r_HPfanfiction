There's a story in which Harry and Hermione end up in each other's bodies after time travel. It's called /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][A Switched Chance]]/ (W: 116,174; WiP).

The downsides are that 1. switching bodies suddenly makes Harry change his sexuality too (s\he starts fancying Cedric), 2. the first chapters are boring, 3. it's a slow WiP with only 120k words written so far.

The exploration of the new body and the magical theory were not bad, though.
