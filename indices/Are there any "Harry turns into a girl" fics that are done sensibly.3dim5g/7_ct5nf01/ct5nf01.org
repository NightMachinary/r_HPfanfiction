I'd say this one maybe fits: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5004694/1/L-Heritier-de-le-Fay][L'Heritier de le Fay]]. Harry's gender switch isn't really the focus, but it's handled better than in any other stories I've found, and it's... debatably slash? since Harry winds up with Gabrielle (the pairing is almost incidental though, this story isn't a romance).
