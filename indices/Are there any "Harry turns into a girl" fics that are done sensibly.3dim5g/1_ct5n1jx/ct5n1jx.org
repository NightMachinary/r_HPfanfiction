I hesitate to rec this as I don't really feel it's the author's best work, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10969324/1/This-Isn-t-Even-My-Final-Form]]) has a Harry being rather blas√© about turning female(like Jamie Evans), although in this case he's 12, has yet to discover the joys of puberty and rather more excited about having wings. Chemical imbalances don't occur until s/he's 15 and realises that protoplasmic humans can be attractive. The story will probably shape up to be a Twelfth Night-esque comedy of errors, it's only 3 chapters at the moment.

Heh, Twelfth Night, now I want a fic where a young Bellatrix crossdresses to escape the clutches of +Marvolo+Malvolio.
