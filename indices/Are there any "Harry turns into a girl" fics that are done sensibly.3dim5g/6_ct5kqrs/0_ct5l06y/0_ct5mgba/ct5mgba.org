Well, mostly that it's used as a convenience, just to get Draco with Harry or something, as you said. It's a mechanism for writers to make things easier for them as writers, without offering some sort of exploration of what the implications would be or what it means for the characters. Maybe it's because I've lived a lot of those implications (or something similar), but they're always in my mind when I try and read fem!Harry.
