  There's no story that I've seen that touches on the fact that waking up into a body that's the opposite gender to the one you've lived in for all your life would be next to traumatizing.

If my body magically changed into a woman's, the freak-out I'd have is mostly due to an unexpected major alteration of my body. I am informed that I am unusual in this; I've heard teachers talking to students about what they'd do if their bodies switched sexes, and the boys tended to say they that they would commit suicide.

Anyway, I'd take a quick trip to Mdm Pomfrey's to check on my overall health, check on the options for changing back, and not worry unless Mdm Pomfrey says I should.
