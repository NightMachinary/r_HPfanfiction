  Have you considered the potential of a bored Voldemort? One who realises that Potter and the order were what made his life exciting?

I've read one like that. I forget the name, but LV decides that winning the war was his biggest mistake and that actually /ruling/ the magical world... sucks.

He goes back in time to help Harry wrap things up and then... I forget how it resolved him having helped off his younger self.

Given how little I remember, I'm doing a terrible job describing it but I think I remember enjoying it at the time.
