Have you considered the potential of a bored Voldemort? One who realises that Potter and the order were what made his life exciting? You could see Voldemort leaving Britain in search of new challenges and thrills or the Death Eaters trying to impress their leader who has become apathetic to life in general. Would their be a coliseum like arena where men fight beasts for his amusement, how desperate would some people be to impress him when all he wants is some excitement. Does worship become boring?
