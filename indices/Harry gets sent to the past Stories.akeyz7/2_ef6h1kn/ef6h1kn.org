Linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX) It has some crossover with X Men and maybe Naruto (it has been a long time since I read it). It is abandoned though but it fulfills your Harry sent back in time.

Linkffn(The Wishmaster by lokilette) Harry is sent back to the Founders' time. He is raised by Slytherin (it does not go into the details as much as you'd expect.) It deals more with the Deathly Hallows than the time travel in the later parts.
