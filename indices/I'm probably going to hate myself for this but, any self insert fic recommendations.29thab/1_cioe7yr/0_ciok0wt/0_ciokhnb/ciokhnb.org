I do not have first hand confirmation, but after over 350k words over 108 chapters that were religiously added in 6 months, there was a 1 month break, and then a note that she was found with cancer, had a surgery, and got a flesh eating bacteria, then there was a 2 month break before that final update to the story, where she says that the bacteria caused a relapse in the cancer.

... then nothing.

A few other authors have (on their pages) said that she had died, and that she will be missed. There are (at least for me and a couple of other users) no updates or answers to reviews nor PMs. After 2 years, I think that unfortunately, we can assume the worst.
