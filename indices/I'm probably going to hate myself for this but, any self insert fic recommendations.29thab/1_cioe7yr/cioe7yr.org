Well, there's the incomplete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7434407/1/The-Visitor][The Visitor]], which is about a muggle woman transported from our world to that of her favorite fictional one... where she meets her favorite romantic hero, Severus Snape. It is amazingly well written, and the author kept it third person and didn't explicitly say that it was her in there, but it's rather obvious (a female Harry Potter fanfic reader who happens to adore Snape finds herself at Hogwarts and interacting with her favorite characters, eventual romance, etc).

It sticks to canon mostly, but with some alterations (as some things can't be avoided, for good and bad)... and the conclusion of the occlumency lessons is perhaps one of the greatest moments in fan fiction history. Unfortunately, the author succumbed to a long series of health issues. One of the /best/ fan fics ever.

edit: this fic is completely unedited, and has a some (though not too many) mistakes in the language. Do not read if this disturbs you too much. It's not professional, but in the end, it has a raw and fun feel to it because of this.
