I am now ;)

Actually I read this all day Saturday from when I woke up til when I went to sleep, and then again on Sunday morning. (And I'm still not done??!! That's new...)

Also I wanted to thank you for finding a fic with both competent adults /and/ competent children, and a huge heap of politics ;D <3 how did you know most of my favourite things?
