  I feel like there could be a way to do a preserve the timeline storyline well, at least in the hands of a creative author.

I've read a few fics that explore the existential dread of a person who knows their future/past is already immutably set. "I must do this because I have always done this" scenarios. The one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal_Return][Eternal Return]] does it well.

It's most fun in AU fics where the stations of canon barely enter into it, that way the reader is still in suspense about the plot as it happens. For example, I love the way time travel was handled in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lilly and the Art of Being Sisyphus]].
