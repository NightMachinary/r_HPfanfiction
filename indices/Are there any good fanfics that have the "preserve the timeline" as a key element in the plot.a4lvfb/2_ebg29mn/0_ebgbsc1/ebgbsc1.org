Generally, I agree with you. Though the standard do-over fic gets pretty old, pretty quickly. I feel like there could be a way to do a preserve the timeline storyline well, at least in the hands of a creative author.

There was a great Harry time-travels WIP back around 2011-2012 (forget the title) that had the premise that boggarts (or maybe poltergeists? I forget) were actually time-travelers that got themselves caught in paradoxes because they were trying to change their timelines. It was much better than my description, and I was sad that the author took down his/her account because of the 2012 FF purge.
