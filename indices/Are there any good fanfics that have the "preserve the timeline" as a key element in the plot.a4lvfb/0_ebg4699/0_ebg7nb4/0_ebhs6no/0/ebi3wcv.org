To me, the worst aspect of the second approach is usually when characters take it to absolutely ludicrous lengths.

Like, I've seen several fics already where Harry first has Pettigrew arrested to free Sirius, then arranges some absurdly complicated scheme to have him escape again so he can resurrect Voldemort in the graveyard, only to then be completely stumped when things don't work out quite as planned and Voldemort manages to regain a full powerbase.

Even worse when he's willing to actually sacrifice human lives just so this stupid plan can work.

I honestly much prefer stories that don't include the Triwizard resurrection and instead have Voldemort return another way.
