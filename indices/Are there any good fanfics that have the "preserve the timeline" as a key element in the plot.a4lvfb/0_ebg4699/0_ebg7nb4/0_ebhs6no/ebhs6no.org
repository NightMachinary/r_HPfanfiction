The other problem with the second approach is that it often stretches plausibility. Harry is interacting with different people in different ways, but he still catches his first snitch in his mouth immediately after his broom is hexed? Really?

My favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), where he's /trying/ to make changes, but history often seems determined to repeat itself anyway, and he finds it very disturbing. Despite his best efforts, the Dursleys punish him for Dobby's visit, Ginny gets hold of Tom Riddle's diary, Sirius Black is still a fugitive, and Harry is entered into the Triwizard tournament.
