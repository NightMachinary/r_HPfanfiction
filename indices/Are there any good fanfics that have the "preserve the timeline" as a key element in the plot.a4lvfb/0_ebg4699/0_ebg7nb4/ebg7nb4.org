One popular subgenre in HP fanfiction is Peggy Sue or time travel do over where characters get sent back in time for a second chance of sorts.

The two main approaches to this are a) changing as much as possible to gain the biggest possible advantage and resulting in a completely different storyline, or b) preserving the timeline as much as possible while only making minuscule changes so the future knowledge doesn't become irrelevant.

The problem with the second approach is that it usually leads to a very boring story.
