Ack, that's some pretty dark stuff there. It's well written and rather engaging, but /damn/ it makes one cringe. I can kinda understand why people don't really give you the reviews you deserve on that one, so don't worry about it. As the arbiters of canon have no place in fanfiction, you shouldn't listen to the nay-sayers over this.

I pronounce it as good, real good, but reading two one-shots tells me your stuff is not for me, sorry.
