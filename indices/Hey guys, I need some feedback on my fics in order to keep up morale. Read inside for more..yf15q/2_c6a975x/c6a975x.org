Hey, I read one one shot "A Beautiful Mess" and I'm gonna go ahead and give you my thoughts on it.

Honestly, I probably wouldn't read your writing again any time soon. I absolutely love everything dark so it isn't the content that's off-putting. You are /very/ wordy. I primarily write poetry and short stories, so I may not be the best opinion on this because I am accustomed to trying to convey big messages with few words. However, it just wasn't working for me.

Secondly, you are incredibly comma-happy. Do you have anyone to edit your stories for grammar and redundancies? If not, I would highly recommend looking into one.

You obviously have a /lot/ of potential here. You have a great command of the english language, and I think that story would have been much more engrossing and effective if you could cut down on repeated words and ideas. It's a *great* thing to be descriptive, but when you've already used one metaphor to describe something, don't continue to describe it. It disengages the reader, and gives conflicting ideas of what something looks/feels like. There's a point where you have to let the reader discern for him/herself in their mind what a situation feels/looks/sounds like to a character after you've already given them enough.

All of that aside, you are /good/ but not polished. I think that may be why some people are reluctant to leave reviews. If something is teetering on the edge of great writing, people are less inclined to be honest than if something is great or if something is terrible.

TL;DR: *This is only based on reading "A Beautiful Mess".* You're a good writer with good ideas, but you are too repetitive and comma-happy to truly engage a reader.
