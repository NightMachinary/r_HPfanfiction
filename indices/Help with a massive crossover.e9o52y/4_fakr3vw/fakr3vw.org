  I'm planning a Grail War

I assume this isn't about Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Pity. I don't know who most of those characters are, but I will just point out that Albus being Ariana's "master" is very disturbing. (Though it could be just my perverted mind). And Ezio is a master assassin, how come Ron is his master? Shouldn't it be the other way? Oh, and Edmond Dantes is from the novel "The Count of Monte Cristo", not some "grand" order.
