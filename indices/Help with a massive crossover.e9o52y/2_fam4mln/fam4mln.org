It is Hard to give a sugestion whitout knowing what you want to do xD

I would cut most of your non fate servants, too many crossovers would just create confusion and make the story to dard to focus. I would change akechi for Mod!harry, it would give a interesting dynamic with Malfoy and it is a classic.

I like ezio.

A au!ariana with dumbledore has huge potencial.

If you want to Troll snape hard core, Hans instead of Elisabeth. But Elisabeth is fine.

Widowmaker is meh, especialy paired with greyback. Give the man Robin hood.

I know nothing about the other crossovers.
