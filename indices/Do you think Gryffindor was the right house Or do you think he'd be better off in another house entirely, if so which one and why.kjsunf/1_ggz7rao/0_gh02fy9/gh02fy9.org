‘Borderline Segregation' is taking it a bit far. It's not the House system that is the problem, but the way Fanon and to an extent canon, treats it so rigidly. It seriously lacks nuance. Is there a problem with the virtues extolled by the Founders? No, they are all good virtues to have.

Is there a problem with separating according to those virtues? No, the intention is to place like minded folk with like minded folk, to foster friendships and create a cohesive unit for teamwork. That's why inter-house sports are encouraged.

This is an instance of the fault being not with the system itself, though it is falsely attributed to that, but with the staff who are in positions of authority over the Houses. It is the Head of House's responsibility to ensure that toxic attitudes do not fester from within. The role of Head of House, is primarily one of Pastoral Care, and they act in loco parentis (In place of parents). P.S.E (Personal and Social Education) is taught by your Head of House for instance and they are supposed to be your first port of call if you have issues, such as stress, depression, disability etc, or if you have issues with other Members of Staff i.e. (in an ideal world, Harry should have gone to McGonagall with complaints about Snape).

However, the fact is, if Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education actually inspected Hogwarts, both Snape and McGonagall would likely fail. Snape on obvious grounds of unprofessional conduct and it would be recommended that he be fired or removed from a position of Pastoral Care. McGonagall would in a fair world be cautioned for being dismissive of Pupil concerns. Realistically, it is not Dumbledore who does the damage but Snape and McGonagall.

For an example of what a real house system is in practice, with competent Heads of House, I will speak from personal experience. My old private school had four key virtues; Integrity, Compassion, Aspiration and Academic Rigour. Now, we were not separated based on those virtues but we did have four houses: Kilallan (Blue), Craigmarloch (White) Strathgryffe (Yellow) Duchal (Red)

We actually used to compare ourselves to the Hogwarts Houses. My house, Kilallan was compared to Ravenclaw, Strathgryffe and Duchal were Hufflepuff and Gryffindor respectively. Craigmarloch was our Slytherin, because they kept winning on points. We disliked them purely out of sporting rivalry and the spirit of competition and nothing else. A little competition is healthy. In terms of house activities, there was the Swimming Gala and Sports Day, which was split into House teams, organised by the House Captains. House Assembly happened once a month, and Charity Events were organised by each year group, also in houses. We would also help out the local community as part of our Houses. Each First Year was also assigned a ‘Regent' or mentor from the Sixth Year. I.e. Each Sixth year was a Regent, for a First year and a Prefect of the School. The Regent system was in place to mentor the first years and to provide a place to talk, if you weren't comfortable going directly to your Head of House.

In terms of classes, lower year classes were separated roughly on House lines. After choosing your subjects, it was a bit more of a free for all. Extracurricular activities were outwith the houses too, so plenty of opportunity to meet different people.

Was the system perfect? Christ no, but it worked damn well for what it was.

The problems of the Hogwarts Houses are not inherent but through lack of discipline and the failure of the Staff to do their jobs properly. Toxic People existed everywhere. Malfoy and his ilk in Slytherin, Zacharias Smith in Hufflepuff, the Bullies of Luna Lovegood in Ravenclaw and Cormac MacLaggan in Gryffindor.
