  It's not the House system that is the problem, but the way Fanon and to an extent canon, treats it so rigidly. It seriously lacks nuance.

I think you'll find that canon is the /primary/ offender there. Some fanfictions try to give Slytherin a more nuanced portrayal, but canon, sadly, does not. Not a single Slytherin stayed to help at the Battle of Hogwarts. /Not one/ current Slytherin student gets anything resembling a positive portrayal, while the Slytherin teachers either live off-screen, like Professor Sinistra, or are very mixed bags indeed (Professor Slughorn, Professor Snape).

And you're right; the supposed virtues of Slytherin House, cunning and ambition, can be fine things to have. Except that Crabbe and Goyle don't have a scrap of either one. Draco Malfoy, who was sorted into Slytherin the instant the Hat touched his head, has slightly more intelligence but is just coasting on his father's position, without any apparent ambition of his own, and doesn't show a trace of subtlety until sixth year when his life literally depends on it. Pansy Parkinson shows up just to call a few insulting names. Marcus Flint is a brute leading a team of brutes; "he's made a few changes to the line-up and seems to be going for size rather than skill."

All of that is canon, not fanon. I can recommend some fanfiction that does a much more balanced job, if you like.
