my annoyance is Rowling didn't expand the house system.

each of these houses have existed for a thousand years. and the wizarding world of Britain clearly puts emphasis on them and each house has a different entrence.

she should have leaned into it more, each house should have its own culture. with maybe its own lessons taught up upper years of each house.

instead houses in canon are just where you sleep and eat.
