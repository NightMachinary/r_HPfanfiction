Well Badgers are brave(maybe not recklessly jumping into action and having a hero complex like Gryffs, but I'd imagine that they would be reckless in certain situations like Gryffs, example being Death Eaters attacking a village, or a werewolf attacking someone, cause its the right thing to do) also, but every Puff remained at the Battle of Hogwarts(like every Gryff), cause it was the right thing to do. Both houses believe in utilitarianism, loyalty and companionship.
