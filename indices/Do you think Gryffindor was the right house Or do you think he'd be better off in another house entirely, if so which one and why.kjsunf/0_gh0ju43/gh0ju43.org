I think Gryffindor is the perfect house for him because of /how/ he choose it.

He was basically a terrified 11 year old who was starved for attention his whole live. But the only thing he said was "Not Slytherin" - after being told it was the "evil house". Sure, all things considered this is pretty biased but Harry, terrified about his place in the magical world got offered doing "great in Slytherin". And instead of leaping to the opportunity of being great he chose just "not being evil". If you consider his live until to this point that really takes leaps of bravery.

So yes, while I see that Harry has potential for each house: he can be studious if he neds to be, he can be cunning and ambitious and he also can be a hard worker and is very loyal - in the end being brave is what he chooses. So Gryffindor is the best choice.
