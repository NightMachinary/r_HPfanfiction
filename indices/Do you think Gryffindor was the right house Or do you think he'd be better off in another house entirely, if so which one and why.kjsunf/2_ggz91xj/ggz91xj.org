I'd say yes(he is very modest and humble, and doesn't want to be reminded of fame being BWL, a fine Badger indeed). He would do fine in any house(even Ron and Hermione would also), but maybe slightly less in Ravenclaw(He is smart, but he doesn't pursue knowledge, and isn't that witty, like Luna, who has a drive to prove that creatures no one has ever found exist, and truly believes they do, even though there isn't any solid proof), though he needed to be in the warmer House duo(that being Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, which inspire companionship/bravery/doing the right thing/being utilitaristic, in contrast of Ravenclaw and Slytherin, which inspire individuality/alliances/manipulation/using any means to get to the goal/pursuing any type of knowledge). Also that doesn't mean anything, and it can not influence you fully, cause you can have warmer traits even in Slytherin(Draco and Snape being the example), but in Harry's case it kinda does. He didn't have any interactions with the magical world before Hogwarts. He built himself a stigma that all Slytherins are evil/dark, and that Hufflepuffs are duffers(Hagrid said that in the first book, but that's thanks to Dumbledore, cause he wanted to lead Harry away from bad choices throughout the series, the Hat after all takes your choice). In conclusion, if we put everything we know in canon presorting as canon, he'd be still in Gryffindor, thanks to Dumby's scheming, but Hufflepuff would have been probably the best house choice for Harry's wellbeing.
