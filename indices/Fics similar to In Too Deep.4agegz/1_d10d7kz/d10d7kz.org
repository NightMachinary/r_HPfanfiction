I'm currently writing "The Dark Lord Never Died", where Malfoy took over Britain in 1981. In 1999, Hermione is a "Wand of Britain", raised as a loyal soldier for the new regime, while Ron is an agent for the exiled Dumbledore. Voldemort, who was betrayed by Malfoy, just returned, and started attacking Britain.
