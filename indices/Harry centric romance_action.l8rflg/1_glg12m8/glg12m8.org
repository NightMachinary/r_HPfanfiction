Linkffn(The Merging; Black Luminary). The former definitely fits your prompt better, and it has the added benefit of being complete, but the latter is worth checking out, as well: it takes longer for it to get to the action, and it's a rare fic in which the endgame main pair is genuinely in question (personally, I'm rooting for Tracey, but I have a long and storied history of backing hopeless romantic candidates, so I don't think my opinion's worth much), but when the action does start, it's pretty damn good, and I remember thinking its relationship writing was on point.
