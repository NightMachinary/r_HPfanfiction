I don't think so. Prompts aren't trying to /discuss/, they're trying to /inspire people to write/. To that end, discussion is /not/ actually conducive - I have never, /ever/ seen a discussion in a Prompt thread lead to anyone actually writing a fic-let, let alone a "discussion" that devolves into prompt-bashing.

If I wanted a discussion, that's what I'd label the thread. I'd frame it as "Would this be a cool AU to write? Discuss what'd need to change and give your opinions on whether those breaks from canon are okay."

It's discouraging to write a prompt, trying to inspire an author that may be suffering from lack of inspiration, only to hear "this prompt requires AU so it doesn't make sense as a prompt" or "I hate <character/trope>, therefore I hate this prompt".

If you don't like a prompt, you don't write a fic for it - same as if you don't like the trope/idea in a Request thread, you don't offer a suggestion and just let your silence do the talking.
