Depends. I kind of like writing-prompts sometimes when they actually inspire me to /write/, which is kinda the idea behind having them.

Maybe if prompts were split off into their own, active, sub we could get rid of them here. Actual guidelines to what makes a good prompt would help too - if nothing else it'd weed out the "glorified 3-sentence plotbunny" prompts.
