As someone who on multiple occasions has been inspired by prompt threads, I'd say please don't. Sometimes people have great ideas but just aren't able to write it themselves. Sometimes the ideas are utter nonsense, but that's fine. We don't say 'don't write fics' just because 90% of everything is terrible; banning prompts for such a reason would be equally frustrating to those of us who appreciate the 10%.
