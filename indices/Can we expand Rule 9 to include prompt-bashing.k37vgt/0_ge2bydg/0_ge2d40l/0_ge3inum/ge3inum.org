  Constructive criticism maybe
#+end_quote

So you agree that providing criticism is a good thing? It's just bad criticism you object to.

Unfortunately you have to accept that the bad will happen if you're going to get the good. Much like the issue of 95% of prompts being terrible...to get the occasional good one you have to permit the terrible ones.
