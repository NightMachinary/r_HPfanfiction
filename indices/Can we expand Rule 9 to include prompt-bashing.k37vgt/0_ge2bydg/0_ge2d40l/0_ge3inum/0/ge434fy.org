  So you agree that providing criticism is a good thing? It's just bad criticism you object to.

I think what OP is saying is that there's a huge difference between "I don't think this prompt would work, because if x never happens it would also affect y," or "this kind of story is really overdone in the fandom, can you be more specific what it is you want out of this prompt" and "lol this idea is really crappy" or "why would you put up a prompt about Umbridge, I hate Umbridge."

The former examples help the prompter to think about what they're asking for, what kind of story they're looking for, and perhaps enables them to refine their posts in the future to make more effective prompts. The latter are a matter of personal taste - just because you think something is a bad idea it doesn't mean others won't want to read it.The former are also polite, whereas the latter are quite rude.

There's a difference between critique/feedback and criticism - ie "OP, have you considered how Remus's werewolf status would affect this prompt because I think what you've suggested wouldn't work with how lycanthropy affects him, at least the way it's presented in canon. Could you provide more details?" is feedback and is constructive. "Werewolf fics are boring and this prompt wouldn't work anyway" is just criticism and not constructive.
