Constructive criticism maybe, "I hate <character/trope>/there are AU elements, therefore prompt bad" no.

And you know what'd help with those Sturgeon's Law prompts, which I don't actually see anyone stepping up to do? Making some /centralized/ guidelines and putting them somewhere prominent so it's public knowledge what makes a prompt work.

If you keep running into the same issues, it's worth prominently posting how to avoid them instead of having to repeat them over and over.
