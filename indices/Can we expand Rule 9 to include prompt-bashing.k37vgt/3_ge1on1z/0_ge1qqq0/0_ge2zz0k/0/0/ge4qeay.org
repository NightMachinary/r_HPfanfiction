This comment you've linked to has got nothing to do with anything I've said or asked. I think there's something wrong with your logic processing, as nothing you've said so far answers any of the very real questions I've asked.

The comment you've linked attempts to explain your views on what should and shouldn't be allowed. Apparently, feedback/critique and criticism are different in that criticism isn't constructive, and is a matter of personal taste. You do realise that when I said "why not ban all criticism," I was being sarcastic?
