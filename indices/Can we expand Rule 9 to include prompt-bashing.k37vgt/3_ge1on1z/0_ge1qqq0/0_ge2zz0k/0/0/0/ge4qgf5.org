  Who is going to determine whether the criticism was in a kind enough manner for you to be okay with?
#+end_quote

This is the question that's being answered. There's a pretty clear line between what is constructive and what isn't. And to be clear, what isn't /kind/ also tends to conveniently fall under the part that isn't /constructive/ - saying you hate the prompt (hate being the keyword) or it will /never/ work because of a thing that can (or can't, if it's the very premise) be changed.

And yes, I am capable of noticing sarcasm thank-you-very-much - it's just worth stating either way.

  And anyway, what could there possibly be that needs additional enforcing, that isn't already covered by existing rules, both site- and subreddit-wide?

If it's already covered by a rule, I'd love to /see/ that it is.
