It's actually quite simple. Anything that gets removed under Rule 9 on Request threads, same guideline applies for Prompt threads - so things like just saying "I hate Ron" under a prompt for "Harry and Ron pretend to date as a joke that gets out of hand"? Against the rules. Framing your criticism with "This prompt sucks because <trope/AU element>"? Bye.

Could also include the bit about being able to label "No Discussion" as well, for writing-prompts that you'd consider "finished" as in "nothing more needs to be worked out, the rest is up to authors".

Writing prompts aren't meant to be discussions, in my eyes. If I wanted to know if something was a good idea for a prompt, I'd make a discussion thread asking "Is this a good idea for a writing prompt?" /before/ I put the prompt out there.
