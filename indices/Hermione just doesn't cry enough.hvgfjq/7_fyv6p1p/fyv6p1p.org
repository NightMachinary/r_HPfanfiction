My story (108k words and counting) is written from Hermione's POV. I'm trying to strike a balance between making her smart and defiant and practical but still showing her emotional side. She cries in my fic. Definitely. But that doesn't mean she isn't strong.

I haven't posted any of this. I worry that people will find her ooc but I've come too far to change my characterisation now. I guess I'll find out when I'm finished and start to post!
