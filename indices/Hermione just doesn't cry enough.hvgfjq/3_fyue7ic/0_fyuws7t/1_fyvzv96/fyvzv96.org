I think that as a person Hermione greatly relies on logic to understand things. So she tries to treat Lavender in a logical way like she would probably try to rationalise it to herself. I don't think she was being intentionally heartless. Not to mention that this was when Hermione had the time turner and was super stressed.

I definitely don't think Hermione is perfect. But in that scenario I think it can be understood where she's coming from.
