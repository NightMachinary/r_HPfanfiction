I think of it as a reflection of Hermione's intelligence. When she can approach the issue intellectually, such as for Cho's emotional state, she can conceptualize the emotions in order to understand their relationship to inputs. As soon as she herself becomes emotionally invested, as in the cases of Ron and Lavender's bunny, she can't access her intellect.

This is, as you point out, a common issue for teenagers.
