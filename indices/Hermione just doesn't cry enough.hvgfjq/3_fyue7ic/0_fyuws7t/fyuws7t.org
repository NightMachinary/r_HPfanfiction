She does have some odd contradictory tendencies in the books. For instance, she shows absolutely no emotional understanding when Lavender Brown was upset about her bunny, while apparently a walking library about Cho's emotions. She has no tolerance for Ron showing jealousy about her relationship with Viktor, but ruthlessly assaults Ron when she can't handle seeing him with Lavender (while he doesn't tear into her about her jealousy, like she did to him)
