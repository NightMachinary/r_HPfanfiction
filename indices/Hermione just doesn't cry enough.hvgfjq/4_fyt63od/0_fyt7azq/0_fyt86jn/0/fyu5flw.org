It's more along the lines of Harry needed someone who wouldn't add to his emotional baggage, had emotional baggage that he could handle and he needed someone who wouldn't put up with his shit and also is able to handle his emotional baggage as well.

Ginny is the kind of person who will look at Harry and know whether he needs a shoulder to cry on, someone to actually talk to or someone that just needs to listen.

Hermione is someone who will look at Harry and just tell him what he needs to do to get better which isn't something that Harry needs/wants.

You can see that by how Ginny and Hermione deal with Harry having to mourn. Ginny from what i remember will come up to Harry, give him a hug, and sit with him not really saying much just being an emotional anchor. While Hermione will come up and try and talk to Harry about his feelings and how to handle them, they aren't wrong responses in general, but Ginny's response is what works with Harry most of the time.
