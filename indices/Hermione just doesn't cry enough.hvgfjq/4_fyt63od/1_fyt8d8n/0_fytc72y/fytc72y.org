To be fair, Hermione appears more in 1 book than Ginny (or any female student) does in all 7 put together, so it isn't a fair comparison.

Maybe it is because I have sisters and many female friends, but I don't think canon Hermione cries that much. Women cry a lot. It's just the way of the world. Maybe men would, also, but we are conditioned to be less emotional.
