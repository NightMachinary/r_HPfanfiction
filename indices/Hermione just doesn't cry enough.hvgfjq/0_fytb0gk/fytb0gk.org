I do remember book hermione crying a lot, and she comes off as ooc a lot in Fanfictions unintentionally. I think most of the time Hermione acts as a self-insert, or people just want her to be this strong, female character, which she definitely is, but crying doesn't make you weak. It makes you human, and that's why hermione sometimes seems so surreal in Fanfiction
