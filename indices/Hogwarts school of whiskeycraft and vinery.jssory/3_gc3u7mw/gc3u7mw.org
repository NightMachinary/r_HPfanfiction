I have imagined Snape being the “Tavern Master/Brew Master” of Hogwarts.

“Class....Who can tell me what is the difference between an ale and a lager? Anyone....anyone besides Ms. Granger? Very well....”

“Please sir for the average beer drinker, the difference between an ale and a lager comes down to how the beer looks, smells, and tastes. Ales tend to be fruity-estery, while lagers are clean-tasting and frequently described as "crisp." But to a brewer, the difference is more fundamental than that. It's not color, or flavor, or aroma, or hop/grain/malt varietals or even water hardness that separates a lager from an ale. Simply put, lagers use an entirely different type of yeast during fermentation.”

“An answer delivered straight from the “Brewmaster's Bible.... Are you incapable of thinking for yourself or do you simply enjoy regurgitating information as if you had just inhaled one of the Weasley twins abhorrent puking pastry's? 100 points from Gryffindor for you lackadaisical indolent attitude.”

Or conversely: Say Percy, who's that teacher drinking beer with Professor Quirrel?

“That's Professor Snape, Brewmaster of Hogwarts. Right now he's drinking a Pilsner but everyone knows it's the Dark Beers he fancies”
