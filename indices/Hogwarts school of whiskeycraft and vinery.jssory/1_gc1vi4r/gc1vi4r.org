I mean really, considering that everyone in the wizarding world learns how to brew potions its not that big of a leap to them developing a strong tradition of home-brewing alcoholic beverages.

It's even got historical precedent. Look up alewives. They were basically housewives that brewed their own ale for personal use and local sale (ale was a lot safer to drink than plain water back then). Their signature attire eventually became what we nowadays consider witch's attire. They were commonly condemned as witches after new brewing techniques made the industry profitable enough for men to want to take it over.
