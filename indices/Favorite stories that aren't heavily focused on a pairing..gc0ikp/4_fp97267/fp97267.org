[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290]] this is a dark!harry but not evil harry. He gets resorted into slytherin in his 5th year and has started to look into the dark arts to help stop voldemort. Really well written one of my favourite fics of all time, hp/dm but not the main focus in anyway - done well in every way. . . .

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]] another of my favourites, if not my favourite, harry didn't go to hogwarts so Hermione and the squad track him down to teach him magic. It's just perfect, hp/dm but again lowkey and there relationship makes me laugh so much, awkward teens sharing a tent to pretty sweet . . . neither of these recommendations are graphic when it comes to sex, they're very soft and both are so well written i cant recommend them more, i hope you enjoy
