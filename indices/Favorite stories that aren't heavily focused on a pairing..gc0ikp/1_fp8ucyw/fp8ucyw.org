A super long Remus character study, and one of my all time favorite fics of any fandom. The author's dedication to fleshing out the marauders era characters whilst being unafraid to stick almost entirely faithful to canon is one of the reasons this is considered one of the best.

Wolfstar is the main paring but it's a super slow burn, and doesn't fully develop until far later in the story.

Incomplete but the author updates fairly frequently.

A time travel Regulus and Harry centric fic. They're also the main paring but the romance is almost non existent, and the author is adamant that this is a story more about the platonic relationships between the main characters than anything else.

This story is also fairly slow moving and features a lot of character introspection, if you're into that.
