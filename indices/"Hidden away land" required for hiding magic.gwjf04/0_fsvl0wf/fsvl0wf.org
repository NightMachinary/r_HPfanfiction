My theory of "wizard space" as many fics call it is that the surface of reality/the world can be viewed as a map. If you then took the boundaries of wizarding areas and stitched them together you could create a new flat "surface" that doesnt show Diagon Alley for example. The creases and dimples where the folds come together are places like the Leaky Cauldron

All peculiarities in street design and geological shape to the world are due to various wizarding folds.
