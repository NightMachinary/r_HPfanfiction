In linkffn(A Time Apart by Ozzallos), a multicross of mostly Ranma/Sailor Moon/Harry Potter, Sailor Pluto notes that wizard spaces are out of phase with mundane reality, which would mean that there's probably an entire wizarding Earth available. That seems incompatible with the treatment of #12 Grimmauld Place and the Leaky Cauldron, though.

In linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream), a Sherlock cross, Sherlock notes that #12 Grimmauld Place is one of about three dozen "missing" houses he knows of in London, and mentions social organizations devoted to such locations worldwide. This fits your "wizard space," but indicates that even if a property is protected by fidelius or other charms, there are effects that muggles can note if they're paying attention.

  “That's been done. Anyway, once I'd got the streets down, I walked them all. Studied them all. Noticed the anomalies. Did you know, for example, that there are precisely thirty-seven missing houses in London?”

  “Like Leinster Gardens?” asked Mary, shivering. She really didn't like to think about what had happened and almost happened there, although things had worked out in the end.

  “Well no, Leinster Gardens has house numbers and fake house fronts but there's a physical gap where the houses themselves are missing. These missing houses are just ... not there. Gaps in the sequence where there's no reason for there to be a gap, but no actual gap between houses. A street with eight houses on one side and seven identical houses and a missing number on the other side. And nobody notices that it takes forty paces to walk from the north end of the street to the south, but forty-four from south to north, only on the side with the missing number.”

And, in non-fanfiction, R. A. Lafferty's "Narrow Valley" has a marvelous description of what you see when you try to throw a rock the apparent 8 feet from one side of the magically-narrowed valley to the other.
