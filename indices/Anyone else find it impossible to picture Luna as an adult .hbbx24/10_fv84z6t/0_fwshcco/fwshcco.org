Actually, one of the many good things on unfairly neglected linkffn(Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers) is how good Lovegoods are well written. They are more overgrown hobbits than elves, but they are really good. The story has not been finished, which is unfortunate on one side (I know that Padma/George shipping is a clich√©, but I would love to see it), on the other hand the author planned to make Marvel films crossover, so it is probably right she didn't.
