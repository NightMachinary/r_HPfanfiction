Funny, I was thinking about my Luna as I was looking at this thread, but I'm kind of surprised to see I Know Not linked here since she's definitely a child in that. (I actually made a new reddit account to reply since I like keeping my non-billows presences a bit separate, but I updated my Twitter for verification/proof.)

But thank you [[/u/wave-or-particle][u/wave-or-particle]] for the recommendations. I'm so glad that the story resonated with you and that you feel moved to share it with other people. (Also thank you [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] and [[/u/elemonated][u/elemonated]] for the kind words.)

I'm actually resuming work on an AU sequel, so I've been thinking a lot about Luna as an adult--not only because this is something that Snape needs to come to terms with for himself, but also because this story will follow Luna as she comes into her own as a young woman, a witch, an academic, a daughter, a survivor, a friend, and so on. The challenge is to balance that dreaminess that makes her Luna while still taking into account the profoundly traumatic events of Deathly Hallows, as well as her trajectory towards finding healthy ways of coming to terms with those experiences. In other words, though the ways in which a post-war Snape needs to grow and heal are pretty obvious, Luna also starts the story as a deeply wounded individual who is equally in need of support and care.

(I'll admit that it's rather slow going, though. This mental health thread is just one of several--I'm also taking on the issue of representation in Harry Potter and the social oppressiveness of British wizarding society, as well as developing frameworks for American forms of magic and--in conjunction--rounding out some new characters who need to be as complex and deeply human as Snape and Luna, but in a way that enriches and guides their journey, rather than distracts from it. It's...a lot. But seeing that folks are still reading and thinking about I Know Not motivates me to keep chipping away at it. So thank you again.)
