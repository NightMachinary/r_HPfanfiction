I have met one person who was a serious contender for a Luna that was around 30. She was a well regarded ceramics artist and nude model who's house was absolutely filled with found-treasures and plants with apparent healing properties (Wicca), and honestly? A really lovely woman. When I met her, within 5 minutes we were sitting in a window bay in her home both sharing how our fathers had passed on while we were girls growing up. She gave me home made tea and seemed to have an air about her that everything was alright in the world.

Her mother was an artist and wealthy, and I think that's a part of why it worked, because being that lovely and a bit out of it would normally have the world chew you up and spit you out.

She was really, really nice, made exceptionally good scones and was gay. I could absolutely have seen Luna be a bit that way.
