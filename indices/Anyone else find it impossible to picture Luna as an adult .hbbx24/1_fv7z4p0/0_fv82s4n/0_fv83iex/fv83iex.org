Yeah, I think a girl like Luna is inherently very vulnerable because of a sense of self-assured naïveté that isn't entirely anchored in reality. Luna at a university party, Luna buying a second-hand car, Luna in a job interview... all these situations have the potential to turn south without a sense of worldliness.
