loose conection here, but this reminded me of tiny tina from borderlands 2, she's older in 3 ands its a weird transition

they made the character more "normal" in that shes matured and knows how to talk to people better while still maintaining some the craziness from her youth.

something like that might serve luna's character well. it would sacrifice that ethereal bizzarness she has a little, but make her more real.some of her floatyness feels like what i imagine a child who was raised alone, went through a traumatic event, and also had a father who blurs the line between whats magical and real and whats magical and fictional. her making friends and growing up could easily allow her to grow more socially skilled without drastically reinventing her character.
