In addition to the folks giving Phoebe from friends as an example, I'd also like to present Frankie from Grace and Frankie. Around 70-75 years old as the show starts, friendly to everyone, always going off on tangents, ex-hippie, believing non-conventional things, working as an art teacher to ex-convicts.
