When I think of a young Luna (first four years of Hogwarts) as I imagine stories in my head as I read them, I think of Evanna Lynch when she was in OotP, when the character was supposed to be 14 and the actress herself 15?

When Luna's 16 or 17? I think of Miss. Lynch when she was in her late teens (18/19 or even 20), wrapping up on DHp2, because she still looked like she was 13/14 when she was supposed to be 16/17 and it just looked strange to me.

Older than that? I think of her when she did things like Dancing With the Stars.

Partly, I think it's because when she had an unfortunate eating disorder when she was younger, it affected her growth in her early teenage years -- hence why she physically looked like she was 12, maybe, when she was supposed to be 15? So, there's a bit of a dissonance and it explains why she looked years younger than what she was supposed to look like, I guess?

Thankfully, time and her own willpower meant she overcame her problems, but it's left mental, visual images in my mind that Evanna Lynch's older, physical appearance is what Luna looked like in her final Hogwarts years and her later life, but her OotP appearance is her when she was younger, like her first few years.

Strangely enough, Emma Watson and the other cast-members had similar yet opposite problems: as the films went on (time during films/production compared to in-universe years), it ultimately had them at 20, 21 portraying 17 year olds, even though the series started with the actors/actresses being 9 and 10 respectively to portray 11/near 12 year olds, heh.

So, that's what my brain does to give more 'realistic' mental images of the characters (even Malfoy, since Tom Felton physically matured rapidly in his late teens: it's like the guy drank Miracle Grow for Humans, hah).

Funnily enough, I always though Karen Gilliam (who played the lovely Amelia Pond in Doctor Who, before it went to crap) would've made a fantastic Ginny Weasley, had she been born in a different time.
