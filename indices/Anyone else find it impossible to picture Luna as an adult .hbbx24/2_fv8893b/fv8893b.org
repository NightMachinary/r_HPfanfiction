I don't and I know about at least very good (and one not so bad) pictures of her. I think with finding true friends and the life partner and having kids, she could settle down a bit, and so her in linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) works for me quite well. Or she could stay single and be as awesomely crazy as ever, and then her as the Professor of DADA in the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] (starting with linkao3(1048010)) is pretty awesome one. That not so bad portrait of her is Luna by Northumbrian for example in her chapter in linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian), linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian), or in linkffn(7801923). However, her main story by him in linkao3(Yggdrasil by Northumbrian) is kind of meh.

I think she a victim of her opposite position to the character development than the rest of the stories (as [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][I have described it about Ginny]]): Luna doesn't have any character development in the canon, because the story is not about her, but about our relationship with her. We started reading about her cynical and jadded (as Hermione did), but eventually we find out how faithful and self-sacrificing friend she is, etc. Exactly the same development Harry and other characters went through. And that is very possible and right (contrary to what I complain about Ginny), however it doesn't make any space for her to show who she really is. You know all those awesome lines like “It would be like having friends”? They are actually a way more serious than they look: Luna is never real friend to anybody in the books, because she never reveals to anybody who she really is. We know she was bullied, but we have never seen her crying, or even being otherwise affected by it. She is completely poker faced about loosing her mum, she just dances through the Battle in the Department of Mysteries, she never let us know who she really is. Which works perfectly well for JKR, because Luna is never in any serious relationship (not only with boys, but we never really see her friendship with Ginny, we just hear about it; and there is no follow-up on her evening with Harry).

However, it doesn't work for fanfiction stories where she should be real character, and it doesn't especially work for any romantic stories. Authors have to mostly create her from scratch which they do sometimes with good results (linkao3(Protection From Nargles by Arpad_Hrunta), linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)), sometimes otherwise.
