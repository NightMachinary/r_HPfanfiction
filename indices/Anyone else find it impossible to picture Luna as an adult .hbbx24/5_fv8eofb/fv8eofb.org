Whenever I picture Luna as an old woman, I can only picture a female version of Dumbledore when we first see him at the Hogwarts opening feast.

"Nitwit! Oddment! Blubber! And Tweak!" That sort of stuff. So probably senile at first glance, but still possessing some degree of unseen sanity. I can totally see her trying to pass out lemon sherbet candy to anyone who has wrackspurts in their heads because she found out they help to get rid of them.
