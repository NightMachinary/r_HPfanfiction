Why of course! Luna is part of the 'Gang' from Hogwarts, but she's rather regarded as the baby, and everything she says is taken with a grain of salt....but Harry always knows that there is truth to what she says, but her mind doesn't know how to express the things she wants to say in ways that typical wizards know. So when a 35 ish Luna, divination professor at Hogwarts, informs harry that Sirius, Remus, James, and Severus seem to be having a Wrackspurt infestation and need an objective eye, Harry knows that someone is going to die soon. Someone who knows them all.
