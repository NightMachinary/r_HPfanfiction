I have always pictured adult Luna Kind of like the head zookeeper at the animal rescue by my house are very chill older lady will streaked of purple in her hair. that can tell you pretty much almost anything About the exotic animal trade on every continent she Is a whirl published biologist and actually helped hunt down a few frog species in South America in the 1990s . She always has kind of a dreamy expression but she is sharp as a tack. That kind of person is how I kind of picture an adult Luna, Very perceptive good at reading people and aware of everything around her and most of what's going on in the world. Adult Luna at the helm of the Quibbler would be a very interesting idea for a story.
