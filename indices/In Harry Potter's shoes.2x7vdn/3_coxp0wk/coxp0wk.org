SI are definitely a good way to get writing practice and get a lot of bad cliches and poor editing skills out of your system before moving on to better plots. Stick it out, finish it the way you want it finished, and then see if you can write some truly original work. Look at the Teachers Lounge community for plot bunnies and also the HPFFChallenges community threads. Make sure your outlining your plot so you don't write yourself into a corner or forget what's happening.
