Just looking at the premise, I have a few thoughts. SIs are fine, and replacing an existing character is fine. The major cliche you need to watch for is turning you/Harry into a Gary Stu - that is, a perfect character who does everything right. Gary Stu stories are boring, because there is no real conflict. Make sure you don't have your character "fix" everything in Harry's life with only minimal trouble. Have him fail at things, both minor and major, or forget about important points, or have others react in ways he wasn't expecting and can't handle. Keep it interesting.

Powerful!Harry is another cliche you may want to watch out for. Is your character going to be able to easily do any spell you've read about in the books? Or is he going to use magic in ways no wizard has thought of using ever and revolutionise wizarding society? (For example, many authors use oaths and secrecy spells excessively, or make veritaserum infallible.) That's not to say it's always a bad thing, especially since your SI is Harry Potter - he has the "power he knows not" after all. /A Black Comedy/ did this very well, making the power he knows not a ridiculously awesome combo of summoning and banishing charms that were so precise they were basically extra magical arms.

And you may want to watch out for other cliches that involve young Harry, like suddenly helpful goblins (because Harry had /manners/!) or children not acting like children (specifically Hermione in this case - Harry is you now, so he isn't a child).

It's nearly impossible to cover all the cliches, but there is a Harry Potter fan fiction page on TVTropes you may want to check out.

On to your actual fic:

You have a poor grasp of grammar which, paired with your habit of complex sentences, makes for an almost unreadable story. Your main problem is run on sentences, both in your dialogue and in your prose. There are also instances of subject-verb agreement, incorrect pronoun usage, and sometimes just...weed sentences that don't make any sense as written.

When I have to stop and reread a sentence two or three times, it breaks immersion. When almost every sentence is that bad, there is no immersion to break. It is frustrating to read. (EDIT: The second and third chapters weren't as bad, but the dialogue was still just a bunch of run on sentences.)

Plot wise, you nicely evaded cliches about goblins, and so far have given yourself plenty of trouble, so that's very good.

My only plot related complaint is this: as a reader, I have a very hard time swallowing that Mrs. Figg and Dumbledore bought Harry's story about Diagon Alley. Unless you intend for Dumbledore to be suspicious of Harry because of his story, I think he needs a better lie.
