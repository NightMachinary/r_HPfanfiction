About the clich√©s, I have already thought about the ones you described and I'm planning on not falling for them.

About the story, I didn't have beta work for the two first chapters. Some people gave me advices but there was no complains even if I asked for it. That's pretty much why I posted here, to have people I don't know tell me what is wrong without restraint. I'll go over the first chapters and try to cut some sentences, I always made too long sentences and I don't think about it enough.

Writing this fic in English is a challenge for me because I'm French and I've never lived in an English-speaking country or practised a lot outside of school. Therefore there must have some grammar mistakes I don't catch. If you want to, don't hesitate to tell me what sentences shocked you so I'll be able to change them.

Thanks for your comment anyway. :)

Edit: I've reread and fixed some things in the Prelude and first chapter, those changes are only on the website and not on fanfiction.net
