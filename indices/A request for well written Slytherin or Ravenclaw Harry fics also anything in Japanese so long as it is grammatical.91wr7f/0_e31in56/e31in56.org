Okay, first things first: *you need to learn to paraphrase here*.

Second, not many fics are going to meet all or even a majority of these criterion; you need to shorten your search. That being said...

Best of Ravenclaw!Harry

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): magical prodigy in the making
- linkffn(The Unfound Door): starts in 5th year, AU
- linkffn(The Mind Arts): Harry is sort of like an emotional vampire and a magical prodigy again

Best of Slytherin!Harry

- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): the most canon-like Harry sorted into Slytherin I have ever found
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): one of the better currently updating fics out there, a massive subversion of HP fanon and world-building
- linkffn(Hail Odysseus): Harry shows up in 7th year gets sorted into Slytherin. Has probably one of the most Slytherin endings
- linkffn(Victoria Potter): currently updating fem!Harry fic with innocuous Slytherin House
- linkffn(Becoming Alpha): Slytherin!Harry is a total rehash, but it is H/G as I recall so that's there if you want it.

In the future, ask for less, or people will just throw random things out for you or not bother.
