We're In This Together by Zugrian, Harry/Pansy Parkinson and her dad is a Death Eater.

I believe there's some Harry/FloraAndOrHestia Carrow stories that treat Flora and Hestia as Amycus & Alecto's daughters (others stipulate that Amycus and Alecto are their Aunt & Uncle).

There's a WIP (hopefully) I'm keeping my eye on where it's potentially Harry/Voldemort's daughter(s), but at last update (back in October) it was still early 1st year. That one's linkffn(Riddle of the Ages by Leyrann).
