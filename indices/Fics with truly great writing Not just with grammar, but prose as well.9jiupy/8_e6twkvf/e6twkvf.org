If you're looking for a short read, (30k, a day's read), I HIGHLY recommend "a life of smoke and silvered glass" by dirgewithoutmusic. I came across it in a previous hpff thread earlier today and read it in one go. The prose and use of repition and imagery stuck out to me as unique and interesting sounding.
