So, this question [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9gx6cj/whats_the_best_writing_youve_ever_seen_in_a_harry/][comes up fairly often in this subreddit]], and I've always wanted to respond to it with excerpts. And, screw it, I'm bored, so here are my recommendations (I may add to this post later when/if I have more time):

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4316181/1/Thrice][Thrice by lyin]]

  Lily looked over her shoulder, to the flowers on the other side of the door, and noticed that the ones that looked like daisies were matted down and not springing back up. There was only an almost solid haze, though she could see through it, as if heat were pouring off some fire and weighing on the air.

  An invisible someone was standing on the chamomile.

  She should have been frightened, but she merely turned her wand and jetted water at the heavy-looking air. It framed a cloaked shape for a moment, pooling over stooped shoulders and a bowed head, and then Severus Snape, only slightly wet, pulled off an Invisibility Cloak.

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768058/1/Pot-Kettle-Black][Pot, Kettle, Black by the Divine Comedian]] (IMO, everything she writes meets the criteria you're looking for)

  Remus says, "Is the Veritaserum still working?'

  "Yes." The answer is out before Sirius has had a chance to think about it. "Thought it'd be over by now."

  "Alcohol prolongs its effects, genius," says Remus. "Thought someone with an 'Outstanding' Potions N.E.W.T. might know."

  "Wasn't thinking."

  "You're generally not," says Remus. He sighs.

  Well, Sirius has certainly expected more sympathy and less disappointment.

  In fact, the whole conversation doesn't go like he's imagined, pretty much like the wretched interview, but how could it, when he doesn't even know what he's going to say until he says it, with Veritaserum seeping around in his brain, creating voids that suck up words and explode them out of his mouth. No, not creating voids. Creating truths that somehow come into existence because he says them out loud.

  Until today, he hasn't even known what a panic attack is. He's just sort of assumed that it is normal to curl up and hyperventilate on the Hogwarts Express when it's chugging towards London, given what's waiting for him there.

  Maybe he is more like Remus after all, destined to try twice as hard as everyone else and still never catch a break. Or maybe he's like Peter, destined to be pathetic.

  He doesn't realise he's expressing all this out loud until he sees the look on Remus's face. "We can just stop talking until it wears off," offers Remus.

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad by mirrormarie]] (the scene below is when Snape attempts Legilimency on Frank Longbottom in an attempt to heal him)

  Ragged fragments. Cuts, savage and raw, gouged into thoughts and memories. The mind writhed at his presence, and he held himself still, calm, unmoving. He observed.

  Swathes of gray. Webs of thought torn apart like cobwebs, their gossamer strands tangled and frayed, their perfect architecture no longer discernible in the soft, weak tatters that remained. Emotions clung to those tatters, billowing and brief. With the slightest pressure, Severus could have destroyed everything in his path.

  And yet, somewhere in that maze of of webs, Severus could feel Frank Longbottom, swaying like a spider from the ruined threads of his mind.

  Spiders were resilient. They were used in potions as an element of balance, the balance of a perfect web, of blood and air, of life and death. They created to destroy, and destroyed to create. In an elegant universe, their elegance was supreme.

  Severus, though far from considering Longbottom elegant -- he was, after all, the father of /Neville/ Longbottom -- nevertheless acknowledged that there might be more strength to the broken man than the ruin of his mind suggested.
