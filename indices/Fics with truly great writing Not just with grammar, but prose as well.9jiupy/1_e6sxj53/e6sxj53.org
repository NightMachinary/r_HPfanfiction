linkffn(the shadow of angmar) is very good imo. It takes a lot of cues from the Silmarilion and it shows. Steelbadger does a excellent job of making Harry fit into Tolkien's world

  The Halls were silent. A distant shaft of light split the darkness and the only sound to be heard was laboured breathing, and a distant rhythmic thunder. His own breathing, Harry realised through the haze of exhaustion and pain. Each beat of his heart heralded a new roll of thunder. Fire, invisible in the darkness, ran across his entire body, and he felt his skin blister at the touch. The light wavered as if it were unsure, besieged by darkness. Harry took a slow, painful step towards it. Then he stepped again, and again. Each step was as slow as the motion of continents, an entire age of the world streaming by. His own personal world was filled with the smell of brimstone, and the thundering in his ears.
