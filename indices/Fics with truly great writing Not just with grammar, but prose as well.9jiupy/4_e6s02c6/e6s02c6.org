This isn't an easy request because we don't know what kind of writing you like. What one person sees as beautiful weaving of words is dismissed as purple prose by others. Or rejected if they don't like the general idea (eg I wouldn't touch a Draco story with a ten foot pole).

Just take "Dignity in fear" as an example. In my opinion, it is by far the best depiction of emotions I've ever read, bar none. Yet other people can't get past the lesbian pairing, or the fact that in one scene the author inserted her views on body hair (which isn't great, but I can stomach one bad sentence in 40k words).

So could you please give us an example what you want to read?
