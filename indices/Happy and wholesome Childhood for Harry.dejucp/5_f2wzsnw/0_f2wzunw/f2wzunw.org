  Harry had lived in a lot of different places when he was growing up, but the home he shared with his guardian, Albus Dumbledore, was by far the strangest and most wonderful. He spent most of his time playing in the woods, making friends with snakes that slithered between the trees. They seemed to understand him, which was good, because no people ever visited the house.
