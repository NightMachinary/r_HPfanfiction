Unless you mind LESS or Albus+Tom moral reversion (not Slytherin apologism, but rather a "mirror" AU), the lighthearted kid!Harry raised by alive parents I liked the most was linkffn(The Apothecary Knows Best). Harry is roughly 6 years old thorough the entire fic, so if you want his entire upbringing, this is not for you.

There's also linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes), a gen fic where SS acts as adoptive father to a kid Harry, following his upbringing from (IIRC) 2 years of age to roughly 13.
