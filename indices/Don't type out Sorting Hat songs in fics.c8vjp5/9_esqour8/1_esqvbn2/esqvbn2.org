This is generally true. To get a good sorting song generally requires more than a few hours and somebody to go over it and tell you if it sucks or not.

As most fic writers don't put that much effort into the whole chapter, let alone the song itself (the excellent writers active on this Reddit and elsewhere notwithstanding) when one shows up in a fic it's almost universally terrible.
