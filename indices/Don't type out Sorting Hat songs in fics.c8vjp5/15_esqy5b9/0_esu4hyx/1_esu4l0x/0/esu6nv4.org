It's so good! She does a fantastic job with Snape and she cleverly shows how he plays both sides in the war. My only complaint is that Flo switches from using “Remus” to “Lupin” in both narration and in dialogue pretty often. However, she overcomes that problem in her later fics and I feel like a proud mama who watched her baby grow into a better writer!

I would legitimately buy her book were she to become a published author.
