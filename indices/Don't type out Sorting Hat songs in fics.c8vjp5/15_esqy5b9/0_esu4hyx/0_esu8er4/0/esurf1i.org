Well you hid is well and and it fit the environment!

Was I too mean about my “Remus/Lupin” critique? I never know what to say to you writers other than to gush over how amazing a story is (I'm star-struck right now, tbh). It /does/ come from a place of love and admiration.

And please don't ever take down “The Aurors.” Those haters can fight me.
