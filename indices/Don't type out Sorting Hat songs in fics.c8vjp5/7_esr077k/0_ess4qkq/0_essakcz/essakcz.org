It was only in Sorcerer's Stone (I believe) of a poem being engraved on the front doors of Gringotts bank in Diagon Alley.

/Enter stranger, but take heed/\\
/Of what awaits the sin of greed,/\\
/For those who must take, but do not earn/\\
/Must pay most dearly in their turn/\\
/So if you seek beneath our floors/\\
/A treasure that was never yours,/\\
/Thief, you have been warned, beware/\\
/Of finding more than treasure there./
