So for every single fanfic, you want people to introduce every character as if it's the first time, Explain the plot everyone already knows about, and explain all backstories even if they're doing a canon-compliant fic? Yikes. JK doesn't even do that in her own books from what I remember.

Though just curious, how do you feel about authors saying for Harry's first year, for instance, ‘the hat began to sing, detailing the strengths and weaknesses of each house in a warbling song' with Harry's thoughts, something we barely got in the book, instead? And for other years something like ‘they listened to the sorting hat's song (insert details here)' or ‘the sorting hat's song was unusually macabre (insert details here)' or something like that, alluding to that there was a song but not going as far as to write the whole thing out?
