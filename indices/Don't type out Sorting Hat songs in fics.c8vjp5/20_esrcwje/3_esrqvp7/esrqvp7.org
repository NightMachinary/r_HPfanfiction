I'm ambivalent either way. If a fic's well written, then I don't mind if they shove the sorting song in there. Quite often if an author includes the first or last line of the song I find that to be better than including or omitting it entirely. I'll always skip the sorting song, but I find it to be a far more criminal offence when authors either copy and paste dialogue/scenes from those first years, or stick exactly to the canon plots despite alterations made to characters which should then have an impact on their actions and the subsequent consequences.

Anyway, I just wanted to comment here because I disagreed with what your other commenter said - after all, we're each entitled to our own opinions, are we not?

Also I love your Dumbledore gives memories to Harry fic, but that's irrelevant to this convo ðŸ˜‚
