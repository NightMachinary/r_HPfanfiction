But even in the books, the sorting hat's songs only appear in three books. You can understand why the song is mentioned in the first book as everything's new to Harry so he is listening excitedly to it. Then in the fifth book it is an appeal to unity between the houses and foreshadowing of DA. But then yeah, the song had no point in book 4.
