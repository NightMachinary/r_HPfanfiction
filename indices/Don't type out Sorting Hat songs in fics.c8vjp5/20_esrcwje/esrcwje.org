Even though everyone - including me - skips it, I prefer it when fics include it. For me, the goal of fanfiction is to be of equivalent quality to published works - that is, the perfect fanfic is one that could seamlessly take the place of the original books and no one would notice.

This requires that each story does its own groundwork in establishing the characters, world etc. without using readers' knowledge of the original as a crutch to prop up technically deficient writing. So - sorting song in, because to exclude it would be to tell an incomplete story. Unless you are removing the song from the world entirely, of course.
