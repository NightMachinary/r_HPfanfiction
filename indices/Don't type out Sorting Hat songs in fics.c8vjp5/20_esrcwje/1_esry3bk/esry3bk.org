While it's nice when the quality of a fanfic is equivalent to a published work, and one could say that a fanfic generally should have such quality, that doesn't mean it needs to repeat all the same details from canon. Fanfics are by definition based on some canon text, which is generally assumed to be known to the readers. Therefore, anything that is unchanged and that is not important to the story can stay unmentioned without diminishing the quality of the work. The reader already knows the canon work and generally assumes that everything which isn't mentioned as different is the same as in canon. It is generally not expected that a fanfic can stand on its own without the canon, just like a sequel isn't expected to stand on its own.
