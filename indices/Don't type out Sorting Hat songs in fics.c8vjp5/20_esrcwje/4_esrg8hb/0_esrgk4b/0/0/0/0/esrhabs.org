Translation: "I am going to ignore your reasons and just repeat my bare denial."

The point is that a person could and would read it, if they had not read canon or any other fanfic. Writing out the sorting song makes the story you are telling complete, such that your story stands on its own two feet as an independent work.

Every fanfic which excludes the sorting song has an implied footnote in that section: "to see the sorting song, please refer to a work other than the one you are reading". That's not good writing.
