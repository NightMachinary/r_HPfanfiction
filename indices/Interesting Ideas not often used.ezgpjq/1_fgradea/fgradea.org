All magic has a price, and the price for Horcruxes is that you literally cannot take the “grain of sand in the ocean” route. A Horcrux has to be an item of some significance to you, and must be in a place with significance to you, and Fate/Magic will ensure that both those conditions are met without the creator of the Horcrux even realizing that they SHOULD toss their Horcrux in the middle of the Atlantic.
