Entrepreneurship and money making projects. Not just inherit millions of galleons and dozens of titles, but actually earn them by inventing and selling stuff. And I mean not prank items (because seriously, the market for prank items in a tiny population like wizarding Britain can barely be large enough for a single shop) but mass producable items that everyone wants.
