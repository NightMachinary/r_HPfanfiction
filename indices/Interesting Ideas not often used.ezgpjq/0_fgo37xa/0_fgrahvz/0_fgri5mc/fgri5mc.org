It's definitely a "when". At this point, unless there are some skilled technomancers at Mahoutokoro using web daemons to clean up evidence, wizards doing dumb sh*t in front of Muggles would be all over YouTube if Potterverse-style wizards were real. That's actually one of the best reasons not to time-shift events in a fic forward, since even 5-10 years later there'd have been way too many cameras for there to NOT be footage of Death Eater attacks during the second war.
