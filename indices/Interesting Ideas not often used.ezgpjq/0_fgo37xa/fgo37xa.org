What I'd refer to according to the first instance I saw of it: Lily Potter Clinics

Basically, somebody realizes that the Statute of Secrecy probably won't last forever, so they start finding ways to use magic to help Muggles without revealing it to Muggle society. Thus, when wizards are eventually discovered they've already got a history of secretly helping out to point to rather than the history they'd have in canon of Muggle-baiting and Death Eater attacks.

I think I've seen it twice, maybe three times overall, but the first was in the form of the Lily Potter Clinics which used magic to treat children that were beyond the help of Muggle medicine, explaining it as "experimental therapies" or "traditional herbal remedies" and modifying (with consent) the memories of the families that they helped.
