Marietta and Umbridge are the only times I truly applaud Hermione's viciousness.

2 points: Kingsley didn't modify her memory so that she forgot the DA as a whole. He modified it so that she would deny if they met regularly for 6 months. And Umbridge tried to give Harry veritaserum, but...

From what I remember, /Marietta/ went to Umbridge because she, and her mother, sided with the ministry and the only reason she was there was because Cho forced her to. I don't really have a sympathetic view of her and I can muster up sympathy for Draco, Fudge, Scrimgeour, and Pansy.
