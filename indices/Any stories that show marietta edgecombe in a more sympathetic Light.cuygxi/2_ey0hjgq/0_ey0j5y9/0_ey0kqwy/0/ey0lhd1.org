I fixed my post, forgot a phrase. It doesn't really change much, but I don't want to be one of those people who tries to retroactively make my stance better.

The children definitely know who cursed it. It's kinda odd she never went to Umbridge about that. Easily grounds for an expulsion after Dumbledore left.

Snape is an asshole, but it was self-defense against a cruciatus curse. You know, the thing that drove the Longbottoms insane!

It's not the measure that bothers me, it's that it's meant to be a preventative measure in the books, but it's never really said so.

... This must be how the ACLU feels defending Neo-Nazis.
