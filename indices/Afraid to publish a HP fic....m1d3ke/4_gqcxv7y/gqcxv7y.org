I'd go into posting expecting to get negativity (if you get a response at all--the field is full of fics, and it can be difficult to get noticed). Compared to my other fandoms, HP has more trolls, haters (of the 'go kill yourself for this typo' type), and readers married to their own particular readings who may be vocal and rude if you don't conform to their interpretations.

Of course, there are lots of lovely readers, but overly harsh comments always seem to stick in our minds more than the polite ones.

In my experience, ao3 readers are more polite in their reactions, even if they don't like a story.
