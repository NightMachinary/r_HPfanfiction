I love a background fic! Wrote one for professor Sprout a while ago here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29425611]]

I've only had the one comment but it was positive and quite a few kudos. The beauty of pre-canon is that you can easily work things out the way you want and people generally don't get upset with that kind of content because as you say it's mostly head-canon for a disliked character.

If you're worried I'd just disable comments , then allow them again later if you're feeling more positive.
