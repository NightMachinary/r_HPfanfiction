I went through something similar, so when the response I received has been almost unanimously positive, I was pleasantly surprised.

I thought that a lot of the critiism of the story would overlap with criticism of myself, but that hasn't happened yet. The only people who give me grief are shippers, which completely blindsided me. They come in demanding that I tell them romantic pairings in advance, which I now ignore.
