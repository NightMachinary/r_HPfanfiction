If anyone knows a good discord server to join, I'd be open to that. Good suggestion!

And I completely agree. I would never write something rude or just flat out mean like I've seen others do. I do the same as you; if I don't like something, I just stop reading. It would take way too much time out of my life to write hateful comments. And I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of such responses and would never want to do that to someone else. I know how much work and dedication it takes to write fanfic, so for someone to hurt an author like that is so disheartening to see. Hence my own nervousness.
