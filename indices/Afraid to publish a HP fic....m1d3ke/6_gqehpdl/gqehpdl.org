If you're anxious about posting to ao3, you might try finding a group (Discord, FB, twitter, etc) for HP fic writers and share with them first? Having a smaller audience to try fic out on might help, and having support in case you get jerks might help.

Although, I have never understood people who leave mean comments/reviews. Don't get me wrong, I've thought "this is crap" and slammed the back button. But why would I complain or try to make someone feel bad for something they made because of their passion for a fandom? So I know it's easier said than done, but just remember that nobody has any right to be a jerk to you for something that is a labor of love.
