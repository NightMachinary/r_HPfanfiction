I, too, am a sweet little cinnamon roll, so I just have all comments disabled on ao3. I don't think anything I'm writing is particularly provocative but simply don't want to deal with any negative responses that I might get because who really knows with the Internet. That way, the people who like the idea can still enjoy it, but none of the trolls can reach you even if they want to. You won't get any positive comments either, but if you're so nervous of the responses that you don't even want to write it, then I think it's worth it.

If you disable comments but still want feedback from someone in the fandom, then I'd be happy to give you responses if you send the link to me privately! I'm not into internet toxicity, so you can trust that I will protect your cinnamon roll-ness.
