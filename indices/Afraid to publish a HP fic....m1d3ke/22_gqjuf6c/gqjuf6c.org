Hello 👋

I write lots and lots of Harry Potter fic. Why don't you join a fest and write that way? Then you are surrounded by others, all in a supportive community. I would say, join a discord too, and just have fun with it. Remember, your characters won't live, and do complete head canons that you hold so dear if you don't write them.

Have fun. It is the biggest of pleasures and changed my life for the better. There is nothing better that looking at your completed fics and knowing that you have added positively to the community 💜❤

Good luck!
