Agreed, hands down. My only problem is that I can't even write for myself, because I keep second guessing myself. I've got a Harry and Dudley Buddy Cop idea, but the only scene I even have half a plan for is one where Dudley shoots either a vampire or a werewolf, and the two argue, Harry over how silver/blessed bullets are illegal in the magical world, while Dudley argues back that guns are rather illegal in Muggle Britain, if they're arguing semantics.

I've also got a Star Wars/Sailor Moon crossover idea (which is mostly an excuse to try my hand at what would effectively be somewhat original Sci-Fi as a young group of Force Sensitive girls from Alderaan go on a galactic road trip, with their final destination ending up becoming the Solar System as seen in Sailor Moon's ancient lore)

I've got ten fanfic ideas and two original fiction ideas that are bouncing about in my head, but while I understand the tropes and can point them out if asked, I can't for the life of me figure out how to WRITE using those tropes. And that is why I always, ALWAYS encourage those who have a story to write to do so, because no one should end up driving themselves up a wall like I do.
