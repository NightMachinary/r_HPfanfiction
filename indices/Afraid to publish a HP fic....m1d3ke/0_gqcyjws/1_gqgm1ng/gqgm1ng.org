I absolutely agree with this! Please don't fall into the black hole of writing for other people! I've read some awesome fics that eventually just seem to turn into pandering for reviews and giving the reader too much power over something that should absolutely be yours. It's hard to be confident, but eventually all that's left to do is try, and I always want people to try. Otherwise how would we ever get new fanfiction that isn't a total rehashing of the same fics we've already read a hundred times, right?

And for what it's worth, I usually appreciate an original idea more than a popular idea, and I think a lot of people here would agree.

Make sure you've got a good beta to proof read, upload it in ffn and ao3 so it's easier to reach more readers, don't apologize to people who give negative feedback, and I think you'll be golden!
