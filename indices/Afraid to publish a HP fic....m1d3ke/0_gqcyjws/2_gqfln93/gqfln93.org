Exactly what I thought, I've rarely seen any negative comments on fanfics except if the chapter/story is really heavy/controversial.

I remember not long ago a chapter of a story that was really violent, basically involved savage infanticide and the writer kinda got gaslighted for it + the lack of trigger warnings. But except for that I've never came across negative comments.

Most readers are always respectful about the writer's work which is one of the best things about fanfics.
