In my experience, its more likely that if people aren't into the idea they just won't read it or comment.

But don't fall into that trap of writing for other people-- you can never please everybody. Write for yourself, to create the content that YOU want to read, see the ideas that YOU like come into action.

And then please do share it because there's bound to be others who enjoy it whether they tell you so or not.
