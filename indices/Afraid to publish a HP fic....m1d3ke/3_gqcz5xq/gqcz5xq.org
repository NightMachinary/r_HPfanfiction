I've gotten some negative reviews on ffn (including one calling me a whiny bitch). Now I moderate reviews.

However I've gotten nothing but kind feedback on AO3, and you can disable comments there if you wind up having a problem.

And, you can always write the story first if it's something you enjoy and decide later if you want to post.

Good luck!
