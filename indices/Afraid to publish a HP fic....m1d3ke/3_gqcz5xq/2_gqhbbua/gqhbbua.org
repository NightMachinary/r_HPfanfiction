My experience is that AO3 is more toxic, unless you're writing slash. Which I don't so I stick to FFN where I don't get told to kms or delete all my stories just because I didn't want Draco to fuck Harry and get him pregnant. And before I'm downvoted for that, that's an actual review from three different people.
