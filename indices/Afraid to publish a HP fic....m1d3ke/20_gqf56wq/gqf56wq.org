Personally i find if I dont like a premise for a fanfiction I don't read. Unless it some how comes up in something else like say jumpchain. But even so I dont leave negative hateful comments. Constructive comments I regards to writing form or flow sure but I dont rip on the work or the overall story thats just rude.
