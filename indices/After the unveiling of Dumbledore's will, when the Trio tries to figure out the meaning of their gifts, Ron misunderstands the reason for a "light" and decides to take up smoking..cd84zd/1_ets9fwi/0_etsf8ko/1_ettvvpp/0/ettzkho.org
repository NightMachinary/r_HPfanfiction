Well a good example would be Hagrid in the movies. He speaks with a West Country accent. That being anywhere from Wiltshire to Cornwall, though Cornish is a bit of a peculiarity. The West Country accent is often, and wrongly, associated with poor, dumb farmers, often like how Goofy's accent is associated with rednecks.

The thing about secluded places like say the Appalachians or the West Country is that they don't progress the way more densely populated areas do. Something interesting is that the US southern accent is actually closer to Old English accents from four/five centuries ago. Same with the West Country accent. It's a much older dialect than the received pronunciation (RP) so often associated with England these days. Funnily enough, James and Dumbledore are from Godric's Hollow, which is in the West Country.

Harry and, while never explicitly stated but often assumed, Hermione both grew up in London, so they'd obviously have RP accents. So not very different than the accents Daniel and Emma used in their roles. Dean is also from London, so he might have a bit of a [[https://youtu.be/ZN239G6aJZo?t=34][Cockney accent]].

McGonagall is Scottish, though I don't think she'd be Glaswegian. Something more posh, like an Edinburgh accent, which is what Dame Maggie Smith used in the movies.

Seamus is from Kerry, but speaks with a Dublin accent in the movies. [[https://youtu.be/pit0OkNp7s8?t=22][And Kerry is one of the most interesting accents in the world, but it's hard finding people speaking it who have the majority of their teeth.]]

Snape, Lily, and Petunia came from the Midlands, and a poor area at that, so I'd say they had something akin to a Brummie accent, like Ozzy Osbourne.
