I know you said obviously... but isn't this just a bit too obvious? Obviously - *obviously* -prompts are optional, lmao.

Also, triggered by the thought of smoking? Can't say I've ever heard of that one. In fact, I'm not sure a person like that can exist, since they'd be largely incapable of going outside.

That being said, I do like the prompt!

I think there should be another one, but for Dumbledore, puffing mad clouds. I've always like the idea of the wizened wizard, smoking a long tobacco pipe, Gandalf-style. It's stereotypical, but it's my favorite stereotype :D
