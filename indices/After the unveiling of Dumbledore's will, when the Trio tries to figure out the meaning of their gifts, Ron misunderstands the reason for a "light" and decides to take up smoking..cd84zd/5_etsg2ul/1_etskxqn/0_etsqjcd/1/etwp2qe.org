I live in London and, as a non-smoker myself, I haven't consciously noticed a cigarette in a long time. Maybe I saw someone smoking outside a pub last week while walking towards the train station? I think I vaguely remember something like that, though the beers stand out more to me.

In any case, all stores sell cigarettes behind the counter behind opaque panels and I don't remember the last time I saw an advertisement for smoking. According to [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/][ONS]], about 14.4% of people in England smoke, and since 2007 you cannot smoke indoors.

I do agree with you that a trigger warning for writing a smoking prompt is ... maybe a bit much, but I can see how reading about smoking in a story might "trigger" cravings in someone that is trying to quit.
