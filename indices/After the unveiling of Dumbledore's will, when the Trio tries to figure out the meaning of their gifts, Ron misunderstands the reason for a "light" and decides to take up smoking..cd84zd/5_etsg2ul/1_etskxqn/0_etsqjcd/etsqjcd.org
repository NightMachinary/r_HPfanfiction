  is smoking really common where you live

The better question is, please tell me what mythical place you live where you won't see cigarettes for sale or people smoking?

Literally every corner shop, major grocery store, convenience store, etc. sell cigarettes.

The chances of going out to any moderately populated area and not seeing any cigarettes for sale or even a single person smoking somewhere are pretty small.

So question, where do *you* live?
