The only one I've got is an NBC's Hannibal/Harry Potter crossover in which Will Graham is quite literally Harry, having changed his name and moved to the US to get away from everything. Hannigram heavy so it has a morally grey to darkish Will (Harry) and while the premise may sound strange it's spectacularly written and well worth a read if you're into both fandoms. Snape has long since died exactly as he did in canon, but Will does NOT have a single shred of fondness or forgiveness for him and makes it expressly clear when he's mentioned that he feels Snape got exactly what he deserved.

It's called "What Do I Know Of Life After Death?" by QueenofLit on AO3. I'd link but I'm on mobile and also new to the subreddit so I don't know the rules or etiquette for linking here yet anyway.
