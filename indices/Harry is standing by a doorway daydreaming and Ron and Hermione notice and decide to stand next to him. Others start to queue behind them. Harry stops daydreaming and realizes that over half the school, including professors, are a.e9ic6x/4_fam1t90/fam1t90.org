Harry stared into the Defense room just before supper thinking over the term so far. Hermione had asked him to lead a defense course and he had tentatively agreed.

He thought of all four defense instructors they had previously and how much the room had changed over the years.

Never even really paying attention to Hermione prattling on about how meeting in the defense room could go badly he just kept thinking.

If he were to have his own defense room it would be much more active. Maybe even seven rooms, one for each year. Yeah the castle had plenty of room. He could easily have a different room for each room. Make them have to work, some challenges. If he could save the stone as a firstie something lighter should be an easy weekly course for the firsties.

Second year have them solve clues to find the damn room. Yeah move the room every week! Graduation time would involve them fending off some conjured snakes!

Third year he would have them form teams of hunters and hiders. Yeah, the hunters would have to capture the hiders. Make for some good team tactics that would. Graduation would be him hunting each class.

Fourth year a series of more difficult trials. Any who fail have to start over again from the start and catch up!

Hmmmm... fifth year.... oh that's brilliant. Owl year would be hunters again only worse. Yes, each class would have to disrupt the others classwork. That would be great!

Talking to himself he out loud finally he pondered sixth year.

"Maybe drop them off in groups into the Acromantula zone and make them survive for a day? After that see about getting a few dementors to chase them. Seems a bit harsh but I did both before end of third year."

Hermione noticed he had spoken finally and took the chance.

"Harry are you ready to start your practical defense class finally? I think everyone who's coming is in line already."

Startled Harry looked back and saw that dozens of students had from a line down the hall waiting to go in the class.

"What the bleeding hell?"

"Harry, language!"
