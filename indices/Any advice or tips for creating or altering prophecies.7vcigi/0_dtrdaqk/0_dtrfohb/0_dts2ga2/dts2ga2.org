Not quite; Prophecies in canon transcribe a possible course of events, such that if /one/ happens, the others will too, and the first event is directly caused by reacting to the prophecy. When it was first Spoken, the main Prophecy could indeed not have happened --- but as soon as Voldemort decided to act upon it and Harry had been Marked, it was guaranteed that the rest would come to pass, like a stable time loop.
