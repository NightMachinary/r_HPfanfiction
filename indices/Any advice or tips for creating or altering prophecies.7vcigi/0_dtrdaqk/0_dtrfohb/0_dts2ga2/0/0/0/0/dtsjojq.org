It's not that he's physically /prevented/ --- the Prophecy is more of a prediction, like... well, like stable-time-loop time-travel as seen in /Prisoner of Azkaban/. It's not that the Prophecy being spoken /makes it so/ that Harry can't walk away, it's that the Prophecy was retroactively made /because/ Harry wouldn't have walked away in the future.

That being said, the Prophecy's /words/ must be realized, but it can mean many different things. Just off the top of my head, the Prophecy says that "Either Must Die at the End of the Other". What if a mage went around calling themselves The Other, fighting alongside Dumbledore in the war? They could then kill Voldemort (because the terms of the Prophecy would allow them to kill "either" Voldemort or Harry) and Harry wouldn't have had to do anything.
