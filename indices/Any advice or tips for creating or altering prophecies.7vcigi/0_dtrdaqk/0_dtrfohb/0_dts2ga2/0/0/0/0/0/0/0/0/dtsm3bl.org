No. In Prophecies' case, that's where the "track" idea comes in, you see. Prophecy can accurately predict the bare bones of a basic sequence of events once /one/ thing happens, and that first thing is a matter of choice. Again, if Voldemort hadn't gone after Harry, or if Snape hadn't repeated the Prophecy to Voldemort, it would have been null and void.

As for the Time-Turners, they're not /always/ stable. It's actually a little more complicated than that. Essentially, the universe/Fate/God doesn't /want/ a paradox to happen, so when you travel back in time, as long as you try not to contradict the past /as you know it/, magic will recoagulate the new timeline into one that was consistent with the old one, giving the illusion of the stable time loops. However, if you willfully make changes, it /is/ possible that you'll actually change the future... but in erratic, dangerous ways that have threatened to destroy the universe, or, as faras less extreme but still very unpleasant side-effects go, accidentally resulted in Voldemort being termporarily brought back to life (as seen in /Cursed Child/).
