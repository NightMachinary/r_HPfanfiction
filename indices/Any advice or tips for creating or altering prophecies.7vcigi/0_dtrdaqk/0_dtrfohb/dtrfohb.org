I thought they were option 2 in canon. Because yes the prophecy DID predict that Voldemort would mark Harry as a Horcrux and stuff, but it wasn't a certainty about dying at the hands of the other, in that Harry could have just walked away at any time and been done with it, and nulled the rest of the prophecy. :)
