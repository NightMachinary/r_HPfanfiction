1 - Scansion and meter : prophecies are not just a prediction of the future, they are a transcription of the seer's knowledge in an understandable way, and HP magic tends to be strongly symbolic.\\
2 - Origin of knowledge : the prophecy is not utered before the chain of events leading to the one described by the prophecy has started (in canon, the second is uttered when all factors are here : protagonists, full moon,... ; the first is for the birth of a second generation under the war, after Harry conception, when Voldemort is on the verge of victory and will start hunting people instead of leading a war, where he will be confronted with magic he cannot understand)\\
3 - A prophecy is not a complete description of the future : it's the warning of a coming fulcrum, a point where all the current threads of destiny and decision comes to be intertwined
