If you are looking for a serious one that does not really suck, I don't know if there are any. The only one that I have read and liked is this:

linkffn(Too Many Dates by fantasy1290)

It is light-hearted and humorous, and that is exactly why it works. The way the harem is formed is kind of novel as well. Minus: the ending is very abrupt. Nonetheless, there are some good laughs to be had.
