The only harem story I would recommend would be Effects and Side Effects. It's readable, pretty fun, and pretty long (although probably abandoned at this point)... That's about it.

Fair warning, Harry gets turned into a girl. It's done fairly well for the genre: Harry doesn't start insisting on being referred to as her/she/Harriet and he struggles with the change.

Harry's incredibly OP, it has some bashing (Ron/Molly/Dumbledore), but otherwise it's pretty fun.

It's pretty good... for a harem story.
