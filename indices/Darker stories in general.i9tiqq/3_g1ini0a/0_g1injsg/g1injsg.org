  In the Darkest of all possible futures a twist of fate meant to save him led Cedric Diggory to choose an entirely different path.Or: The story of how Cedric Diggory became a Death Eater. This fic was born of my catching a throwaway line in the Cursed Child about Cedric Diggory becoming a Death Eater. We see a lot about political radicalisation these days and I wanted to have a good delve into why someone (especially someone like Cedric) could end up wanting to join an organisation like that
