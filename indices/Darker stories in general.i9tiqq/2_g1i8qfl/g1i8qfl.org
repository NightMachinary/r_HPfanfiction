Linkffn(Brutal Harry) has a realistic Harry and does well in dealing with how a person, especially a kid, doesn't just come out of a home like the Dursley's okay. Pretty dark also, but hopeful.

Linkffn(Growing and Standing) touches on dark subjects like bullying and is so well written and touching that I cried, like, the entire fic.

Linkffn(Lady of the Lake) is darker, but it's a famine one that takes place after the series and is an ewe. It's ppe (politics, philosophy, and economics) a bit, and a lot of this author's fics go dark if you like this one.

Linkffn(Devil, Tower, Star) is /super/ dark in a not violent, mostly depicts the realities of war, and features scary magic. It's unfinished, but /so/ good and rather scary at times.

I've got a few others if those fit your tastes! Though if you're hoping for solely bleak only the last probably fits bc I can't stand no emotional payoff in a narrative. Too much cynicism is boring!
