Their Verdict of Vagaries on FFN is slash Tom Riddle/HP, where Harry makes the wrong choice at the transit station of death and becomes misplaced in time, going down a moral slippery slope as a result of his isolation and trauma suffered at the final battle. It's very long and gets progressively darker as it spans the time from 1945 to 1981, basically observing TR's entire rise and fall from power in close range. In that sense it is quite unique.
