If you consider time loops as time travelling, then I recommend "The many deaths of harry potter" linkffn(12388283)

The story is brutal initially but once the story gets rolling is pretty damn good, especially since this Harry isn't overpowered, he's cunning and rational, a bit of a cynic so he thinks of ways that can kill him so this, in turn, influences the way he uses magic in incredibly creative ways, and probably why it's one of my favourites
