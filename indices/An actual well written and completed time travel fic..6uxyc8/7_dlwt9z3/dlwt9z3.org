I had a thought that if adult Harry goes back in time without his magic it would make an interesting time travel au with new obstacles (how to get things done as a squib, how does a squib protect himself from wizards) does anyone know a fic like this?

I was imagining adult squibbed Harry existing in the as of that moment cannon Harry's world along side young Harry, if that's more clear.
