Thirding. IMO far and away the single best piece of FF ever written. It's the only HP thing I've read that I felt truly nailed the characters.

That aside incredible use of Time Travel too. My biggest pet peeve in time travel FF is the notion "oh, lets use our future knowledge to beat voldemort in the space of about a month or so".

The fact that it realistically made Snape into a good guy was also amazing. Snape and Sirius becoming friends is something I never knew I needed until this.

This also has probably my favorite Dumbledore in any FF too. The majority of Dumbledores you see Harry hates for being manipulative, despite the fact canon Harry never showed any signs of resentment over the revelation that he's a horcrux. This Dumbledore acknowledges what he did, asks for forgiveness, and then treats Harry as an equal. IDK why that's a novel concept in FF but Harry and Dumbledore's dynamic in this was fantastic.

/ahem/ I uhhhh might have gone on a bit long there. Anyway, give this a read, it's so so good.
