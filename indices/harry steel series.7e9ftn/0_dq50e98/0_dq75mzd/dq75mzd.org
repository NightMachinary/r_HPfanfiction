So... Maybe I'm an idiot (likely the case) but given that JK Rowling hasn't given permission, and fanfiction of any sort is questionably legal (bla bla nonprofit derivative work) in the first place, I would imagine that fanfiction of a fanfiction is not even questionable for someone who would write fanfiction in the first place.

I mean, sure, it may not be "PC" to just use someone's world, but isn't that what every fanfiction writer is doing?

Sorry if parts of this sound snarky as that's not my intent.
