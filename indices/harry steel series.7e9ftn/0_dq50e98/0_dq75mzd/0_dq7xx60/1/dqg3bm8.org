Ah, my bad. I just took all the disclaimers as a legality thing.

Still, being as it's still HP fanfiction, and legally TheBlackhand724 can't claim ownership/proprietary whatevers, I fail to really see the issue. I mean, I wouldn't do it, but I don't see the issue. (Mainly the reason I wouldn't do it, is because I couldn't do it justice, but I probably wouldn't have an issue using the world/premise from a story that was bad)
