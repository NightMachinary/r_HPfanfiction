My biggest complaint in that fic is how it doesn't address Lily at all. Was this version of Lily always just as petty and shallow as her sister, and just hid it better because she was so popular? Did her son's fame gradually corrupt her? Was she just going along with James due to some sort of magical pureblood marriage slavery BS?
