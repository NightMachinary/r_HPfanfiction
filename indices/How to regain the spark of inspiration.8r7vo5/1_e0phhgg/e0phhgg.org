Edit: Sorry mate, I glanced over your post briefly and didn't realize your actual question. /le facepalm/

Realize this: the spark, the zone, the waves, the mood, the Right Time, etc. etc. don't exist.

Writing is working. I'm not going to tell my boss: "Sorry, I'm not working today, I lost my spark."

Just tell yourself: I'm going to write 100 words, and if they're bland and uninspiring, so what? I'll go back this evening or tomorrow morning and fix it.
