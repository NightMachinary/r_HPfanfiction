There's a book by Stephen King called, "On Writing" and I've found his advice makes it much easier to write stories.

Don't show a soul what you've written until you've finished the first draft. "Write the first draft with your door closed and your second with your door open". Showing off your writing before you've finished your story can make a writer lethargic because they think they're doing "great", so you don't work as hard. On the other hand, it can discourage an author because people criticize the story too harshly. Wait until you've written your first draft, then show it to others. After you've shown it to a few people (such as friends or maybe even a beta or two), make changes that you deem appropriate from the feedback you've got from your first few readers. Remember, it's your story, so you decide what stays, what goes, and what can be added. After making those changes, start posting! You'll get more feedback from a larger and broader audience. Then, you can make little tweaks that you want to make. Boom. Now you have a story. Then you do it all over again.

Read and write every day. You can take one break per week. I personally take Sundays off. Your brain is a muscle and you should be exercising it, even if you're tired. It'll do you good in the end. Think of reading like lifting weights or using machines. It makes your own writing stronger because it gives you a better idea of the do's and don't's of writing. Writing is your cardio. If you write every day, you'll start to be able to write longer and faster. Just like working out, it has to be consistent. Take too many breaks or too long of breaks and you can end up in the state you're in now; lethargy. Lethargy has been the death knell of many of my stories or story ideas.

Writing is hard work, but it certainly pays off. Keep at it and believe in yourself!
