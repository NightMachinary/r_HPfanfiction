Doing anything purely on inspiration sucks and is doomed to fail. If you write when you're inspired, you'll get the high points of the fic, but not anything else. What I try to do is make an outline. So in chapter 1 you have the high points - point A, point B, point C, etc. Then you just try to connect point A to point B however you can. It might be the most dull thing you've ever written, but as long as they are connected, you've done your job as a writer. Making it pretty is the editor's job, and you'll take up that job later.

As for overcoming the feeling that a story isn't worth continuing... that's all on you, mate. I can't sell your own story to you. If you don't think it's worth continuing, don't continue it. Find something that interests you and makes you want to puzzle it out. Take all your favorite stuff and mash it together and figure out how to make it work. If HP fanfiction doesn't excite you anymore, then that's that.
