Hmm, I've never really been good at outlining, maybe should give it another go. If I have a structure to write around, scenes to write toward, that might help me stay focused if not exactly inspired.

The biggest problem is I have so many ideas, it gets hard taking the time to actually finish one instead of skipping gaily on to the next thing that pops into my head. I am far too fickle, and that's not a good thing for a writer. I don't want to be another never-finishing-things person.
