I told you that I make outlines and try to connect the high points, but specifically what I do is just ask myself "Ok, what do they do next? What do they do after that? After that? After that?" Writing is very much a step by step process. Just write the most mundane crap: He did this. She did that. She said this. He responded to that. Don't deviate with flowery descriptions unless you are good at that. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other until you have connected point A to point B. Then repeat that until your story is finished.
