I've been posting as I finish each chapter. I've tried a couple hiatii, and they only made it harder to get the groove back when I returned, and as I'm quite a forgetful person I feel it's dangerous to allow myself too many breaks.

I like your idea of making short asides, just to get back into the world of it. Maybe some side-characters or a villain pov to pique my interest again. Thanks!
