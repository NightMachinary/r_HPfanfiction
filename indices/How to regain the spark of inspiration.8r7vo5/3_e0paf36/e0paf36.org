Have you posted any of it yet? If not, it might be an opportunity to take a step back and assess the current state of the story and what you want to do going forward. It might also be a good idea to maybe write a few smaller stories in the same world you have in mind for your larger one. This would give you a feeling of accomplishment because, hey, you finished a thing! Also, writing a few small stories might give you ideas for your world building. When I started writing HP fan fiction years ago, I limited myself to one-shots on purpose because I had a bad habit of not finishing longer stories and I feel like this helped me create a persistent HP world of my own.

If you have posted part of it, there's no shame in letting it lie fallow for a little while so you can work on some other things. You're also free to take it down--don't feel like you're obligated to keep plugging away at it if you don't like what you're writing. You're not being paid, you're not on a deadline--it's completely up to you.
