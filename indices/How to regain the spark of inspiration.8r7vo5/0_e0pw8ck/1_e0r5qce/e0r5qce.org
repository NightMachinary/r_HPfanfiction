Funnily enough, I find reading to be a motivational factor for me to write. Just a few weeks ago I was reading Stephen King's "The Outsider" and at the same time was on a writing high. Now that I've finished it, I've been lost in a trough of not writing. Of course, everyone's different but reading and writing certainly go hand-in-hand.
