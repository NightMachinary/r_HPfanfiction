I have but probably about fifteen years ago by this point and I don't remember anything specific enough from it. My advice is fairly general and just involves treating writing like any other discipline that requires time and practice. It comes mostly from my own experience and epiphany that such phrases like 'I lost my muse' or 'I'm not inspired' were really just fancy ways of saying 'I'm lazy and don't feel like doing the work right now'.

It holds true for far more than writing. A lot of 'talents' that take time and practice to get good at involves actually doing it. And a lot of people simply don't want to put forth the effort or think it will be easy and that's never the case.
