  But I'm not sure how to inspire myself. I feel like I've lost the spark of it.

  Anyone have tips for getting back in the groove? Secrets to overcoming that feeling that a story isn't worth continuing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

By keeping to a schedule.

Writing is work. It's hard. It doesn't come easily. And one of the absolute worst things to do while writing is reading. Because reading is easy. And distracts from how difficult writing can be. And often you'll just start comparing this to that and whatnot which is entirely unhelpful.

If you want to write. Then write. Focus on writing. Make writing the priority. If you're waiting around for 'inspiration' or 'sparks' you're never going to be an effective writer.

Sure, there will be points where you need a break, like any other job in the world. But you won't truly understand that until you've gotten yourself into the habit of writing.
