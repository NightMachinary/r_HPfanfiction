Here's an example relating to the population.

JK has stated that the population of wizarding britain is 3000ish, this is impossible.

In /The Goblet of Fire/, Arthur Weasley states that a ministry task force of 500 have been working all summer on the stadium for the quidditch world cup. This alone would mean that 1 sixth of the total population of magical britain was working on building that stadium. That's not all however. Let's forget the stated population, what would that task force imply?

So, it's a task force of ministry workers. That means it's a government function. Governments do not have the liberty to dedicate 100% of their resources to any one project. When not at war, they cannot even dedicate fully 20% of their resources to any one project due to the sheer number of other things they have to do. Let's be /extremely/ generous and assume that the ministry task force building the stadium accounted for 10% of the /entire government of magical britain./ That means that the Ministry of Magic is composed of, at minimum, 5000 people. (500 = 10%, 500 Ã— 10 = 5000). So that means that the government /alone/ has 2000 more people than the stated population. But we can go further. According to the *UK Office of National Statistics* 16.5% of the total /working/ population was employed in the public sector, aka working for the government. ([[https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/march2019#:%7E:text=For%20March%202019%2C%20there%20were,percentage%20points%20on%20December%202018.][Source found here]]) We can make a rough comparison between the wizarding and muggle worlds. Not a fully precise comparison as wizards live far longer than muggles, but any innacuracies on that account would mean less people in government not more so we can safely find a minimum. So if we take the ministry as having 5000 people, (remember, a generous estimate based on the government of magical britain dedicating /one tenth/ of their manpower to building a /stadium/), and apply the same statistics as found in the UK, then the minimum /working/ population of Magical Britain (not including children and retirees) is 30300ish (30303.03 repeating) as illustrated by this, JK Rowling's stated population for Magical Britain is frankly impossible.

But wait, there's more.

It would not be an unreasonable assessment to say that I am unfairly basing my analysis on a single excerpt from a much larger series, so I shall rely on a far more established example. The population of Hogwarts. Rowling has gone on record, ([[https://www.therowlinglibrary.com/2016/11/06/how-many-students-are-at-hogwarts/#:%7E:text=It%20was%20in%20Pottermore%20where,its%20own%20house%20and%20gender.][here]]), saying that Hogwarts has around 600 students in it. As found [[https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/demographics/age-groups/latest][here]], roughly 21.3% of the population of england and Wales is under 18. If we take as granted that Hogwarts is the sole magical school of britain, and that enrollment is free aside from the cost of supplies, then we can assume the vast majority of the population goes through the school. But there's another problem. Hogwarts only accounts for people between the ages of eleven and 17-18. I couldn't find any statistics that specific, so we will guesstimate that of the total under-18 population of britain, Hogwarts students account for 40% of them, (Seven years at hogwarts, half of that age range is nine years so 40% is generous), and that leaves us with a total under age population of 1500 (not including homeschooled students or part-humans barred from education). So, we've got an under-18 population of 1500. Under-18 accounts for 21.3% of the population of britain. Doing that math leaves us with a minimum population of 7042.25, more than double what JK stated, and again not including any homeschooled people, or part-humans denied education. /But there's more./ We know that witches and wizards live for longer than muggles with a stated life expectancy of 137 (and three quarters) in the 1990s, ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizardkind#:%7E:text=Wizard%20life%20expectancy%20in%20Britain,times%20as%20long%20as%20their][Source]]), which is nearly double that of muggles at the time, who had a life expectancy of 75.14 years. The number of students at hogwarts remains the same, as does the number of under-18 individuals, but given that wizards live twice as long, then we can safely double the total population that we calculated based on those percentages. So instead of 7042.25 minimum, we get a minimum population of 14,084.5, or 1000 short of five times the stated population. So again, JK's stated population is /impossible/.

*/But wait, there's more!/*

You're probably sick of maths by now, so this has less than the other examples (still quite a bit though). Think about Diagon Alley, Knockturn Alley, and Hogsmeade. Think about their infrastructure. Can a /total population/ of 3000 support that kind of commercial infrastructure? What about the sports teams? We know that there are, at least, 13 professional quidditch teams. ([[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/ministry-of-magic/department-of-games/british-and-irish-quidditch-league/#:%7E:text=The%20thirteen%20most%20successful%20Quidditch,Ministry%20of%20Magic%20(OP7][Source]]). But how would that work? If you divide 3000 by 13 that's less than 250 fans per team, that's not enough to financially support a major league sports team. Hell, 1000 is barely enough. What about the wizengamot? It has roughly fifty members, one sixtieth of the total population. Is it really reasonable that the highest level of government, the equivalent of a legislature and judiciary rolled into one, would account for one out of every sixty people you meet? No, it wouldn't. And so, based on the institutions of Magical Britain, the stated population is impossible.

JK Rowling said herself that she's not good with math, [[https://www.therowlinglibrary.com/2016/11/06/how-many-students-are-at-hogwarts/#:%7E:text=It%20was%20in%20Pottermore%20where,its%20own%20house%20and%20gender.][here.]]

I believe that should be all you need to know on the subject.
