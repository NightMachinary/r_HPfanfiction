The number of wizards working on The Quidditch World Cup means either the vast majority of the population work in sports entertainment, there are hundreds of other schools like Hogwarts that just aren't shown, or the wizarding world underwent an apocalyptic levels of depopulation if Hogwarts students make up the entirety of the underage wizarding population. One of these three must be true to make the numbers work, yet all three seem to be unsupported by canon or common sense.

Not to mention that extrapolating from the population, even if we give JK every single possible ideal scenario the percent of the population working in sports (IE even just counting the number of quidditch teams alone and ignoring the rest) is extraordinarily above muggle proportions.

Edit: just to elaborate on that last point ; They have leagues filled with teams like we do, despite having a pathetically small population proportionally
