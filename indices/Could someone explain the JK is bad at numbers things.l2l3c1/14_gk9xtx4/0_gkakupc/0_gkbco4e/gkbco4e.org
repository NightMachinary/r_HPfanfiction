I think I remember somewhere in the books it's said that hogwarts is the best /in britain,/ which would imply more in the country. but in book 7 when hogwarts is made compulsory, a weasley (maybe bill or arthur) says even though most kids are educated there, the parents have the choice to educate them at home or send them abroad, with no mention of other schools in the country. one sentence doesn't disprove anything, but you'd think if there were other notable schools in britain, that's where they'd be referenced.
