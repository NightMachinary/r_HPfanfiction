The biggest problem I have with that is the age of James' parents. I took the information on Fleamont Potter in the Harry Potter Wiki as a starting point. According to it, Fleamont was born before 1909, but his exact date of birth is never stated. This creates a lot of problems for me, as it could well indicate that he was born either one or several years before the aforementioned 1909. In the event that he was born a year earlier, when Euphemia (his wife) became pregnant with James, he would have been 51 years old (Euphemia became pregnant in 1959, and the following year James was born), so where is the "advanced age" that Rowling was talking about? Another problem with this has to do with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. In the opening scene of the film, in a page of the Daily Prophet you can read a note that talks precisely about Fleamont Potter and his hair potion Sleekeazy and how he had enchanted the American wizards and witches. The date when this happened was 1926. At this point Fleamont would have been in his final year at Hogwarts or he could have graduated earlier. My headcanon on this is that Fleamont was too prodigious to brew potions and had been working on it since he was at Hogwarts (as far-fetched as that sounds). How would you folks fit all this in?
