I don't think /any/ of the books have an accurate calendar for which weekday lines up with which day of the month, for one. Da Wiki dedicated a few paragraphs to it: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dating_conventions#Contradictions]]

There's also the Curious Case of Marcus Flint: In most editions of Philosopher's Stone, he's a sixth year - meaning his entire presence in Book 3 is a plot-hole (did he have to redo a post-O.W.L. year? Did he just show up for Quidditch and the staff didn't care? Neither explanation makes sense in the world). This one was eventually retconned so in newer editions he's a fifth-year.

The size of the magical population, too, is basically unexplained and inconsistent - at one point, J.K. stated that there's about 3000 wizards and witches. Goblet of Fire states that a task force of 500 Ministry employees worked on the Quidditch World Cup stadium - so that's 1/6th of the total population of Magical Britain not only working in government, but presumably /in just the one or two departments relevant to that task/ - the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and /maybe/ the Department of International Magical Cooperation since the stadium would be used for an event of international significance.

In Book 1, it's stated that the Gryffindor team hadn't won since Charlie Weasley graduated... Which according to later books, would have been the year before. Similarly, Ginny wanted to go to Hogwarts "since Bill started" - which doesn't make sense in any timeline.

It's something J.K. Rowling herself admitted in interviews, as well - she's self-admittedly very bad at numbers, and IIRC has actually stated something that boiled down to "please don't over-analyze the numbers in my books, they're probably rubbish" at some point.

For a story with a detailed economy... I'm beginning to sound like a broken record, but [[/u/Taure]] keeps track of the main-character's finances in quite a bit of detail in side-material for Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605).
