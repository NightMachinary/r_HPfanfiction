Especially how it's shown in the movies - with the books there's a bit more leeway since you can assume the ministry is physically smaller, but in the movies it's massive - you could probably assume up to a third of the population could be working there. My solution to the problem is that maybe the ministry rents out office space and other facilities or something.
