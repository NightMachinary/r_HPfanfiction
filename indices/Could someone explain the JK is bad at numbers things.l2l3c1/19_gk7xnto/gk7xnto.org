As for the recommendation: HPMOR (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) by Eliezer Yudkowsky. If you're interested specifically in the economy, exchange rates etc. then in Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis it's all explained but I highly encourage you to read the whole fic, overall the wizarding world presented in it includes more complicated system of politics so it's all really interesting. Also if you prefer to listen then there's an audiobook called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality Podcast by Eneasz Brodski and you can either download it or for example listen to it on Spotify

edit woah that's got rather downvoted, can someone explain to my why? I'm just genuinely curious what's wrong with the recommendation because I think there has to be something I'm not aware of
