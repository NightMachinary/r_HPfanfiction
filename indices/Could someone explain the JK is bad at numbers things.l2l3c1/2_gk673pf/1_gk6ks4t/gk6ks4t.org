And if it's Gold, well that's an exploit if I've ever seen one. The only reasonable explanation would be that the exchange rate was fixed at 1G = 5Â£ many years ago by treaty, and the Ministry is refusing to renegotiate that to screw with the goblins...

And speaking of goblins, given how many rebellions they had, it is surprising that there's even a single one of them left alive. Because rebellion usually meant traitors' justice, where hanging would have been a mild sentence compared to eg the wheel or being quartered. And since so many rebellions happened, it is unreasonable to assume that the goblins were overly successful since they needed to rebel again and again.
