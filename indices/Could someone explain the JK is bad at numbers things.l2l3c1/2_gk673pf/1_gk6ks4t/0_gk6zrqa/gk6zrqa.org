I look at the so called goblin rebellions as simply rough negotiations. In other words the goblins want a change in the treaty, the wizards don't want to renegotiate, the goblins rebell and once again they fight to a bloody draw (I can't see the wizards winning and not wiping the goblins out (for the reasons you stated), likewise for the goblins winning.)

So the only way I can see this working is that neither side is able to truly get the better of the other. So they fight, members on both sides die or get injured, they negotiate a truce with a treaty that gives a few things that the goblins want. And then they go back to an uneasy peace.

I could never understand the story arc that JKR came up with for the goblins. I mean come on why would you give your enemy control of your wealth irregardless of whether he is easily beatable or not.
