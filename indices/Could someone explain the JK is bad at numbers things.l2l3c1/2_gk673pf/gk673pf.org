Actually, the thing I hate most about her "bad at numbers" is the way she changed the exchange rate for Galleons.

At the beginning of the series, a Gallon was said to be worth about 50 pounds. I don't know if she ever outright stated this, or if it was just calculated from the first book. When the owl arrives at the shack with Hagrid's paper, it cost 5 knuts. If you equate that to 50 pence, the going rate for a London daily paper at the time, that makes each knut roughly 10 pence. Multiply by 493 and you get roughly 50 pounds. So far, so good.

But somebody decided that exchange rate was too high. Don't know where that came from, since they're supposed to be made of gold. Maybe they were concerned that people wouldn't be spending galleons: after all, how often does anybody run around with 50 pound (or 50 dollar) bills? They're not the most common currency. So maybe that was the idea behind it; they wanted more galleons used in the stories rather than most of the prices being in sickles and knuts.

In any case, in 2001 --- after four books and a few months before the first movie was released --- she said the exchange rate was variable but around 5 pounds per galleon.

There are two problems with this:

- The first is just my personal thing: in a monetary system where she deliberately used prime numbers---29 knuts to a sickle, 17 sickles to a galleon, for a total of 493 knuts (not a prime number) per galleon---for some reason she wants an exchange rate that is an easily-multiplied number (50 and 5).
- Because she changed the exchange rate halfway through, she changed the Weasleys from "struggling" to "abject poverty." At the beginning of the second book, the Weasley vault has a SINGLE GALLEON and a few other coins. This means that the Weasleys, instead of having just over 50 pounds in their account (we've all been there), had just over 5 pounds in the bank. This for 5 kids at the BEGINNING of their school shopping. That wouldn't buy even one of Lockhart's books.
