There's also the issue that if 1 galleon is ~50 pounds, then a wand costs, what, 350 pounds? Not exactly expensive for what it is, but certainly something a struggling family would have a hard time coming up with which would somewhat justify Ron being sent off to school with a lightly damaged hand-me-down wand.

But at 5 pounds a galleon? 35 pounds is a lot easier for someone not in abject poverty to swing, even if it means a lean month of eating rice and ramen (even easier to justify since all the boys will be off at hogwarts which should cut the grocery bill down to next to nothing, even if they grow most of their own food)
