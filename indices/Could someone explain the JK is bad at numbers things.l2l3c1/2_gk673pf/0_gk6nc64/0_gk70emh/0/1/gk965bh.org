Ron had Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.

But Charlie's OLD wand indicates that Charlie has a new wand, probably the first thing he saved up for when he got his job. Since at this point Charlie had been out of Hogwarts for 7 years (before the ages were adjusted), it makes sense that he'd give his old one to his parents in case somebody could use it in the future.

Edit to add: Just because it was Charlie's old wand, does not mean Charlie was the first owner. Even at the very beginning, the wand had a bit of the unicorn hair core sticking out. That indicates the wand has seen either many years of use, or some rather hard use. Quite likely it was a hand-me-down for Charlie is well, just another reason he'd want a wand that chose him as soon as he could afford one.
