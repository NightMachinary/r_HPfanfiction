I always thought that the wands tune themselves to their wielders personality as the wizard grows up, since if not, wizards would need a new one every two/three years at Hogwarts.

But what if their personality changes too quickly? What if the wand can't align itself to its wielder new personality? It would become useless to them.

So something happened to Charlie, his wand doesn't fit his personality anymore and he gives it to his mother to see if one of his siblings can use it.
