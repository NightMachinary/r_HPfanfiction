Most likely is that Charlie just wanted a new wand to take to Romania with him and had the new job and independence to pay for it. He treated his wand somewhat poorly if after only 7 years at Hogwarts it had the unicorn hair poking through and likely wanted one in better shape to take for his dangerous job working with dragons. He probably thought he could help his parents out by giving his wand to Ron rather than making them buy a new one; two birds, one stone.

Honestly, given that Unicorn and Ash are all about consistency and loyalty its a little surprising that the wand worked as well for Ron as it did. I wouldn't be surprised if the wand was a little irritated at Charlie for treating it poorly and abandoning it and was more willing to work with Ron because of that.
