I once wrote up my own big document comparing prices of things over the course of the books and it becomes clear that around Book 4, the decision was made to basically treat Galleons as a pound equivalent in that costs are generally defined in their relationship to galleons rather than anything else. To me the Wizarding Currency issue isn't so much a "Rowling can't math" issue as it is a "Rowling can't consistency" issue. Some things work better with the 50 to 1 rate, some work better with the 5 to 1 rate, others even work better with a 25 to 1 or a 1 to 1 rate. Rowling obviously never bothered to consider what things actually cost and chose to just write values that sounded good on paper.
