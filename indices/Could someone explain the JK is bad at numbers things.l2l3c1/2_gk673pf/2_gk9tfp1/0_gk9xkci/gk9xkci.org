Yeah. I'm seeing that a lot in terms of peoples' ages too. Dumbledore's and McGonagall's ages. And apparently Bill's and Charlie's ages too. Hadn't realized that.

But yeah. It's an overall consistency issue that should've been caught in edits for the seven books. George R. R. Martin has folks that keep track of things like that for him. Any tweets or most of Pottermore, let alone that one play or the Beasts movies are even further from any bits of consistency the books had.
