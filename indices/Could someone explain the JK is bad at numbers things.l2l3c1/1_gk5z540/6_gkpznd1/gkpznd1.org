The population one is particularily bad when you consider the average wizard lfiespan is supposed to be 137. So, therefore basically every wizard born since 1860 would be alive in 1991. And yet, there are only 3000 wizards...but there are somehow 40 students in Harry's Year? 40 students a year, for 130 years is over 5000 people. So, what's the deal with that? High wizard sucidide rate?
