If they are only 3000 witches and wizards that is too few to support a healthy population. Especially when it seems from canon that a single child is more common than lots of siblings. So we have 2000 adults and 1000 children. So then if the 1 and occasionally 2 kid birthrate applies. We will only have 500 new couples (assuming 50/50 gender) that means next round only 500 kids. With each generation getting smaller numbers let alone having the genetic diversity becoming non-existent.

So there have to be a much greater number of magicals (like around 30-40K). And Hogwarts has to be considered as an "upper crust" school for the movers and shakers in the magical world. And the birthrates have to be higher than what the books seem to imply as even 15-20K "breeding pairs" is too low to keep the population up without a lot higher birthrate.
