Why do you think only children died? Each adult who died is one who can't become a parent. Meaning a few generations down the road, that's ten people less.

It would make sense for a small baby boom, but large wars devastate a country's demographics. Like France after WWI or the Soviet Union after WWII (although a lack of men is easier to compensate for).
