Because a sports league needs enough fans to support it as a business. It has nothing to do with how many players there are. Think about the professional sports in your country: they need literally thousands of paying ticket-holders for each game, because they need to make enough money not only to build and upkeep a stadium but to pay the salaries, etc. Yes, only wealthy people can own a team, but nobody is wealthy enough to throw all that money away just as entertainment: they need to be making money off of it.
