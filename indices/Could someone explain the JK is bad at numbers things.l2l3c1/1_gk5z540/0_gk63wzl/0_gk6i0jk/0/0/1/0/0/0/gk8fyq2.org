You're just wrong.

Most sports are played mostly by amateurs, including at a high level. Even today a very large number of international athletes are at most part-timers. Take, for example, the United States team at the rugby league world cup in 2017. Out of a squad of 24 players, 5 were full time pros. Another 8 played their club rugby for teams that I think are semi-pro (which doesn't mean that all their players are paid, just that some are). The majority were amateurs. Only five of fourteen teams in the competition were made up entirely of full-time professionals.

Or consider the Olympics. Until quite recently it was entirely amateur - professionalism only really took off in the 1968 games (did you know that the Olympics used to include arts competitions, but they were dropped after the 1948 competition because artists sold their work and so were professional?). Before then governments put a ton of money into sponsoring the games [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics#/media/File:Olimpiai_Stadion,_a_n%C5%91i_magasugr%C3%A1s_eredm%C3%A9nyhirdet%C3%A9se_(1._Cs%C3%A1k_Ibolya,_Magyarorsz%C3%A1g][for their own purposes]]._Fortepan_17417.jpg) but the games themselves, including the vast majority of athletes, were amateur or at most part-time pros.

Most domestic leagues in most sports are played and run by amateurs. Doubly so when you start to consider leagues that draw players from tiny populations.
