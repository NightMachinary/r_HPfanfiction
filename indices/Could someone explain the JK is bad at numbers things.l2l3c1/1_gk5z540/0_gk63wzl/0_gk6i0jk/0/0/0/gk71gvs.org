Just the fact of having like 13 teams with 7 players plus subs mean they have north of 100 pro players plus coaches... Only Ginny and Oliver Wood are heard as joining a pro team in Harry's years... which even if that's from Gryffindor is nowhere enough. In a 7 years gap more than 8 players should retire from a 100 player league.

Also where else would they get players from if it's a 4 team school and the only school around?
