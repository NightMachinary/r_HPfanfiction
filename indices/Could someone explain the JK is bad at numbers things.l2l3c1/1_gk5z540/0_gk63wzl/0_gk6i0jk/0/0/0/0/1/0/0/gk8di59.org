So what's the point? That Angelina and Alicia could have been pro? Ok... And so? They didn't. And the thing is that, pro or semipro, we have a league of 100 players and in the whole Harry school year we only see 2 going to fill vacant slots...

We need more names actually making it to a team for it to make sense.
