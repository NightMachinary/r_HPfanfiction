We only get Oliver and Ginny as Quidditch players in 7 years for Gryffindor. If Katie or Angelina or Alicia Spinnet would have made one of the league's teams... pro or semipro... we would have heard of it.

You could argue that there are more players from the other houses making it to the league, but that doesn't seem likely. After all, Gryffindor is the best team, they won 3 out of 5 tournaments we know.
