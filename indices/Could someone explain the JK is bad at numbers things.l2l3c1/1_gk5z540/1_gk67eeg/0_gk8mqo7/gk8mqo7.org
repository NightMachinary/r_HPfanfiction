Even if we go by current chronology (I used Hogwarts mysteries as a guide, regardless of it canonicity), then Ginny is still too young. Bill is two years older then Charlie (who is in same year as Jacob's sibling and Tonks) and Charlie is 8 years older then Ginny, meaning Ginny was just a baby when Bill started.
