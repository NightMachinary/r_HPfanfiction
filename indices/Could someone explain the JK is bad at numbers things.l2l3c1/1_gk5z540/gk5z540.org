When PS was first published, Charlie Weasley was seven years older than he is canonically.

Dumbledore's age being revealed to have been 150 in 1991 (birth in 1841), before the 6th book... then becoming 110 (birth in 1881) for the 7th book.

McGonagall's age at the time os PS being revealed to be 70 (birth in 1921), before the 6th book... before we learned she became teacher two years after graduating (that info comes from Pottermore) which means (since we know she became a teacher in 1956 thanks to OP) she is supposed to be born around 1935. Then The fantastical beasts: crimes of grindelwals comes and we have McGonagall being contemporary of the events of the movie (set around 1927, before she was even born), and now... we don't know.

The quite established fact there are 40 students in Harry's year, meaning there are 280 students versus PoA where there are 200 students supporting Slytherin in one of the matches, while the three other houses supports Gryffindor.

I think she gave an estimation of 3000 wizards and around one thousand students at Hogwarts... which is consistent with the 4 times 200 students, but 1/3 of the population are kids?

Also, the fact that Merlin, the King Arthur's wizard was in Slytherin... which I don't know if that's an inconsistency but I think the timeframe for King Arthur is around the 400-500, not after 1000.

There is so much errors about the dates, (for example, every year Harry and his friend take the Hogwarts Express, the 1st September, and they start the classes the day right after, Lupin who should not have been able to get in that train since that day was a full moon in 1993).

Nearly Headless Nicholas saying he didn't eat for 400 years, even though he has been dead for 500 years.
