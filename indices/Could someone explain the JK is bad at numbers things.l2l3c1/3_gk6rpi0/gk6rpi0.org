Marcus Flint is a Sixth Year in Philosopher's Stone, however he's still around in Harry's third year. Someone asked JKR about this on her old website and the answer was something along the lines of: "Well, there's two potential explanations here. Either Flint got held back a year, or the author isn't very good at Maths. I like to think the first is true, even if it's probably the second."
