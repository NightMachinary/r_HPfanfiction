They actually retconned this so in newer editions of PS he's only a fifth year, which I take to mean that even J.K didn't think the "he had to repeat a year" made sense.

Most fanfics still have him as either having to repeat a year or "just showing up for Quidditch", both of which are plot-holes all on their own - if he had to repeat a year it probably wouldn't be a post-O.W.L. year, and I don't think any of the staff would allow him to show up just for Quidditch.
