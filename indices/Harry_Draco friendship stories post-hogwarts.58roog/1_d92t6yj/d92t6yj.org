There was a fic I read called linkffn(big brother is listening to you) that has this as a big part. Basically it's a way to make Harry/Daphne work by making the wizard ing world have a version of the show big brother. But Harry and Draco becoming friends is a big part. I can't remember who Draco is paired with but I don't think it's hermione. It's a neat little fic with lots of Harry/Draco bromance fluff.

Edit:turns out its Gabrielle. If I remember correctly it actually works pretty well.
