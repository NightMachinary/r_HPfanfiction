Summer of Change is complete.

What you are asking for is a sequel, and most authors would at least ask for permission from the original author.

Personally I'm not certain you could improve on that story, a sequel would answer too many questions I'm not prepared to find out the answer for. Never ask a question you do not already know the answer to, or do not wish to know the answer to.
