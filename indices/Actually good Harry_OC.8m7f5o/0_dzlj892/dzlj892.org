Wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it is good and complete. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power)

There's also some that are somewhat must read Harry/OC like linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy; Grow Young with Me; Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss; Hell Eyes by Jezaray)

There's a couple that I remember that aren't all that good, but are complete. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Power; Madley In Love) Though you could say that Madley isn't OC, per se.
