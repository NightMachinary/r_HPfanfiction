I never really saw Ginny as a clone of Lily. But maybe it's because we know so very little about Lily. But, tbh, the only thing I like in Harry/Ginny is that it makes Harry officially part of the Weasley's family.

Lily/James was kind of awful for all we knew about it.

Remus/Tonk was a total disaster (let's force an older man who is probably depressed as hell into a relationship with a girl he barely knows and doesn't show any interest in because... love will cure everything? Because she's cute and she wants to? Because no one can mind their own business?)

Ron/Hermione was just... meh. If only they could have stayed friends instead. There was really no need for this romance, imo.

Fleur/Bill was just out of nowhere. And I never really remembered Bill's age but it seemed so weird.

I think one of the biggest problem is just the need to put all the characters in a relationship by the end of the series AND to put them with someone from the group. It's never satisfying. I can't believe Hermione would have stayed in England, would have become Mrs Weasley 2.0, sticking with her high school sweetheart. It just feels all too forced.
