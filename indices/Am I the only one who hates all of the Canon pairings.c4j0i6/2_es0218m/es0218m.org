Ginny is a non character, Ron and Hermione could work if JK bothered to lay any groundwork.

The real criminal pairings are Nevill/Hannah Abbot and Luna/Rolf Scamander

I mean WHY

Why use the non-character of Abbott, and invent Rolf Scamander, just to break up the only relationship that would have been remotely food? Neville/Luna is infinitely superior.
