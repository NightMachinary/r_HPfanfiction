While I dislike Rowling's attempt at writing romance, your reasoning is... Questionable.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny is basically a clone of Harry's mother
#+end_quote

What? They both have red hair. That is pretty much the only similarity.

It is like when people say there is no point in fics that pair Harry with any of the quidditch trio, as Ginny was on the team so they are just replacement Ginny's.

#+begin_quote
  There never was a ton of character development
#+end_quote

Outside the trio, no-one is seriously developed except their subplots. Rowling basically close to have Harry pair with a background character, and not promote her to main.

#+begin_quote
  I had seen potential in Ron and Lavender hoping that it would show Ron mature,
#+end_quote

What? Lavender is basically the primary 'Ron doesn't have to challenge his assumptions about relationship' pairing. Ron/Hermione is the right pairing if you want to show him maturing. It just doesn't work because it isn't developed and doesn't feel earned.

Could have easily had Ron get serious about studies because he wanted to impress Hermione. Or had them struggle with different assumptions on what they would do after school. Or had SOME sort of non-harry-related conflict for them to work through.

And no, kissing other people to make each other jealous does not count.

  like Bill and Fleur,
#+end_quote

It happens entirely off screen with just enough hints to suggest what happened. If anything, this is what works best in Canon, as the reader can fill in the blanks.

#+begin_quote
  Two of the only good pairings are, of course, Lily and James, and Remus and Tonks.
#+end_quote

?????????

Lily and James are a steriotypical 'boy wants girl who won't stoop to notice them'. What we know about James is that he was a bit of a bully like Ron. And he basically got 'hero gets the girl' treatment. And Lily is woefully undefined, and acts almost entirely as a motivation for the male characters (Harry/James). Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the entire HP series failed the Bechdel test.

And Remus/Tonks? You thought Bill/Fleur came out of left field? It was pretty clearly tieing of romantic lose ends without introducing new characters.
