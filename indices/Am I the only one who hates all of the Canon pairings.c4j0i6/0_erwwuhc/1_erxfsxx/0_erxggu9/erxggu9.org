Depending on the light you want to cast, The Muarders and the twins could easily be seen as harrassers.

A negative Ron view is more of 'insensitive prat' catagory, perhaps with a side of bigot. That is what I assumed the OP meant when they called Ron a bully and I used it in the same terms.

Although those are more redeemable that the straight up bullying of Draco or Dudley.
