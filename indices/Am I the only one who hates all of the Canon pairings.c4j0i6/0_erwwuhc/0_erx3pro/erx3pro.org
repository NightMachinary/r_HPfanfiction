  as Ginny was on the team
#+end_quote

Ginny joined the team as a replacement when Harry was banned, so they were only on the team together for sixth year by which point JKR's shitty chest monster thing had reared its ugly head. I don't disagree with the concept you put forwards, but Harry trained with the original chaser team for five years against Ginny's one. If someone wanted to argue that Harry spent hours every week with the quidditch girls and there must have been some interactions between them I'd agree, I'd then point out Harry spent his summers around Ginny. I don't disagree with your idea but I do take issue with your argument.
