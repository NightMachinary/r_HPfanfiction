No, I dislike them all too. Almost all of them manage to find ways to squick me out or feel insanely conflictual, and they all feel forced. There are hardly any pairings in the whole series that don't involve story characters getting together, because of course there's no life outside the narration and the characters don't exist outside of their scenes.
