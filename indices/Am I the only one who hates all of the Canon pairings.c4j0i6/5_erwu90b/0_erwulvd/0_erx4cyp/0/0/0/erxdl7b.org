Just because he doesn't show certain traits of an incel doesn't mean he clearly is one. For example, the fact that he doesn't treat Lily like her own person, with her own emotions and likes and dislikes. He sees her as an object to be won. He doesn't care about her own happiness.

Another trait is that he uses a single failed romantic pursuit as an excuse to be a spiteful vindictive douche to everything and everyone, and refuses to take responsibility for his own shitty personality.
