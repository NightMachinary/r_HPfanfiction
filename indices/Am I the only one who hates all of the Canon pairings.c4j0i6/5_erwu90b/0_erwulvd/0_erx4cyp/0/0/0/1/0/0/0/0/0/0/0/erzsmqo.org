â€˜One glance at it showed me all I needed to know' - that alone is proof he didn't see Pettigrew. He only took a cursory glance, to him Black was guilty and that's all that mattered. I think you're kidding yourself if you believe Snape would have ignored Pettigrew had he seen him. He wanted revenge on Lily's betrayer.

Additionally Snape is only ever spoken about through the lens of Harry's opinion, we know he bullied Harry and possibly Neville but we have nothing on the other years. People over exaggerate what he did - of course it was abominable behaviour but it wasn't widespread. In fact he protects the most at risk students from the Carrows by giving them detention with Hagrid.

Snape risked his life as a spy for the light for many years. He got good intelligence and followed Dumbledore's plan to the letter. Killing Dumbledore saved Draco, Harry and probably the entirety of Wizarding Britain. His patronus charm literally did save all of wizarding Britain, taking Harry to the Sword of Godric Gryffindor.

Also let's not forget that Harry, who was picked on most severely by Snape, names his child after him. That's a sign that he's redeemed himself to the boy he hurt most deeply. I think there's definitely a case to say Snape is redeemable.
