Racists, homophobes, and sexists all have exceptions to their rules. As Snape did not deny calling every other muggleborn a mudblood this seems to hold true for his blood supremacy. His desire for revenge was born out of a broken promise that the chief blood supremacist would kill her baby and spare her. He then spent near 7 years bullying said baby and treating the child Voldemort didn't go after even worse. The man threw the sword in a frozen lake in the middle of a war out of spite.

He was a vile pos, who did a few decent things. That makes him 3D. Not redeemable.
