Snape was sort of in a bind in the sense that he was a spy and therefore didn't really have any option other than to continue using the word mudblood. Otherwise he couldn't have been, you know, a spy! I think his desire for revenge may have been born from that, however I don't think that's all it was eventually.

Also the very nature of Snape being 3D helps make him a more redeemable character. A neglected child, hurt and alone, poor and constantly wearing ill-fitting clothes, is it really any surprise he would desire power. Add to that the horrendous abuse and bullying HE suffered from James Potter and Sirius Black, Snape's faults come from his ill-treatment. I don't blame him entirely for his actions. Additionally Snape did work tirelessly as headteacher to protect the students.

Rowling says that Snape is immensely brave and when asked if she considered Snape a hero, she replied: "Yes, I do; though a very flawed hero. An anti-hero, perhaps. He is not a particularly likeable man in many ways. He remains rather cruel, a bully, riddled with bitterness and insecurity---and yet he loved, and showed loyalty to that love and, ultimately, laid down his life because of it. That's pretty heroic!"

I believe Snape can be redeemed.
