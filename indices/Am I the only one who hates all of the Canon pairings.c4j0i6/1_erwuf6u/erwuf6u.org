Stopped reading at “Ginny is a clone of Harry's mother”, because that's patently idiotic to anyone whose capacity for reading comprehension extends beyond hair colour.

Edit: Never mind, read the rest. You really going to try and pay out Ron/Hermione when you call Remus/Tonks a good ship? He's twelve years older than her, and she bullied and harassed him into a relationship and child he didn't want. It's toxic as fuck.
