Ok headcanon that I have

Creating a horcrux taints your soul not the soul shard you put in the object. Its what makes horcruxes discreet and not stand out as dark objects.

But that only applies if you only make one horcrux. Voldemort made multiple so all other horcruxes after the first one comes from an already tainted soul.

Its that tainted curse that stops your soul from healing. If Tom Riddle comes back to life as a full person from the diary then his soul shard will heal since its not tainted. But he's also in a different time a different life with new experiences to shape and change him that Voldemort never had. This new soul that forms is a new thing entirely its no longer a soul shard. Its no longer Voldemort's horcrux but Tom Riddle's soul. Despite the Diary not being destroyed, a year after Tom Riddle Jr emerges from it Voldemort is down one horcrux.
