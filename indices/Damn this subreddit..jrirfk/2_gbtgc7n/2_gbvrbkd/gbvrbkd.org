I download mine into Calibre with Fanficfare, you can make custom categories and tags there. Bonus is that I can then read on my ereader instead of a normal screen (and realize just how much time I'm about to 'waste' when it tells me a fic has like 1500 pages). And you have a backup if the original is deleted or ffn is down.
