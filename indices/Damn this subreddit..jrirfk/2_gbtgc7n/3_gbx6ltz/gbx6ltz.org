I use the "mark for later" on ao3 and ffnet downloaded in the app. If the fanfic is over 100k words on ao3, I download it and read it on a separate app. I have a lot bookmarks tagged "Downloaded" ðŸ˜‚ my browser saves where I was in the fanfic if I read it only halfway (don't like reading in chapters, always have the full story) its saved where I was wegen I open it again
