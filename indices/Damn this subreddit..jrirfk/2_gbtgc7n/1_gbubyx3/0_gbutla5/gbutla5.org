Same. With ao3 I've sort of got a two part system where I mark them for later and if I've started it I'll also bookmark it with a not of what chapter I'm up to. I just often forget why I wanted to read it, but if I bookmarked them all then my bookmarks would get confusing with what I've read or not. I think I need to put sections in the bookmarks on safari so they're categorised by mood or something
