Yup

I highly recommend ~tripling the speed of the voice for this.

There are a few downsides; the voice is optimized for Google maps so "Dr. Granger" is always pronounced "Drive Granger", for instance, and if authors do <><><><><><> to separate sections it reads out "less than greater than" over and over which is obnoxious but overall I quite like it. I actually used it for my last reread of the series proper even though I own the audiobooks because it's nice to be able to pause and copy out quotes.
