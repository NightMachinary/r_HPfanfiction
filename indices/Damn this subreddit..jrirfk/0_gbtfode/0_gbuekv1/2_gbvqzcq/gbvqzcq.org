I use Calibre to download the fic then ultraedit to edit the text file then TextAloud to convert the text file to mp3 which also splits the mp3 into small chunks so that I can listen to a few chunks instead of the whole bloody thing, I then load the mp3s onto my cellphone and use VLC to play the mp3s
