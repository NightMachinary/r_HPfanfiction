iOS has this feature built in with [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.macworld.com/article/3390309/how-to-make-your-iphone-read-to-you-by-using-speak-screen-in-ios.amp.html][Speak Screen]]. Once you have Speak Screen enabled, just download the fanfic ePub to iBooks, swipe down with two fingers, and Siri will start reading the whole fic until told to stop. I prefer the Siri Male UK voice.
