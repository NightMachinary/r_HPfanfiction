Yo! I wrote a weird prompt about this years ago! The character was an Archaeologist and kept hearing rumors about it, so she went backpacking to find it and found Hogwarts in all it's glory and was so confused. Turns out, her father was the grandson of a Squib from a pureblood family and her mother was born a squib. So neither of them considered one of their children having magic and she never showed signs of magic, so she was raised like a muggle. She becomes the Muggle Studies teacher and lives happily in both worlds while showing the newer generation that Muggles and the things they have are actually really cool and they are more advanced than Wix could ever have expected. Taking students on field trips into the muggle world so they can blend in better because it's better to be safe than sorry. It didn't go far, but I still have it in a notebook somewhere.
