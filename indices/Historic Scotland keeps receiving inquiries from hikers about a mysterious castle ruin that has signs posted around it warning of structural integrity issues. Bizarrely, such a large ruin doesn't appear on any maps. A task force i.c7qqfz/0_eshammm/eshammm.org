If a squib sheltered or ignorant of their heritage discovered Hogwarts (or anywhere else magical), they'd actually be the biggest danger to the statute if they were careful enough and could compile proof. Not only do they likely not set off the wards, but they can lead others back to it, even if the muggles they bring cannot immediately see the castle.
