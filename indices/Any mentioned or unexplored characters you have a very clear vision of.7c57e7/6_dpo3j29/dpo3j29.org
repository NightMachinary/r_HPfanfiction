I invented backstories for Mulciber and Sturgis Podmore for my fic. I could be flexible on Sturgis, but Mulciber is firmly locked as headcanon. If I wrote a completely crazy AU, Mulciber would still be what he is in my current fic. The unwanted son of a nasty pureblood, who murdered his father and half-brother and took his father's place among the Death Eaters. Fled Britain after Voldemort's fall and became a wand-for-hire.
