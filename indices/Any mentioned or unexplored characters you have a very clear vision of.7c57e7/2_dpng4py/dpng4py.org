Theo Nott. He gets mentioned, like, once in book 3 but I have such a clear view of his character. He has a hard time reconciling the loving father he had with the monster Nott Sr was to the world. He loves his Slytherin housemates, especially after seventh year, when no Slytherins, not even the first years, were invited into the RoR to escape the Carrows, and either he willfully took the Mark about as much as Draco did, or if he didn't, it was because he was too young or other reason, and not because he didn't want to prove himself like Draco did. As a main pairing, I'm a sucker for a good Hermione/Theo, but if we're just including background or minor characters, if Theo is gay always Percy/Theo, if straight Luna/Theo.

I can totally get sucked into different characterizations, but there needs to be given context and reason. Also the more wild the AU, like Voldie Wins!AUs, there's a lot more wiggle room. I really just love fanon Theo Nott.
