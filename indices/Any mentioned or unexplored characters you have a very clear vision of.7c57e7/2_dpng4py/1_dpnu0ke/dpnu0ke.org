I have a really defined view of Theodore Nott as well!

Tall, broad-shouldered but quite delicate despite his size, always walking about with his head in a book, and tends to be quite private. Doesn't involve himself in situations that are not his own, and tends to be quite detached from situations when he is trying to resolve them. I tend to write him as being quite protective of his fellow Slytherins, especially the younger ones, as I imagine him as having several younger siblings.

I did something a wee bit different with his canon, though, and made the Death Eater Nott Snr an uncle - Canton Nott - rather than his father, 'cause I've been trying to explore more of the separations down family lines, you know?

I'm actually thinking I'll write some Theo/Hermione into my current fic, so I'm really glad to see someone say they're interested in the pairing!
