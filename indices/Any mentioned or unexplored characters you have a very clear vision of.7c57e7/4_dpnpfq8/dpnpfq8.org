Honestly? Kevin's Entwhistle. During my rabid hunt for names, places and more throughout every avenue I found I came across the "Original 40" students of Harry's year as penned by Rowling.

That was 3 years ago and since I've constructed an entire fleshed out character even though he'll likely never appear in my major fics.
