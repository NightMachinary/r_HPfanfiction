Not a minor character, but in writing some pre-hogwarts Harry I decided that at some point he'd definitely memorized every synonym for "fat" in the thesaurus so he could accurately describe the Dursleys. Also so his insults to Dudley would have the double whammy of calling him fat and implicitly calling him stupid for not knowing what "corpulent" means.
