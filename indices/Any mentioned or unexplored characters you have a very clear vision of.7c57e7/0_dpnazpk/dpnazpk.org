I picture Daphne Greengrass like this pretty much always:

Except the hair is less frizzy.

  Do you ever get put-off when a fic presents a completely different version of a character you've fleshed out, or do you like to seek out different presentations of them?

Depends. Is Hermione suddenly an idiot? If so, yes. Is Daphne not an Ice Queen? Idgaf, I'll keep reading. Actually, I prefer her not to be. I want the main canon characters to stay close to canon, I don't care about the rest and their personalities/looks.

The only exception is Harry. If we were restricted to canon Harry's personality, I'd have quit reading fanfiction long ago.
