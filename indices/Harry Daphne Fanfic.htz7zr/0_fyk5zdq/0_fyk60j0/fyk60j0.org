  When Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to return to Hogwarts after the war to finish their schooling, they are expecting an easy year. Nobody expected McGonagall to push for inter-house unity and nobody expected the unlikely friendships and relationships that would result. Tells the tale of the trios final year at school, then goes beyond that.ORIGINALLY POSTED ON FANFICTION.NET UNDER NAME OF HOLZ9364. However, I am in the process of deleting that account.
