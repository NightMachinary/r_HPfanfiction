You can do whatever you want in your fics, and it'll probably be better foreshadowed than Harry's resurrection.

Bu if you care about canon, it says (Deathly Hallows ch 35):

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

Which suggests that Voldemort is Harry's horcrux, effectively, and anyone could have cast the Killing Curse on Harry to get the same result.
