Well, the canon magic system is just whatever is most convenient for Rowling at the time.

I personally like to think that an AK with the intent of killing Voldemort's soul piece inside Harry would work. I don't think it's canon but i don't care much for the canon magic system, simply because it's unrefined and at times just doesn't make any sense.

It has been a while since i actually read the books and my understanding of the original magic system is probably extremely warped by the sheer amount of fanfiction i've read but IIRC it's never really explained how the Ak works, how exactly it kills and how much intent matters.

I think it's futile to even try to attempt to make sense of it all and just go with your own personal magic system that leans on the basic canon ideas.
