  The only way to destroy the Horcrux in Harry's scar is for Harry to die.

Well, if I recall Deathly Hallows correctly, isn't remorse of the creator a way to destroy a Horcrux? This, to me, suggests that TWO methods of Horcrux destruction were done simultaneously. First is the death of the Living Horcrux. Pretty self-explanatory. The second depends on interpretation. If Voldemort kills his own Living Horcrux, that could be seen as a sign of remorse, and destroy the Horcrux without necessarily harming the Horcrux container. This /probably/ *isn't* enough to allow Harry to live, but it's an interesting thought experiment.
