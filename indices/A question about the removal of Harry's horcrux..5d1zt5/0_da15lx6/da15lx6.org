Canonically, no. There's no way to kill the horcrux directly. Remember that what destroys a Horcrux isn't the Killing curse or basilisk venom etc themselves. Rather what destroys a Horcrux is the destruction of its container. With a living container that means death. For example when Harry was injected with basilisk venom in CoS it didn't do anything to the Horcrux because Harry didn't die.

The only way to destroy the Horcrux in Harry's scar is for Harry to die.

Voldemort being the one to cast the spell was part of the key to Harry coming back to life afterwards (in combination with Lily's magic in Voldemort's blood anchoring Harry to life), but not to destroy the Horcrux itself. Death by any means is sufficient for that.
