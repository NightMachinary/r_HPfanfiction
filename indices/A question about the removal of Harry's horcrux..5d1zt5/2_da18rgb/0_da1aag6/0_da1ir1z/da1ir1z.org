Interesting. Ive seen a few where he goes back in time and it automatically erases the Horcrux because for whatever reason it cant travel with him (due to being linked to a particular time, or having the attachment to Voldemort or whatever). But I have never come across one where he AK's himself to kill the Horcrux as a sacrifice for the travel.

Got any good recommendations of stories like that?
