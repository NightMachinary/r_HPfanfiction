The general consensus is that the container must be destroyed for the Horcrux to be destroyed. This would mean Harry dying. However I have always been curious if harry could die for 5 seconds and then be brought back to life. Think.. your heart stopping and then being shocked back to beating (the muggle way). I am sure in the magical world its possible to briefly die and be brought back as well.

So then... how dead is truly dead? How dead is necessary for the destruction of the Horcrux?.

All interesting questions. But at the end of the day as others have said, you can pretty much go off in a variety of other directions.

For example.. the Horcrux attaches itself to the host, so why would it not be possible to unattach it in some way without killing the host. Or transfer it from one host to another? Or even alter the host in such a way that the Horcrux can no longer survive attached to that particular host. None of these things really break cannon because cannon simply doesnt contain enough information to invalidate them.
