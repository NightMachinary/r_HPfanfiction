Well, that depends. Someone casting the curse at Harry alone would not /just/ destroy the Horcrux, but also kill Harry. However, when Harry got hit with the curse and "died" he was brought back through because of the whole "love" bs.

Basically, if you get some family member to sacrifice themselves for you... your good! No deaths for you!
