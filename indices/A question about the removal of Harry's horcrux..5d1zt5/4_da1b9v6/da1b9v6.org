In canon, Dumbledore spent a couple years thinking about this issue and decided the only way to remove the soul fragment from Harry was for him to walking up to Voldemort and take a killing curse from him.

I and many readers have problem with this solution:

1. We do not believe Dumbledore is all mighty and all knowing. He was also working alone.

2. Harry was never a properly made Horcrux, he only had a soul fragment latched on to him accidentally. Dumbledore never seemed to take that into consideration canonically.

3. Having Harry walking up to Voldemort seemed quite risky to me. What would happen if Voldemort decided to interrogate Harry just a little? With Harry's lousy occlumency, Voldemort would have easily found out the truth and won.

4. Killing curse was the not only way to kill someone. Voldemort already tried it a few times before and failed, why should we assume he would keep doing that? A sectumsepra across Harry's neck or dropping a heavy rock on his head would certainly kill Harry, blood protection or not.

--------------

As a result, fanfic writers have come up with many solutions:

- Assume the Horcrux was localized in his scar, then use muggle surgery to remove it

- Apply basilisk venom to the scar, and when Harry is 'sufficiently' dead, use Phoenix tear to heal him.

- Stage a fight with Voldemort and get 'accidentally' hit by a killing curse.

- Assume wizards define death as heart stop beating, so use muggle means to stop his heart artificially and revive him with CPR 5-10 minutes later.

- Use a dementor to suck out the soul fragment from the scar.

- Develop or find rituals to exorcise the soul fragment.

- Develop rituals and use Harry's link to Voldemort to attack Voldemort's main soul directly.

- In fics where Voldemort was sensible enough to use a random rock for one of his Horcruxes, Dumbledore's canon Horcrux hunting would be completely screwed. The solution was to trap his soul in an object, and work on Harry's scar without too much pressure.

- In one fic, they did a complete obliviation on Voldemort, didn't bother with Harry's scar.

--------------

Of all the above mentioned fanfic solutions, having Harry fight Voldemort and getting hit by a killing curse is probably the most reasonable one IMO. It doesn't violate canon in any way, it doesn't require more explanations, and it is guaranteed to work. In addition, Harry would have other people protecting him when he woke up again. He wouldn't need a lying Narcissa to save his life.
