I can see that. He can't help but enjoy the good fortune of pre-war times, gets cocky because he's been through it all, he's not an eleven year old like the rest after all. That Malfoy arrogance doubles when Harry accepts his friendship this time round, and while teaching him to be a proper pure blood (because you fight fire with fire right?)

The suave, charming Riddle seduced the dark so lets get Harry to do the same, as he already has the Light. But this just makes the Light reject the Boy Who Lived, throwing his parents' sacrifice away to pal around with Death Eater's. So when the time comes, when politics and backroom deals aren't cutting it (because Tom might have been dead for the past decade, but he had years of experience to lean on) noone heeds the warnings and Harry, poor child is already in the Dark's clutches so its easy to do away with him. And /all/ thanks to you, young Malfoy.
