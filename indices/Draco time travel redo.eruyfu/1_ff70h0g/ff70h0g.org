I really don't need to start a new WIP when I have others to complete, but here's Draco trying to ingratiate himself with the trio on the train:

“What a cute rat,” said Draco, recognizing the mangy creature from Malfoy Manor. Pettigrew had tried to stay beneath the Dark Lord's notice, and had usually succeeded, damn him. “May I hold him?”

“I guess,” said Weasley, handing the rat over with trepidation.

“Thanks,” said Draco. “Come here, you little cutie.” Once he had a good grip on the rodent with one hand, he drew his wand with his other, aimed, and cast “Stupefy.”

“Bloody hell!” exclaimed Weasley.

Draco quickly cast the animagus-reversal spell on the unconscious vermin, dropping him to give him room to expand on the floor.

“Who's that?” exclaimed Granger.

“And why do his robes look so seventies?” Draco couldn't help but wonder, for that flare at the hem and that wide collar hadn't been seen since the early eighties at the latest. But that wasn't important. “That's an animagus,” he said. “Sneaking onto the train with us.” He looked to Weasley. “Did you know you were helping an adult wizard sneak onto the train?”

“No!” squeaked Weasley.

“Is my owl---“ started Potter.

“Your owl's just an owl,” said Draco.

“Could you check?” Potter asked.

“She's fine,” said Draco, standing. “I need to go talk to the driver.”

Pettigrew let out a low groan.

Draco addressed Granger quickly. “Watch carefully. If he comes to while I'm away, or tries changing back to his rat form, I'll need you to stun him again. Move your wand thusly and cast Stupefy.” Pettigrew lay silent and still again. “Got it?”

She nodded, eyes wide, and got her wand ready.

Draco was about to leave, but wanted insurance. He addressed Potter. “And let your owl out of her cage in case he does manage to change back to a rat and tries to escape. Owls can handle rats.”

Potter nodded and opened the cage.

As Draco left, he heard Weasley mutter, “I let him sleep in my bed...”

It was difficult to explain the situation to the driver, but Draco got the point across eventually. The driver paged through an old book, looking for the official policy for the situation. “Stowaways,” he read. “Unauthorized passengers, riding the train without tickets. It says I should owl Hogwarts so they can send Aurors to meet us at the Hogsmeade. Arrest him for theft of service.” He woke a small brown owl. “Rouse yourself, dearie. You'll earn your keep today.” The owl looked surprised to be woken. The driver started writing a note.

They'd arrest him for considerably more than that, but that was a good start. “Thank you,” said Draco. “I'll keep him unconscious until then.”

The driver wasn't happy about that. “Seems a bit excessive.”

“He's a rat animagus!” said Draco, hating the squeakiness of his voice. “He can't be trusted not to escape.”

“I suppose,” said the driver.

“I've got to get back,” said Draco. He ran through the train, ignoring the calls of his Slytherin friends. Losers.

He returned to his train compartment, where Granger still stood guard. Her gaze flicked to him. “I stunned him again,” she assured him. “He twitched.”

“I think that was just the train wobbling him, actually,” said Potter.

“Thank you,” said Draco to Granger. “I knew I could count on you. Anyway, the driver is sending an owl so Aurors will meet the train in Hogsmeade to arrest this wizard for theft of service, and I dare say a good deal more, since who knows what he was plotting, sneaking into a school?”

Weasley shuddered. “Thanks.”

This was an awkward situation in which to attempt to chat, but Draco tried. “You know,” he said to Granger, “There's a potion that could fix that.”

“Fix what?” she asked, gaze flicking to him then back to the unconscious man on the floor.

“Your hair.”

“What's wrong with my hair?”

Draco opened his trunk to get one of his bottles of Sleekeazy's. “Consider this a little welcome gift to the magical world.” He set it by her, then drew his wand and trained it on Pettigrew. “Go on, take it, I've got our prisoner covered.”

With his peripheral vision, Draco saw Granger pick up and examine the bottle. “Um. Thanks,” she said.

“No problem,” said Draco. “I always do what I can to help muggleborns.”

Weasley seemed to be choking.

“What, you think I'm like my father?” challenged Draco. “I'm not.”

“Didn't say you were, mate,” said Weasley.

“But I guess you don't have much experience with potions,” Draco realized. “I'll help you use it.”

“It's fine,” she said.

“You want to make a good impression, your first day at school,” said Draco. “You can't go in looking like that, I mean really. Do you have a comb?”

“In my trunk,” she said.

“Go get it,” Draco ordered. “And keep our prisoner covered while I fix your hair. There's enough time, the train won't get to Hogwarts for hours.”
