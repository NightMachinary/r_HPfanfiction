"Run it by me one more time, Griphook, if you would."

"Account Manager Griphook, Lord Potter," said the goblin, testily.

Harry nodded politely, not wanting to anger his newly minted Account Manager. "Of course, my apologies."

"Yes, well," Griphook muttered as he walked across the office to what appeared to be a large chalkboard. The goblin drew a large 'P' at the center, and turned to his client.

"The plan is simple, Lord Potter," said Griphook. "You purchase a share in a successful business, and then recruit three other wizards to sell shares in that business."

"I got that part, Grip--" replied Harry, only to see the glare coming from the goblin. "...er, I got that part, Account Manager Griphook."

"Good," said the goblin, with a satisfied nod. "Do you understand the next step, then?"

"I think so," said Harry. "There would be three wizards under me, right?"

Griphook nodded, and drew the letter 'W' three times underneath the 'P'.

"Alright," continue Harry. "Then, each of those wizards recruits three wizards of their own?"

"Yes!" Griphook gave a toothy grin as he drew in additional wizards at the base of the chalkboard. "And each wizard contributes their profits to the company, which is you."

"Uh huh," said Harry. "How is this not a pyramid scheme?"

"What nonsense is that?"

Harry shrugged. "All I'm doing is talking people into talking other people into selling something. It's a scam."

"This is nothing like a pyramid scheme, Lord Potter, I assure you!" Griphook's voice was beginning to raise as his anger came to the fore.

Rising, Harry took the piece of chalk from the hand of his soon to be former Account Manager. Then he drew a pyramid around the diagram. Griphook stared at the board for a full minute, before he vanished the writing entirely.

"If you will excuse me, Lord Potter," he said quietly. "I need to speak with Ragnok." Without looking at his client, Griphook stormed off. Perhaps it was not too late.
