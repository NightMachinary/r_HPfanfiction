  "I used the majority of your gold to place a bet on Bulgaria winning during the final of the Quidditch World Cup " Griphook said with a grin on his face, which Harry couldn't help but find nasty.

  "Don't worry, the Bulgarian Seeker is significantly better than the Irish one, the odds of him not catching the Snitch may as well be non existent, just one week and both of use will be swimming in Gold" Griphook joyfully assured him.

  Despite his confident tone, Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He brushed it of as excitement, nobody knows better than him, that a better Seeker guarantees a win.
