I don't feel anyone has been mean, but I think it's because I am not heavily read. This is an untested theory, but I do wonder if just sheer traffic volume would draw those who feel like they will be clever if they are contrary, or perhaps they think somehow that the number of reviews suggests a perfection the writer never suggested herself.
