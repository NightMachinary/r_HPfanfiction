I've never had like, a super hurtful review but I posted a chapter one time and I was pretty bummed at the hate for it. It wasn't the quality of the writing as much as people really didn't like that Harry and Ron got into a fight, and Harry won. I'd been particularly proud of that chapter, but hey, at least they cared enough to get mad and converse with me about it!
