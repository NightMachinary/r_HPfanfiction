I don't know if it hurts me, more like I want to hurt the reviewer, but I see red when an anonymous review points something out that they think is a plot hole or something in the vein of "you dun goofed you" and it isn't, it's just that the reviewer didn't read carefully enough AND I CAN'T REPLY BECAUSE IT'S ANONYMOUS.

I'm perfectly fine with people not liking my stuff, but if they're objectively wrong about something included in the story, yeah, that can piss me off.
