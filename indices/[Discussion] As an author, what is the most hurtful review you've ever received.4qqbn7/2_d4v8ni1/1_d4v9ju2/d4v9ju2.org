UGH I had this last week! Someone went through and left a bunch of guest reviews on Not From Others saying I had my timelines wrong, mixing up movie and book canon (like saying Tonks and Remus died together holding hands) and, bizarrely, saying they were disappointed that they never found out who the betrayer was despite the confession being a major aspect of one of the later chapters. I can't message them to politely correct them, and as it's a completed fic I can't add an authors note either!
