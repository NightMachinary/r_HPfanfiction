Oh god, those people infuriate me so much. I have a fic labelled angst/tragedy, and from chapter 8 (out of 33) it was stated that one of the characters would die. Not foreshadowed or hinted, straight up and outright /stated/, and the last few chapters are pretty much his farewell to the world tour... and yet at least one reviewer still seemed annoyed that I didn't save him at the last minute, or write about him returning from death. Feeling sad about it, I understand, that's fair enough, but in those circumstances I don't get how anyone could honestly expect a happy ending.

Seriously, if you don't like unhappiness and terrible things, don't read angst fics!
