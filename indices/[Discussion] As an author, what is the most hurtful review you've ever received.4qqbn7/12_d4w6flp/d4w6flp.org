I usually just shrug off the few really nasty reviews I get. The ones that felt the most hurtful were when I got a bunch of bad reviews on Chapters 53 and 54 of /The Arithmancer/ saying how badly I was portraying Hermione and not understanding what I was trying to do with her character--this even after the one time I made major changes to a chapter after I posted it.
