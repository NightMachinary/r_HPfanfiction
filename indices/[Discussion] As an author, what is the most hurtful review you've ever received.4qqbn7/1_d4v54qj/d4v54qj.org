Honestly, anonymous reviews tended to be fairly positive. I did have one reviewer who started off very complimentary, but he/she quickly soured on my story once it wasn't going in the direction of their preconceived notions. I looked at their profile, though, and saw a big wall of text about their Twilight pairing preferences. Felt loads better after that.
