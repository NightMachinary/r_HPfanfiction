Someone once started an entire thread on a forum about how much they hated my fic, resigning it to the dumpster with various fics that couldn't spell things right. And I spelled things right. The fic's long deleted, but that thread's still out there. That kind of still annoys me, even though it was nearly ten years ago now, because if you google my fan fiction penname, guess what's right at the top? Argh.

I think they hated it because Ginny was a real person in my fic. Apparently they weren't keen on her.
