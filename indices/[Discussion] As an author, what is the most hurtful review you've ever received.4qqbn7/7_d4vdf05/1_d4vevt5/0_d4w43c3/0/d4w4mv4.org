I just am afraid to read it because potentially, it's amazing. But if I read it and dislike it, that's the only HP/House crossover beyond House's Houses--and that's not actually a crossover--that I could potentially like. So I prefer having it be potentially awesome than to read it and have the potentiality realized or exterminated.
