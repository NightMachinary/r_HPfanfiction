One of the blessings of being "under-reviewed", as many reviewers tell me I am, is that when I do receive a negative review, it's usually constructive criticism. Due to that, I don't think I've ever received a properly /hurtful/ review per se, but I have received reviews that infuriate me.

The most annoying review I've ever received, one that still rankles today, was a review left on my highest reviewed fic. The basic premise was that it was a buddy-cop comedy about Harry and Ron being wands for hire. About halfway through it, I suddenly remembered Hermione exists, and decided to widen the scope to a trio fic. So I started re-integrating her into the fic around chapter 10, and then there was an arc that was heavy on Hermione and light on Ron from Chapter 14-16.

I receive a review stating that the fic has too much Hermione and not enough Ron, completely ignoring the fact that Ron has been present in every chapter, and that Hermione hadn't even made an appearance in chapters 6-10.

But the part that still makes me froth in rage to this day, is the phrase he used to describe the fic: "it's like if the guy who wrote The Notebook tried to write Band of Brothers". Which is twofold spastic, because the fic is a /dark comedy/ about a mercenary turned government spy; how is that at all similar to a /war story/ about a Unit in the European Campaign of WW2? And if there's ever been a Nicholas Sparks protagonist who is as foul-mouthed and genuinely unpleasant as Harry in that fic, sign me up for a read, it sounds hilarious.

I know I shouldn't obsess so much over one review, especially one that wasn't even that hurtful, but seriously fuck that guy.
