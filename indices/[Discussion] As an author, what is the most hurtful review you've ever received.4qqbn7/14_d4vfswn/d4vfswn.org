God awful ending. Seriously, why bother reading your work again?

So basically Daphne is a shallow "princess" blood-sucking leech. Harry run for the hills! I'd rather see Harry end up with Ginny, that's how shite this pairing is. Please author do us all a favour and end this pile of crap now.

You deserved to be flamed. You made your Daphne undeserving of Harry.

What a stupid characterization of Daphne. I worry about your sanity.

You knew you are going to be flamed but you did it anyway. So what is the best word to describe you? It starts with S, or I or M, or all of those. I usually like Daphne but I can't stand your Daphne. You deserved to be flamed.

What the hell is wrong with you!

Bloody fucking muggle - Petunia - the child abuser - the hating neglecting bitch -! And Harry on amicable terms and actually Harry forgave her!

WELL ... FUCK YOU!

Because the pairing makes me sick and I'd like to know now before I read further, can you please tell me if this is going to have Harry/Ginny?

8 g 1297670400 delete Far too sacred from critics. Anyway, again pure shit. This harry has nothing to aport to this story since it seems all motherfucking characters get the best and the spotlight. He just feels like some shitty sidekick. Pretty much prefer canonHarry to this faggot. I am scared too see thedueling competition, since reading this I think Harry won't be the great dueler he was in canon, shitty spell repertoire or not, he was among the best, if not the best in his fucking school. I am out of here. Enjoy your fail

10 r 1298448000 delete Yay, with each chapter you make Harry look more and more stupid all the time showcasing how much better other students are than him. Curious, that I have yet to see some proper plot or some good character development. As always, you fail

None are particularly 'hurtful'. I don't think I've gotten a review telling me to off myself or anything. But there are some that are 'hurtful' in a different way. Like 'Lego-land' asking if a story clearly makred Harry/Fleur would have a Harry/Ginny action. Do people really expect me to to out of my way to tell them information they have readily accessible in the story tag?

The most hurtful thing, to me, is when someone leaves a review, and I can tell they didn't actually read the text. And it happens way more often than you would expect.
