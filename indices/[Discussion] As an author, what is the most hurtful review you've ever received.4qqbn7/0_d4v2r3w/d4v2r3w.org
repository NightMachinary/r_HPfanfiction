I actually have been lucky enough to be treated very well by the community over that past year, but when I first tried fanfic at the tender age of thirteen (under a different penname that spelt fleurs name wrong), someone went through all 30 something chapters of my fic and left a review on each one. They didn't offer any help. They didn't point out any mistakes or poor writing. They just told me I was worthless and should give up writing, that this was the worst trash they'd ever seen etc. Made my little thirteen year old heart break. I still don't understand why they continued beyond the first few chapters if it was that bad.
