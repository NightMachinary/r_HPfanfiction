Yeah, it did take the wind out of my sails a bit. The weird thing is, they got banned by the mods (it was on Mugglenet), and then like a week later they created a new account to send me a message apologising and saying they didn't realise how young I was. I accepted the apology at the time, but looking back I wish I hadn't because that's a horrible thing to do to anyone, no matter their age.
