I don't think I've ever had a really bad review, at least not that I can remember. My knee jerk reaction to any criticism tends to be "fuck you!" but that only lasts until I beat my pride into submission and consider their words more objectively, and most of them are constructive in some way at least, even if I don't necessarily agree with them.

The only one that I can recall as being particularly useless was a review I got that just said "Very, very poor choice of plot" which left me baffled more than anything. It was put on the first chapter of of 320k fic, and that chapter is 10k long and introduces a couple of plot points, and the summary alone has at least four things that the reviewer could object to so I really have no idea what they disliked so much.
