When I was young late elementary/early middle school I tried to write something. I got a really horrible review and deleted the whole thing. There were actually a couple positive reviews as well. However this reviewer tore my young self a new one about what a horrible person I was for writing such a shitty story about their favorite pairing (Fleur and Bill). That there was so few fics about them my drivel didn't need to be there.
