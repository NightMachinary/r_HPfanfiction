I've been really lucky in that most of my reviewers are wonderful. I always ask for constructive criticism and they can be so sweet and polite.

But....I once became the target of a troll in a fandom other than Harry Potter. I was writing a MimixYamato Digimon fic and this guy made it a point to insult, harass, and demean me on every chapter simply because I shipped MimixYamato and not their preferred MimixIzzy. They not only did this to me, but every other author who shipped that pairing. It was a joke really. And reporting them achieved nothing. So I learned to ignore them. It was simpler that way.

As they say, don't feed the trolls.

I try no to let bad reviews bother me. I know that I can't please everyone and that what I write isn't perfect. Even GRRM and JKR have their critics. So I just let it slide. Unless they harass my reviewers. Then it's on.
