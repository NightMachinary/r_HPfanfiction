Well, I've been incredibly fortunate in the feedback I've received. A lot of eloquent, generous readers have felt comfortable giving their in-depth opinions, mostly because it used to be common, once upon a time, to use comment sections as a springboard to wider character analysis or debates about plot. Also, I'm not a big name and don't attract a ton of readers, so (except for one instance, see below) I've avoided being a target. Probably the worst comment ever addressed directly to me said something along the lines of "what a waste of talent for such a nasty tale," which is almost a compliment. (The fic in question contained major character death, so I'm not surprised some readers were repelled by it.)

The most startling attention ever paid me occurred the day a familiar username went ballistic over our different interpretations of Snape's character and started spamming my journal with obscene, screeching, capslock abuse, including a threat to rip my nipples off. It was incredibly hyperbolic and a bit mentally unbalanced considering how trivial the disagreement was. After creating and deleting multiple pseuds for the sole purpose of berating me and the mod of a fic exchange, they closed their account. It's possible they're still out there under a different pseud, but after that meltdown they've had the decency to leave me alone.
