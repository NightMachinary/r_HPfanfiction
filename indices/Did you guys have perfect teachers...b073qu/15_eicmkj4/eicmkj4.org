I'm Norwegian, though from the relatively middle of nowhere, and here are some highlights of terrible teachers I've had.

*Swimming teacher:* didn't care what level you were at, you were going to do the tasks assigned to you or die trying. Why wasn't he fired? Because the school covered for him on the grounds that there were no other teacher that could teach it. He was finally fired 5 years after I left primary school. To add some context here. I've got a 1/3 lung capacity and he forced me underwater even though I barely made it back up again. Nobody liked him, student or parents.

*Middle School Social science/Geography/History teacher:* Takes whoever explains first's side. No matter the fact that it was 100% illogical.

*Middle School Science/Math teacher:* He taught the A and C groups of Math and English, they averaged your grade between Math and English and put you into a group for it. Now, for the C group he barely did anything. Showcased one example upon entering a new topic and then here's your tasks for the week. He also was pretty biased towards his homeroom class, giving them the benefit of the doubt and even giving them answer sheets of his tests.

Compare that with my GED math teacher last year and we got showcased tasks for the first math class of the week and usually the second to last one as well. Depending on how things went. Odd how most people there got a lot higher grades, which we even saw in that year as we had substitutes and on the test we had there most of us plummeted 2-3 grades. Only one went down 1 grade and he'd been sick for most of that period and doing self study work at home instead.

*High School First Year Economy teacher:* 2 students of 20 managed to do any sort of work after August. Didn't consider showing how to do any problems calling the rest of the class morons. But our class used up the schools goodwill on getting our Norwegian teacher exchanged with another one. Then we get around to April/May, and we get the second year teacher for a while. Suddenly we all understand it while the 2 'prodigies' barely manage to keep up. She stopped teaching the next year. Odd that.

So, does bad teacher = firing, no. But it's definitely something a school should think about. That swimming teacher had had complaints going back to when my oldest sibling was in that school. So it wasn't unknown but the school and possibly the district worked to keep the status quo. I'll note that most people from said district considers it one of the more corrupt ones. Now take from that what you will.
