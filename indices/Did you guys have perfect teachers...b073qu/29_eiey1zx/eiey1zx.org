I think you all forget some rather important distinctions:

Snape in the muggle world would be an ex-con and former member of an terrorist organization. He would never get hired as a teacher. The best he could get is to be hired by the government to be a spy in the terrorist organization.

Umbridge literally tortured students. I honestly doubt parents won't notice scars on their children's hands and not take legal action. Plus you need qualifications to be a teacher and if the government just assigns their leader's secretary to be a teacher there would be a media shitstorm of epic proportions.
