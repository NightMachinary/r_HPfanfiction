I most certainly had my fair share of excellent and horrible teachers, and everything in between. The good ones stick with you, the bad ones you try to forget. I've been out of grade school for over a decade now and what wounds there were have healed.

Some teachers you click with and you have a wonderful, others make a year hell. I could name names and tell stories, but I don't want anyone getting doxed.

One thing that really shaped my school career was how my teachers dealt (or didn't deal) with my learning disabilities. Some teachers would work with me and what I needed, others would say I was making it up. Over the years I learned to advocate for myself and by the time I was 14 and heading off to high school, I had enough confidence in myself, and I knew my parents had enough confidence in me, that I stood up for myself and didn't let teachers (or other students) bully me any more.

But before that? When I was young and very naive? I had a few truly horrible teachers that if I could talk to them today, I'd tell them /exactly/ how I felt.

Did any of the teachers I complained about get fired? No, but they certainly got a ding on their record, and I may have made myself unpopular, but I didn't particularly care. I never got along with the popular kids anyways, and the Anime Club kids were always happy to see me.
