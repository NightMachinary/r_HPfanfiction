I've had a teacher who was worse than Binns. At least Binns drones on about history, whereas that guy just droned on about what went through his head. Once he spent close to an hour telling us how traffic james were giving him anxiety attacks. He also spoke about thrice as slow as a normal person.

He's retired now and "teaches" German to refugees.
