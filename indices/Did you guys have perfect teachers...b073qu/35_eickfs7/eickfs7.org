I've definitely had bad teachers, but none to the level Sanpe or Binns. I've even had "mean" teachers (which I don't think would fly today), but one of the meanest was also one of the most passionate, who organized class trips or held biology lessons outside.

Binns teaching style might be acceptable in an University setting, just reading a script. This of course assuming that Binns is actually conveying all the valuable information that the students need to learn, which is somewhat doubtful.
