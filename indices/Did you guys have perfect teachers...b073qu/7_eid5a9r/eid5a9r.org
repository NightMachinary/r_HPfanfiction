Growing up with HP books, I found all the teachers extremely relatable. I had my fair share of Flitwicks (those were the best), McGonagalls, Lockharts and Binnses. And Snapes, yes. My Technical Drawing teacher (why the fuck did we even have Technical Drawing in highschool?) constantly underscored and picked on me because she was best friends with my aunt's mother-in-law, and that woman hated our side of the family with passion. That resulted in me refusing to put any effort in my work, which fueled her insults even more.

At Uni, we had that one Professor who was extremely knowlegeable and good at her subject, but loved to play favourites at random, and her attitude towards other students ranged from dismissive to outright bullying. Like Snape, she was very well-spoken, sarcastic and could bring students to literal tears with a few contemptuous remarks.

I'm not from the US or Western Europe, and it's extremely hard to get a teacher fired where I'm from, unfortunately. I only know about a computer studies teacher from my former school who had an affair with a 16 y.o and got fired, but then he was hired by another school, got fired again for sending pervy texts to schoolgirls, and now he is teaching in yet another school.

Anyway, I think that having all the teachers at Hogwarts be wholesome and competent and supportive would make for a very boring read, regardless of how realistic/unrealistic it would be.
