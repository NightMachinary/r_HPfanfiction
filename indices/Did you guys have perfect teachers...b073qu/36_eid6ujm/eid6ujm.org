As someone from England and within a few years of Harry's age, PTA influence was well-established at this time. Children don't always appreciate what needs reporting and there were types of bullying and abuse that didn't get addressed properly, but even a a boarding school, quotable insults to pupils or totally unengaging teaching would have been dealt with.
