I can't see a teacher that engaged in targeted harassment not getting fired at least at any of the schools I went to. Nor a teacher that physically abused students the way that Umbridge did.

I've had teachers that were jerks and even some that made kids cry, but what they did was at least connected to the material or classroom behavior. I can't see arbitrary harassment based on personal grievances being tolerated in most instances.

I'm sure there are examples of teachers that bad that have remained employed, but generally I think both of them cross the line.

Binns and Lockhart while both bad, I can see remaining employed at a lot of schools, mostly just depending on how fortunate they were in terms of how their students tested despite their inefficacy.
