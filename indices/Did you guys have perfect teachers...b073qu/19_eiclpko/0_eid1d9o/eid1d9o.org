Targeted harassers absolutely do retain jobs. Ever heard of #metoo? Lol.

But specifically about Harry Potter, Snape's worst behavior was targeted towards Harry and his friends. None of whom ever complained about it. (Can you imagine the Dursleys being like Mr. Snape, please stop mocking our child in class??) Ha. Anyway, all of the worst teacher behavior flew under the radar with the exception of Binns and some of the Defense teachers. We never hear of anyone reporting Umbridge's corporal punishments (and it's outlined that Dumbledore's hands are tied with her anyway) and like I said, Harry and Neville never complained about Snape that we know of, and the rest of his behavior can be justified by lenient administrators as just "strictness" and "loyalty to his house"
