Preach. My kindergarten teacher locked a friend of mine in the closet for dawdling over his assignment, then went to lunch and left him there. (Poor American school district.)

My first grade teacher died, and the substitute was used to teaching fifth grade... and kept trying to feed fifth grade material to first graders (that went well).

The gym teacher screamed in students' faces for the slightest mistake. Not every small child is an elite athlete who is motivated by that... some of us honestly didn't know which order to run around the bases in and burst into tears.

My fourth grade teacher had taught my older brother, hated him, and never hid her disdain for me from day one--- I couldn't possibly be anyone but my brother's clone in her mind.

--------------

Fast forward to my father getting a promotion and my family moving to an elite school district. Every one of those teachers actually was amazing.

--------------

Fast forward to another promotion, another move, and my parents slapping me in a private school.

One teacher was so unable to control the class that she couldn't physically keep the students in the room. They'd just leave and stand in the hall and chat. No one made it stop. Didn't learn much Latin that year...

Another teacher didn't bother to read the AP French syllabus and taught us from the wrong books so we had no chance on the test. I went to college and had to beg the head of the French department to give me a chance at the higher level classes... my test score reflected my not having had the opportunity to read Pierre et Jean, not my inability to understand French.

A third teacher would sit with teenage girls on his lap, hands perilously close to going under their skirts.

And there were some excellent teachers too.
