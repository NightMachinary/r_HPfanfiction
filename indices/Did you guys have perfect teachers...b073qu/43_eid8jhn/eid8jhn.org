I had some great teachers. My music conductor, statistics teacher, and others in high school, and some phenomenal history professors in college.

However, I also had, in senior year of high school, a physics teacher who once walked up behind me in class and whispered in my ear that I should drop his class because I was going to fail anyway, so why bother.

...

I stood up and threw my notebook at him. He sent me to the principal's office where I got one or two weeks detention and a stern talking to. They didn't suspend me because the good teacher had so many complaints, they were aware how much the students hated him. All teachers were one 1 year contracts at my school to allow the school to retain/fire as needed at he end of the year. Suffice to say, he wasn't retained for another year.
