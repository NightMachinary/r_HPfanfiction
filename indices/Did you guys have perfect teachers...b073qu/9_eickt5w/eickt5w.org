My English/French teacher in grade 9 was fired for grabbing students. There was a lot about her that didn't seem right throughout the year but that's officially why she was fired. There was also my grade 7 math teacher (who was not qualified to teach math and gave me 4% on a unit test because I missed the whole unit and he made me write the test anyway) who my class tormented enough that he retired two years later, but... that's different. And my grade 1 teacher who made me do grade 2 work, yelled at me for doing grade 2 work, and generally stressed lil baby me so much that I started chewing on my hair.

Other than them, I had a lot of great teachers, but also a lot of teachers who might have been unprofessional if they weren't so generally likeable. I had teachers who would talk back to the students in the same tone that students would talk back to them, but since it felt like they were playing around, it wasn't hurtful.

Personally, I think Snape is an interesting, flawed character, but I would square up with him if he was real. His â€˜bravery' is commendable, but that doesn't mean that his actions as a teacher are excusable. He should NEVER have been allowed to be around students. So no, I didn't have perfect teachers, but I can say with confidence that the schools I went to would have never allowed that inexcusable behaviour and abuse of students if they had known it was happening.
