I went to a state school in the UK. It was a good school, but still your average comp.

I had some AMAZING teachers. I had some teachers I hated at the time but looking back were excellent. I had a handful of truly awful teachers.

Two stand out in particular. A maths teacher who would put all our test scores on the board and point out I had the lowest every time, enjoyed putting me on the spot and humiliating me on front of the class, And ended up leaving me with a severe anxiety around maths that I still have to this day. Another was an NQ history teacher who was still stuck in her cool girl phase. I was good at history but for some reason she just took a personal dislike to me and would make up rules to punish me, isolate me from the class, just generally be rude. By this point I was older so didn't care as much - it actually became a running joke in my class. I remember once she stormed out for no apparent reason and someone just quitely went "god flo, how could you do that." She always gave me low grade and then one day she had a go at me for something stupid and I just walked out. Went straight to my head of sixth and said "I am not being taught by her anymore, move me to another class." He did, and then my grades shot up and I went on to do history at uni.

The thing is, both of those teachers have gone on to advance in their careers. I know both of them had complaints put against them, but in general they performed well in observed lessons and got their students through the exams. It's hard to sack a teacher, and to be honest a vast majority of complaints are probably from the parents of absolute nightmare children who feel they are being treated unfairly but aren't. When I look back, yes my maths teacher was unfair, but I never paid attention and frequently didn't do my homework. My history teacher, by all accounts, was popular in the staff room and helped a friend of mine out through a really difficult time.

Then of course we had absentee teachers. My drama teacher used to frequently not turn up, so we taught ourselves. I know she was put under disciplinary action but at the end of the day she had mental health issues and strong union representation.

The only teacher I knew to get fired was my form tutor, Mr cooper. Oh Mr cooper, you were not meant for teaching. Who knows what the final straw was for you? Maybe it was when your students turned up to the exam and realised they had been studying for the wrong paper, so all but two of them failed. Maybe it was the complaints that instead of teaching them, you just put Shrek on. Not once, but several times a term. Maybe it was when the head teacher expressly told you that you could not take your students on a school trip, but you secretly did so anyway, taking them white water rafting without any insurance. Maybe it was because you left one of them there.

Whatever it was I hope you are living it up on that cruise ship you work on now.
