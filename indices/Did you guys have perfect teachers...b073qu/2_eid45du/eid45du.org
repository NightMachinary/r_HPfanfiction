Okay, let's try to analyze this realistically (at least from a middle class American perspective).

Binns is a parody of the coach who's required to teach /something/, so he teaches history. He lectures straight from the book, and no one really learns anything. I had one like that who was actually fairly engaging, but he also literally gave us the answers to the tests under the guise of a "study guide," and he wasn't the only teacher in the school who did that. Realistic, except that he should have been forcibly retired when he died on general principle. Muggle schools tend to have pretty strict retirement ages.

Lockhart is a fraud who didn't know the material. His students might think he's entertaining during the school year, in a muggle school, he would have been fired after his first year after half his students flunked the standardized tests. Realistic inasmuch as he probably wouldn't have been fired before the year was up.

Umbridge is a career bureaucrat who has the +school board and mayor+ Ministry on her side and is strictly teaching to the curriculum. She is a symptom, not the disease. In the muggle world, she'd get letters of complaint, but she wouldn't get sacked until and unless her actual crimes came out. Realistic in the larger context of the corruption going all the way to the top.

Snape is very intelligent, but not good at teaching, and appears not to like teaching or children. In the muggle world, a chemistry teacher with his accident rate would have been fired or forced to change subjects, but that might not be a fair comparison to Potions class. Insulting his students, verbally abusing them, making them cry, ignoring Hermione's need for medical attention in Book 4. All that might have gotten him some letters, but probably wouldn't be enough to fire him, unless some kid recorded him ranting, and it went viral. Unfair punishments, if they could be proved, might get him a reprimand, and if they happened often enough and went on long enough, it might be enough to push him over the edge, but that would be a hard sell. So...honestly, borderline, but not for the usual reasons.

Trelawney is half-faking it, but in a subject so subjective that it might as well be Art by muggle standards, so it's hard to judge her there. However, she is also a drunk, and that would /definitely/ get her in trouble and plausibly fired, so I'm going with unrealistic on this one.

Hagrid's safety record is...probably not as bad as it's made out to be. In fact, it's probably /better/ than Kettleburn's, who was constantly on probation. However, he's not fully qualified, so in a muggle school, he never would have been higher in the first place. Unrealistic, but for a different reason than usual.

I think the real complaint here is that Hogwarts is supposed to be the best school of magic in the world, but with teachers like these teaching core classes, it sure doesn't feel like it is. An world-renowned private boarding school that strives for excellence ought to be able to get a full set of good teachers, and Hogwarts looks to be struggling on that count.
