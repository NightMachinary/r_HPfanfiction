Well, I had a hallucinating History teacher, a French teacher who was barely more alive than Binns, an English teacher who was afraid of everything, especially his students, and a manipulative psychopath of a Theater teacher who had sex with his students on the girls' loo, where he got caught by a fifth-grader and fled to Ecuador. At university, I've had a lecturer who is pretty much Snape.

Edit: I forgot about the biology teacher who kept his tonsils in a jar.

On the positive side, no Dark Lords or their genocidal followers.
