I think we're expecting higher standards out of "the greatest wizarding school in the world" that was at the time being run by one of the greatest wizards to ever live.

Being a high-school teacher in the real world is basically a completely shitty job where you work too much, you make too little, and you don't get thanked for it. Usually. It's not that there are no good parts, but overall it's pretty bad.

Hogwarts professors I basically /have/ to be a prestigious position, there's only like a dozen of them. A dozen, for several countries.
