A fifth grade teacher in my school in Michigan was fired for bullying and verbally abusing kids. A history teacher in my first high school was fired after grabbing a student and hitting them upside the head. Teachers and students *did* speak up. What makes you think Dumbledore would have listened to people speaking out against Snape? Snape was a useful tool.

I never had a teacher threaten to poison my pet. I never had a teacher insult my appearance. I never had a teacher refuse to help after seeing a student assaulted (fights were frequent in my middle and high school). My teachers never threw away my work in front of me refusing to grade it because they didn't like me.

None of my teachers were perfect. That doesn't mean Snape didn't have abusive behaviors when it came to the /children/ that were under his care.
