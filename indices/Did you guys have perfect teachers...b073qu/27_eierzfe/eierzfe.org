Did I have teachers who obviously played favourites? Definitely. But abuse would never be tolerated at any of my schools. One teacher inadvertently humiliated one of my classmates when she failed an assessment and he was given a talking to and she was allowed to retake the internal, even though she had failed of her own fault. One of my friends was kicked out of a club for cursing out the teachers, but it was the teachers who were reprimanded for kicking her out in a rude and unprofessional way. Once my school got so many complaints about one teacher's incompetence that he was demoted to a relieving position the next year. Another was reprimanded by the deputy principal for ruining kids shoes by making them run in the mud and rain.

These are not everyday occurrences of course, but it gives you an idea about the standard teachers are held to at my schools. They are very nice public schools but certainly not the nation's best, which Hogwarts is meant to be.

Relating this back to the teachers - Hagrid and Snape would have been sacked for child endangerment and abuse, respectively. Now that I think of it, Hooch would be investigated for her recklessness with flying lessons. Fake Moody too, for performing Unforgivables in front of kids. Trelawney and Binns would depend on what kind of grades their student were getting over the years.

Obviously wizards aren't strong in administration or legislation at all, so Hogwarts would never be as strict as Muggle schools in the first place. But I was definitely disturbed by how much teachers got away with in HP just in the context of my own experiences.
