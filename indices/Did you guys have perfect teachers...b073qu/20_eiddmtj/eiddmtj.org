Perfect? No. But my parents went on a warpath for issue with teachers that are trivial compared to what Hogwarts gets on a regular basis.

(I mean, I doubt anyone at Hogwarts has ever heard of an IEP)

Hell, I opted out of standardized testing due to philosophical issues with them. Somehow I don't see "This is stupid I'm not going to do it and I'll get my lawmaker to back me up" working at Hogwarts....

Well maybe if you are a snake...
