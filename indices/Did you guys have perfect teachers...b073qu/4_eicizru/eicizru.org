I had one music teacher/musical director who was a hardass, and while he never yelled or physically touched any student, he was a tough critic who singled out the slower students to the point of bullying. He had favorites and encouraged kids to critique each other, as harsh as possible, "because that's how you learn". This teacher was never disciplined because he was very talented and nurtured/coached his favorite kids into winning competitions, and they said that he was a decent guy once he winnowed out the uncommitted.

However, that was many years ago. If you take educational training courses for secondary education in this day and age, you'll have to go through seminars, background checks, workshops, conferences, and progress evaluations. If you don't deliver outcomes on a yearly basis, you will have superiors breathing down your neck. You will have parents making an outcry for little to no reason, like their kid not getting a form signed is /your/ fault. You will have coworkers side-eyeing you because if you don't have tenure or seniority, poor outcomes lead to being shoved off at the end of a year, to a worse school district filled with problem kids.

The difference between fictional magic boarding school and modern day schools is, imho, parental involvement. In fiction, parents and authorities need to be kept out of the way to allow kids to have adventures. IRL, child safety is the top priority, parents believe their child is a snowflake, and treat them as children at 17-18, when in magical society, a wizard or witch would be considered a full-fledged adult.
