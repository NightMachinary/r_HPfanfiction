I am not a secondary school teacher, but as far as I'm aware in the US the performance you have to deliver is mostly standardized test scores, not meeting some measure of engaging lessons and being nice to students. I'm not /that/ old, so definitely there were helicopter parents and snowflake kids when I attend high school, and yet the bad teachers stayed.

I think a lot of it has to do with parental expectations. Maybe if the kid whines that their geometry teacher sucks, the parent is like "yeah so did mine, so what?"

Likewise, any student owling home about Snape's "teaching" methods would be met with a "yeah, potions is hard sweetie, Slughorn didn't really teach either back in my day"
