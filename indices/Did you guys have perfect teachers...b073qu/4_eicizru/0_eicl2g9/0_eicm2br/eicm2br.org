Standardized tests are just a minimum of performance in some areas. Living in any place where the number of positions at "good" schools is tiny in proportion to the number of people with degrees in education will cause schools to be very picky about filling places. People can be replaced easily, the market is competitive, which is hugely different to the wizarding world, which has a limited population, of that, few academics and scholars capable and willing to be teachers.

Hogwarts' lenience on the quality of its teachers has a lot to do with how difficult it is to fill vacant positions. The DADA position has eaten through its teachers since 1957 (34 professors at the start of Harry's first year), and how many other people could teach Potions, other than Snape, Slughorn, and possibly Dumbledore himself?

That's one of the issues I see with people and Fix-It fics applying modern standards and logic to the wizarding world of the 1990's. The circumstances and situation are totally different. Have parents send letters to Dumbledore and Snape about the teacher professionalism, and they just read them and do nothing about it, because what else can they do?
