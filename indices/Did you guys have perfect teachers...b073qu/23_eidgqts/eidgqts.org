I never had a teacher anything like Snape or Binns. It never even occurred to me that there was meant to be something realistic about them, or Lockhart or Umbridge. It wouldn't even make sense to have those characters act that way in a fic trying to be realistic. Lots of the Wizarding world doesn't make sense though, so eh.
