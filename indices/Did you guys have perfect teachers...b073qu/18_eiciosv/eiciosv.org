I have a theory about why people despise Snape so much. Think about the who average Harry Potter fan is. Western, attending school when the series was coming out, nerdy. And what happens to nerdy kids at school? They get bullied. And it's not just the nerdy ones -- lots of kids get bullied or do the bullying, and then feel guilty about it.

So this means that bullying is a subject that is not only extremely relatable to the average HP fan, but often touchy as well. Especially when perpetrated by a teacher -- someone in a position of authority who is supposed to prevent the bullying in the first place.

But, let's take a look at other things Snape did. Like, betray a homicidal megalomaniac /to his face/. Snape could have been captured, brutally tortured, and killed at any time during at least several years. He played a desperate role and arguably, without him, Harry, Hermione, and Ron would have lost the war and been brutally tortured and killed themselves.\\
You'd think that would carry more weight than they bullying. Especially since Snape was bullied himself -- bullied so much, in fact, that Sirius nearly killed him /as a joke/. Funny, huh?

But, here's the problem. Who actually experienced that? Who was almost murdered by their bully in school? And who faced a Voldemort, tricking him, while knowing their death was only inches away? Who sacrificed their life for a memory? No one. And so Snape's positive contributions -- while extremely impactful from a plot perspective -- are absolutely unrelatable. While his negative contribution carries so much more weight because it's something lots of people personally went through.

Tl;dr People relate more strongly to things they've personally experienced, therefore bullying carries more weight than winning a war/facing a death eater.
