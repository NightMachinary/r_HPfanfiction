Sirius was 16, so not exactly a child. By that age, teenagers generally understand that sending a classmate to be mauled by a deadly beast is unacceptable, even if you really don't like said classmate. Making children miserable is a shitty behaviour, but not really comparable to a murder attempt.

Also I don't think Snape was trying to expell Remus for being sick specifically, he clearly didn't know about him being a werewolf, or why would he knowingly go inside the Shrieking Shack on a full moon? It's Sirius's actions that would cause Remus's expulsion or even execution if Snape was killed or turned.

I love Sirius as a character, but what he did was inexcusable, especially since he clearly didn't feel any kind of remorse afterwards.
