You are actually wrong on this one. Snape actually did know that Remus is a werewolf and tried to get him executed by going to the Shrieking Shack at full moon. James actually saved Snape's life by preventing him. Dumbledore knew this and basically gave Snape a warning.

Snaps was already a bigoted bully in his Hogwarts years. Why do you think Lily stop being friends with him?
