Sorry, I remembered it wrong. As you said, Sirius lured Snape to the Shrieking Shack.

  Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree-trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life.

As to how Snape knew:

  ‘What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?' demanded Snape. His colour rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. ‘What's Potter got to do with anything?' said Lily. ‘They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?' ‘He's ill,' said Lily. ‘They say he's ill --'

  ‘Every month at the full moon?' said Snape.

  ‘I know your theory,' said Lily, and she sounded cold. ‘Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?'

  ‘I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.'

  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.

  ‘They don't use Dark Magic, though.' She dropped her voice. ‘And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there --'

Through this conversation, there is no way Snape didn't figure out Remus is a werewolf if Hermione figured it out in third year.

I do agree with you that the Marauders weren't exactly beacons of perfection though.

Snape didn't exactly wanted Remus executed, but he did want to expose him. I think the execution was sort of my own deduction, since considering that Buckbeak was to be executed for attacking Malfoy, if Remus actually did bite Snape Remus would most definitely be executed.
