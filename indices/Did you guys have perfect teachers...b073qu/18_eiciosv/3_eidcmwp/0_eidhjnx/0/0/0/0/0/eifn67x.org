But that conversation was obviously after the Shrieking Shack incident, so of course Snape knew at that point. Though he might have had his suspicions before. And Snape's resentment in this scene is totally understandable. He was almost killed, but it was completely swept under the rug, and everybody continued to think that the Marauders were such great guys. That situation was probably one of the big reasons that contributed to Snape becoming a DE.

Anyway, this is why I mostly avoid reading fics set in the Marauders era altogether. If they aren't justifying every bad decision Snape ever made, they are spinning the Marauders (usually minus Peter) as the greatest group of friends ever who did nothing wrong, and that dirty Snivellous totally asked for it anyway. Yes, Snape was an aspiring Death Eater, and yes, the Marauders were cruel bullies. Two wrongs don't make a right
