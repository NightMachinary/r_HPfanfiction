Did he really? Where in the books is it said that Snape knew about Lupin beforehand? And how

would even work?

He was just generally snooping around to get the Marauders in troube (can you blame him, after after seeing how they bullied him in the Snape's Worst Memory?) and Sirius dropped how to get through the Whomping Willow. For a laugh. James saving Snape from the situation his friends created and that would cause them great trouble otherwise wasn't that noble of a deed, but a thing any person with an ounce of a common sense who is not a psychopath would do. Especially since James as an animagus wasn't in danger of Remus himself.

Lily stopped being friends with Snape because of calling her a Mudblood, and generally heading down the wrong path. We don't know about him bullying anyone in his Hogwarts days, beyond retaliating to the Marauders. Nothing in what he did at that point justified trying to kill him. And let's be honest here, the Marauders didn't bully Snape for his bigotry. They started it from the moment they laid eyes on Snape when they were 11, and it escalated from there.
