That's a good point. Snape is a complex character. But it's incredibly common to see any type of analysis be focused on the bullying aspect of his character -- often at the expense of others. Which always puzzled me.

But then I thought about it from a perspective of emotional distance. People relate more strongly to events they've personally experienced. And while many have been confronted by bullying, few can claim the hardships Snape lived through. So naturally, the bullying is assigned a higher gravity. It's a subconscious decision rooted in the inherent safety and comfortability of our lives, where the largest “danger” often comes from a bully in the school yard.
