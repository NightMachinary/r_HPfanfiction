Ugh sounds like my middle school principal. Came up to me in the cafeteria and ran his hands through my hair (which was very long). He said, “Ooh, what are we going to do with all this lovely hair?” And I shouted, “/You/ can let go of it!” A few students were surprised that I shouted at the principal. But that was the end of that.
