Psht my high school had worse teachers. We had the creepy math teacher who kept touching girls' arms and complimenting our blouses, and the misogynistic vice principal who learned the boys' names but never bothered learning the girls' names. He just gave us “cute” nicknames. And also touched and complimented us a LOT.

“BuT tHeY wErE bEiNg FrieNDLy! YOu shOuLD feEL coMPLimenTED!!1!” No, trolls; they were specifically treating students differently based on gender, and behaving in a way that emphasized their dominance over our bodies. Not one of the male students had this discomfort. Every one of the female students did. And we didn't know what could be done about it.
