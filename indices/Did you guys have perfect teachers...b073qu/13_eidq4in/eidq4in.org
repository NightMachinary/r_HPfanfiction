Eh, the teachers are all fine barring Snape and Umbridge, who are both kept in the books for purely political reasons.

The rest of the teachers are relatable, and hell, even Umbridge /in the classroom/ is relatable (her detentions are another story entirely).

Comparing Snape and the detentions of Umbridge to real teachers in the 90s? Those two would have been fired extremely quickly. Snape probably wouldn't have been hired in the first place, being an ex-con with a poor disposition.
