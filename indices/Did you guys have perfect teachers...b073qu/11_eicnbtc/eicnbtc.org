Honestly, people on this subreddit have some unreal standards for all manner of things. Whenever anything falls short of these ideal utopian heights, they're all up in arms. I don't know if it's because they're that idealistic or just insanely sheltered.

They rail about how bad Snape is, but compared to some IRL teachers that I've heard of, Snape is pretty tame.

I can count at least 3-4 teachers from school and college who were exactly the same as Binns - they'd just drone on and on and have next to minimal interactions with the class.

I've had teachers who were more or less like Lockhart in the way that they had no idea what the hell they were doing.

I've had teachers take two hour long lectures on topics (stuff that I painstakingly took notes for) only to announce at the end of class that that stuff is out of syllabus and was just something interesting. I've had points deducted from me for challenging (challenging in as polite a manner as I could anyway) chemical names of compounds. I've had teachers who'd show up drunk/drank on the job. And the teachers who made girls cry with snide remarks, there were enough of those.

Granted I don't think I've ever had anyone as bad as Umbridge, but I have read about similar cases in the newspapers. By similar, I don't mean punishing students to carve themselves up - I mean punishing students so harshly that they faint and so on.

At the same time, I've had some absolutely brilliant teachers as well.
