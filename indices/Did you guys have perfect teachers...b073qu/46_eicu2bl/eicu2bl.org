My teachers were far from perfect, skill wise. But none of them would have ever dared call us dunderheads like Snape, nevermind single out people to bully them or god forbid, give preferential treatment to certain students; and nobody was as blatantly incompetent as Binns (people sleeping in class) or Trelawney (failing to notice students passing complete bullshit for homeworks) who wasn't actually sacked within one year of teaching.

  Surely one of the more loving teachers or students would have spoken up??

We actually spoke up all the damn time. Which is why and how the incompetents were made to fuck off. The administration didn't want students making their lives hell with protests and student strikes.
