  Look, I had the privilege to grow up in what's considered one of the best American school districts. Nevertheless, I had teachers who I would rank right along with Snape and Binns. But but but--Snape ABUSES the kids! Surely one of the more loving teachers or students would have spoken up?? Yeah, and my geometry teacher happily targeted and tormented kids in class and made them cry on a regular basis. Did any of us go running to the principal? Not that I'm aware. As far as I know, she carried on like this until retirement at a ripe old age.

Hear, hear - except I went to a good school in the UK. Some of my teachers were so bad that I (who had been one of the targeted kids) promptly had a nervous breakdown within six months of leaving the place.

Main difference is that we /did/ complain to the head about these things - and were brushed under the carpet for our troubles.
