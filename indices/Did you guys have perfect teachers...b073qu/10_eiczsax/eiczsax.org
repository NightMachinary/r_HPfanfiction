During my teacher training I had the wonderful joy of being paired with a teacher, who reminded me of Snape. He insulted students, he screamed, he had high expectations of students but told them in the same breath that they couldn't reach them, he was a ticking time bomb (no warnings just straight to shouting), he clearly hated his job and the students.

He hated me even more because the students liked and prefered me (very easy to do just be nice, treat them as human beings and don't mock them when they have problems following). This man sat in the back of my lessons and loudly mumbled how shit my lessons were and that I was teaching the students wrong things. Which confused the kids and made them scared of participating in my lessons as the man was a ticking time bomb and they were trying to protect me from his wrath.

Well he once mentioned in the staff room that he would gladly hit his children at home so I called child services on him and they followed up with a check up, especially because his children's teacher said that his daughter once mentioned that her father would hit her. When they asked him questions he lost his temper and now has to do anti-aggression training. They also spread doubt on him being allowed to teach.
