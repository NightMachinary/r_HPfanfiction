I mean, no, like everyone, I had some crappy teachers over the course of my educational career--- one got fired, though it was for sheer incompetence more than anything else, and one I think did cross the line between strict teaching and turning her classroom into her own personal dictatorship. But if anybody reached the level of cartoonish villainy Snape did, yes, they would've been dismissed eventually. It's a pretty big strike against Dumbledore that he let this go on for years without batting an eyelash--- God knows Snape is the last person you should stick in a job that involves teaching children.
