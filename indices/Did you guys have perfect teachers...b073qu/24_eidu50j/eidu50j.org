Binns is boring. A lot of School Teachers, to kids, seem like Binns, or mostly just read verbatim from the Textbook, I had a few of those. Snape and Trelawney, as well as Hagrid are the ones that would be sacked in a real school, as he never teaches the Health and Safety. Not a pair of Magical Goggles, some kind of Chemical-proof enchanted Lab Robes, Gloves, Proper safety procedures, and he'd fail a CRB check.

Trelawney is pissed as a newt in class. That'd = instantly fired.

Hagrid didn't Graduate School. Wouldn't be allowed to hold a Teaching Post. That, and his idea of Safety is "What's safe for Hagrid" as he's fucking huge and could punch out the Troll from the first book, not "What's safe for students" and well... his illegal breeding for the Skrewts.

McGonagall isn't a bad teacher, after Flitwick and Dumbledore she's probably the best one we see, she's a shit head of house because she holds too many positions and can't properly give her house the support they need. You'd want her as a Teacher, just not as your head of house.
