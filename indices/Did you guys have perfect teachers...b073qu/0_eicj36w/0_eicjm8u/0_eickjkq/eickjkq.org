  You didn't study for your NEWTs, but it doesn't matter!

I always assumed that OWLs and NEWTs were exempt from Dumbledore's "no end of year exams" declaration; only because the school doesn't set them. An outside testing board comes in and proctors the exams. In particular, cancelling OWLs messes with the 5th year students because they need to get certain grades to move on to NEWT level classes the next year. NEWTs create a different problem in that most professions appear to require NEWTs in certain subjects; but it'd be much more feasible to just postpone NEWTs, whereas postponing or cancelling OWLs creates more logistical problems.
