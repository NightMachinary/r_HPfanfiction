I wouldn't it put it past Dumbles to do that to graduating students if he thought it was worth it. He hired Lockhart and condemned an entire year of students to his teaching, after all. If he cancelled the exams at school, the students would still have the opportunity to arrange their own exams with the Ministry.

  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that â€˜there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.
