My dad is a high school teacher. Wanna know a secret? 16 year olds aren't nearly as subtle as they think they are when they're trying to derail the lecture and get the teacher to tell a story. He knows and he fuckin scheduled it into the lesson plan.

He loves being an entertainer and having an audience to brag about his family or tell tales about whatever bullshit he can imagine. He claims he's teaching them to fact-check but really he just thinks it's amusing if a kid is stupid enough to tell another teacher that blinker fluid needs to be replaced every 12-16 months or it can corrode the flux capacitor.
