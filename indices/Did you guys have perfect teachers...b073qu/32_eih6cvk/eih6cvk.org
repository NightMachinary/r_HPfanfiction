Binns was the boring teacher. We all had those.

Snape was the bully who failed his life so took it on children. We probably all had a Snape.

Lockhart was purely incompetent, we all had those.

But I never had a teacher who forced me to mutilate my hand cause I insulted the ministry. So I think that those kind of teacher would have been fired.
