You know, people might also say that Snape didn't actually teach. My counter argument is that there's nothing much to teach except the basics. And, we didn't really see the basics in the book because: • We only got to see the first class in the book • It might have been in the text. Or some other reason.

Secondly, as [[/u/evolutionista][u/evolutionista]] referred to Slughorn, I'll give my views on his and Snape's teaching methods.

Slughorn asked them to identify the potions to get the class interested, and then told them to brew the Draught of Living Death,( if I remember correctly, a very difficult potion) out of the book.

~Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. ~

He gave no advice, as far as we can see, to anybody.

Snape, though he didn't ask them to identify the potions, held their attention and interest with a lecture. (And some snide remarks. They were interesting for me because I just love sarcasm. Maybe not interesting for Harry, sadly.) Anyway, he gave instructions on the board, most likely modified, as he didn't make them refer to the text. He also helped students, directly for Slytherins, and indirectly by ridicule for the rest. Though he did take the ridicule a bit far, that's not my point.

So...yeah. Sorry, it's too long.
