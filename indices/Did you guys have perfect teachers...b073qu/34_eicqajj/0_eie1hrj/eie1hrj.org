Wasn't brewing Draught of the Living Death part of a competition? I don't think he would've helped anyone then. Not to mention Slughorn elaborated on each of the potions after they'd been identified, though it was more about their properties than how to make them:

  “Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room--oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . .

  “It's liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”

  The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.

  “Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off. ”

  “Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.

  “Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally. . . ”

  “Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.

  “Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days. ”

Slughorn was encouraging to his students, and liberal with praise - if a bit concerningly generous with the kind/amount of information he gave out. His first class was several times more engaged than we ever see with Snape. If he wasn't so negligent and biased against students like Ron (especially when he sat right between two of his most-praised students - Harry and Hermione) he could have been stellar.
