We only saw Slughorn teach at the highest levels, though. By that point, all the students in the class had demonstrated mastery of the basics in their OWL exam, and he was preparing them for even more rigorous testing.

If one were to compare Potions to something like chemistry, then at that level I would expect some degree of lecturing, a lot of assigned reading and perhaps at-home exercises and prep work, and then an in-class lab (or in-class potion, in this case) that was largely unassisted by the instructor, the results of which would constitute a significant portion of the grade.

It's not really fair to compare Slughorn's approach to teaching advanced students to Snape's approach to teaching novice students. That said, I think we agree that in terms of classroom management, Snape maintained a much more hostile climate and favored humiliation and terror as a disciplinary and instructional tool. They both played favorites, but Slughorn favored individual merit (even over family connections and wealth) and rewarded successful students with his attention and networking opportunities and simply withheld his good favor from less promising pupils, while Snape empowered his preferred bullies and personally relished terrorizing the “easy targets,” and was equally indifferent to the education of disfavored students whether they were academically gifted like Hermione or struggling like Neville.
