You're incredibly delusional if you think a teacher like Snape wouldn't be fired in the real world.

Since you listed Umbridge I'll assume you're thinking she wouldn't be fired either. I'm sure she's a wonderful teacher - you just have to get past the fact she tortured children and didn't actually do her job.

People keep forgetting, Snape was not a good teacher; everyone just loved Alon Rickman.
