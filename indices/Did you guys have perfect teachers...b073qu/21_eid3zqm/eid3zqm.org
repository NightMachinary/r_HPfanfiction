I can think of a few resigning under duress. Two did, well, unspeakable things - one on premises and the other elsewhere. The others simply didn't deliver on exam results. I was one of the resident music nerds and got burned by this something fierce. Being told that your head of department lost the demo CD that everyone said you should be really proud of on the day of the deadline leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste. My younger brothers shared several mishaps under those teachers, to boot. I don't blame the department, though: it was woefully underfunded and chronically short-staffed. Schools don't care about the arts, etc.

Many of the teachers were unprofessional in their dealings with pupils, i.e. outright bullying some while showing favouritism to others, among a number of other unseemly behaviours that I shan't name. But many more were polite, forthcoming, and driven to motivate others in the subject they loved.
