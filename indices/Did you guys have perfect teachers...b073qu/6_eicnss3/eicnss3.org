Snape is a special case. While I don't know if it's canon or not, it's almost certain that he hated the job and never wanted to teach in first place. He remains because Dumbledore and the Dark Lord demanded it of him for spying reasons. Hell, it's possible that he /had/ to act the way he did because the alternative would lead to uncomfortable confrontations from the Dark Lord.

(A saner Tom would have recognized the value in the spy being a more pleasant person as being more convincing to the other side. Then again, a saner Tom would likely have realized Sev's duplicity).
