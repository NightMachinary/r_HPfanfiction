The argument that you shouldn't complain because others have also had it bad, and you might have had it bad when you were a kid and YOU didn't complain is a tired and incorrect one.

Firstly, fanfiction is and always has been written as a desire to fix things or alter things or even just exist in the space that the writer enjoys. It's not unrealistic to want the things that you see that are fixable to be fixed.

Secondly, sure, they're good characters to read about. But they're also laughably bad at their jobs, some of them, and it's not some slur on the face of the original author of the whole book series to say that. I mean, the tv show Pete and Pete had the same constructs--nearly every adult in the entire series was laughably bad at something, and it was usually their jobs.

I went to a terrible school district. It was in a shit poor neighborhood and when I was 18 and had a job if I missed the bus my mom had to come get me because none of my coworkers dared drive there at night. Our superintendent let really terrible ideas through in a vain attempt to make things better, and one of the results was that in sixth grade, every student was placed in a class based on their prior grades, with all the 'best' kids in one class, so on and so forth through five homerooms. They didn't make this a secret, and it did a lot of damage to the psyches of the kids who did their best and were still in the 'worst' homeroom. They didn't even give the 'best' class students one of the worst teachers, and they were the only class of the five that got to do animal dissections.

Your point is somewhat valid--regular schools allow terrible teachers to teach. It's not unheard of. But a cinematic and literary universe doesn't *have* to follow those rules, and fanfiction certainly does not.
