I agree with all your points so I suspect we are talking past each other. I absolutely agree no one should stand for or remain silent about sub-par teaching. I'm just pointing about that it's /realistic/ for bad teachers to remain employed and so by removing bad teachers from your fic, you are "fixing" things for Hogwarts students, but you are not increasing the realism like some think under the logic that any /realistically/ competent school would remove bad teachers immediately.
