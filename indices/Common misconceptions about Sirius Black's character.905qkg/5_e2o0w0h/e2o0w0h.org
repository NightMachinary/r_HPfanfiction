Since he's a pretty shadowy character in canon it's hard to say how he could be misconstrued; it's all up for fanon grabs really and you should write him as you see him. If you think a characterisation of him is 'off' just don't write him that way. Personally I think he was a bit of a mess and very close to the edge but that isn't altogether canon although there are hints that he wasn't very stable.
