When I posted this I had tumblr!Sirius in mind. He is a sugar high, energetic and whiny man child that spews idiotic crap out of his mouth, always staring at girls and being entirely non-caring of his problems. I mean that Sirius and the Sirius who sent Snape down the Whomping Willow are different people. So I was wondering if the example I provided was possible back then.
