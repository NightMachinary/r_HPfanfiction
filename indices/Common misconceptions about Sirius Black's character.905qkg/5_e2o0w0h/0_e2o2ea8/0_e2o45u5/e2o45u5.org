I really hate the Tumblr! Sirius that I've seen in Fanon. Cheapens one of JK's complicated characters.

Sirius is reckless and has a problem with authority, though he does obey Dumbledore enough to side with Snape at the end of GOF. He's a bit moody and there's definitely some damage that Azkaban wrought on him, but not so much as what we expect of Azkaban. His very redeeming quality is the sheer loyalty he has towards James and therefore Harry.

He's also a treasure trove of knowledge about Voldemort and Death Eaters as we learn most of it from his mouth in GoF and OotP.

He joined the Order when he was very young and thus sees Harry as eligible to fight too, something that Molly cannot accept. She didn't fight when she was younger so she can't understand why Sirius supports Harry in that decision. He's a very able fighter as seen in OotP (his duelling is incredible if you've read that part)

And he definitely has skeletons in his closet that he never got to properly deal with.
