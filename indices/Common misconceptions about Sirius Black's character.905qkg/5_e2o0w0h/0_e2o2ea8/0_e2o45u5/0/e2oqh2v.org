One thing I find interesting about Sirius is him being a much more physical fighter. He pushes people out of the way and when Harry is in danger in OotP, his instinct isn't to fight but rather, to get Harry and Neville out of the way. He pulls Harry out of the way of the fighting, and when he see's Tonks topple from her fight with Bellatrix, Sirius tells Harry to take Neville and run before going after Bellatrix himself. Sirius is deeply protective as a person; loyalty is paramount to him, making him running away from home a wonderful contradiction because what would it take to break the bond of someone who is that loyal.
