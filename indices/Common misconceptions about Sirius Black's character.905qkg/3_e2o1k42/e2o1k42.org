Hard to say. I will seperate this into the reasonably certain aspects of his character and the speculated or outright wrong.

Reasonably Certain:

- Sirius was good looking, though take it with a grain of salt from Harry's viewpoint.
- Azkaban did affect him somewhat, though clearly not as much as you would expect given what we know about the place.
- He has some dog-like traits.
- Even before Azkaban, Sirius was a very reckless person (see November 1st 1981).

Speculated:

- Azkaban unhinged Sirius significantly. His recklessness was because of that and not how he was before.
- Sirius became more dog-like /because/ he became an animagus. This dovetails with the ideas that James and Peter changed after 5th year as well due to the animagus transforamtion.
- He was a ladies man. Possible, but not nearly enough evidence. He never gives Harry "girl advice."
- He didn't hold a grudge against Moony for the situation with Harry, or Dumbledore. Who knows? Maybe he yelled at Dumbledore the first time he went to speak with him in PoA.
