That's because romance and love are pretty much censored to a G rating in the series. Hundreds of teenagers, a giant castle and less than 15 adults. It would be sex everywhere, all the time, with very few exceptions. Just imagine the kinky use of magic and replace common sense with the horny teenagers, and it's a wonder teenage pregnancy was not rampant.
