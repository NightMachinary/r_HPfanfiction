Idk about mosconceptions but I despise the Tumblr/fanon Sirius you see a lot. My biggest thing about him is that he is 100% not okay,not at all. The level really depends on the writer but he's been through some horrible and tramautic years/decades.

He comes out of Hogwarts at 17 to become an auror where he fights on the frontlines of a war, (his brother dies on the other side); he loses all his friends/family in one night to betrayal and murder; he is then /wrongly/ imprisoned for 12 years where he endures daily forms of phsycological torture and physical stress; he then spends years on the run from the law.

At the very least he has some form of PTSD.

Edit:

Even as a teen I don't see him as a 'happy, go lucky' kind of guy. Given his family, I would think he would probably be more angsty, combined with being very stubborn it makes him reckless. I think the recklessness is born out of his stubborness (i.e., His need to help/look after Harry in OoTP leads him to the DoM) rather than the variations of oblivious!teen you often see. In actuality, I think his humour masks his anger, born out of a need for laughter than a proclivity for it.

He's also intelligent, not just at magic or schoolwork but in general and after his stint in Azkaban he has wisened a bit as well. In GoF he has a many poignant observations in the curiosities surrounding Crouch/Bertha/Death Eater/TriWizard Tournament mess- the chapter *Padfoot Returns*. He's not oblivious or blind to much, (he's /biased/ against Snape) only restricted in what he knows.

I could go on forever about Sirius haha, but I'll leave it there.
