Most characterizations I see of him either portray him as flamboyant and overexcited or constantly in a depressive state. Neither of them fit the way he is characterized in the books. Sirius was obviously someone with a lot of issues - reckless, moody, angry, impulsive, etc. JK Rowling referred to him as being in a state of arrested development after being put in Azkaban at 22. You can see this in his relationship with Harry where he seems to be more interested in recreating his dynamic with James rather than being the father figure Harry needs. Despite all of this, I think Sirius is one of the most interesting and complex characters in the books. He has an immense loyalty to his friends because he was not born with people loving and caring about just for being himself. He isn't used to that type of unconditional love. He created his own family with the Marauders (which mirrors how Harry found a family in Hermione and Ron). I think he's incredibly charismatic and obviously very quick-thinking and intelligent. As a teenager, he probably had this casual coolness about him that made him really popular. He seems like he was really fun and always down for a good time - not someone who took things or himself too seriously. I think he would have used humor and fun as a way to avoid the trauma of his childhood (as corny as that sounds).
