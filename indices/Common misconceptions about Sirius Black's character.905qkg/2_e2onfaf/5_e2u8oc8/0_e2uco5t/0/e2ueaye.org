Yep, I see what you mean. I was thinking about an AU, not strictly canon. So he didn't go to Azkaban. I was thinking someone who was more mature, completely non-judgemental but calls him out on his crap and deals with him completely patiently and still manages to keep him guessing, amusing him endlessly. Do you see Sirius as someone who loves a good mystery? I didn't consider the friendship factor so thanks for you input. I can totally see Sirius as demisexual. Acceptance, is, of course, the prime factor so I think you hit that spot on.
