I think things like the map, Remus, the mirrors, all the experimentation done in his youth shows Sirius as someone who does love a mystery and would probably engage with it. I'm not sure maturity is a requirement, I think he'd fluster under too much of that but perhaps someone with some similar experiences or has knowledge in some of the other non-Azkaban issues (he has some mental instability even before it, he clearly had an emotionally abusive upbringing and personally, I also see some signs of insecurity) so I suppose if I were tailor making someone for him, they would need to be stable more so than mature, unwilling to give up, able to cope with whatever other issues he may have (I'm not sure how he would feel about genetically his children, for example) and be willing to let him help and take care of them because Sirius latches on hard when he feels strongly and will want to connect in that way. Aside from that, a good sense of humour, Sirius is both very dry and a prankster, and above all else, understand how important his friendships are to him.
