As a rule, I don't see him as ending up with anyone. While not strictly canon, given what I imagine are some intense attachment issues, I don't see Sirius as the type who would feel comfortable in a conventional relationship in the long term. Especially if you're post-Azkaban, where he has even more trauma to add to that and difficulty with betrayal.

I can see him enjoying sex, but his emotional needs are met by having strong friendships. However, I'm not against it if the chemistry and work is put in. I think for it to work, it needs to be someone he has a strong friendship with, who has no problem with his wanderlust and can put in the time and energy required to reach a strong level of trust. Other than that, my only thoughts are that I very much doubt he's wholly heterosexual (I tend to characterise gender/sex being non-issues, it's always about the person) and that it's someone who can keep his interest in terms of humour, adventure, temperament and someone who can appreciate his intense loyalty. Acceptance is key; he didn't have it at home.
