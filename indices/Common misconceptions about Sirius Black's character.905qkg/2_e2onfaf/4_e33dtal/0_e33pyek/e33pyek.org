I'm glad you enjoyed it! It's both late, and I'm rather sleep deprived, so I hope this makes sense.

If I had to hazard a guess at why he's showing some signs of being insecure (at least to me), I'd say it's because of his upbringing. He may have had every advantage financially and educationally, but his familial relationships are complicated to say the least. In terms of my own thought. I believe he has issues with attachment because those emotional needs just weren't met as a kid, but obviously, this is just speculation.Then we have a couple of things that indicate that he latches on hard with people: we know he did with James (as Harry did with Ron, who was an isolated child and living in muggle London, I imagine Sirius had an insular upbringing too), we see he and Harry latch on very deeply from limited communication, and from context, he was close with the Order.

So where does this lead into insecurity? Well, if you consider the Black's as a whole, family as a concept is something earned and maintained. It's not a given. You will be removed from it if you don't bow to their desires. Everything comes with conditions. Having that in a child, it would be easy to see why he would seek out a family of his own definition (i.e. he says he's related to Bellatrix, but she isn't family) and cling to them desperately because he was raised to believe if you don't co-operate, you get removed. This is bound to leave a certain amount of insecurity about status and relationships. You see some of it with Harry, when he assumes that Harry wouldn't really want to be with him in PoA. I mean, even his oldest friends were down for him being a Death Eater and as we see with Remus, he forgives him immediately. He clearly wants that acceptance.

This can also interplay with, from the hurled insults, his self worth being very, very confused. He feels superior, but inferior in his own superiority. It's the being told you're practically royalty, but also being screamed at for a variety of things (i.e. the bike, I imagine). It would incite a feeling of worthlessness on top of feeling self-confident.

So I suppose by insecure, I mean that he doesn't feel solid in many of his relationships but still clings to acceptance. They believed he was a DE, he believes Harry doesn't want him, he believes it's his fault James and Lily are dead because they trusted him and Harry had to save him instead of the other way around. I think feelings of insecurity and worthlessness are hand in hand, because he both feels he can't be good enough and when he's shown loyalty (not even to himself, his tone to Ron completely changes upon him showing loyalty to Harry), he clings on for dear life because somewhere in the back of his mind, he knows love, family, friendships are all conditional and he may not measure up.
