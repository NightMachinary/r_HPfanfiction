  He was brilliant, but lazy. This is noted by his professors, and probably indicates that he was bright only in things he was interested at excelling at.

It seemed more that he was /bored/ with school rather than laziness. Remus described him as one of the cleverest in the entire school and it's pretty much supported by his attitude. People who are generally bored with school are also people who are outstanding at most subjects. How many people do you know come out of an exam and say 'I'm expecting a full mark'? Most would be nerve-wracked. He is also described as the top of his year (along with James), so he's basically a straight-O student. He's also said to be very talented by Slughorn, who taught him Potions.
