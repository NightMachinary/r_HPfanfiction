Yes, I saw the same user but I didn't want to engage and feed the trolls, so to speak. We know from Pottermore that Sirius is excellent in Charms (and nonverbal magic), which I think is interesting given Remus seems to be adept at Defense and James as transfiguration, making them quite the team (I don't know about Peter, as his page is less than complimentary). I just don't see Hufflepuff because I don't think Sirius necessarily prioritises hard work or fairness in general terms. I think Sirius is very much about his own narrative and experiences, which gives him some tunnel vision and that does seem rather Slytherin. He is the product of almost a thousand years of Slytherins (if you go with the Blacks being part of the Norman influx to Britain around 1066 along with the Malfoys) and he was raised by them, so I think it's leaked into his personality more than he realises. Loyalty to those who are loyal to you in absolute is definitely more of a Slytherin ideal, because it implies a quid pro quo more than Hufflepuff does, it's focused in a small group as you say and betrayal is not an option. JKR once said Sirius, for all his faults and traumas, has incredible loyalty to people and I like to stick with that. I think Hufflepuffs can be loyal to an ideal, whereas I think Sirius is more loyal to people.
