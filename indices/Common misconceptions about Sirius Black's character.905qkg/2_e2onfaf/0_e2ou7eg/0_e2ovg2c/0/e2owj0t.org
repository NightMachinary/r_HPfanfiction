There's really no need to apologise, lol. I just get extremely irked because there's been a user that says Sirius and James are idiots, in addition to everyone claiming Lily, Lupin and Snape were the top and Sirius is dragged down... And anything that suggests he's less brilliant he already was in canon just irks me very hard, especially with fanfiction!Sirius. Yeah, I see Sirius as too arrogant to /not/ get an O in History or Magic but I don't think he's interested. I mean, like you said, he's ambitious in his best subjects (Transfiguration, Charms and possibly Potions). Hell, I think he'd be too arrogant to even fail Divination. But I don't see either him or James taking it, as fanon likes to assume. I do see how he'd be perceived as lazy, so thanks for clarifying.

But Sirius does showcase some Slytherin traits, as you've already noted. Some people peg him as a Hufflepuff but I disagree. He'd be a Slytherin. He was cunning, had some degree of ambition, shrewd, manipulative and most importantly, loyal to those he cares about only. He is only loyal to those he loves, as you've already noted. I think that's generally regarded as a Slytherin trait, not a Hufflepuff one. Hufflepuffs are loyal to a lot of people, Slytherins just have a group of friends that are carefully selected. But they remain loyal to them.
