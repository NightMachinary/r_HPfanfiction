I did note Slughorn's comment above, yes. I agree with you that he was definitely bored. It's possible lazy wasn't quite the right word to describe what I meant, and I do apologise for that. He's not ambitious or driven in things he has no interest in, he knows he's smart and has no desire to push himself because he doesn't need to. This is, I feel, his contrast to his brother who is driven and has everything to prove, which gives them their fundamental House difference. When he decides he wants something? Pushes himself to excel beyond expectation, such as becoming an animagus. I just don't see him as pushing himself the same way in say, History of Magic. He's done enough to get an O, so he's happy enough, he's not interested in pushing himself to get an, idk, 100% or extra credit because it's super boring. This would be what some teachers would consider to be 'lazy' because it's not giving 110% across the board even though he's capable of doing so.
