I do, but it's almost all in one 'universe' at the moment. There's a variety of canon compliant ones (Sirius leaving home and it's aftermath, for example) within the series though, as it doesn't become AU until summer '95. You can find them on [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/kuchikopi/pseuds/kuchikopi][ao3]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etonberrysandkuchikopi][ffnet]].
