Yes, I corrected it. It's very, er, /late/ (if you call staying up until 6 am late) where I am and I need to get off to sleep. I really like your characterisations, they're realistic and have depth. The dynamics between the brothers are also interesting. Your fanfictions really need to be more popular!
