Yes, but I don't know, anger-driven characters or always angry characters don't attract me at all so if that's the case with Sirius, I don't know how I ended up liking him so much. The fact that Peter was a Death Eater but was as inactive as possible and eventually denounced Voldemort to the entire magical community is enough for redemption, to be honest. The author actually explains this through Sirius, he feels like he can't deny himself - and the other three - their full friendship because it was what kept him going. And it was only two weeks until Peter defected. He later gets tortured because of it, but doesn't betray his friends. This is honestly my favourite Peter in the fandom. He actually has a personality here, and a believable one at that.

Which is what makes it so fun, honestly. Having all these different books to please people of every taste.
