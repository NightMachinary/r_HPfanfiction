Julia was a frankly terrible character. Her and Sirius's relationship had potential but it was wasted. I liked her job and wished that the author would have delved deeper into it. I mean, magical archaeology? Hell yeah. Her other interests were also quite neat. It's just a shame that she decided to give them to Lily at the end while Julia was just there for the romance. While we're on the topic of Julia, Lily. Lily was frankly terrible and quite bland. The author made it quite clear that she was more than just a secretary but her place within the Inner Circle didn't make sense in the slightest. She was supposed to be awesome but we're never shown that and instead get her image as a housewife. If anything, just give her role to Julia already and she'd have been more interesting.

I think that the fact that, again, the situations differ, Sirius's motivation would have been something else other than anger. Because, again, he was being tortured daily for their wherabouts so he clung onto the friendship this time. There was really no reason to be angry since there was no betrayal. And even then he still managed some anger at Voldemort, but that was after his escape. I think it's also worth noting that what actually kept him alive in Azkaban was the thought of his innocence, not his anger.

Yeah, writing styles differ and that's OK! Renascentia is amazing and so is the Unbroken Universe and they're too very different stories. But I think the series itself was quite large enough already without the author developing his level of maturity. During a war, it just hits you like that so I can excuse it.
