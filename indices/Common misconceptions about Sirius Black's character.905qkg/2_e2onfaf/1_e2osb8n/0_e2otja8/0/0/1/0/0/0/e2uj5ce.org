I don't disagree, but I think it's not a Sirius-specific issue in that particular AU. Everyone takes a level in maturity, and while understandable, it's difficult to see them at Point A and Point B without the time to explore between the two. Sirius, as you noted, went through a lot of abuse during this time and yet shows little of the arrested development he shows in canon after Azkaban. I still think it's well written and well characterised, but I think it just suffers from the 'everyone is awesome' vibe which is cool if you're into it but I really enjoy flaw explorations. I keep thinking of his reactions to Peter and Snape upon returning, and it just doesn't feel as if it was explained well why he would have this sort of reaction. I only got a few chapters into the second one before it all got a bit too 'everything is about Sirius' for me, and he's my favourite character. It's one of the better ones, but I am (by my own admission) hypercritical about Sirius to the point where a lot of moments that feel just slightly off will turn me away from a fic, which is why I'm very fussy about which ones I read and if I know the author. I don't go about saying so, as it's only my personal view of what feels off, but Promises still has the some of the best world building I've seen in the whole fandom.
