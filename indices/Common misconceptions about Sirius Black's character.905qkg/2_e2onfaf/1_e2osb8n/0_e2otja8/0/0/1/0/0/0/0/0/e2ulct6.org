Julia was not the kind of person I would have chosen, no. I understand why the other characters reacted this way, and I suppose it does make some sense that he still has some friends, but his lack of anger bothers me. That anger kept him alive and sane in Azkaban, but it doesn't seem to factor as much in promises and I don't really like that. I just don't understand why the author wouldn't choose to show his journey to that level of maturity rather than granting it and leaving readers to rationalise it, but it's not my writing style, after all. And you're right, people overlooking his prank stuff is a definitely ugh point for me.
