Yeah, but I still think it was one of the better characteristions of him in the fandom. Besides, that dark phase he went through in the second book didn't gloss over it. People were disgusted by him. However, I can see where you're coming from and it did annoy me a bit. But you gotta look at it from this point of view: Sirius has just escaped ten years of physical, emotional and psychological torture so his friends will of course be more sensitive and delicate around him. He would need a rest (and deserve it as well). Maybe they thought being too harsh on him will finally break him. I think it's softens it a bit when I see it this way.
