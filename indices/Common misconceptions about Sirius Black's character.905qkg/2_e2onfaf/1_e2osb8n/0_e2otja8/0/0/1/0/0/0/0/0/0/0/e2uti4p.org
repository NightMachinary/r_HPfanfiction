Yeah, it just wasn't the kind of story that kept my attention because of those character deficits. If you're ensemble, you have to juggle and give fair time to each person and balance them well, especially OC's. I just don't feel like that was exactly it.

If you'll excuse me putting on my work hat for a moment and dragging psychology into this, Sirius speculates that it's his innocence that kept him sane but this is a thought, not an emotion. He specifies that the emotion wasn't a happy one, and while he never says it was anger specifically, the way he talks abut knowing Peter was with Harry is like a fire being lit in his head. To me, I would interpret these both as types of anger. There are other emotions linked to his innocence that could have done it, but my gut says it's anger. I do see what you mean about the fact that Peter didn't specifically betray him or James, though he did become a Death Eater which was glossed over a little bit too much for my liking giving what DE's did to him. I don't know, I get where you're coming from, but it doesn't have the right emotional impact for me and as a reader, emotional impact is important to me.

The author had their priorities and it doesn't line up with that I would prioritise, which is fair enough honestly. Everyone has different experiences, and see's how characters will react differently based on their interpretation of it. I personally don't see maturity during a war as a given so I would want it explored, but my war experiences are not going to be the same as other peoples or even what other people might think a war experience would be. It's all about finding your individual priorities and groove. Not every story is for every reader.
