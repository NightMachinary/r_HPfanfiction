Yeah, understandable. I do agree that Promises has a lot of unique worldbuilding. Especially the thing Remus falls through, I forgot its name. And it does suffer from 'everyone is awesome' like you said. For example, during the Unicorn Group meetings, it was nearly always Lily that did the stuff despite being there, like, ten other people? I think she suffered the worst from it, in my opinion. But the characters did seem a bit more human and because everyone was admittedly 'awesome' that made it a bit more bearable instead of just only one person for everyone to gawk at. I also didn't like Julia much, she lacked depth.

I think the situations differ here a bit. When he went to Azkaban in canon, he lost all three friends in one swoop. However, in this AU, he still has them around him, all of them supportive and he wasn't locked up. He was also being hunted down by Voldemort every chance he had so that must add some level of maturity. Being hypercritical of him is almost a requirement to love his character, to be honest. I mean, look at all that worshipping he gets and the people that make him very OOC as a result because they overlook his flaws. They even hand wave the Werewolf Prank Incident away like its nothing. So, understandable and very relatable as well.
