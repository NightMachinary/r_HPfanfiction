Isn't it? I'm always starved for recs for good ones. One of my old friends and I literally began writing HP again after about five years because we just weren't finding the characterisation we wanted anywhere. It's pretty difficult to find a well balanced Sirius characterisation in gen fic and finding gen fic works in general is a bit of an ordeal here for some reason.
