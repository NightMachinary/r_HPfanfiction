Gen is my favourite too, and I don't mind minor romantic subplots at all (one sneaked into my own without any warning, so we ended up going with it), but I haven't found anything ongoing or even one-shots that feel like more than snapshots. I've tried most of the big name rec'd ones, but haven't been able to get into them. The only sort of ongoing I'm reading is not really fic but more like describing a fic, so I'm not sure if it's worth reccing. If I could find something that didn't play into any of the above, I'd rec it in a heartbeat but sadly, I think everything falls into one of the traps. I don't really read SI fics, as a rule, so I've probably missed that one.
