Ahahaha okay here we go, I suppose I'll do this one. Way back in the day (about the time Order came out), I used to write in HP and I wound up hating most of the Sirius' I saw and wound up writing him just because it was driving me crazy. I can't say fully what he's like in fanon these days, I don't delve in that deeply, but I can state the things I have seen.

- Sirius Black is not a dog. Yes, he spent a considerable period as one in Azkaban and out of it, but that does not mean he runs about excitedly constantly, yells about everything, jumps all over people and will hump the leg of the nearest attractive person.

- Sirius is not stoic and withdrawn either. He's got quite a dry humour as we see it in canon and he uses it as a compensation for his experiences, he's unapologetically blunt (especially if you compare him with Remus, but he outright tells the Weasley kids some things are worth dying for when it's their father on the line) and he's prone to fits of depression. This is not the same as being stoic. Sirius is obviously concerned about seeming more stable than he is, because he is noted as withdrawing during his more intense periods. I could go on about the blaming the individual for their weakness rather than recognising their trauma thing that seems prevalent in magical culture and seems to be a throwback to a pre-WW mentality, but it would digress from the point.

- Sirius came from a purist family, and changed gradually. My most irritated thing is people who forget that Sirius has a fair number of more Slytherin traits. He can be quite manipulative in his representations of facts (perhaps not on purpose but he does get wrapped up in his own perspective and is quite an unrealiable narrator, possibly due to some of his experiences in Azkaban). This gradual change has always appealed to me as while not directly comparable, growing up at the protestant side of the peace walls in Belfast during the troubles and ending up with a best mate from a catholic family meant that both of our perceptions of each others 'side' of the wall were very different and often misrepresented. I feel like through James, and others as they came into his life, he got his horizons opened in much the same way. This is such an important cornerstone of his character.

As such, seeing people who have him be super into muggleborn rights practically from birth gets side-eye from me.

- Sirius has his hair long as a side effect of being unkempt and depressed. It's not his default state. You see in pictures that usually, when he's happy, it's cut shorter.

- Sirius bangs everything that moves. Where did this even come from? Girls looking at him in Order? He doesn't seem too interested in them, and a few posters aside, doesn't seem to show much interest in general. His friends are super important to him and fulfill a lot of his emotional needs. For me when it comes to Sirius, it's hugely important to emphasize how deeply he loves his friends and this is often overlooked for a ship. I don't disagree about the possibility of a name of obsessed house meaning he was sexual earlier than you'd expect, but I don't think that translates to promiscuity automatically.

- Sirius doesn't have canon tattoo's. The film director just thought it looked cool. PoA is a beautiful film, but do not get your canon information there.

- A little adjacent, but where on earth did people get the idea that Sirius is afraid of Orion? I know it's the cliche for the child in an openly emotionally abusive situation to fear the father, but I think we can see pretty openly, Walburga was much more his sparking point. He even makes a note of it in Order. Whatever Sirius' relationship with his father, there's no canon indication he was a feared patriarchal figure.

- He's not flighty. He's the opposite of flighty. He digs his heels in hard. I'm guessing this is part of the whole dog being easily distracted idea, but he's much more 'dog with a bone'.

- Sirius does change across the series. He's angry, sullen, disconnected, out of control and struggling with Azkaban in PoA. He's recovered a little by GoF, sounding much more chilled and relaxed, and is protective of Harry. In Order, he's deep into depression and stuck in a house he hates and he slips closer to a melancholy version of PoA and gets some revertigo because he definitely acts a little more like a teen in it (probably being in that house). These are all important factors to take into account when choosing your time period.

- Sirius found James and Lily's bodies. I realise this is the film probably putting it about that Snape did, but it was him and Hagrid.

- He was brilliant, but lazy. This is noted by his professors, and probably indicates that he was bright only in things he was interested in excelling at. 'Exceptionally bright', as McGonagall put it and 'talented', as Slughorn does.

Honestly, these are all off the top of my head and there's probably more, but I've rambled enough.

ETA: Just for the sake of debunking, I also added in Slughorn's quote.
