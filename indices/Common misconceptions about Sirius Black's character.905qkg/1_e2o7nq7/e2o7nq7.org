The problem with the Sirius we see in a lot of fanfic is that people seem to think the reason he is moody is because of Azkaban. Maybe that is part of it, but we see in OOTP he definitely had some moodiness as a teen too, and his sense of humour was dark, even cruel. Don't forget where he grew up and the context around that. I'm not sure where any of the silliness in canon even comes from to be honest.

Also, the gay thing. So, I have no problem with people interpreting Sirius as gay. Really. Its not how I see him myself, and I think if he was gay he was gay for James, not Remus. But I can see the appeal and if you think he is gay I fully support your view of him that way. But please for the love of god do not turn him into a camp stereotype. Its so unfair to the lgbt community to deny them such a layered, deep and troubled character and turn him into a glittery cliche. Also, please remember the historical context of the 1970s. Some gay lids definitely were camp then. They were not popular and they were not admired by girls.
