If he was LGBTQ then he was most likely bisexual. I just think it's extremely unlikely for him to be gay while he has posters of muggle women hanging on his bedroom walls while he could've just as easily hung up posters of men. So, yeah, bisexual is very plausible. There's also the asexual interpretation.
