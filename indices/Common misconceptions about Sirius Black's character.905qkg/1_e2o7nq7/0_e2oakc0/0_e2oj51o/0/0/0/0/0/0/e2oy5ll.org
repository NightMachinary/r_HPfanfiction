Probably not. The society as a whole seems to have a more egalitarian view on gender, so that would probably translate to non-standard sexuality as well.

This will be dependent on which family you're talking about though. The last male heir of an ancient family will have duties that supersede personal desires or attraction. So I imagine the Weasley's would be supportive of Ron being gay, while Neville and Draco would have more pressure to marry and produce a suitable heir.

On that note, it's not clear if the magical world has a concept of adoption. I mean obviously Harry was adopted by the Dursley family, but if he had been taken in by Dumbledore for example, would Harry be legally considered to have the same rights and privileges as a natural born son of Albus?
