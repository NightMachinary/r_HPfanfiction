I generally prefer Hinny, but even I have to admit that there is just not enough about Ginny in the canon to make it much sense. Thus for me the basic idea how the relationship could work comes from stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Grave days” for their relationship). And I am also the last person to say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best book of the series, but linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang) made their relationship much more possible.
