I've been on hermione reading spree this week. This is few of my recomendation. Linkffn(Pet project) HG/SS is surprising for me, considering the age gap. The characterization of snape in this fic is helping me like this pairing. Story: The Debt of Time Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496]]) this fic made me appreciate HG/SB and HG/RL. But i am dropping it because i couldn't handle polyamorous relationships. (poor sirius)

Other than that, Linkffn(delenda est) linkffn(stepping back) made me love HP/BL pairing
