I can't tell you all that without spoilers.... I can tell you the Mia/ Sirius is deeper and more lasting, but Remus does make one real comeback. Keep in mind what they've said about bonds- Mia and Sirius aren't ready to have a sealed bond. They still have to evolve and grow up a bit

I think that the big thing to remember with the Pack bond is that it's not about romance or love or sex. It's closer to being FAMILY.... she wants to make the Pack bond to Remus because she loves her friends and they're like family to her. She doesn't want to do it because she just wants closer to Remus. She wants them all closer to each other, to draw strength from the magic in the bond. If you want the one big spoiler

Debt of Time is my all-time favorite fic, so I really recommend finishing it. I know it's long, but there is so much amazing stuff coming.

I will tell you that Chapter 71 is the end of Mia and Remus's romantic relationship, if that helps. You can get through!
