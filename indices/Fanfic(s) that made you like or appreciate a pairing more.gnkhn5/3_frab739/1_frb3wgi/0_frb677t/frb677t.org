Well, i love bond concept in that story. Hermione is bonded to sirius, so when she made love to remus both of them agree they do not match. But later when they facing Greyback, hermione wants to make another bond to remus. Thats feels like hermione betraying sirius...

I think i am stopping at chapter 50s Can you tell me how long until hermione and sirius become a lover and did remus still get in that relationship?
