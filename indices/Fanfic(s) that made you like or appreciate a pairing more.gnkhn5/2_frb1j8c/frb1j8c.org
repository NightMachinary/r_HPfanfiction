Harmony has always been a bit bland for me, and their relationship dynamics in pretty much every fic I've read was horrific. But then I read Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift, and I was sold. Seriously, everyone should read it, it's a damn masterpiece when it comes to treating the characters right.
