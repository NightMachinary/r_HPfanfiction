He definitely has beef with Malfoy. Malfoy "sold out" the Dark Lord by claiming he was under the imperius curse while Barty ended up spending 10+ years in Azkaban (then a couple of years trapped under his fathers imperius curse!) for his crimes/refusal to denounce Voldemort.

Edit linkffn(The Green Girl) has the Malfoys unhappy about the transfiguration but they are aware it's Barty and not Moody who did it. BUT, based on the graveyard scene at the end of the book, this knowledge doesn't seem possible in canon. Sooooo just how scared of Moody was Lucius to not make a gigantic fuss about his only child being transformed into a ferret/bashed against the walls/floor?
