Low drama stories where everyone just acts sensibly are the best kind of stories. I've ragequit a bunch of fics - most recently about 5 minutes ago - due to the MC being so idiotic that it's depressing to read about. People's obsession with having constant drama and conflict in every story just feels masochistic to me.
