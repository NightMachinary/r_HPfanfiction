My one problem with cleaning up Grimmauld Place is the permanent sticking charm. If there was a way to remove it, Sirius's mum would have found it and pulled down the posters in his room. So, my take was that after the war, Harry buys a similar house in London and they turn Grimmauld place into a museum or something.

Also, Kreacher and Harry worked things out in Deathly Hallows.
