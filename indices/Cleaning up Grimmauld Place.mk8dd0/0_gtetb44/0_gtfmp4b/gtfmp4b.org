  My one problem with cleaning up Grimmauld Place is the permanent sticking charm. If there was a way to remove it, Sirius's mum would have found it and pulled down the posters in his room.

House-elf magic, as easy as that. There is multiple evidence in canon where house elves bypass Wizard wards (e.g. Dobby popping in unnoticed during CoS, Dobby's rescue mission in Malfoy Manor, Kreacher apparating out of Voldy'y cave) and Wizards being either un-knowing of that or ignorant of the possibility a "lower" being might have magic supreme to theirs.

Sirius' mother simply never thought of asking Kreacher.
