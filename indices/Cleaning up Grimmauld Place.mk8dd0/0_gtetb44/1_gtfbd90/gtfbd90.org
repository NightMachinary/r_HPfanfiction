The best idea I've seen is removing the wall itself. It could work if you cut out the wall with some spell, and quickly replace it with a new one. And of course magic.

As for why Sirius' mother couldn't remove the posters in his room, I think the idea of damaging her noble ancestors' house, even temporarily, would've appalled her. Also, she may not have gotten magical assistance in fixing his room, because the Blacks kept dying as years went on. It could be that she wasn't magically gifted to pull off the reconstruction on her own.

As for living in it, I do think Harry would redecorate the house and live in it for a while, but I think he'd want to move out after having childrens because the house would be too conveniently big for them to pull off shenanigans. I imagine he still has it as a safehouse or a worst case scenario where they need a highly protected house like the Order did.

edit: misspelt appalled.
