  As for why Sirius' mother couldn't remove the posters in his room, I think the idea of damaging her noble ancestors' house, even temporarily, would've appealed her. Also, she may not have gotten magical assistance in fixing his room, because the Blacks kept dying as years went on. It could be that she wasn't magically gifted to pull off the reconstruction on her own.

That actually makes sense. It also fits with the hints at mental instability due to inbreeding that are in the books.
