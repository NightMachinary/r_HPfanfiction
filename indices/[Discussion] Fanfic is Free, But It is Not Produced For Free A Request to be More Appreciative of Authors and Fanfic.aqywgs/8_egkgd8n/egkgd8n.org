I'm gonna also wing it and say that there is also unequal treatment between fan artists and fanfiction writers in general. To a lot of fans who consume both fanart and fanfic, it appears that they treat the former as a privilege and the latter as an entitlement. While I acknowledge that both mediums require a huge amount of expertise and effort, fans respect artists that can draw their fav characters well while treating fanfics and writers as a natural byproduct of fandom. And I think that's unfair because these are both 2 valid forms of art and they both deserve equal support. Eespecially with fanfic where the writer is working for free (+ all the reasons stated above) and not asking fans to pay for the release of their next chapter. I just feel like we deserve a little more love and respect. I apologise if this all sounds a little rant-y, but I need to get this off my chest.
