While I agree that people need to be respectful, this does go both ways. Readers are investing hours into reading, in some cases, monolith sized stories, only to see the author will "be back next week. I swear this time!!!1111!1!"

If fanfic authors run out of ideas, or just wants to stop writing, they need to just come out and say it. Instead of just vanishing into the ether - while also demanding none of their stories are up for adoption.

I read through an abandoned story a few years ago, where the author complained that they lost their hard-drive and their story backups nearly every three published chapters. Eventually, they just vanished, with the usual promise at the end of the last chapter that they were for sure back, and would be posting again by next week. (Like most unfinished stories, since this line is nearly the same across the 100k+ abandoned HP stories alone).

This is the 21st century. Cloud storage across just about every major tech company is free for ridiculous amounts of storage. Text files will practically guarantee said storage is nearly infinite.

I mean, good god. Plums(on FFnet), seems to have the inability to finish a single story(even though they're all massively popular), goes around complaining in review sections about people not finishing their stories.
