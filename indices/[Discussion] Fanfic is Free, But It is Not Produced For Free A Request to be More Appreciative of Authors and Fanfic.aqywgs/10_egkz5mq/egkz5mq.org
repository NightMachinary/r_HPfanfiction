Being an author myself, I understand just how much constructive feedback is appreciated. Which is why I always try to be respectful and constructive when giving feedback.

I normally don't criticize fanfiction authors for the direction that they take their stories (mainly, my comments are on the execution of the fic itself). Oftentimes I find the direction they're taking the story to be a fascinating one that I'd like to see more of, and it honestly boggles my mind whenever I see a reviewer try to force the author to go a certain direction with their fic.

That being said, I do have a pet peeve when it comes to bad grammar in fics. Like, I can forgive the occasional typo and whatnot, that happens to all of us. But if you're slaughtering the English language, getting called out on it by reviewers, and you refuse to improve your grammar, do not expect me to give you any feedback at all since you're clearly not listening to your audience when they're making valid points. I'll just close the tab and move on to the next fic.
