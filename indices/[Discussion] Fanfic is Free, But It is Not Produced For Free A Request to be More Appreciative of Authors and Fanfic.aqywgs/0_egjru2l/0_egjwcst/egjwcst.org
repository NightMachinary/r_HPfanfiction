There are definitely people here that have made me feel miserable about my writing before, but then I remind myself I'm not writing for them. There are also people here that have been overwhelmingly supportive and helpful. It can be really tough, especially when you have really enjoyed writing something and someone is rude and unhelpful about it. I recently had that with one of my humour fics on this sub and it came at a really personal time for me so I got a bit teary but resisted commenting.

But, I've now figured out which people give helpful (even if critical) feedback, and which people I'm just never ever going to please ever. That helps more than you would expect.
