To be honest, I love this sub, but it has made me almost afraid to write fanfiction. Watching the way some people tear apart authors and pick apart their stories is unnerving. I've been able to make a mental list of “what not to do” in a story and I know that you can't please everyone, but sometimes it just feels impossible.
