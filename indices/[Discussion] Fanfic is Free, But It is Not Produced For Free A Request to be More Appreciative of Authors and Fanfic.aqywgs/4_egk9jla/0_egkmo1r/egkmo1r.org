  How the hell is THAT many authors losing everything they have written to random hard-drive failures and shit? Is there some sort of condition that you can't be a fanfic author without writing on a toaster? USB memory sticks are practically free nowadays, invest in one. Backup your work to it. It's not hard.

I think that sometimes people are just looking for an excuse as to why they want to rewrite or delay the next chapter, or quit the story, etc.

Instead of just saying they have writer's block or ran out of ideas, you get the faulty USB sticks or corrupted hard drive.
