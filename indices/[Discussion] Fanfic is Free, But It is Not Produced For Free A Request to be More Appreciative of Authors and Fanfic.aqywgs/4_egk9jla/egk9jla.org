A whole lot of pretty words, that can be summed up much easier as "Be a little bit more respectful to people who you interact with, even if they are just some online persona". Or more succinctly put as "Don't be an asshole".

​

Readers shouldn't get all angry and pissed because a story is going a different way then they wanted, or because their waifu is being sidelined in favor of the authors waifu, or whatever. Though I think that simply stating your disappointment/preference is fine as long as you maintain rule number 1. IE: Don't be an asshole. Same goes, if the author is writing one type of story, don't jump in with "strong suggestions" that are completely out of left field. (I'm looking at all those reviews/comments that keep suggesting girls to add to the harem, and how it would TOTALLY make sense... for a work that didn't, doesn't, and never even hinted at a harem.)

​

It goes both ways though. While authors are investing time and creative energy into a work of passion, it's not like readers aren't investing anything into the story. Time to read it, emotional attachment to the characters, etc. There is a certain amount that the readers ARE owed, not so much in "creative decisions" or anything dumb like that, but in communication and loyalty. You know, stuff like "Try to finish the story that a lot of people are enjoying", or "Let people know if you decide to abandon it rather then just disappearing", and maybe, just maybe "Try to avoid promising to post the next chapter by the end of the day, and then never posting anything ever again.".

​

On a side note:

How the hell is THAT many authors losing everything they have written to random hard-drive failures and shit? Is there some sort of condition that you can't be a fanfic author without writing on a toaster? USB memory sticks are practically free nowadays, invest in one. Backup your work to it. It's not hard.
