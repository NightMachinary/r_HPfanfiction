  How the hell is THAT many authors losing everything they have written to random hard-drive failures and shit? Is there some sort of condition that you can't be a fanfic author without writing on a toaster? USB memory sticks are practically free nowadays, invest in one. Backup your work to it. It's not hard.

Hm. No, I have had these things happen more than once, as shameful to admit. I back everything up on my USB, EHD, SSD, and on the cloud. One time, all of them messed up. The cloud did not update, my EHD just failed to load for a solid week, my PC rolled back due to a windows update, and I lost my USB.

Another time, I legit just deleted my entire folder after cutting it from my USB. I then deleted it, thinking it was the old one. Another few days of writing lost.

Happens, to be honest. Nothing is truly infallible.

On a side note, in the span of a year, I have lost six USBs.
