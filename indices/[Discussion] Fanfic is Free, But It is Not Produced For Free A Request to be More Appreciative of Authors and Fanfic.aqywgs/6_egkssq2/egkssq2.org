I need to do better at this for sure, because it's sooooooo easy and tempting to snark.

Also, I am writing a story that has elements that have been picked on in just the past couple of days on here. Obviously they weren't targeting me since I haven't put anything online yet. But still, it is a little discouraging and I imagine it hurts a lot more if it's your actual work being criticized.

THAT SAID, authors, PLEASE learn that you can NEVER please everybody. My family member is a prolific novelist, and she gets goodreads reviews all the time about "I liked the story, but it was too scary for me." Same book, someone else's review: "the tension felt thin and it wasn't scary at all." "I wish there had been more romance between the leads." Same book: "I can't believe the author forced the main characters to get together. Feels artificial and I would have preferred no romance." "Book ended abruptly." "it dragged on and on" etc. etc. and these are award-winning, acclaimed books, people. You cannot please everyone. Just remember how much everyone whined about the "classics" we were assigned to read in school. Just cause you are getting criticism doesn't mean you didn't create a great artwork.
