Meh. This post is going to be unpopular I'm sure.

As a middling quality fanfic writer, I'd say I've received way more as a writer from the practice of writing and posting fanfiction than I gave. Without fanfiction, my thirty or so original fiction stories I've written and published in various venues have been read by, I don't know, maybe twenty thousand people? I've two novels that will never be published, destined for an eternity on the "We almost picked this up, but opted for the other story" soft-letdown list.

In contrast, my most popular fanfiction story (among least impressive things I've written) has a million hits. The feedback I've received from readers for my fanfiction has, in the aggregate, been far more valuable to honing my craft than any MFA-esque, circle-jerk, butchering/critiquing of my prose by wannabe litfic "let me share my childhood trauma in twenty easy installments" word-barfers.

I suspect I'm not alone in this.
