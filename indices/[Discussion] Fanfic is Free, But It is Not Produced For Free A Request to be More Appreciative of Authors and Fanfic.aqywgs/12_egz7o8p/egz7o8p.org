I think the issue as redditors have mentioned is that some readers are entitled and self-absorbed.

They read one fic they love/hate and then go on to judge every other fic by the same standard.

For others, some themes in a fic can be disturbing, disagree with a person's strongly held beliefs. It should be case of attacking the idea but instead readers attack the author.

In my own experience, fanfics are an escape from reality, I don't appreciate Fics that remind me of the grim reality.

Like the fact that if you're handsome you can get anyway with anything.

Cue Draco redemption fics, cue young good Tom Riddle or Bellatrix Lestrange or good death eaters.

People always look for someone else to lay their problems on.

Cue manipulative Dumbledore.

Its concepts like that which get under my skin.

As a result, I have started saving fics to read offline. It prevents me from flaming.
