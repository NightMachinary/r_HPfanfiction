I agree. Leaving feedback, negative or positive, so long as it is constructive, should never be considered a bad thing. To say otherwise is tantamount to suggesting that you're not allowed an opinion.

I think OP, though, is more referring to making personal gibes or making light of an author's effort.

Comments like that. Sure, it's "feedback" and it's obviously indicative that you didn't like the story. No argument could made, however, that your feedback is constructive. It doesn't particularly /help/ the author and it's needlessly hurtful to someone who, presumably, worked very hard on a story.

Though, please do not assume that I think that's what /you/ were implying, either. I'm just trying to make the OP more clear.

It's worth noting, also, that not all stories are written equally. A lot of people literally create shitpost stories, of which they shouldn't expect anything more than shitpost feedback. But I don't think /anyone/ here is talking about those kinds of stories.
