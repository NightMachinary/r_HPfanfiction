As an author and reader, I wouldn't say, â€˜all sides are even in this game.' I can read 100k words in a few hours, but my story is 100k words and it has taken a few DAYS worth of work, and that's only talking about the time I actually spend writing and editing. I have spent over two years working on this piece. I've had my ups and downs, mental health issues, work issues, family issues, and yet I continue writing because I want to finish this story. I want my readers to have the story and the ending they deserve and I want to see this thing completed the way it deserves to be completed. So no, I don't think the time and effort here is equal on the part of the readers and the writers. The writers put a whole lot of effort into one chapter for you to spend maybe half an hour reading it.
