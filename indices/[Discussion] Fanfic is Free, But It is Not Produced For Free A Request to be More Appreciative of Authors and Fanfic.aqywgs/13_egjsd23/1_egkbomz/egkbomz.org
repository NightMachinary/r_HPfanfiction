I read HP fanfic and write for a very different fandom myself. It takes me months to write 50K words with research, rereading what I've written so far, consulting the crazy amount of notes and the outline I've made (and possibly alter that again), etc. But it takes me two weeks to read 1M words. If I read a 50K story, I'm done in a day or two and I move on, but that author spent much more time on it than I would need to read epic long fics (or greater). Writing simply takes /a lot/ more time to do. And at least I personally find that reading is less "active" than writing. It's not as tiresome for my mind.

Yes, readers invest their time, but nobody makes you read that particular story. Yes, authors choose to write, nobody makes them, but they also choose to be vulnerable and allow everyone access to their work. Yes, you're allowed an opinion, but your experience with the story is likely much more fleeting than the amount of time and effort the author spent on it. Both are needed for the fanfic community. Writers want people to read it and readers want people to write it. However the least a reader can do to encourage an author and possibly improve their writing is to give it a minute's pause and consider what they write under someone's story.
