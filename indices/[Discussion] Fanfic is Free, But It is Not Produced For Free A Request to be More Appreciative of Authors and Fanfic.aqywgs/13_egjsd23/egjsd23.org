Authors are spending their time to write stories.

But readers are spending their time to read those stories. And they have a right to leave a feedback about the product they payed with their time for.

All sides are even in this game.

[Edit]: I'm not surprised for being downvoted. It just proves that this subreddit is all about self-centric authors who expect only praises regardless of their stories quality.
