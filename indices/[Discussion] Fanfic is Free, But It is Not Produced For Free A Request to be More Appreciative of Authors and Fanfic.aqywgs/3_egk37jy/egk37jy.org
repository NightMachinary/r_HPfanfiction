As a writer, I cannot agree with this post more. I love writing, I do. I do it for me. But I also do it for everyone else. I do it because I want to share this crazy story in my head - the one I live in all the time - because I want it to live in the world so other people can see it. And all I want... is, perhaps, some acknowledgment that I'm not out there doing it alone. A comment. It means the world. Leave one. :)

Even if it's something small, for a writer to know that someone is reading and/or enjoying their work is enough to make their day. It's all we want. It's true.

And constructive criticism, by the way, is just fine. Welcome even. At least that's my take on it.
