It takes a great deal of time and commitment to write a fic: even more to finish one. I've seen entitled writers on these forums (/I only got ten reviews on my last chapter, doesn't anyone love me any more?/) but I've seen a lot more entitled readers /(I'm so tired of this trope and that trope and why do writers abandon fics and why aren't they more imaginative and why don't they try harder and gimme what I want, gimme gimme, gimme . . ./ ).

Like (I guess) most fanfiction writers, I wrote for myself the stories I couldn't find anywhere else, but I posted them because . . . I was proud of what I'd done: I wanted to share it: I thought other people would like it too? All those things, I suppose. It does feel rotten when nobody else loves your babies the way you do, but that's the nature of the beast.
