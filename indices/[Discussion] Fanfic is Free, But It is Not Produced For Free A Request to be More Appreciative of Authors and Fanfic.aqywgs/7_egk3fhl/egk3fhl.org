I have this problem myself. Especially when I story seems to start off well and takes a dive for no apparent reason. I manage to reign it in sometimes, but there have been a handful of times where I got super triggered and left a mean review.

There are general standards I think should usually be criticized (poor spelling and grammar, excessive details, etc.) but I try (emphasis on try) to mix in some positive stuff if the issues were minor. Writing fanfic myself I know it's easy for people to forget there's a person behind the text and on the grand scheme of things it's rarely sensible to go ape on someone.

Another commenter complained that readers use their time to read so they can criticize too. Issues here. The time difference is rarely even comparable. I've written 10K chapters of stories that people read through in 5 or 10 minutes, yet it took me weeks to write. If someone goes in super hard core and calls it a waste of time (true or not) it's simply a fact that they hardly lost any time at all in reading it, whereas I've spent many hours planning, drafting, writing and correcting it. The cost to them is the time it takes to cook some eggs, but to me it was far more. Some proportion is called for in most cases.
