Exactly this. I started planning and writing a fanfic around December 2013, I've completely scrapped and started over 3 times already when I had around 20 chapters done, both times that averaged about 5k words per chapter. On my third attempt, I'm currently at ch19 and it finally still feels right. I chose not to upload it until I got it finished just because it takes so long and I kept going back and forth. But even when I'm not writing, I'd sometimes just think of something for the story or play out different scenarios that I might want to add to the story. It's not at all comparable to the time it takes to read and think about someone else's fic.
