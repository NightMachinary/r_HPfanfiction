Preach. I've had someone PM me and ask to "reconsider the pairing" in my fic "because there's still time" (the relationship hasn't started to really develop at that point yet) and listed a bunch of reasons why the pairing is wrong and Snape is the worst human being ever.

And than these people argue that it's concrit, lol.
