I appreciate the sentiment, but it definitely wasn't a compliment, underhanded or otherwise. I didn't mean they were hyperventilating because they were that invested in the fic, but rather they were hyperventilating because they were that mad my fic didn't immediately cater to their whim. I seriously doubt they read more than half a chapter at most. But, I wasn't too bothered by it because a quick glance at their profile suggested they did a lot of author baiting, and a quick glance at the fics they had written suggested I really shouldn't take any of their criticism into account.
