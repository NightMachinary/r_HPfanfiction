Mine was a dispute over how much the time-turner would have aged Hermione. For simplicity's sake, I went with one (1) full year, making her biologically 18 as of the 19th of September 1996. This was important to me because there are grown-up (read: sexy times) scenes in the story that involve her and an older character, and even though the age of majority in HP is 17, I wasn't comfortable with her being under 18 in this scenario. The person first tried to tell me to just change her age to 17.5 and when I explained why I wanted her 18, they had the gall to tell me to just start the story 6 months later. I'd written up to almost Christmas! AND I had used Christmas as a significant date. I refused and explained that I was too far in to do that and they immediately back-pedalled. This wasn't in PMs, though. This was in the comments section. Ended up deleting all but their initial comment and my main response comment.
