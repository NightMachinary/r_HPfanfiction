A lot of times readers will even try to argue with you about "facts" that are completely wrong. I remember I had a lovely PM conversation (read: not particularly lovely at all) with a reader absolutely hyperventilating over the fact that I hadn't made Harry as strong a wizard as Dumbledore in a crossover fic I wrote, because Harry is obviously as strong as Dumbledore in canon. I tried pointing out that, A.) Making Harry an uber-strong wizard in this fic would actually undermine the integrity of the story I was trying to tell, and B.) Harry is /nowhere/ near as good at magic as Dumbledore in canon, but I eventually gave up because the guy just wouldn't budge on his completely unsupported headcanon and just kept making weird, nonsensical and snarky jabs about my "lack of creativity."
