I think I've always been pretty upfront with being in the pro-Snape camp, but I DO understand why and how people remain so firmly set against him.

To that end, while my preference would be for him not to die and have to learn to live in a world without Voldemort (and his downfall) as a focal point for his life, and hopefully become a "better" and more whole person.

I acknowledge this is a bridge too far for many.

In that instance, I would have liked for him to die later (albeit probably not by much) but long enough for say, a hidden stash of his memories (put away in case of his death) to be discovered while the trio search for the Horcruxes in the castle.

This would have allowed an informed Harry to have a moment where he and Snape could meet with each knowing the whole story and hash things out. Either make a peace (or not). Which (to my mind) would have been a more honest and truthful forgiveness (or not) than one given after death when it's easy to do because you aren't confronted with the reality of that person anymore.
