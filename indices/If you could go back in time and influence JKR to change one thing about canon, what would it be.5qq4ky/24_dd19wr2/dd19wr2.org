Just redo the whole conflict. I want a Voldemort who, if you apply a very twisted logic, actually kind of does have a point in some ways. I mean, he is literally worse than Hitler, since even he did have a point in some ways, and did positive things, especially during his rise to power (not that I'm condoning nacism in any way). I want more insight into the lives of purebloods, especially the Black sisters. Make things a little more grey rather than just black and white. What was Azkaban actually like.

Other things would also include

more character development for other characters and Harry widening his social circle a little,

no Hermione/Ron,

new/no epilogue,

no timeturners,

Dumbledore who doesn't fluctuate between a wise old mentor and a clueless moron who likes to play Hunger Games with his students.

New tasks for the Triwizard Tournament. What's the point of watching a lake and a maze entrance?
