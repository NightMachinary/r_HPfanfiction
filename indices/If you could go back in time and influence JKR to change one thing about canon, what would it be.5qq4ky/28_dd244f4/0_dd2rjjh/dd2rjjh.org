  I mean come the fuck on she's characterized to resemble his own god damned dead mother. If him being with Ginny isn't one of the sickest examples of an Oedipus complex I don't know what is.

You gotta be kidding me. I think you are actually quite racist because you basically implied that all red-haired women must look alike.

In the Books, there were NOTHING that showed Ginny and Lily resembling each other: Ginny had flaming red hair, Lily dark red; Ginny was said to be 'short', Lily most likely not; They definitely had different facial features too.

Flitwick, McGonagall, Remus, Sirius, and Snape all knew Lily well, if Ginny looked so much like Lily as you said, why wouldn't anyone of them make a comment? These people had spent enough time with Ginny and Harry.

In fact, if there was ONE PERSON among Harry's friends who resembled his mother the most, it was HERMIONE: Muggleborn, bookish, studious, smart, headgirl material, had strong sense of justice, and hell of a temper.
