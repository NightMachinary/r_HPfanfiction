  Anybody but fucking Ginny Weasley really.

Anyone than the girl he genuinely loves and loves him back, who fit together in terms of personality, experiences, attraction and hobbies? Right.

  If him being with Ginny isn't one of the sickest examples of an Oedipus complex I don't know what is.

  this is my opinion

Yes, that's a (wrong) opinion, not a fact.

Ginny is more of a "normal" ginger, and Lily has dark red hair. In addition, there is allusion to Ginny having freckles, which isn't the case for Lily, Lily having green eyes and Ginny having brown, and Lily being taller than Ginny.

Even according to the Oedipal theory, this would be wrong, because according to it it develops between the ages of three to six - in the phallic stage. Harry was one year old when he lost his mother.

  If you have nothing supportive to say, then don't bother opening your gobs and saying anything.

So if we don't agree with your opinion, we should just shut up? Whatever happened to freedom of speech?
