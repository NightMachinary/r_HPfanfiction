I'm going to go with put Harry and Hermione together like they bloody well should have been in the first place. Or if not her then Luna. Anybody but fucking Ginny Weasley really. I mean come the fuck on she's characterized to resemble his own god damned dead mother. If him being with Ginny isn't one of the sickest examples of an Oedipus complex I don't know what is.

Now would also be a good time to mention this is my opinion which I'm entitled to have as I wish. Anybody who flames me on this is having their comments reported and are being blocked. If you have nothing supportive to say, then don't bother opening your gobs and saying anything.
