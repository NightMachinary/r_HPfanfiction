I don't think she needed to change anything in cannon, it is her story to tell so she put what was important to her story telling. However, if I could have influenced pottermore, I would have had her spend a lot more time finding in-universe ways of explaining the most common plot holes people complain about. Fan Fiction is a wonderful way to explore those plot holes, however I love the originals enough to wish for a serious attempt by JKR to give explanations for them.
