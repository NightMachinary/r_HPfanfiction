Honestly, I wish Harry had died. I think the ending, of him and all his close friends surviving and marrying each other without severe signs of psychological trauma is ridiculous. Him sacrificing himself would also have lent credence to the Ron/Hermione relationship, and generally have given more impact to the war.

Whilst I agree it was the best way for the series to progress, I do wish Sirius had had a better life - a few more years free with Harry would have been wonderful.
