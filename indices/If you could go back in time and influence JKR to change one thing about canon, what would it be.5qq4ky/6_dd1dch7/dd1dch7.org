I would have some Slytherins decide to stay to fight the Battle for Hogwarts on the good side, and I would at least have it hinted that Snape had something happy in his life before he died. Maybe he had a girlfriend he had to break it off with when Voldemort started to return, but it really gets me down that he didn't have anybody to love him and probably died a virgin (messed up Death Eater stuff doesn't count in my books).
