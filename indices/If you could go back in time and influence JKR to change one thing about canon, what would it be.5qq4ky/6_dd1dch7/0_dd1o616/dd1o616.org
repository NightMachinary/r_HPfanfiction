In my head canon, he definitely had other happy relationships but didn't want to get too attached because he thought of himself as a Death Eater and was full of guilt for causing Lily's death. Canon isn't very specific about this, since it's from Harry's perspective, and Snape would have no reason to give trivial memories to Harry as he was dying.
