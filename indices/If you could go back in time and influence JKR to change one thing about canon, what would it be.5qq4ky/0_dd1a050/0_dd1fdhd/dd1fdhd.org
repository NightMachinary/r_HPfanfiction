  Have Ginny interact with Harry/the trio more in earlier books.

She made Ginny into Harry's soulmate, and yet refused to give her a big role. It was a contradiction in itself. Hermione and Ron each appeared roughly 7000 times in the series, Ginny only about 800 times. This discrepancy for a supposedly important character is simply too big. Ginny especially got short changed in Book 7, 100 more pages (would still be shorter than OoTP) about what happened at Hogwarts would go a long way to improve her standing among readers.
