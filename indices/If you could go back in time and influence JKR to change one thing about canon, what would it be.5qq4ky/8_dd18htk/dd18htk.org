I have a few options, if it was a matter of editorial influence:

- Have Hermione discover the Time Turner in some tricky mystery thing, and that changing Sirius' fate is what breaks the thing.

- Make the Goblet of Fire the trophy of the Tournament, a Divination device of ancient reputation that is held by the winning school until the next Tournament

- Show the Order being active and useful, even if they are defeated half the time (unable to keep Voldemort from breaking out his allies in Azkaban; losing Amelia Bones)

But of late I think the greatest mistake she made was having Ron betray Harry's trust in 4th year; it was out of character- in fact, it broke his character for the rest of the series. If Ron had stayed a stand-up loyal friend all the way through, people wouldn't be half as bent out of shape about him and Hermione getting together. He should have been a bro- the getaway guy; the one who gets Harry access to information about their culture in a way as cool as the twins.
