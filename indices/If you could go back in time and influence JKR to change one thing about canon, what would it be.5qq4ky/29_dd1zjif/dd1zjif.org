Make Harry smart and independent (because this would snowball the most IMHO - chain-reaction/ripple-effect and all that!) and give him sense or wonder and a thirst to proof himself and to learn (I know, multiple things, right? - Wrong, because they only change one "thing" (well: One PERSON!))

This way a lot of "stupidity" can be avoided (no rushing to the ministry to "free" Sirius and no shitty plan to hunt for the horcruxes by stumbling along like blind fools without any plan what so ever etc. etc. etc.!)
