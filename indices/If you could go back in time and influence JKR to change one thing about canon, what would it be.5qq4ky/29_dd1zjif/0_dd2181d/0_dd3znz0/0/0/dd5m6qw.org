If you're talking about Fluffy they could just play music since they did that anyway. The plan in first year wasn't terrible. If I sounded pretentious I didn't mean to.

I'm saying that their plans weren't good. The second year they barely tried telling a teacher (Who wasn't Lockhart, don't know why they told him anyway since he thought he was an idiot). Then Harry & Ron decide that the best course of action is going into the old chamber with a snake that they know will be large and can kill with it's eyes.

Third year was okay since the first part of it happened out of chance and they didn't really have a chance to do anything else. Though they could have planned a bit more since they had time-travel before going back in time.

Fourth year, he tries to out-fly a dragon (and admittedly succeeds). Second task don't have anything against the plan (Though I do have against the people runnning the tournament, they made it sound like whoever was down there would be left there forever. They are running a competition where challengers can die, why would the students expect that there friends wouldn't have the possibility of dying too.) Third task, I thought Harry was competitive though I don't see anything wrong with him taking the cup with Cedric.

Fifth year, they literally named their group "Dumbledore's Army", which isn't the best thing to do when Umbridge was already looking for excuses, and left all the people's names on a list (correct me if it was disguised or something). In fifth year (later in the year) they did what I said in my last message, which even if they couldn't floo there (The Minister did, but also of course he is the Minister). Of course its weird that the order appeared after they'd already gotten there. (Not saying manipulative Dumbledore like some stories, but it was just for the plot.)
