I despise the epilogue because it's a happy ending for the sake of a happy ending instead of being a part of the story that was necessary to wrap things up. Everyone is happily married with kids and those in need of redemption have been redeemed. Like most things, it's a problem stemming from the not always well-done mesh of children literature and YA.
