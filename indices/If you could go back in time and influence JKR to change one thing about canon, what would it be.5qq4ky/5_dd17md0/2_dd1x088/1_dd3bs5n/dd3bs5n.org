What I didn't like about the epilogue is that it closed the canon saga completely with it that fanfic writers are force to either conform on her idea of an ending or fanfic writers needed to write AU stories in writing post Hogwarts stories. It wouldn't be a problem it was a good ending but the epilogue came of as underwhelming to an amazing series. I feel like Harry still would have other great adventures after defeating Voldemort that J.K. Should have left the story open-ended. Plus the epilogue sort of implies that nothing has really change in the magical world. Prejudice is still present in their society and wizards still abuse magic on muggles (referring to Ron admitting to confounding a tester to get his muggle license)

I never bothered to read Cursed Child once I heard it's a continuation of the epilogue. Is it really that bad?
