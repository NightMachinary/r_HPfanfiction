I liked the alternative perspective chapters in Books 1, 4, 6, and 7. They added more depth and intrigue to the overall plot of the book.

In one of her old interviews, JKR mentioned almost writing a chapter including a conversation between Slytherins Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott. This would be something different to read about, as long as it would be after Book 2.

Something I'd like to but won't happen with JKR is fixing up all the mathematics inconsistencies.
