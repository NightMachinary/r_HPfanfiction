Slughorn fought - and he was the head of Slytherin. Andromeda fought against Voldemort and she was Slytherin.

It was only the current generation in canon we didn't see producing anything other than black (or at best Grey) Slytherins.

For my own part I always wanted there to have been a much clearer redemption of Draco - a moment he CHOSE to be better/different rather than simply failing to pull off being evil. As it stands now I feel the epilogue implies that nothing has changed and history is doomed to repeat itself. If we had a clear "breaking of the cycle" with either Slytherin as a whole, or simply Draco as a figurehead breaking with the traditional perception of what it is to be Slytherin I would have had more hope.
