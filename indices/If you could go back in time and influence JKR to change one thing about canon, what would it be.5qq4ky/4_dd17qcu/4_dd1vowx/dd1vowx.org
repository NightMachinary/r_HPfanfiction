  Thirdly, I never really understood the conflict in the books. It doesn't make sense. From what I have gathered the Purebloods already have power. I can understand that they don't want Muggleborns in their society. But why would they try to achieve that through an armed struggle? Wouldn't passing legislation favoriing purebloods better further their agenda? I mean they were already doing that though? With the ministry being corrupt. So why the armed struggle?

Don't think of the Purebloods as one unified group. There are Purebloods in power and there are purebloods not in power. There are even Purebloods that have some power but want more. There are factions. And Voldemort was recruiting from those groups that were unsatisfied with their place, from second and third sons of Pureblood families who would never inherit the estate or the Wizengamot seat, from families that had been politically outmanoeuvred and lacked the power they felt they deserve. He gave them a scapegoat they could blame all the ills in their lives on, the Muggleborn who was promoted for competence over the /proper/ deserving person, the Halfblood who built their business with their own hands and took customers away from the ill-managed floundering Pureblood-owned shop.

They never had enough sway that they could dictate the laws.
