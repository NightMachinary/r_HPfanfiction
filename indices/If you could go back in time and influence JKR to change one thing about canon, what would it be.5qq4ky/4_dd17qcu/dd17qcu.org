My biggest issue with the book is the Slytherin house or rather how it is viewed. Imagine being isolated, ostracized and hated on. They put a hat on your head to decide whether you would be good or evil at a young age of 11.

So if I had the choice I wouldn't make everything so Black and White. Slytherin might have a bad reputation but Slytherin wouldn't be synonymous for evil. It really bothers me that no one from Slytherin stayed behind to fight. How is that even possible? Some may argue that Rowling changed her mind later and gave an interview but to me only the books are canon. We don't really know much about anyone from Slytherin besides a few people and they are all used to display prejudices.

Secondly, I'd like to know more about other characters besides the trio. Maybe Harry should increase his social-circle. Maybe branch out? idk.

Thirdly, I never really understood the conflict in the books. It doesn't make sense. From what I have gathered the Purebloods already have power. I can understand that they don't want Muggleborns in their society. But why would they try to achieve that through an armed struggle? Wouldn't passing legislation favoriing purebloods better further their agenda? I mean they were already doing that though? With the ministry being corrupt. So why the armed struggle?

These are my main issues with the book.

I just remembered, another thing I dislike about the book is how much luck was involved. I don't know if Dumbledore had a bit of Trelwaney in him... but I doubt he was a seer. So how sure was he that his plan would work? If Voldemort did find out about the Horcruxes then it would have been very easy for him to get them and throw them somewhere in the sea. Harry did cut it pretty close in canon. Voldemort does find out after the Goblet, A lot could have gone wrong with Dumbledore's plan and it did. So it was just luck that everything worked out and that's is my issue. It could have ended in a tragedy just as easily. Harry Potter was supposed to die.
