She should learn better math. 3000 wizards (1000 of them Hogwarts students) are not enough for a nation that not only has a functional government, free health care, free education. public transportation. multiple professional sport teams. multiple newspapers , a prison island, legal prosecution and is still able to be oppressive to a dozen species or so. The number of 1000 students in Hogwarts is also large compared to the number of students in harry s year, but it also doesn't make sense compared to the number of teachers. I would make her add a multiple number of wizarding villages and towns in Britain and increase the number of wizards and witches to around 60000 and the number of hogwarts students to around 4200 so each year would have 600 new people and each house around 150, i would still have them live in rooms of five and have classes with five other gryffindor girls and 10 members of other houses. i would also have her ad a whole bunch of other teachers and classes and staff to deal with these extra students ( why doesn't Hogwarts have a barber? does their head of house cut their Hair? Did Snape cut Dracos hair?) i would also make harry interact with other students more even people who are unpopular get to know their classmates better than harry knows his and he is on a boarding school
