Yeah but what I dislike about Ginny is that she acts like a slag when she dates dudes. Her and Ron. Maybe it's a Weasley trait as I remember Molly mentioning they once was caught by the old Game Keeper as well. But both Ginny and Ron's extreme public displays of affection put me off. I'm just glad Harry and Hermione didn't act like that when they were dating Victor and Cho.
