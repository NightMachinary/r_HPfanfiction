Everyone did approach Harry not just Ron and Hermione, but Harry just wasn't very sociable to make that many friends because of his upbringing.

  Also, Harry probably wouldn't put up with Ron's shit if he had more friends.

Lol, by this logic why should Ron have to put up with Harry's shit then (e.g. OotP)? What does Ron get out of his friendship with Harry? Oh that's right being perpetually overshadowed (like Hermione said) whilst always being in danger from going on reckless adventures with Harry. But hey, Harry could do anything and it's excusable because he is the hero right?

  If Harry had a larger group of friends, then Ron's behavior would only stand out more and look even worse.

How many friends are willing to die for Harry then? Do you realise being Harry's friend is not exactly easy or nice at times?
