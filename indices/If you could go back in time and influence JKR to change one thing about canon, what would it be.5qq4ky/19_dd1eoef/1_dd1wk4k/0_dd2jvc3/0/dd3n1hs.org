Maybe. But I don't think that would change how people reacted. Remember that the kids, as opposed to adults, would likely be more awed and possibly intimidated by Harry. I don't think they'd be more likely to approach him, just more likely to gossip about him and stare at him.

We see how the adults react to him and it's pretty convincing of adult reactions - ie different from children's.
