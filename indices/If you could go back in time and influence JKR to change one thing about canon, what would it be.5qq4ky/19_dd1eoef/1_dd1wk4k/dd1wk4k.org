About approaching famous Harry - there was a young movie star in my college class (a recognisable one whom most people could name his movies and character if not his actual name) - and with 450 kids in my college there were plenty of opportunities to bump into him and pretty much everyone did. Did anyone act weird and approach him purely about it? No. We were all there to learn, and those who made friends with him did, and those who didn't didn't bat an eyelid at him going about college. It's far more realistic to me now having seen how people actually act.

However, we are in the Uk and not America, which I believe is far more forward and possibly would be a bit different. But then, so is HP, so, comparison still stands.
