Actually 4 things:

1. No time turners, period.

2. No Barty impersonating Moody plot, this just makes Dumbledore too incompetent and negligent, make him impersonating his dad Barty Sr instead.

3. Remove inconsistencies with the Trace, don't let Tom Riddle avoid it just by using a different wand, and don't let it screw over Harry whenever you feel it's convenient.

4. This one comes off directly from #3, so no Flight of the 7 Potters nonsense. If you want to kill off Hedwig and Moody, at least do it in a more convincing way.

In fact, I would also get rid of the overused prophecy trope. Pretty much every fantasy story, even sci-fis like Starwars and Matrix, is resorting to that (boring) thing. I really hope JKR could break the mold and come up with something more original.
