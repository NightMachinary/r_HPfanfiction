  while Riddle's spell goes ignored for occurring in the Gaunt's house, which is ignored for being a known wizarding household.

But the spell used is the Imperius Curse, which is supposed to be unforgivable and should trigger an immediate investigation.

I'm not sure that there is a plothole here though. So long as Riddle uses Gaunt's wand, and Gaunt's wand does not have a trace on it, then there's no problem.
