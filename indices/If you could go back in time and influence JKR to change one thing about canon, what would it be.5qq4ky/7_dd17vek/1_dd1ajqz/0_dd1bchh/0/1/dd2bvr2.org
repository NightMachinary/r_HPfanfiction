  But the spell used is the Imperius Curse, which is supposed to be unforgivable and should trigger an immediate investigation.

We do know, (as [[/u/wordhammer][u/wordhammer]] said) that the trace works on the person rather than the wand and even during the events of Harry's story it is fairly imprecise, only showing that “oh, in this place there's some magic used and there's some underage wizard/witch nearby”; the only reason it was possible for anyone in the ministry to blame Dobby's magic on Harry was the lack of any other juvenile wizards (or witches) in the area.

And consider this, though: We don't know the exact state of the wizarding world and the trace during Tom's youth, and for all we know a delayed action might have been all they could have done. Alternatively, they knew the Gaunts in some way or form and thought it best to wait until whatever happened ended.

With that, they'd arrive later, knowing that /spells/ had been used and /maybe/ knowing that there were unforgivables amongst them and again /maybe/ knowing what those were. Since the Priori Incantato spell only shows the last spell cast with a wand, with only one wand (Morfin's) they didn't really have a way to check if he was the one casting all the spells or only the last one; for all they knew, it might have been that some underage wizard just happened to be nearby when Morfin went on a rampage, and since there weren't wizards living there other than the Gaunts and Tom's connection to them nobody knew it wasn't like anyone would think it Tom's doing.
