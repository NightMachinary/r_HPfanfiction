  We do know, (as [[/u/wordhammer][u/wordhammer]] said) that the trace works on the person rather than the wand

No we don't.

In Dobby's case Harry's wand was in the cupboard - very close to the spell he cast.

It may even be that the trace is on both the person and their wand together, rather than either individually, and stops working if the two are separated.
