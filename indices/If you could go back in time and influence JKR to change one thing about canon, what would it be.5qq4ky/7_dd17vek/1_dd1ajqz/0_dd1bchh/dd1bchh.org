I had noticed that Dumbledore's explanation doesn't stand up to what he described. I came up with an alternate theory that does fit though: Riddle used the Imperius on Morfin and commanded him to go up the hill and kill the muggles in the manor. That way his memory about the events are accurate and match with his wand use, while Riddle's spell goes ignored for occurring in the Gaunt's house, which is ignored for being a known wizarding household.
