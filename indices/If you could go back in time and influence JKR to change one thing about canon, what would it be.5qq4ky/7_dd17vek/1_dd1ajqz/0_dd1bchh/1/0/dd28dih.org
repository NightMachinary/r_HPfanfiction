I had forgotten about that, but in reviewing the passage at the beginning of book 4, it only mentions that Frank Bryce saw a pale, dark-haired teen around the house that day. The implication is that Frank was seeing Tom as he either approached or departed the scene of the crime, but I would submit that it's logically plausible that Tom was there, spying on the situation before going to the Gaunts to get more information and decide on his plan. Frank would have been the only one to see him around since he was a groundskeeper; folks in the village avoided the Riddles because they were upper-class pricks and the Riddle's maid was working indoors.
