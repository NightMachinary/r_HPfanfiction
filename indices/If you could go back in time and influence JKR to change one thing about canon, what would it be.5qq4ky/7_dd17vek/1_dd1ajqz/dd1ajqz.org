Not that I disagree with you about the trace (it is inconsistent) but Tom Riddle did not escape the trace by using a different wand according to the text.

Tom Riddle took Morfin's wand to provide more evidence for Morfin being the culprit via Prior Incantato.

#+begin_quote
  He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.

According to Dumbledore the Ministry:

#+begin_quote
  ...can detect magic, but not the perpetrator
#+end_quote

Which just doesn't make sense in the context of Tom Riddle's actions. Why after all didn't the Ministry wonder what an Under Age Wizard was doing in Little Hangleton to allow them to detect Morfin's magic?
