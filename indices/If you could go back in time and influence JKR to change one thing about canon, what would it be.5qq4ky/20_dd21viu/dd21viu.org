I'd ask her not to kill off Remus and Tonks. I felt like it added nothing but leaving Teddy with no parents. And keep Fred. I think the death of Colin alone would have been enough death to get a point across. I feel like the death of an underage child was pushed aside because of everything else...That's just me though.
