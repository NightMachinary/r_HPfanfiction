I would remove the repeated references in HBP to Harry struggling with magic. They don't really add anything to the story and rather give the impression that Harry has barely learnt anything all year, which is rather depressing given that he's just found out that the outcome of the war rests on him. His complete failure with non-verbal spells is particularly annoying given that previously we had seen repeated examples of him having strong willpower and focus.

It's just a few sentences here and there but I think removing them would have a disproportionately positive effect on my opinion of HBP.

This is especially true given that he opens DH casting a load of spells we never saw him learn in HBP, meaning he was studying defensive magic during that year. It just never got mentioned.
