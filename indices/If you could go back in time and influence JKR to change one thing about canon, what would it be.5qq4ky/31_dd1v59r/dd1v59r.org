Severus/Hermione would be cannon.

Edit: Okay, I kept a straight face about that for precisely 2 minutes. Sermione is a whimsy, a desire founded and propagated on the fandom that would have ruined Rowling's publications due to condoning a teacher/student relationship. A hint toward it would have been lovely, but doesn't fit the publication and would honestly have completely changed the story. Really, I would want Severus to have stayed alive - for the same reasons that Rowling wanted Hermione and Ron together - but he honestly would have lead a miserable half life. Death was the best thing for him, though the death of his old life would have been better instead of his entire life - that wasn't in the cards for him without some sort of happy piece to his life. Really, really, I would obliterate the epilogue from memory. If it hadn't existed there would have probably been a lot more inventive FanFictions at the beginning, and the pairings wouldn't have generally been confined to cannon for so long. For the most part, I agree with the nit picks of all the other commenters. The time turner was used wrong, very wrong. Harry was not psychologically abused or disturbed, at least to the extent that not being loved and being called 'freak' should have left him. Ron shouldn't have given in to his jealousy and then returned when he saw the dragon, Hermione is alive - he should have know what sort of events would be a part of the competition before hand, especially with him wanting to enter. Plus, Harry is always in danger. Always. And, the magic in the series has come to run me the wrong way. Voldemort discovered a way to obtain immortality in /school/ that we have to assume no one else ever found and used. We have to assume that the only reason Harry actually won was because he has been fighting all his life, Voldemort was weakened due to the death of 6/7th of his soul and he is a child of prophecies and thus essentially inherently a Demi-God of some sort. And Flamel! He just /died/ right? Well, if I knew the secret to the stone I would make another for safe keeping and if I was 600+ years old I would probably have enough common sense to send a duplicate and, would be magically and intellectually superior and thus probably capable of /leaving the planet/ if I was being hunted down and didn't want to fight back or interfere in the lives of mere /mortals/.
