It is certainly a pairing that grew on me, like a parasite that won't let go any more than the series will. I tried not to like them at first, the rational part of my brain knew there was something intrinsically wrong with the former student and teacher falling in love. All the same, if they hadn't been in that position we might have been presented with the story of characters like Jane Eyre and Rochester, a man more than twice her age, who fall in love due to their character. I won't try and rationalize it, but I will point out that a majority of the well-composed SSHG fics are post-Hogwarts or overly rationalized. The community isn't about the teacher/student relationship, it's about the common ground between them and overcoming societies definitions of normal to be happy. At least, that's how I see it most days.
