Yes it is, but this is Magical Britain, an isolated, throwback to almost Victorian Britain. It may seem normal in 2019 UK, but in a rural or aristocratic community form 40/50 years ago would not, and that is what I believe JKR based herself in. I'm confident no character in her books uses /issue/ in that sense. I'm normally reluctant to make corrections, not my business, but too many anachronisms or Americanisms can put me off. This, I think, would be one.
