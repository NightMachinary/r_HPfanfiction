Dark Hermione conversion challenge. (Note, I don't read Hermione stories so I have never attempted to read a Dark Hermione, so this is my stab at how I think it could happen, ones where she's just evil at 11 and/or been raised by Death Eaters are just silly.)

Why is Hitler often considered the benchmark of evil over Stalin or Mao who were responsible for far more deaths? Why do most Historians not paint Lenin and the other communist dictators as the worst people to have ever lived?

For better or for worse we have a tendency to judge intentions over consequences. Rent control for example, historically has led to worse living conditions for the poor since Landlords have less incentive to look after their properties and builders would rather build expensive places exempt from rent control to sell for far more money. However it is still a popular policy amongst many since its intentions are to make living affordable even though in operation it has been found to have the opposite effect. Hitler's campaign was based around the superiority of the german people and securing them a better future, something others deem a poor intention when looking at what that meant for non-aryans. The communist dictators tried to make life better for everyone and create a little utopia, instead their people died by the millions.

Hermione has shown tendencies to believe she knows best and that she thinks little of others opinions when they don't come from those she deems clever, I.E Hogwarts teaching staff. She has also shown a stubborn streak, an unwillingness to back down over what she believes herself to be right. See house elves and the firebolt in the third book, Scabbers too. Remember what the road to hell is paved with?

Is it hard to believe after seeing the failings of the wizarding world she would want to help? From her point of view she knows the solutions, everyone has always told her how brilliant she is. If she was given a chance wouldn't she try to implement them since it would make life better for everyone? Now, what happens if people disagree? Well she knows best. If people are holding back progress then railroad them, they are traitors to the future. What do you do if people aren't agreeing with you or helping, you MAKE them or you get rid of them. Historically most authoritarian states within the last century have started out with someone trying to help others. When faced with opposition they clamp down on dissent.

Hermione being evil might not make sense, especially in stories where she's evil for the sake of being evil but if you look at what she might do in the name of the greater good, in trying to help others then she can begin her descent. What is right is not always easy the books tell us, to fix the wizarding world would be hard and come with a high cost but in the end would it be worth it, would it have been the right thing to do? She might be seen as evil but for her, she was always trying to do the right thing. Outsiders see her as evil, she is a girl trying to make a difference.
