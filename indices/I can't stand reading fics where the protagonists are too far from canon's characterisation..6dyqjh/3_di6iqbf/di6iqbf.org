For me, it depends on how they change. A Snape who ended up in Ravenclaw (for example) could be quite different, still have the same lonely anger and longing for acceptance, but go about everything in different ways. A Snape who lives the same life as canon but ends up a nice person...no.

I also don't mind a different interpretation of more minor characters. Harry sees the Weasley twins as fun and clever, but Percy may well see them as borderline malicious bullies. Unreliable and biased narrators can be a great storytelling tool.

Dark Hermione is one I have never managed to find believable though. I can believe her as bossy and ruthless and a bit of a bitch, but never dark and evil. Feel free to change my mind!
