A Dark Lady Hermione just makes no sense. But if you show Hermione during the war I can see her doing things people like "all Slytherins are evil" Ron would consider dark. Because she knows history and draws the parallels between the Muggleborn discrimination and the Holocaust. The ministry was building concentration camps for muggleborns and that could be a good point for Hermione to "go dark" in order to help the people. Because stunners won't win the war. Imagine fighting an armored division with tasers.

But that asks the question, what is dark? Using lethal force in a war? Using magic that purposely hurts instead of a quick death? Killing any Death Eater on sight? Causing civilian casualties?

Because that's how you win a war. And you need a total victory in order to discredit an ideology.
