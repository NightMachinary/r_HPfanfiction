Now this might come across as a bit dickish but if you want canon characterisation then avoid AU, people like Northumbrian, FloreatCastellum do wonderful post Hogwarts stories where they attempt to keep the canon feel. The story you linked has AU as the first thing in the summary. Personally I think AUs where they try and keep canon personalities are worse. A person is shaped by their experiences, in AU or rewrites the author wants to change this so Harry will experience different things and therefore be a different person.

In my opinion it is a miracle that Harry coming from the background he did is such a nice person and so trusting. Maybe there is the potential for mumbo-jumbo involving the horcux in his head containing so much hate that to repel it he became super nice but really he'd have every reason to be a dick. I can therefore understand why people might want to write darker, or more solitary Harry's. They will write with what they can understand and engage with. A lot of fanfiction starts with the idea of what if? Now like it or loathe it, it can raise interesting ideas. If Harry was more lonely and less trusting would he have still gone into Gryffindor? What consequences does that have? Poor characterisation is when the eleven year old speaks like an adult or their actions and personality are opposed or it is shaped by experiences they never had.

If we look at canon Harry what sort of personality do we see? We actually miss most of his day to day interactions with people and tend to follow him in high pressure scenarios.We know that he always tries to do the right thing but how much of this stems from his innate nature and how much from Dumbledore at the end of first year? He isn't overly friendly, he only has two close friends and seems on speaking terms with a few more but for the most part is rather isolated. He's young enough to not be aware of his own mortality, racing drivers get slower after they start a family when they realise they have something they need to come home to, they don't take the same risks. Harry will always take the guilt and tends not to blame others, is this from the Dursley's where he would have become accustomed to being blamed for things he didn't do or at least didn't intend? If Harry isn't raised by the Dursleys as in some AUs then I could understand this not being a thing for Harry any more.

Harry Potter is the half-blood son of James and Lily Potter, his Godfather is Sirius Black. He has muggle relatives through his mother. That is what he was born with, heck I've seen his date of birth moved, everything else is shaped by his life. If his life is different so too would be Harry.
