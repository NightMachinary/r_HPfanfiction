I just don't like stories where they are too far from canon characterization for no reason, but if Harry has a different upbringing or experiences different things then it wouldn't make sense if he were the same person we know from canon. Eg the 'Slytherin Harry' stories... If not Hagrid, but someone less direct about such matters introduces him to the magical world and Harry never gets told that Slytherin is the House that produced many dark wizards/Voldemort supporters he wouldn't argue with the hat and could end up there. What follows would be Harry spending his formative years in a different environment, with different people, making different friends etc. Basically I want realistic characterization, and if that differs from canon in a way that makes sense, I'm all for it.
