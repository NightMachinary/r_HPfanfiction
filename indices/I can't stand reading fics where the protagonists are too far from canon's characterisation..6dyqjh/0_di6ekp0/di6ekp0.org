AUs are kinda my jam, so I'm more lax about divergent characterization ... /buuuuuut/ ... I prefer there to 1) be a good in-story reason for it, and 2) the canon personality should be the foundation for the altered one. They can be different, but recognizably so.

Otherwise people might as well put OCs into the story -- it's more honest and I'll probably nitpick it a hell of a lot less.

  Even if Daphne has no established personality in canon, she's written as Lily 2.0.

That's easier than having to characterize from scratch, I imagine.
