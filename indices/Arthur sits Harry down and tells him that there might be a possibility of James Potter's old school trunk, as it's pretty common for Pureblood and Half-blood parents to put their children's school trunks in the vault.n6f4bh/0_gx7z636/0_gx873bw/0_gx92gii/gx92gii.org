If you don't mind me expanding on this, then here's my entries:

Items 17 to 20 are extremely faithful recreations of the US Navy battleships /Iowa/, /New Jersey/, /Missouri/, and /Wisconsin/, who's guns (yes, /all of them/) have the same effect as the railway gun. And the best thing? They're controlled via your thoughts, and as long as the ship(s) are in range of the target, all you have to do is think of them shelling it and they will.

Item 21 is a special one; a model of Ohio-class Ballistic Missile Submarine /Wyoming/, with the same controls as the battleships, except it fires /real nukes/, and you choose between miniature nukes (which are about the size of a .50 caliber bullet) or a full sized nuke.

Item 22 is a model of Thomas the Tank Engine; which, through the power of magic, has been given sentience. The thing is, so long as it is given permission (as to prevent accidents), it will act as a mini-commander for the railway gun, the planes, and the ships, giving you an easy way to kill behind enemy lines that most will never suspect. (and it can tow the railway gun, so assassinations are super duper easy)
