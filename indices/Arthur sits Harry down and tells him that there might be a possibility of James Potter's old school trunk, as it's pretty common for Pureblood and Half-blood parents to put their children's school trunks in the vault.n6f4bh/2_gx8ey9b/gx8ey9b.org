Harry opens it up to find indy!James inside a massive 500 room castle-chateau, radiating with so much power that lasers are constantly shooting out of his eyes and he is passively levitating at all times. He is training endlessly in dueling stances with sixteen time turners swinging from his neck, while magical clones of Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix Black put on a triplet strip-tease in the background, moaning erotically and swinging their legs around like Bayonetta during a cut scene.

He slowly closes the trunk and re-locks it. He maintains, until his dying day, that his father died on the same night his mother did, valiantly trying to defend him from Lord Voldemort.

Some things are better left under lock and key.
