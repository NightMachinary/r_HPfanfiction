Honestly, I can imagine both. For shipping, a grand romance would just be weird. But them using each other physically to fill the holes in their hearts, and over time this coping mechanisms becomes an actual relationship.

Alternatively, her and Harry grow closer when he comes to visit Teddy and she tries to live through Harry, becoming a sort of nosy aunt who takes him under his wing. I can see Ginny included in that because her mother isn't coping well with the death of her son.
