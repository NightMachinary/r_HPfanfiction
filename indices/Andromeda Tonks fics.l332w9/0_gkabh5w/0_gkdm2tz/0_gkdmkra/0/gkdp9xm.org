I mean I'm not going to claim that it would be the most normal relationship, but at that point Andromeda is 42-47. And with at least 50% higher life expectancy, she still has at least another 10 years where she could still have children on her own.

There would definitely be a "wtf are we doing" moment, or even a few, but I honestly don't see Andromeda caring about social expectations (she married Edward after all), and Harry never particularly cared either.

But my perception is tinted by my headcanon and I certainly envision her a lot more bitter and vengeful than most. No happy reunion for Narcissa, but disdain because she was always very self-serving. I can easily see Andromeda having a higher opinion of Bellatrix, who never lied about her allegiances and went out fighting rather than switching sides like a ping-pong ball.
