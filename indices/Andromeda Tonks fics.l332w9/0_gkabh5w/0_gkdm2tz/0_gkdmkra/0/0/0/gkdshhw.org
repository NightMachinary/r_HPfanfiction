Hmm, that could also happen, but it would be very awkward to say the least. Especially when Harry brings his girlfriend/wife with him.

The obvious solution would be a triad, but I honestly can't see that happening since the way their relationship came to be would basically be an unhealthy codependence. Inserting a third into that would be a lot more difficult than into most others.
