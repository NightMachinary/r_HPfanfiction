I would like these, too. Her being adoptive aunty/mother to Harry after the war, NO RELATIONSHIP, is something I would love to read.

Day-to-day life of Harry helping Mrs. Tonks with Teddy and Andromeda teaching Harry what his parents can't. Harry doesn't want to go to Mrs. Weasley because she doesn't quite get it. Yes, she's lost a son, but he and Andromeda have lost almost everything. So, Andromeda helps heal, teach, and smother Harry with motherly love.
