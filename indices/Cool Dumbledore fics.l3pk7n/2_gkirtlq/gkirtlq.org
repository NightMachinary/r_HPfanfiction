Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay has one of the best Dumbledores I've ever seen in fanfiction. Competent at handling the Ministry and taking a good approach to the Horcrux Hunt (near-miss with the ring notwithstanding), while still being full "Alas, Earwax".

The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond, a sadly abandoned soulbond fic, has another very fun Dumbledore who participates in snowball fights and continually dodges paperwork while trolling a few rule-breakers on the side.
