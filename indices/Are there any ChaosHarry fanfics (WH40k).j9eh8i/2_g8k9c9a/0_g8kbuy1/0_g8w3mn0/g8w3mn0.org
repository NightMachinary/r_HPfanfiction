Warhammer Fantasy Battle (Just Warhammer when it started out) was the original miniatures ruleset for tabletop battles in an Extruded Fantasy Product setting (which eventually got fleshed out into a quite good late-medieval/early-early-modern mostly-Europe fantasy setting.) Factions are your standard Elfs/Orcs/Men/Dwarfs with sub-variations for flavour and a couple of unique-to-the-setting minor factions.

Warhamer 40,000 was the sci-fi spinoff of Warhammer Fantasy (literally the same rules in the first edition) that eventually ended up way more popular and got its core IP licensed out for video games. The factions are: Catholic Space Nazis, Catholic Space Nazis in Power Armour, Catholic Space Nazi Nuns With Flamethrowers, BDSM Space Elves, Machiavellian Space Elves, Space-Fungus Football Hooligans, The All-Devouring Swarm Of Bugs, Five Different Flavours Of Omnicidal Chaos Maniacs, Robot Space Pharaohs, and the Happy Smiley Sunshine Space-Caste Cult. There are some minor factions and variants, and the sadly-retconned-out-of-existence Space Dwarfs, but those are the main ones. Whole thing was a Bungit Stew of every other sci-fi setting from the previous century of genre fiction, which evolved into the current setting once they hired some actual writers.

Warhammer Age of Sigmar is the sequel to the now-discontinued Warhammer Fantasy Battle, and is its own whole new setting, but it came out after I got bored of it all and sold my toy soldiers, so I'm hazy on the details.
