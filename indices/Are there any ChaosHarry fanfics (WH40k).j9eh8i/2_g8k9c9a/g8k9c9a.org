I had to look up that wh40k is a video game and Chaos is a thing from it. There is a fanfic where Harry is General Chaos of the Chaos Legion, but it's not related to wh40k. That isn't the fic you're looking for. It can go about its business. Move along. The Force gives you control over mismatching fics.
