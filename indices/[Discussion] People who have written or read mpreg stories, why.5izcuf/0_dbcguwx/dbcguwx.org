I don't like reading about pregnancy. However, children are a large part of people's lives, so if magic would allow men to have children, some men would have children.

Albus Dumbledore is semi-canonically gay. Some stories (eg Firebird's Son) have put him in heterosexual relationships and then given him children. I have a story hanging around on my hard drive in which he has a husband with whom he has had children -- and so, when Harry is orphaned, he and his husband, Afton Perks, choose to raise Harry along with their daughter, Sally-Anne.

Mpreg in the backstory, and some discussion of it. But with fpreg, you don't usually hear details about how widely dilated the parent's cervix was, or how many stitches their perineum required, so I'm likewise circumspect about the mechanics of male pregnancy.
