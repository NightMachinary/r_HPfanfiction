First, we're speaking of a world where magical beings exist: vampires, werewolves, merpeople, goblins, Veela, giants, and probably others that aren't leaping to mind. We have Metamorphmagi and Animagi---people who can transform theirselves at will into other shapes or animals---so, if all that is possible, why would mpreg be so wildly outside the realm of possibility, given that the impossible already exists? It is, for the purpose of my story, simply another state of being.

The basis for the story was that the ability for men to conceive and carry a child to term was something most pureblood (born of two magical parents) wizards could do, but when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect, the Ministry found a way to suppress the ability. It wasn't until Harry, who was raised in the Muggle world, became pregnant was the plot discovered.

One of the things I consciously avoided was falling into some of the typical mpreg traps. There are no bizarre cravings, no wild mood swings, no bursting into tears at a moment's notice. There wasn't quite enough body horror, but that's not something I write well. The "mystery", such as it was, was a bit too easy to figure out, but on the whole, I'm damned proud of that story.
