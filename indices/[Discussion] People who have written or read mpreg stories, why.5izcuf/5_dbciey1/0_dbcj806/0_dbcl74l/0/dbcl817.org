  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry Potter fell in love with Severus Snape---and that is where our story begins. All Harry wanted was a quiet year to finish his education, but when the Sorting Hat raises the spectre of Voldemort reborn and Luna is telling him he's going to change the world, a quiet year becomes impossible.
