tl;dr: I am not bothered by male pregnancy at all.

I never understood why authors go that route instead of using a surrogate carrier that can add more depth and detail to a story by being there. We can then learn what this character likes, dislikes, and a bit about their past. Is this character a previous friend or a new character that the MC went through an agency to find? Is she a pure-blood? Bias? Hateful of the MC? So many questions that could be answered and learned from.

MPREG comes off as lazy and unintuitive writing.

The two characters could do their thing in a potion which would then be drunk by the female and boom, impregnated! Then traits from both males can go in. It's magic, who cares about inconsistencies.

Of course, I do find a pregnant Harry amusing with how he acts, but I would rather a new character be introduced and remain in the story then take the lazy route and just have Harry (or the bottom) do it.
