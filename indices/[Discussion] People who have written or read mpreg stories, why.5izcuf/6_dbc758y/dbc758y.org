The problem I have with it is that it often becomes the defining feature of the story. Instead of just moving on with the story, the authors need to spend chapters upon chapters justifying their reasons and excuses, instead of just leaving it as is. Other than that, most slash pairings are "wrong" to me. Nothing against homosexuality, but I throw up when I read SnapexHarry or HarryxDumbledore. Sometimes, just sometimes, it works out, and I guess its allright, if the story is otherwise good.
