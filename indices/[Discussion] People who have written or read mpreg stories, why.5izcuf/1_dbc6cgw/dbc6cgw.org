I don't read them intentionally. Sometimes you just stumble into one and wonder to yourself, "How willing am I to suspend disbelief today?" In a fandom that revolves around books/movies concerning a /magic school/, my answer is usually obvious. The concept isn't synonymous with bad writing. Weird plot, maybe, but I can work with trash sometimes.

I think authors write it because they want a slash pairing /and/ familial bliss (he has your eyes, Harry) or angst (he has your nose, any-HP-adult-male). To each his own, I guess.
