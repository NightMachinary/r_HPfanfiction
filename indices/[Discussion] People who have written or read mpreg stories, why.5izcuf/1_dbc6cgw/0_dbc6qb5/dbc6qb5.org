I have never read one but my biggest issue with the whole concept is giving birth as a male. I imagine that a lot more painful than as it is by nature.

Edit: to make thinks clear, my issue is the way a male pregnancy would end the natural way, namely squeezing a child through your penis. If you want to make a case about magic then you could take the more logical route and have the two males create a child through magic (in a lab or a cauldron or however) and then have a woman carry it. Or use the cauldron like an artificial womb.
