It depends on whether the Animagus (or Sirius under this particular curse) can still use his magic (other than turning himself into a human). Maybe you can add to the tension by Sirius teaching himself how to perform wandless nonverbal magic in order to communicate telepathically with people. Or you could have the nonverbal communication style of the dogs. It would be very rudimentary at first but then they could also write by tracing their paws in the dirt.
