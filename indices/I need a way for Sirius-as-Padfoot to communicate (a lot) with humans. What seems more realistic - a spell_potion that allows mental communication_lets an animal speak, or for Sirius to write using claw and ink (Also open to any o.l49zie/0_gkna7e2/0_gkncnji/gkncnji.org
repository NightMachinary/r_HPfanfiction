Guess it might've helped if I detailed this in the post.

So, Sirius has been cursed so that he can't turn back to human, but it's also an AU where everyone still think he betrayed the Potters. After escaping Azkaban, he manages to kill Peter, which is when he gets cursed, then goes to live as a dog with Harry (who has no idea who he is) until Remus finds out, at which point Remus wants to kill him, but of course Harry's not going to stand by and just let this random dude (he's never met Lupin before in this AU) murder his pet dog. The fact Sirius has lived with him for years and not tried to kill Harry or gone back to the ressurected Voldemort makes Remus pause long enough to want to find out why, and Sirius is going to want to clear his name. Thus the need for communication.
