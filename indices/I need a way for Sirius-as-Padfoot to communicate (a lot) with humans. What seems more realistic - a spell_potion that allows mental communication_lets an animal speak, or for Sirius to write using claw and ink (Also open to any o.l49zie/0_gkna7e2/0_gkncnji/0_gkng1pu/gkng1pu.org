Oh that is fun!!!

For tension I think the imbalance of communication between Remus and Sirius might work in your favor here with Harry as a mediator. It would be interesting to see how Remus can ask the right questions to get the answers he needs. Sirius growling and showing emotion in response.

Especially since we assume Lupin has some experience communicating with Padfoot from school so he might be better than you'd expect at just understanding dog. Getting easily annoyed and bickering at stupid answers or actions.

Legilimancy would work too? Especially if Sirius's dog thoughts are a bit disjointed, again adding to the tension and mystery.

If Harry likes reading, finding passages in books to point at would also be good? Song lyrics or titles? Again, a lot of effort on your behalf but that's a way of communicating?

I like this idea! I think, play with the limited communication as much as you can before resorting to two way conversations. More interesting. But if you want to drag it to a longer story then there's probably a potion Remus and Sirius could both take which allows them to hear eachother? That would probably work best. It would then be fun if it's just Lupin who can hear Sirius and Remus has to try convince everyone else on his behalf. Sirius can be getting better at scratching out things during this time since he's starting to get used to talking to humans again.
