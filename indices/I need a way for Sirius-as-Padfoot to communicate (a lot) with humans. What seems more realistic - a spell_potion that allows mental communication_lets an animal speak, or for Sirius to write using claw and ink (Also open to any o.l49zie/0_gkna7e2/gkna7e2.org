Can I ask why?

Is it remotely or is he in the room with the people he's communicating with? Because if he's in the room, whines and tail thumps as confirmations work? Dogs can look confused and angry and can point. That feels the most realistic

Remotely, maybe Legilimancy? Can you legilimens a dog? Sure why not. You decide how legilimens works it's decently flexible. That's all mindreading and would work if it's adults he's talking to.

After that, if it needs to be anything more indepth, scratching out basic words probably feels best? Talking dogs are odd to me but that's a completely personal opinion.
