I liked the [[http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/oNLhUKOmeWnitaWgOSh8Ds2LzgzUG06XAbg87KzTJmraG3Ax40N_fZ5R9wNXBiNqK_OCVdLEEVmeRcO2-V0eXQkxVQkCEaoFzqOHrmrs4DJuNQ/PSfics.html][Psychic Serpent Trilogy]], by Barb.

I read it a long time ago, but it was one of the first professional-grade works I read.

Story starts in year 5. The first story is good, turns out snakes can tell the future in a minor way, so Harry has a little pet garden snake that gives him 5-seconds into the future prophecies from time to time.

Second story is great- Harry makes a deal with Voldemort to go back in time and save his parents, but also Voldemort doesn't fall, leading to a whole alternate universe and a fix-the-timeline plot.

Third story uses themes from both preceding books, and has a prophecy involving Harry and Malfoy.

The relationships change, so it's not just, say, a Harry/Hermione book or whatever. I don't think there's any slash, and I'm pretty sure there aren't any major Original Characters.

Edit- Link works for me, but for anyone else, you can use Sproc's links to access the stories (although I would actually suggest clicking to the author's profile page and going to her homepage- I believe she's made a few edits but was unable to post them on Facebook for whatever reason)
