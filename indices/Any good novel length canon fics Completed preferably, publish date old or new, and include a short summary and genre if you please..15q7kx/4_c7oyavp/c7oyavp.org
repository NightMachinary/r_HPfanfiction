This was one of the first stories I've ever read, it's OLD...Started in 2001 and ended in 2003, so it's GoF canon. It's over 600k words and written by the people from The Sugar Quill.

It started my 10 year journey of Harry Potter Fanfiction. I dont recall all the specifics now, but it's canon ships (at least, H/G R/H), ad is fairly intense at times and it does go into mature content but nothing lemon-y.

I'd recommend it, even though It's now AU because of the others, it's incredibly well written.
