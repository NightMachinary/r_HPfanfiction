[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power][Searching for The Power]] by GinnyMyLove (me) - 570k words - Complete

Harry/Multi - heavy lemons - I couldn't decide whether it was porn with plot, or plot with porn...and there is a character death that hit me just as hard as my readers...I didn't even know what I was writing until I got there and I was like....."no....shit no...I can't!...but my muse wont let me write anything else...."

Hermione finds out the "Power He Knows Not" might be Love, and vows to help him find it...in any way she can. Harem plot ensues, surprisingly a lot of depth outside the lemons though. But I'm biased as the author.
