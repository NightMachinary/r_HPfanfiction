Well, to be honest, a combination of habit, laziness, and a dislike of the period in a book where one is introduced to the main characters. Even highly recommended works often have lackluster introductions to characters; something that fanfics tend not to. There are obviously exceptions, and I do go and those that are recommended to me.

Also, books cost money, but fanfiction does not.
