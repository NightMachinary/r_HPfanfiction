I reccomend "Harry Potter and the Boy who lived". It greatly expands the magic system of HP while still feeling like Rowlings work. It also shows the difference between magic schools and everyday life in them. You can find the first 12 chapter on fanfiction.net but a full 18 chapter version is on archiveofourown or DLP.
