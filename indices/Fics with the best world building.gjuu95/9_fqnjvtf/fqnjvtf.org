I know it's way way /way/ off topic(as it doesn't involve Harry at all), but when I think of crowning examples of worldbuilding, the first fanfic that springs to mind is a crossover between /Naruto/ and /Mass Effect/, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9628704/1/Misplaced][/Misplaced/ by Deus Swiftblade]]

Rather than just inserting Naruto into the /Mass Effect/ universe, it actually expands the /Naruto/ universe to encompass /Mass Effect's/, basically expanding on the history of a /Naruto/ version of Earth, complete with its own history and politics, conveyed by Codex Entries at the end of each chapter.

The fanfic is a bit of a doorstopper, though, being longer than the entire /Harry Potter/ series.
