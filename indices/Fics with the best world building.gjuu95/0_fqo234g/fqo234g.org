Alexandra Quick's world is incredible and doesn't get enough credit upon first glance. It's not the highlight of the story - the plot and characters dwarf the worldbuilding - but I feel like people look at it and assume it's set in a canon version of America, or just a Wizarding America that's not very different than Wizarding Britain.

Inverarity doesn't expand on Rowling's magic system at all - I think he's invented two or three spells in total over the course of the series - but the point is that everything is drawn from American values, American tradition. Blood status is important, but so is social class. Slavery is/was real. People from different backgrounds are treated differently and have different traditions. It's a wonderful change from the rather colorblind and pallid world of canon, and he does it super well.
