  Inverarity doesn't expand on Rowling's magic system at all - I think he's invented two or three spells in total over the course of the series

He adds a fair number of spells, including some non-Latin/Greek spells, which make the setting feel more alive and diverse.

But aside from incantations, he adds some entirely new magical concepts, like doggerel verse, witch's sight, alternate worlds, and powers, some of which are pretty big departures from JK Rowling's setting.

So I'd say there's a decent amount of magical world building.
