I mean the characters r all super fleshed out and it doesn't just focus on Harry + friends. Overall i'd say the main cast is: Harry Theo Blaise Neville Hermione Jim Luna Ginny Amy Draco Ron Lucius Fred George Tom Dumbledore Flint Sirius Regulus Snape James Lily Peter Remus and Rufus and All of them r fleshed our fully, with (once you learn them) clear motivations for everything they do and a pretty significant contribution to the story.
