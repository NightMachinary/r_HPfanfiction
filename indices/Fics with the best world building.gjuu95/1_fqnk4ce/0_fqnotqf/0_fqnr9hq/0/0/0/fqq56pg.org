It's more of a GoT style “main cast” obviously characters like Lucius and Regulus and Rufus and the adults get significantly less screen time then like the core of Harry Theo Blaise Hermione Jim Neville and Ginny, but all the characters I mentioned in that long list have had at least one chapter that fleshed out their backstory, to varying degrees.
