This is my favourite world building fic thus far - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/13/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries]]

â€‹

A brief summary/take on the story - In the story thus far, the worlds used are from D&D, the 9 Realms from Norse Mythology and HP (An AU version of it, though.) Harry and Albus wind up in one of the 9 realms, that is also the Underdark (A la Drizzt, yes.) The story deals with how they got there, whether it was a deliberate choice, where they're going and how to get there and some interesting takes on both magic and weaponry, as well as a lovely twist on Canon Lore to be so much more ... impressive.
