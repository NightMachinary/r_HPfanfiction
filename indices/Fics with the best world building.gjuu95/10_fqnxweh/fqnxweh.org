I'll happily second Prince of Slytherin, (as mentioned, 1.2 million words to cover 3 years is either mind numbing monotony of every single class or good world building) and add linkffn(Victoria Potter) and linkffn(Firebird's Son) + sequels.

The first is fem!Harry in Slytherin and the second is so very AU that you really have to read a few chapters to follow, but I definitely enjoy both
