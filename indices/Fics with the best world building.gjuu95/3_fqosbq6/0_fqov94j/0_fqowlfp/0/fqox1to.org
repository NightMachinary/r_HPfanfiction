I can see where you're coming from. Harry just seems too mature for his age, but with the way time is flowing on Svaltrheim (spelling) and Harry's magic bringing him to his peak form, the accelerated growth maybe can justify his maturity. Also his somewhat different biology as a half-elf can also contribute to a different rate of growth of his maturity cause we don't really know what parts of his elvish biology he has gotten, apart from their superior battle awareness etc. Also we can still see some kid-harry-ness in the last few chapters, especially when dealing with Princess Whats-her-name.
