When I'm looking for something to read, I look for things that are 80k words minimum, but I'll pass over those in favor of 100k+ quickly.

That said, as long as something is complete and engaging, I'll give it a try. I generally don't read things that are in progress, no matter how promising it seems. And I dislike reading things that add in useless fluff to engorge the word count- better to be good with a low count than questionable with a high count!
