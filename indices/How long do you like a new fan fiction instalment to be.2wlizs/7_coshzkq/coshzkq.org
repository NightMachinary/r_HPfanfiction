For me it depends in whether it is a new story I'm following or a complete story. For complete stories, anything over 5k per chapter is good but too many words per chapter can also indicate that the author has too much filler or doesn't know how to properly section the story. For new stories, if they're still writing it, I'd prefer between 5k and 10k weekly. Too far below that sweet spot can indicate the same lack of compelling plot as if it were complete, but too high above that can indicate the author is rushing through. If it's longer between chapters, a maximum length of 20k is better because the author could have just released two 10k chapters..

As far as total wordcount, however long it takes you to tell the story, but I'd prefer it to be concise without summarizing and detailed without repetition or filler. Depending on what you're trying to write, that could be anywhere from 10k to 500k. Stories over 500k tend to have too many plot elements and that can confuse the author into making story breaking mistakes. One shots below 10k tend not to have any plot at all.

All of those numbers are affected by the quality of the summary and first chapter.
