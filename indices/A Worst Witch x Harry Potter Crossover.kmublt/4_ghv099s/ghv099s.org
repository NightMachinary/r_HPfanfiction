I haven't read any but now I want to write this. Harry and Mildred teaming up would just be chaos. Something that could be done for this is having cackles academy be one of the schools in the tri wizard tournament and having Mildred or someone else get picked. Might have to change the ages around for it to work idk how old the witches in the worst witch are.
