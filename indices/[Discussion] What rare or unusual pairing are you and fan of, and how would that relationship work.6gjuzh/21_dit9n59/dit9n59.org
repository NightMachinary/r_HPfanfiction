My OTP M/F is Harry/Luna. Although there aren't that many longer, complete fics with this pairing, I feel like it's not too rare. So, my OTP M/M pairing is Harry/Blaise. He's basically an OC since all we know is he's a Slytherin, black, has an Italian last name, from a neutral family, proud, and has a mom who is purported to kill all her husbands.

I like Blaise/Harry because it puts Harry with a Slytherin, yet a neutral one, so we know he's not a Death Eater. Yet he's proud, so there would still be issues to work through as a couple. And as a minority in the house of purebloods, I feel like he would have an interesting take on blood purity. So, you could have some of the drama of Drarry without the history of bullying, hatred, and racism to get over. Sadly, I haven't seen an author tackle the pairing quite how I'd like yet.
