Hermione / Bellatrix - How would that work? Well... Either you make Hermione a massive masochist or you take the route of the less known character and give Bellatrix some sort of reason to be as she is. But it really never works without massive allowances. Basically, Bellatrix / Hermione works if the reader lets it work. If you don't want it to work, it won't.

Sirius / Bellatrix - The most dysfunctional relationship in the HP fan-universe. Frankly, I like the idea of it. Its greatly fucked up beyond all measure and I love it for it. "Making it work" is again a thing of perspective. Those two would be constantly at each others throat, and /like it/ that way. If anyone wants to read my take on it, here goes: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12066162/5/Braindump-Ideas-un-edited-unfiltered-and-available-for-anyone-to-use][My Idea Dump Fic Chp. 5]]

Beyond that I don't really have a lot of preferences. I like Harry/Tonks a lot too, but not enough to ignore a fic's problems. The aforementioned two are the only ones I will ignore a lot bullshittery in a fic for.
