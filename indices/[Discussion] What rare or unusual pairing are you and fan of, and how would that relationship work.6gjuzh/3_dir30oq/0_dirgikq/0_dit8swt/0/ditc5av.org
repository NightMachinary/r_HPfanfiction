Because the Death Eaters are literally magical Nazis (with muggleborns acting as jews). They had concentration camps and NÃ¼rnberg laws. No way one of them and Harry would work (or Hermione for that matter). Snape and Draco were members who agree with the ideology from early on. They are just racially motivated terrorists who have some regrets because Voldemort does what he promised, similar how people were surprised by the Holocaust despite Mein Kampf and then things got messy (surprise, genocide is not a clean thing). They used racial slur during their school time and do not oppose Voldemort's ideology. Snape may have some regrets but still joined them in the first place. There's no redemption for terrorism.

Ron, while not necessarily a bad person, is not a good friend for Harry, much less a partner. Between jealousy, inferiority issues and his lacking emotional range I just don't see that working.

Neville is pretty much the only guy left. All others are just blank spaces with a name tag but from our canon knowledge they don't have any qualities that Harry would need in a partner. Hermione is undeniably number one in this aspect, with Luna and Neville being better than the other characters. Neville at least is loyal and can relate to Harry's hardships like their parents fate and abuse at the hands of their relatives.
