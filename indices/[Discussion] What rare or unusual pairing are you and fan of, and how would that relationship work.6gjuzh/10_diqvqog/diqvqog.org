Harry/Pavarti or Padme. It's rare to find a good one where shes not harem fodder (Pavarti) or a Hermione replacement (Padme).

Also Harry/Molly and Harry/Rita. Molly because she could be so much more and its normally a desire to see either a time travel involved or simply comfort after the war. Rita because its been something I think could work if done right.
