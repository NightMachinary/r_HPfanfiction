Umbridge/Skeeter. The ultimate bitch pairing from hell. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354203/1/Logos][Apparently someone actually did write it]])

Post-war Hermione/Narcissa. Narcissa tries make a like for herself after living as a trophy wife without any real options, becomes the new potions master after Slughorn finally retires. Hermione needs some peace after her relationship with Ron goes to shit and her relationship with some of the Weasleys becomes somewhat strained as a result. McG invites her to teach transfiguration. They don't really like each other much at first, but eventually grow closer, despite constantly bickering like an old married couple.

Hermione/Fleur. Bill dies during the wedding attack, Ron dies in the final battle saving Fred, and they help each other heal.
