I think a DH hallows compliant fic without the epilogue can find space for a Harry/Daphne in a similar situation to Days to Come or even similar to R-Dude's contractual Invalidation which is one of my all time favourites. A lot of it comes down to Ginny being the safe choice and I want to explore the Harry Potter world and using a non Weasley pureblood is a good way to explore that. I have no good reason for not Ginny and I won't try to pretend otherwise, I just find it boring and safe.
