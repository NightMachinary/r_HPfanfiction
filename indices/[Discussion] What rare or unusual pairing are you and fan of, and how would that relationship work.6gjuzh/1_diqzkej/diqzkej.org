Harry/Gabi D not my favourite pairing but I don't think there is enough. I think the the epilogue is too clean. With the mess that follows the war and the extra attention it would bring I struggle to see Harry not becoming extremely jaded. Maybe he'd leave and go travelling, maybe he'd allow others to dictate his actions for a while but I don't engage with the happily ever after tone that I personally get from the epilogue. Gabi fits into this as she was abroad the whole time. She doesn't have the same memories as everyone else, she didn't watch him slay the boggey man in the middle of Hogwarts. She's a breath of fresh air to a tired and fed up Harry. Some who brings a little light to a man beginning to drown in shades of grey. The expectation that Harry will solve the problems of the wizarding world flip flop throughout canon with the idea of him being a dark lord. I see no reason for this to stop so someone without a track record of doing this might be refreshing.

Dudley/Pansy. Dudley getting away from his parents and trying to find out who he is as a person without their strong views shaping his own. Realising that his cousin was a much better person than his parents would ever admit leads to some soul searching. Pansy has just watched everything she knows get turned upside down. Dumbledore, Potter and Voldemort are all halfbloods. She has watched pureblood superiority crumble. Maybe, just maybe her family was wrong. Where does that leave her, Pansy ventures out into the muggle world to learn how the other half live. Trying to escape her past. People haven't forgotten she tried to sell out Potter. Now I've read a story similar but I really want to imagine the scene where Dudley brings Pansy to a family reunion of some kind and only then does she learn about Dudley's connection to Harry. Personally I want Harry to be paired with Daphne Greengrass in this situation so we see Malfoy as Harry's unwilling brother in law and therefore sharing Christmas with Dudley and Pansy.
