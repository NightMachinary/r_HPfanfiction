I had this idea of a Samurai!Bellatrix of a sort, who values her honor more than even her life, and who would never betray her word whatever the price. So Bellatrix would have married Rodolphus Lestrange out of genuine love. Then, Voldemort would have accepted to spare Rodolphus' life in exchange for Bellatrix's loyalty and obedience.

Led by her honor, she would do anything to serve her new master to the best of her abilities, becoming the monster we know (or perhaps slightly less of a monster).

When Voldemort kills Rodolphus in a fit of rage, breaking his word, Bellatrix turns against him immediately, and begin to wage her own war on Voldemort and cie, not trying to reach out for Dumbledore and the order at all.

She could then meet Harry and gang due to circumstances. It would be hilarious to have Bellatrix crashing through the Department of Mysteries, and saving the day at the end of book 5, perhaps even directly saving Neville's life in the process, which would be absolutely horrible for Neville.

Edit: Actually, my first idea was that Bellatrix would've been tricked by Voldemort and Rodolphus (a fervent supporter of the Dark Lord), that she knew it but still rolled with it because she gave her word. Revelations would happen just prior to her dying. But I find the idea of Bellatrix wreaking havoc in all factions just by switching side (sort of, as she wouldn't join the order) to be potentially fun.
