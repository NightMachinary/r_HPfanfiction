Actually, I wasn't thinking of any sword at all. More of an attitude or moral code (not necessarily the Bushido but something that would look a bit like that). She's got magic, why bother with a sword?

I'd like to see Sirius' face when Bellatrix arrives into the death room mid-battle and throws Dolohov or Rookwood through the veil, instead of attacking his group ;).

  And yeah, Bellatrix in this kind of story would be just shy of Voldemort and Dumbledore in combat ability, but lack their breadth of knowledge in Dark Arts and esoterica, respectively. Definitely worth the effort in recruiting.

There would also be the gap in experience. Bellatrix' a lot younger than Voldemort let alone Dumbledore. And she just spent years in Azkaban. But she would definitely be at the bottom of tier 1 at the least in terms of power and skill.

Edit 2: Apparently I missed that part.

  Oh, I wasn't imagining any kind of katana. /Any swords, really/.

I don't think a rapier is the best choice for a woman. If you're physically weaker than you opponents (and women generally are, at least when it comes to the upper body), you'll want a lighter weapon. Best choice would be a 2-handed sword. Since you use it with both hands, you have to provide less strength from each arm. Which would give you a greater maneuverability and more speed.\\
A rapier isn't a light sword. It's a long and thin sword that's made to poke rather than slice, but it's as heavy as any one-handed long sword.
