Oh, I wasn't imagining any kind of katana. Any swords, really. But if she did use one, it's be something like a rapier, I think. A very precise pokey kind of sword.

And yeah, Bellatrix in this kind of story would be just shy of Voldemort and Dumbledore in combat ability, but lack their breadth of knowledge in Dark Arts and esoterica, respectively. Definitely worth the effort in recruiting.
