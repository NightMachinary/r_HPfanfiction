  I imagine that if she turned against Voldemort, she'd seek to ally or swear herself to his enemy: Harry. Dumbledore is an obstacle, sure, but Voldemort sees Harry as his enemy due to the prophecy, not Dumbledore.

Absolutely. But she can't exactly just walk to him and say "hello".

  In regards to Neville and Samurai!Bella... Perhaps she was present that night but not involved in the torture. She's a fighter, not a sadist. He might be able to forgive her in that case.

That's a possibility. It would make sense. With the Dark Lord gone, there's no reason to go out of her way to torture people. Her only obligation would be to stay loyal to Voldemort and keep searching him.

Also, when I say Samurai!Bella, I'm talking about values and such. Not actual katana wielding. It's not clear in my first comment I think. I wouldn't want to be misunderstood.

Bella would also have to be a very powerful and skilled witch for Voldemort to go out of his way to forcibly recruit her.
