  When Voldemort kills Rodolphus in a fit of rage, breaking his word, Bellatrix turns against him immediately, and begin to wage her own war on Voldemort and cie, not trying to reach out for Dumbledore and the order at all.

  She could then meet Harry and gang due to circumstances. It would be hilarious to have Bellatrix crashing through the Department of mystery, and saving the day at the end of book 5, perhaps even directly saving Neville's life in the process, which would be absolutely horrible for Neville.

I imagine that if she turned against Voldemort, she'd seek to ally or swear herself to his enemy: Harry. Dumbledore is an obstacle, sure, but Voldemort sees Harry as his enemy due to the prophecy, not Dumbledore.

In regards to Neville and Samurai!Bella... Perhaps she was present that night but not involved in the torture. She's a fighter, not a sadist. He might be able to forgive her in that case.
