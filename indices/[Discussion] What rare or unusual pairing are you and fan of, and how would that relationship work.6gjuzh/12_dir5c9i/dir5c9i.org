Harry/Bellatrix is a rare pairing, and normally requires some real shenanigans to pull off, especially if it's after the DoM battle.

But what if the insane bitch we all know is a lie? The Dark Mark might have unknown side effects after all, like maybe rarely causing something similar to dissociative identity disorder in those that take it. Or maybe it does it to everyone that has it? I mean, I can see that pretty easy. Charismatic Voldemort preying on the hidden fears and concerns others have, convincing them to take the Mark, and then the Mark twists them slowly into cruel caricatures of who Voldemort thinks everyone is deep inside(intent and belief matter in magic).

If a method of removing the Mark was discovered, and Harry got to meet the real Bellatrix instead of the psychotic fanatic personality construct that got forced on her, who knows what might happened between two people who have a common enemy?
