The pairing I'm a fan of is Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley. I said this in response to a post some weeks back and another user accused the relationship of pedophilia, so I'll reiterate: this pairing can work when Hermione comes of age.

When you think about it, Hermione always has had a love of magical creatures (i.e. S.P.E.W.) while Charlie loves his dragons so much that he finds more comfort in them rather than in women (canon). Yet, if the two ever met and discussed their mutual affection for magical creatures, what more is there to say of them?

Most stories involving Charlie and Hermione are a marriage bond (which doesn't really make any sense to have them paired together), or the two having a one-night stand (which also doesn't seem to be of Hermione's character). Very little stories, unfortunately, actually bring Charlie and Hermione together in a logical sense, either because most authors don't care to put in the time and effort to do so, or they picture Charlie as a Christian Grey cutout, while using Hermione as their own vessel for sexual fantasies to ignite.

It's a shame really, as I think Charlie/Hermione has a ton of potential. But alas, it's not very popular and seems to be decreasing in popularity every day that ticks by. I've read a ton of stories dealing with the pairing and 99% of them are all garbage.
