Harry/Pansy because oposites attract, very hot sex and perhaps eventually love, it can only happen as they're both adults though, In Hogwarts years it seems unlikely, specially if she's seen as Malfoy's.

Before I knew that Dumbledore was gay and his love for Grindewald, I shipped him with Minerva, but as an unrequited love from her or we're profesionals and don't date colleagues sort of thing.

Bellatrix loves good old Voldie, but he only uses her to satisfy certain needs...

Severus/Narcissa needs more fics. Perhaps it would only be an fling that's only physical (they both care about Lucius and they feel guilty about it). I wouldn't be suprised if Lucius cheated her and she fucked with someone else to revenge.
