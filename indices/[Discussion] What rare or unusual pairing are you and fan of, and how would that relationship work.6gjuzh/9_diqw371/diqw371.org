Ginny/Bellatrix- fierce, passionate, lethal. I imagine this would be a short term or inconstant relationship. I could see Bellatrix taking Ginny as a pet or mentee in a situation where Ginny was recruited to the Death Eaters (possibly if Riddle's possession twisted her making that possible) and Ginny turning the tables on her eventually.

Tonks/Hermione: Tonks is confident, cheerful, funny, laid back, courageous, and not particularly insecure. If Hermione's quirks fascinated Tonks and drew her in, I could see them having a long, stable relationship with their biggest fights about whether Hermione is inadvertently being condescending to Tonks about her area of expertise and whether Tonks' career is advancing as much as Hermione thinks it should. Plus, as a halfblood, Tonks wouldn't be totally clueless in the muggle world or around Hermione's parents.

Harry/Bill: in the epilogue that should have happened, Harry is the DADA teacher because he genuinely enjoys it, is tired of fighting criminals, and also because thematically it's a powerful statement that A) Voldemort's curse is broken and B) Harry achieved the job that Voldemort was never able to because he made better choices than Tom Riddle did. In this ending, cursebreaker Bill would be a great collaborator for Harry, showing his Hogwarts classes applied DADA knowledge and bringing Harry to dangerous (but fun) places to battle evil for nothing more important than magical artifacts. Harry canonically thinks Bill is handsome and cool, and after Harry physically fills out a bit (possibly during his post-Hogwarts exploration of various fields in DADA fields) Bill might be interested in his little brother's speccy but buff friend with a good head on his shoulders and nerves of steel. Bill's character is a bit unfilled, but he's confident and chill with Molly in the face of her disapproval and comes off as a strong character. Plus, then Harry gets to be a Weasley! ;)
