Tonks/Hermione sounds interesting

I personally can't see Harry/Bill, they barely speak before Book 7 and although the idea of Harry hunting artifacts is cool, I just don't see where the enduring relationship would stand. The way you describe Bill feels more like Harry would want to work with him on occasion, not chain his life to his. If Bill had retired from field work, I could see it working.
