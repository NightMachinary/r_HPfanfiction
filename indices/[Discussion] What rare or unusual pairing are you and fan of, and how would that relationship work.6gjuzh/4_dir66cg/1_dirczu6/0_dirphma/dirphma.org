  It really isn't unusual. 80% of fics with OC are female!oc/Sirius.

Really? I've hardly found any - though admittedly I don't generally read Marauders era fics, and I daresay there are some in that area.

I think I might write a male OC/Sirius fic, just so there's at least one out there. I've already got some of it in my head. Trouble is, it's a bit angsty and I don't like angst.
