I like Harry/ Gabrielle (with Gabrielle being older than eight...). I mostly like this because she can still be a veela but she doesnt have to be fleur and can basically be whathever you want her to be (though preferably not some brain dead, sex addled flusy). This also has quit e a nice basis because he saved her from the lake during the second task. I don't even mind 'bonds' so long as they are actually sensible and not the usual 'wehave to have sex, now!', 'omg, harry that was amazing enpven though it was our first time', bla, bla, bla.
