Ginny and Victor Crum. While at the Triwizard Tournament, Ginny organizes a game of pick up quidditch, and Victor asks to join. Ginny is adamant that she play against him, even if he's better. Despite knowing full well that Victor is a better player (and much older) Ginny plays her heart out as a seeker, but in the end Victor still wins. He's impressed by her spirit, but she's still a kid as far as he's concerned.

However, Ginny keeps doing some damn impressive stuff, like organizing the DA and helping to take down Voldemort. Years later, when Victor sees Ginny playing quidditch for England, he invites her out to drinks. They strike up a deal to push each other to be better players, and occasionally they even play against each other. From their friendship, they eventually get together and life is good. Oh, and Harry ended up with take your pick.

Orrrrrr....things could end up positively freaking nuts because Harry was born with red hair and I really want to find a way to make every Triwizard Tournament champion a Weasley just to drive Minnie McGee up a freaking tree.
