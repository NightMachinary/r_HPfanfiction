I don't disagree she is Supportive, especially in Canon of Bill, and she is Mature, but I disagree with Easy going, Fleur I see as someone who would try and make you "better", whether by eating French Food (that she Canon-lly beleves is better that British food), or dressing better (which Harry needs), educate themselves. Fleur I can see bullying her SO into a monthly or weekly dinner at a nice restaurant of her liking, of going to the networking events that Harry hates in the Books. the Balls and Parties, the very things Fleur would flourish in.
