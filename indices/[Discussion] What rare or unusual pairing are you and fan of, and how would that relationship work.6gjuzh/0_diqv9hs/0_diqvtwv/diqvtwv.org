I do love Harry/Pansy as well, I can see it being built on the bickering and snarkiness of the two, until the walls come down and Pansy just wants to feel protected by the big damn Gryffindor hero that is Harry Potter and Harry handing the reigns of most of his life over to the cunning mildy manipulative Pansy. A very Symbiotic relationship perhaps even more than we usually see in Fanfiction

Harry/Narcissa could be fun, especially if they are just "using" each other whether to get back at people or make a point or just stress relief. Then it becomes the norm and then it's a foregone conclusion that they are together.

Harry/Gabby actually isn't my usual cup of tea actually I prefer him usually with Fleur. I think it's because I like the mix of the dirty T shirt and jeans Clad hero in Harry crossed with a beautiful yet high maintenance girlfriend as you can see with my enjoyment of Harry/Fleur, Harry/Pansy and Harry/Lavender. I feel that Gabby would be a bit too accommodating. I love a bit of heat that isn't solely sexual between my love interest (although the spill over into the carnal is exactly what I look for)
