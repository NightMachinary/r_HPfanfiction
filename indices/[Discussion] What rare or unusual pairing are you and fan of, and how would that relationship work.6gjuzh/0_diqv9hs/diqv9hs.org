Harry/Pansy - Lots of playground squabbles that lead up to a 'I don't hate you' kind of confession. Probably lots of snark and mutual crabbiness follows. Drama about sides maybe, but maybe not too if both are independent minded.

Harry/Narcissa - Saves Narcissa from Voldemort HQ, maybe offers her protection via hidden property. Might lead to a bit of inadvertent Stockholm Syndrome, and then 'I've never had the option for anyone but Lucius' follows. Might be some element of 'gonna shag Draco's mum, ha!' in it for Harry.

Harry/Gabrielle - Most likely takes place post-Hogwarts for Harry, but the method is fairly obvious: Gabby finally gets her hands on her white knight.
