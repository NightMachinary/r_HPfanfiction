I don't like the idea that people can't change. Life changes people and priorities shift over time, and it's not unthinkable for priorities to align in two people that once had wildly separate ways of life. Rather, I'd say what's unthinkable is people maintaining the same set of priorities they had in school for their entire lives, no matter what.
