If it were a RL relationship, I'd agree with you. Pansy would have to be a lot more willing to compromise than I imagine she is, and Harry would have to learn to deal with his anger suppression issues because the little things Pansy would take for granted would drive him up the wall, accumulate, and explode.

Both of them would need to learn hella communication.
