I too am a big fan of Harry/Pansy, but feel like ultimately it shouldn't go anywhere. Fundamentally, Harry and Pansy are not compatible in any serious romantic or even human sense. You can see a relationship developing between their adult selves based on mutual attraction... but sooner or later their relationship should stop being love-hate and just become hate. Essentially, horniness would blind them to all the many good reasons they detest each other but great sex can only keep a "relationship" going for so long.
