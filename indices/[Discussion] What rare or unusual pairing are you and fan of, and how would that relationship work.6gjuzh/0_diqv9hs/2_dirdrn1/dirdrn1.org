  Harry/Gabrielle - Most likely takes place post-Hogwarts for Harry, but the method is fairly obvious: Gabby finally gets her hands on her white knight.

I love this. Unfortunately it's also extremely rare. Most Harry/Gabby fics are harem or involve veela bonds that just involve Fleur for good measure. She's always kinda the little sister of Harry's hot girlfriend.

Really the only decent one i've read was Hope by Jeconais and that was a little too Mary Sueish for me.

Although there was one fic that i can't remember the name of that involved Harry traveling the world as a problem solver and then meeting Gabby on some kind of science ship in the arctic. I don't think it was finished but i recall it being pretty good.
