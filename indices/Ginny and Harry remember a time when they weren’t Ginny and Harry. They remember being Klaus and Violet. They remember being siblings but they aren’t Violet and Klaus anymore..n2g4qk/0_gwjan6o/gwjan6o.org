Ron noticed it first, during Harry's first visit to the Burrow.

Ginny had walked down the stairs and attempted to hide behind him when she noticed Harry muttering to the twins. He fancied he could almost see the stars in his sister's eyes until she noticed him take a spot of butter and put it on a corner of his plate. "Oh. It's him." She whispered to herself before unceremoniously plopping down on her seat and taking a piece of toast, cutting it in half lengthwise and buttering each half with slow and careful strokes.

Harry grinned at her when she stopped. "Well, fancy meeting you here."

Ginny growled at him before reaching for her toast. She ended up grabbing the butter dish instead.

Hermione didn't take long to notice that Ginny and Harry were odd when sharing the same space.

"Remind me who got who killed again ?" Harry sniped one morning.

"Remind me who decided to forget the weapons back at camp that day?"

"It was hardly a decision."

"What are you two talking about?" Hermione asked.

"Role playing games. I played a character called Violet and Ginny was Klaus."

"I make a better girl than you, admit it." Ginny said smugly.

"Talk to me after you've gone through your first period."

"My first what-oh! Oh no..." Ginny muttered.

"Oh yeah. Can't wait to see how /you/ deal with it."

--------------

Lockhart never got to notice.

"How sad." Harry said, shaking his head as he watched the two Aurors wrestled Lockhart to the ground. "A fraud masquerading as a children's carer, who knew?"

" Not us." Muttered Ginny, taking pictures of her former defence professor getting an impromptu lesson in what muggles use truncheons for.

--------------

Snape avoided the trap just in time.

"Here." He said, passing Ginny a set of Polyjuice potions.

She looked at him suspiciously. "Why?"

"Miss Granger is stinking up the bathroom. There's a reason the potion calls /dried/ boomslang skin the preferred option."

Ginny kept staring at him.

"Consider this payback for exposing Lockhart. Now we're even."

"Ah."

--------------

Voldemort, well...

"Oh no." The ghost of Tom Riddle said as Harry Potter entered the diary and turned into Violet Baudelaire in front of him. "Not you again. Where's your brother?"

"Recovering from possession. Wouldn't happen to know anything about that Tom?" She asked, clutching a vial filled with memories in her hand. "Or should I say, Olaf?"

"/Count/ Olaf, thank you very much!"

"Oh sorry, /Lord/ Deadbeat or whatever, guess what? We're back."
