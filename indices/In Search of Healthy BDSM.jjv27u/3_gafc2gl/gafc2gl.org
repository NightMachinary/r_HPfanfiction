I am conflicted about “Becoming Harriet by Teao“ linkao3(4876630). I still believe it is one of the best fem!Harry stories around, and although I generally don't object to hormonally teenagers (of relatively safe age) behave as ones (and I was just yesterday kicked out of [[/r/HarryandGinny]] for it), there is a problem in this story that the smut clashes with the story, which is there. It is like the author couldn't decide whether he writes a smut or good story which is hidden there. And yes, there is BDSM involved, but nothing crazy, that even I (who thoroughly don't like the practice) was able to swallow it as authentic.
