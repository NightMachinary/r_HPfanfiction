I wouldn't touch this topic with a 10-foot-pole.

I think it's very difficult to place the Holocaust and reality-warping wizards next to each other and write a tactful story because you either have to answer the question "how could they let this happen", or you can make it not happen. This is very, very easy to do wrong. A prompt like this risks a fic on the same level as [[https://www.toplessrobot.com/2008/12/fan_ficition_friday_goku_and_anne_frank_in_until_t.php][Goku x Anne Frank]]
