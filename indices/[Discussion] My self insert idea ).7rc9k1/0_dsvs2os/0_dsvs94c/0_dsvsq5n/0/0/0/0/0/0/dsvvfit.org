It's Kuz/c/o.

I kinda agree on the sequel (but then, Kuzco's story /is/ "over": he's learned his lesson and would be less funny now that he is no longer a jerk). The show is called /The Emperor's New School/, and it has the original cast. Kuzco is once more the same character, though as I said, it comes at the price of negating some of his character development (he's once again lazy and entitled, though he'd no longer leave Pacha to die like in the first movie).

/Kingdom of the/ */Sun/* (I made a typo) was the movie that /The Emperor's New Groove/ was once /going/ to be before they decided to turn it into the wacky comedy we know it as; it was once a much more serious fantasy epic (there's a story there that the animators were split on which approach to take, and for a while each half was making their own movie in neighboring rooms until the producers stopped /Kingdom/). I love the /Emperor's New Groove/ we got, but /Kingdom of the Sun/ looked awesome in a very different way. I

n that version, Pacha was younger and Kuzco's lookalike, Kuzco was called Manco, there was no Kronk (sadly), and Yzma was a darker villain (though still played by Eartha Kitt!). That version of the movie drew more heavily from Incan mythology and had a central "Sun deity" motif that they eventually recycled for /Tangled/. In that version, Yzma was aligned with the evil God of Darkness (she'd made a deal with him for her magic powers; /that/ part was reused for Dr Facilier in /The Princess and the Frog/) because she wanted to stay young forever and thought that sunlight was what was making her age. Her plan in this version is thus to become Empress so she'd be in a position to unleash Supai and blot out the Sun forever. It's a pretty weird plan, but also very original, and in that version Yzma had [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAt9ovvKgCU][a song]] that was all about it!
