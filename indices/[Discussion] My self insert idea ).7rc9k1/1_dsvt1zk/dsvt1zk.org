Are you sure that you want to write a story in which a self-insert joins the magical Waffen SS? Because the Death Eaters are not your average mafia style crimelords but genocidal terrorists trying to do their own little holocaust while happily ruling the rest of the world.

Not that I am against the bad side per se, but it would be far more interesting to see the SI create his own crime syndicate instead of joining the people set out to exterminate certain people based on circumstances beyond their control without any personal gain (unlike the mafia, who is after the bottom line).
