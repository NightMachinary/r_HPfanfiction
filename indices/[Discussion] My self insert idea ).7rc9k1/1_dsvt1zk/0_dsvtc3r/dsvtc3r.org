Oh. :( Well maybe I could do both? :) Have the SI join the Death Eaters and give Voldemort information and stuff, but then break away and form their own mafia family and criminal enterprise because they realized that wasn't what they wanted to really be involved with? Like maybe it is like Teen Titans where even Slade said that the world being destroyed was something he wouldn't have wanted, and HE was a criminal mastermind. He teamed up with the heroes to beat the demon king. So yes maybe the SI could have THEIR limit at genocide and world domination?
