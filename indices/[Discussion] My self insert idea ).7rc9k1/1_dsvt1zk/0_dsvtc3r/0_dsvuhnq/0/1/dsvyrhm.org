You could always have Gregory Goyle go back in time and use his limited knowledge of what went on in the war to help Voldemort , in exchange for keeping Vincent Crabbe safe. We know Goyle isn't the smartest, but he is a malicious bully who isn't afraid to torture or kill, which makes him far better for going back to change the outcome of the war to his side's favor. With how smart Tom Riddle is supposed to be, even faulty remembered histories from the future would have enough information for him to avoid the same pitfalls he would have had otherwise.
