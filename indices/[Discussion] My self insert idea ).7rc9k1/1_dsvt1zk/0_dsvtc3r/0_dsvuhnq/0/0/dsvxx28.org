I think it might be a more interesting story if your character didn't know all the details. Like maybe they aren't really interested in Harry Potter and didn't read (all) the books themselves, but they picked some things up just because of how popular they are. Maybe saw a movie or two, know a few random details, but can't tell Voldemort everything. Otherwise, it would be a very easy win for Voldemort. Also, if you want to write a "kind-of-self-insert joins the Death Eaters", just do it. Maybe he/she is an evil person, maybe a power-hungry psychopath, maybe just a person with criminal tendencies who dosn't have enough knowledge of the books to judge the situation accurately (and regrets their decision later, when they find out what Voldemort actually does...) It wouldn't really be a self-insert, I guess, but it could be fun to write.
