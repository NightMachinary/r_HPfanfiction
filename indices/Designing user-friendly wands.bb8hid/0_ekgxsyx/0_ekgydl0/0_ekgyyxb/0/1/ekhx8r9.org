IIRC, Lupin pulls his wand out of an inside pocket in his robes in the POA movie during the boggart scene. There's also the throwaway gag in book 5 where Moody warns against storing your wand in your back pocket since he knew someone who blew a buttock off that way. This leads me to believe that "in your pocket" is a fairly standard place for wizards to store their wand, oddities like Luna aside. (/Which/ pocket being a matter of personal preference, I suppose.)
