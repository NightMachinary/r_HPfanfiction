Huh. Touche. I hadn't actually thought of that. They do literally everything with their wand, and hardly ever put them down. That makes for some interesting avenues of investigation. Like eating with wands and dancing with wands.

Another thought: what about just making muggles unable to see wands? That's a basic charm they put on a ton of stuff. Then they can open carry or stash them any old way and not worry about muggles being confused.
