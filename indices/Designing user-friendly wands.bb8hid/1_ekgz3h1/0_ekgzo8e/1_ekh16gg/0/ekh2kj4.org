Go take a ruler and measure out 14 inches on your forearm. I just went and double checked, but that went out way past my palm. The average wand is 9 to 14, with some going over 15, and even 9 would be very uncomfortable, particularly every time you bend your elbow. Besides wands being straight and one's arm being very not straight (even if you're not super muscled, there isn't a convenient flat surface there).
