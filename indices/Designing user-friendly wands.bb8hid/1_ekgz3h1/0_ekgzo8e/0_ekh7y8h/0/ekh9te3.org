I assume they see the /stable and permanent manipulation of space/ as a difficult subject that requires long study to manage. So, people who /can/ do it become experts who sell their service at a proportional price, leading to questions of affordability. I would imagine poorly done expansion charms could implode or distort in some way, leading to distrust in cheaper options.
