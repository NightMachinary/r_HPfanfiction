Pretty much any holster/scabbard that works for a longish knife works just as well for a wand. So a shoulder rig, something down the thigh, boot-top, strapped to the off-hand forearm for the shorter models, across the small of the back. Undetectable extension charms are within the magical scope of a reasonably talented schoolgirl, so your holster doesn't need to be as deep as the wand is long.
