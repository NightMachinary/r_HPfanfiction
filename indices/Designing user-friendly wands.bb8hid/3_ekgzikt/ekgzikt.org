A shoulder holster would seem to be the way forward, surely? Fixed just where you mean to draw it with elastic to let it shift with your movements at the bottom end.

Getting it enchanted with a long-lasting disillusionment charm would be a good investment. Demiguise wool straps and mokeskin lining for the high rollers who want it invisible, smaller than the wand it contains and apt to bite anyone trying to steal it.
