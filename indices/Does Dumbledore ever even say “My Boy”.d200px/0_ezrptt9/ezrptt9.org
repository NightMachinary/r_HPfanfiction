He calls Harry boy twice at the end of PS:

"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."

"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed."

Also he calls Malfoy "dear boy" several times in HBP and during Felix Felicis and probably elsewhere (iirc) Slughorn calls Harry "m'boy" and Scrimgeour also calls Harry "dear boy".

All of these may or may not be the American editions, I didnt check.
