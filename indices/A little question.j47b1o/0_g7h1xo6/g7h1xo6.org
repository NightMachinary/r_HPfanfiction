Because on the most superficial level, Hermione seems perfect. She's smart, kind, and cares about social justice issues. She's who people empathize with or want to be. Of course, a deeper or even a second look of her character reveals just as many flaws as anyone else in the series. But that can take nuance and a deep look at the books, which can be difficult when the first read people do is as kids and it's very hard to pick up on it.

The movies didn't help. The movies, which had a lot of exposure, removed a lot of her worse traits and gave her good traits she didn't have from other characters (especially Ron).

Then came a lot of fanfic. Authors liked the idea of Hermione being great, oftentimes paired with Harry, and readers delighted in that representation. They grew popular, often at the expense of Ron. It became a go-to trope that was guaranteed to get views and favorites. There were many stories where Hermione was the super protagonist or paired with Harry.

Now there /are/ Hermione bashing fics, they're just less common and much harder to find. But they aren't common. Good authors won't bash, taking a large percentage of stories with them. Authors that do bash, will bash Ron and other characters, who are "easier" and more popular with their audience. It is a rare author that will bash Hermione since it's poor writing and less successful of a strategy.
