I've used a prologue twice so far. Once in "The Dark Lord Never Died", detailing the events following Halloween 1981 which set up the Wizarding Britain of 1999 where Chapter 1 starts, and once in "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water", where it's more of a teaser of the main villain's "birth".
