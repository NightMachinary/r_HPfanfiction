In the Sherlock fandom, there is a fic that everyone recommends if you want to have your heart trampled on- its beautifully, artfully written but every chapter leaves you in tears. The ending is solid and fits the story, but is by no means happy. Linkffn(6914974)

Is there a similar kind of fic in the Harry Potter fandom?
