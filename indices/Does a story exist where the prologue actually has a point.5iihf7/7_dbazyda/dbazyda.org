I generally don't bother reading prologues. I give them a chance, read the first few paragraphs to work out which of the stock 'prologues' it is, then skim the rest in a minute before heading on to the actual story.

Only one of the stories I have written has a prologue, and it is does actually have a somewhat distinct narrative from the rest of the story. That particular story is written entirely in third-person limited where Harry is the PoV character. The prologue is instead limited to a couple of characters native to the crossover world, and instead of filling the reader's brain with a bunch of superfluous information it really just serves to get the reader into the right mind-set for the rest of the story with a bare minimum of time given to exposition. At least, that's the intent. I didn't want to waste a chapter on the whole 'here's my contrived crossover explanation', so I just didn't bother. Instead the prologue is about placing Harry within the new world.

Of course I kinda ruined that by the spending some of the next chapter dumping exposition. But that was chapter 1's fault, not the prologue!
