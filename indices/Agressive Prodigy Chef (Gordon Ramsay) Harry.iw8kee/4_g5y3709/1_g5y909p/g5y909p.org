I'm having trouble reading the first chapter. "Dumb-dumb-dore" "hardy har har" is is awful to read. And the "evidence" he's bringing out isn't presented as it could be to actually do damage. Like the actual evidence for the manipulations would be showing Dumbledore telling Neville, to tell Hermione, how to get past the devil's snare. Instead we get the rehash of what happened, and Harry adds commentary of outside events.
