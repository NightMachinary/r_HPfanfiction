Personally, I agree with you. It makes sense to me, that Grindy would kill off the people who went against him and their positions would end up being filled with the survivors. It's also possible that those survivors would also be Pureblood and that stigma against non-Purebloods would be even stronger after the trouble, but I think it'd be quite likely that many non-Purebloods would end up in power.
