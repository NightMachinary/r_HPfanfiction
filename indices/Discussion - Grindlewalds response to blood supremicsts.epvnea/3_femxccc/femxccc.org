It's simple - we don't know enough about continental Europe - or where the magical communities might divide in their opinion - to state how it should be in canon. We do have a few possible hints - France seems to be more open to non-humans, with Fleur seemingly highly respected (despite obvious Veela heritage) and Madame Maxime in a position of high authority (despite being a half giant, though she tries to hide it to a degree). Durmstrang is described fairly evidently as darker than Hogwarts, but along with other factors let us interpret it in various ways (eg - dark in Britain aligns itself with Purebloods and blood supremacy - so we could assume similar for Bulgaria & Durmstrang. Alternatively, given Bulgaria's use of Veelas, their Prime Minister seeming to like Harry for defeating Voldemort, and Krum having no issues with Hermione being muggleborn, we could see them uncoupling those two ideologies).

That opens up Europe - and regions of Europe - to different interpretations on blood purists. Your view would be a very possible one, particularly in central/western Europe - though it would require fleshing out Grindelwald's war, and if they managed to actually control any parts of Europe or just acted as terrorists.

I think there are plenty of other roads to take to get to whatever state in different parts of Europe that an author wants - either more pro/anti-muggleborn, more pro/anti-demihumans, etc.
