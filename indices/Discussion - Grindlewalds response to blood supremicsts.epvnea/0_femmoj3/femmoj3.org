Too many fics just sort of assume that Dark Wizard = Pureblood Supermacist, but it makes more sense for Grindelwald to have drawn the line at wizardry, not ancestry.

I haven't seen a fic that made your headcanon explicit, though too many (usually ones that bash Dumbledore) assume that the rest of Europe is more progressive than Britain. (Because no-Muggleborns-allowed!Durmstrang totally makes sense in Progressive!Europe...)

Some authors (e.g., [[/u/Starfox5]]) make the opposite case but for the same reason: Grindelwald offered Muggleborns equality, and they had flocked to his cause. With his defeat, their oppression had redoubled, and they are viewed with distrust.
