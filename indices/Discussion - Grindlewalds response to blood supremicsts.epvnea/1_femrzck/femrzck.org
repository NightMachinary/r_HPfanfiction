It is my personal headcanon also that Grindelwald was staunchly against Blood supremacy too. If anything, I'd imagine a great deal of his followers were Halfs and Muggleborns. His ideals never gave me the impression of a proto-Death Eater group. Dude was just a ruthless speciest, in the same vein as Magneto. He probably preached that Magic is Magic, regardless of blood.
