Dumbledore's a brilliant eccentric. Harry acting dotty like Dumbledore wouldn't work. And Dumbledore's outfits are flashy, but not outrageous - Fudge wears lime green, Umbridge, pink, and Mrs Longbottom wears a stuffed vulture. Those things aren't small.

Actually, it'd probably be pretty hard to wear clothes seen as rebellious.
