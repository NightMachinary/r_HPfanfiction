[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/115114][Irradiance]] is well written and really good but super depressing. Linkao3(115114). This fic is locked so you need to make an Ao3 account to see it if you don't already have one.

I liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4605858/chapters/10496574][Summer Boys]] a lot. It's not too plotty, but it's well written and pretty detailed character development IMO. Linkao3(4605858).
