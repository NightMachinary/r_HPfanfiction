There's actually quite a lot of information about how magic works scattered about the series. No character ever gives a "magic 101" lecture, sure, but we still have a good idea of how things roughly fit together.

I've put much of the evidence together here: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit?usp=sharing]]

I'm actually incredibly glad we're never given a systematic explanation of magic. Any such explanation would be overly simplistic. Wizards shouldn't be able to explain magic completely and systematically, just as Muggles can't explain the natural forces of the universe comprehensively. Further, even if you did try to summarise physics, it would require years of study to properly understand that explanation. So it should be also with magic.
