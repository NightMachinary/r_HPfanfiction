Right, magic is not elaborated on the series a all. Basically, however you can make it work with details you have, then that's that. It works however you want it to. Your theories are correct if they don't conflict with Canon. I would not worry about how much it works. It doesn't actually work at all, it's magic it's not real. So unless we hear from Rowling otherwise then it works however you want.
