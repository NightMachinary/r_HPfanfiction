Seventh Horcrux, oddly enough, had an interesting blurb on this.

Basically, high level rituals are more subjective and abstract than an ordinary Lumos or whatever. So, you can create an unopenable door- but there has to be a way to go on a quest to piece together a key.

You can curse a teaching position, but you need to leave a loophole such as , "Cursed until an applicant as good as me takes the job."

And you can hide a secret, but you have to tell at least ONE person, because in life you always have to trust someone.
