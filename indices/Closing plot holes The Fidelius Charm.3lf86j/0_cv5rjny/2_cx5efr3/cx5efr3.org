Bit late to the party, but the Fablehaven series covers this concept well (spoilers for the series, of course).

The main plot of the series is a character working to free a group of demons from a prison, and to do so, he had to retrieve 5 MacGuffins. Well, one of the characters asks why the MacGuffins exist at all; can't they just make a prison that's impossible to open? The answer is that they /could/, but the enchantment would unravel. However, a prison that's fiendishly difficult to open will not fail.
