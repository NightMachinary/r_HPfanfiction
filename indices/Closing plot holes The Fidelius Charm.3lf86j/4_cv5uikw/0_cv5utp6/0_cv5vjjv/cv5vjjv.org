I think I'm missing something in my understanding of the Fidelius. Yes, Hermione was a secret keeper, but giving the secret to Yaxley does not make him a secret keeper (Unless Hermione dies, that is). Harry did not become secret keeper after he got the secret form Dumbledore in OoTP. Unless you're a secret keeper, you shouldn't be able to pass on the secret to anyone else. Yet Yaxley, despite not being secret keeper, can bring other Death Eaters to Grimmauld Place via side along apparition.

Also as the article agrees,

  And this uncovers another big flaw in how the Fidelius Charm works. If you know the secret of a hidden place, you can bring in someone else who doesn't know the secret, if you bring them in using side-along apparition.

This makes the difference between the Secret Keeper and someone who isn't a secret keeper but merely knows the secret a mere technicality. It also severely weakens the power of the charm. Also, there is no difference between having one secret keeper or twenty, so there would have been no need to abandon Grimmauld place after Dumbledore's death.

Also, Voldemort could have just asked Snape to side-along apparate him to the Order HQ? How does that work?

Eh. May be I'm missing something obvious. Did Yaxley actually become a secret keeper? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Since Dumbledore died, everyone who knows the secret becomes the Secret Keeper, regardless of whether Dumbledore told them or not. Yaxley isn't directly stated to be a secret keeper in the books though, just someone who knows the secret.

EDIT: Huh. Now that I've written all this, that seemed to be the point of your original point. I only understood after I typed this mess.
