[[http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/the-secrets-of-the-fidelius-charm.html][This article]] seems to look into the Fidelius charm in some detail. It was published right after DH, so any info after that is not included in the article.

Another thing:

  "As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me ... we arrived at Grimmauld Place ... I've already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm's protection. Since Dumbledore died, we're Secret-Keepers, so I've given him the secret, haven't I?" There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition

Can he really? Yaxley isn't a secret keeper (he just knows the secret), yet he can effectively give someone else the secret? Then what is the point in distinguishing between the secret keeper and someone else who knows the secret?
