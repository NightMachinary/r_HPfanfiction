There's some discussion of this elsewhere - what happens to the Fidelius after it has been cast. My post was largely focused on how one establishes a Fidelius in the first place, not about the various things that can happen to it once established.

For example, we know from HBP that if Bellatrix had inherited Grimmauld Place, she would have been able to access the house even though it was under the Fidelius. So a change in ownership of the original secret either breaks the Charm or enables the new owner to access the secret despite the Charm.

My preference for why the Godric's Hollow Fidelius completely broke is the destruction of the subject matter. It's not a matter of the secret being true or false, it's that there /is no secret/. The house has been destroyed.
