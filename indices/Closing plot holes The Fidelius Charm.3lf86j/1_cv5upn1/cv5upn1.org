One 'plothole' that you didn't close is the fact that after Dumbledore's death, the fidelius over Grimmauld place still held, but the one over Godric's Hollow disappeared after the Potter's death.

The only conclusion I could come to about the above, is that the fidelius charm also takes into account what the secret is.

The secret at Godric's Hollow was most likely "the Potters live at Godric's Hollow", so when the Potter family was killed and Harry was moved to live elsewhere, the secret is no longer technically true, so the protections dissolve and the broken house becomes visible.

However, the secret at Grimmauld place was "the headquarters of the order of the phoenix is 12 Grimmauld place." It doesn't matter that both Sirius and Dumbledore died at that point, as long as the owner of Grimmauld place still considers that the headquarters of the order of the phoenix, the fidelius holds.
