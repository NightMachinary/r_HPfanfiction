I think the bit about the ownership can be expanded further, into what is not actually law but rather people and their way of feeling about things.

What I mean is, if you do give someone some property but are still planning to use it until the end of time or whenever, you will still /feel/ that this place is yours. Because you live here, it's your place in a way. Considering how often magic in this series is rooted in emotions and how people feel about things, it might very well be that rather than the law dictating whether this-or-that belongs to you or not or maybe or whatever, it's how you feel about it that matters.

Which might be limiting the charm even further without actually decreasing its potency. Because if you happen to be the secret keeper of someone's property, and you spend all the time here, will you not at some point start feeling that this place is /yours/, in a way, too? And if it were about feelings involved, would that not reveal the secret because the secret keeper is no longer qualified?

And in the same vein, I think it a good guess that the strength of the charm is directly (or close to that) proportional to the strength of the loyalty of the secret keeper to the secret giver; the name of the charm itself is, after all, derived from the Latin word for “loyalty”. If that were the case it would be another possibility for why the Potters' property became visible after Pettigrew betrayed them (because he held no loyalty towards them and so the charm itself disconnected from the secret keeper and stopped working), and a good reason for why it is not possible to get out the secret via torture (“for as long as their loyalty holds”, and thus even if they divulged it under torture by chance it would not give the torturers anything).

Or at least, that's how I approach this particular bit.
