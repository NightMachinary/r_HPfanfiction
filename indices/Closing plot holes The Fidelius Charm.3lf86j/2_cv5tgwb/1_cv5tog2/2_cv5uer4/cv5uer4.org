I think the more likely scenario would be the fidelius holds, simply because it could almost be seen as completing the ritual.

If part of the ritual in casting the fidelius charm is entrusting the secret to someone, then when that same trust is fullfilled even under pain of death it thereby follows that the protections of the ritual would hold even stronger.

In this scenario, it's no different than the secret keeper sacrificing their life for their loved ones, and that is practically the central theme of the story.
