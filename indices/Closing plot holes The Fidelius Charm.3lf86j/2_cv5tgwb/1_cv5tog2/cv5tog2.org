No idea. Nothing in my above explanation indicates what happens one way or another, because it's all about how to establish a Fidelius charm, not what can happen to it afterwards. There would seem to be two options, though: the Charm breaks and the location is accessible by anyone, or the Charm holds and no one can ever access that place again.
