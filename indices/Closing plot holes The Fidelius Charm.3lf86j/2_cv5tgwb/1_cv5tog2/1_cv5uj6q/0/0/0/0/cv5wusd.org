Good point, and I think you're probably correct.

 

I wonder if it would be possible to layer your security by making your keeper take an unbreakable oath to never reveal the secret? It is possible that it would conflict with the magic of the Fidelius i.e. 'it is not a freely given secret if you require the keeper to take the oath' or maybe it conflicts with the subjective nature of trust (Fidelius>fidelity>faithfulness), namely that faithfulness is not genuine if it is guaranteed through force.
