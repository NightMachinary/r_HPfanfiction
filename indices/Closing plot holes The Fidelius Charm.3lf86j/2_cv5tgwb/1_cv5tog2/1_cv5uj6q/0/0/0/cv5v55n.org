I just don't think it makes sense within the story though. If killing someone is enough to break the charm then the Charm is almost useless against someone like Voldemort who will happily kill anyone. Sirius was of the opinion that Pettigrew should have died rather than betray his friends. He seemed to be under the impression that Pettigrew dying rather than giving up the secret would have kept Lily and James safe.
