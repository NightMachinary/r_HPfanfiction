It definitely has a downside, but that is the case with most things in life. The charm would still be extremely useful. In the other scenario the downside is that the charmed location is lost forever. The upside is that if things ever get to that point you are already dead, so you don't care. It stinks for anyone who left their stuff at your place though.
