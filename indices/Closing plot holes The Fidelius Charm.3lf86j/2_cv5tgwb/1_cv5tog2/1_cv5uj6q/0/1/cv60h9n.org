In the book , "â€œJames Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were""

This part implies that Secret won't be revealed even if the secret keeper dies. Otherwise all Voldy had to do was to kill Black.The part about Black going into hiding maybe because the secret could be (maybe) accessed through Leglimiens or Commanded through Imperious Curse, or any other manner.
