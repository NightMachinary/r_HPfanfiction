On a side note, I imagine Voldemort never used the Fidelius because he *A)* did not trust anyone enough *B)* Cannot perform the charm due to a cracked soul or *C)* the charm is obscure enough that he couldn't find out how to do it. Thoughts?

Maybe. But is the land "lost" as in displaced? I know the movie portrayed it as if Grimmauld Place /expanded/ into existence, so maybe the Fidelius does mess with space, or maybe that is just the visual perception of a secret being revealed. Personally, I think the charm would break if the keeper died.

  What if there was another Australia sized continent in the Pacific that some Dark Lord took over and then died with the secret to?

I think the mechanics of 'ownership' would prohibit this. Even if a dark lord has some claim to ownership, there are other ownership areas within his area (i.e. people's home). He could not charm a country if there were spaces within it he did not 'own'.
