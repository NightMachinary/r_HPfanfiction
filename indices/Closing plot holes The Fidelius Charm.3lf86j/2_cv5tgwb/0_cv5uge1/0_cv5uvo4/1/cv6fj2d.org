A or C, leaning towards A personally. There's no real evidence that his "cracked" soul constrains him magically (his inability to understand love is connected to Horcruxes, but only inasmuch as it serves as a rejection of compassion for ones own gain), so B doesn't hold.

There are strong indications that Fidelius was unknown before Dumbledore invented/found it, but it's pretty clearly common knowledge by PoA (at least amongst the order) and Voldemort would undoubtedly have investigated it in case it was connected to his defeat, so I think C doesn't work.
