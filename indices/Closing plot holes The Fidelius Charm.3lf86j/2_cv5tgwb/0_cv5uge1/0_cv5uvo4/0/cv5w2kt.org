Option 1: Enslave all the people, making them his property.

As for the lost land, I don't consider magic relevant to any science at all - it's just different. If something is within a Fidelius, it ceases to exist for everyone and everything that doesn't know about it. It's not hidden, not hidden within a fold of reality, its not that they just cant perceive it - it simply does not exist at all. Magic has no boundaries.
