The Earth is actually over ten times as large, physics and whatnot have just adapted to massive amounts of land being lost as lords and kings managed to die with their secret. Or whatever.

In a more realistic scenario, it'd be really interesting to consider that there may be a /lot/ of places lost due to this. What if there was another Australia sized continent in the Pacific that some Dark Lord took over and then died with the secret to?
