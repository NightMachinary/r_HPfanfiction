I'd say the Fidelius collapses, as there is no longer anyone being trusted. The spell is a way of protecting a secret by entrusting it to another person. If the owner establishes the spell with a trust in his best friend and no one else is told the secret, and the best friend or the owner is later killed, there no longer a bond of trust.

Even Dumbledore wasn't certain of what would happen when Sirius died, but his hunch was that the Fidelius was sustained since there were existing bonds of trust between him as secret-keeper and the new owner by Sirius' declaration, whether it was Harry, Remus or Tonks (or anyone else in the Order, but those would be the most likely recipients of the Black homestead).

An interesting scenario would be if Sirius hadn't made a declaration and the house went to Bellatrix or Draco; the Charm may have held together until the owner met with the secret-keeper and declared that they didn't trust him with the safety of the secret.

I agree with [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] that the Potters' house in Godric's Hollow lost its protection when it lost its roof.

What I haven't reconciled is how Ron could tell Dobby where Shell Cottage was if he wasn't the secret keeper; what he should have said was 'go to the Mausoleum on the green in Tinworth; Bill and Fleur will know someone's come to visit and take them to a safe place'. Then he'd explain that the safe place is under Fidelius.
