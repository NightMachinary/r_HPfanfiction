  What I haven't reconciled is how Ron could tell Dobby where Shell Cottage was if he wasn't the secret keeper; what he should have said was 'go to the Mausoleum on the green in Tinworth; Bill and Fleur will know someone's come to visit and take them to a safe place'. Then he'd explain that the safe place is under Fidelius.

I think the only way to explain this is with the typical "House Elves can do whatever the fuck they want but no one will ever realise they could abuse these abilities to solve the plot".
