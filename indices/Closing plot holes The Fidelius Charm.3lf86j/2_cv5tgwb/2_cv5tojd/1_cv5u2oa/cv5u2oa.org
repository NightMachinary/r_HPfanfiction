Good point! Thank you :) That creates a lot of incentive to not tell anyone but the secret keeper though. If your secret keeper dies, then all of a sudden you have multiple people who can expose the secret.

 

So then, what do you think would happen if only 2 people know the secret, the giver and the keeper, and the keeper dies?
