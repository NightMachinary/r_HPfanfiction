Response to each point: 1) Harry was still alive at this point and yet iirc muggle authorities were arriving shortly after. (Might be fanon memory. Not sure it's been awhile) 2) This is plausible but presents a weakness of the charm. The charm works by hiding something not actually providing physical protection. I don't see destroying an entire village being an issue for Voldemort. All he would need to do would be track people likely to visit to get a general location. 3) Again plausible but still shows inherent weakness. First, do records of properties under fidelius just disappear then show up after it breaks? Does all knowledge get hidden or just the specific location? Second, inheritance is a legal issue determined by law. Law is determined by the government who holds the right to overturn wills. A corrupt government, especially one controlled by V would easily be able to exploit this.
