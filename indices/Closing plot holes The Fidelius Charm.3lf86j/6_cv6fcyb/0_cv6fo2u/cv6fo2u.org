There are a couple of similar explanations.

The first is that the wording of the secret was such that it ceased to exist with the Potters' deaths. The secret was the Potters' location, so when the Potters no longer exist, the Charm has nothing to hide any more.

The second, contrary to the first, is that the house was the subject of the Charm, but that the destruction of the house has a similar effect to the death of the Potters in the first scenario: there is no longer any secret to hide, because the subject of the secret no longer exists. Thus the Charm breaks.

The third explanation, completely different to the other two, is that inheritance by someone not part of the secret breaks the Charm. In HBP, Dumbledore says that the Order evacuated Grimmauld Place out of fear that Bellatrix might inherit the house. This implies that the Fidelius would not prevent Bellatrix from accessing the house if she had inherited it, meaning that inheritance of the secret can break the Fidelius. But not all inheritance breaks the Charm, as Harry's inheritance did not. The difference seems to be that Harry was already in on the secret. So when Godric's Hollow was inherited by baby Harry/The Ministry, the Charm broke.
