My biggest issue with the fidelius in cannon is how others are able to access Godric's Hollow after 10/31/81. It's reasonable to accept that Hagrid, Dumbledore, Sirius, or other friends would be in on the secret and thus be able to access it. But others being able to see it doesn't make sense. Pettigrew is still alive and in hiding. How did he reveal the secret?
