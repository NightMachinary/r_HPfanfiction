  How would you resolve the fact that it's technically possible, but unheard of in the books?

I wouldn't say it's technically possible. The only thing we see the Fidelius used on in the books is a physical location, so I'd say canon is that the Fidelius is used on physical locations. Anything else is non-canon extrapolation.

That said, if I had to provide an explanation for why you can't hide those sorts of secrets it's that they're not your secrets to hide. The above explanation of the Charm means you can only hide secrets that are "yours", like the location of a home you own. Public domain information would not fall into this category.
