Well, to a certain extent this is less a plot hole and more a character making a bad decision... they already made one pretty awful decision by not accepting Dumbledore's offer to be the secret keeper, so determined were they to demonstrate trust in their friends. It doesn't really surprise me that they didn't think it was necessary to try to game the Charm for extra protection... they will have trusted Peter so much that the possibility of the Charm's failure was not even in their consideration.

That said, I'm sure one could come up with a decent fanon explanation to rule out certain obvious exploits. The two most obvious exploits are a) reciprocal fidelius charms b) switching homes after the charm is cast. Both cases are essentially the same mechanic: a secret keeper living under a fidelius.

The most obvious rule to add is that any attempt to deliberately evade the Charm's limits breaks the trust between the giver and the keeper, and thus breaks the Charm itself. So a secret keeper could incidentally end up living under a fidelius, but they couldn't deliberately plan to do so to remove the element of trust from the spell. Not sure how well that works with Bill and Shell Cottage though.
