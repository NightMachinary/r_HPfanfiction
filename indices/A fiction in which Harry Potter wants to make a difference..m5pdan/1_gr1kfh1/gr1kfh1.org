Evitative by Vichan and its sequel do this a bit? Iinkao3(Evitative) .

There's some good magic theory/lore about knight and dark magic and how being a dark wizard and following Voldemort can be mutually exclusive. It just so happens that many old magical families who lean dark go into Slytherin but Harry intends to show that dark magic is not all bad and by extension, Slytherin. Hope that's what you're looking for!
