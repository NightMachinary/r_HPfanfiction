It's a post-war fic and following the events fresh in everybody's minds, people jump on the Slytherin-hate bandwagon. The thing is that even people who fought on the right side, such as Andromeda, receive that hate. Harry tries to defend them but ends up getting some hate in turn. The conflict is represented by Harry's attempt to prove not all Slytherins are bad.
