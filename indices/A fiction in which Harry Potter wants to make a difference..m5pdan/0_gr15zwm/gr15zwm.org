Slytherin's reputation in canon is very well deserved, and the best way to improve it is to destroy Voldemort, bring his sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazi minions to justice, thoroughly 'de-Nazify' this house (and the Ministry), and ask the Sorting Hat to NOT dump every blood purist there.

Harry as an 11 years old can do very little, especially considering top Wizard Nazi Lucius Malfoy also sits on the school board and has an inside track to the government. IMHO, the best opportunity to finally fix the Slytherin house is after the War, after Voldemort has been destroyed, after the Malfoys have surrendered, and after a significant part of the Ministry has been purged.
