My fic has a lot going on, but one of the things Harry wants to do, is create an equal and just society. And he believes the first important step might be to abolish the house system, and simply sort kids based on gender and age.

It's a logical thing to do, I think. Most of the bigots, and blood supremacists come from families who have been sorted into Slytherin for generations.

They are raised in the "life", go to Hogwarts, and are almost always sorted into a house, packed with people who share those same ideals.

It makes sense to me, to mix everyone together, to broaden the kid's perspective.
