I think three children might be too much for career-oriented Hermione. Harry would like more kids, but she's only willing to compromise on one. They have a daughter they call Lily, and while she's bright like her mother, she inherited her father's love for fun.

Harry is the stage dad. He's the one the kid remembers sitting with her for meals or playing in the park. Harry loves to cook, and it's a love that he passes down to Lily. He's the one who was present for each and every tea party, the one who kissed scraped knees. He heaps all the love he had never gotten to his beloved daughter.

Hermione tries her best to be there, but she's a rising star politician. Her work takes up all of her time, and it often follows her home. She tries to be there for dinner at the very least, and she's assigned herself the bedtime stories. She tries her hardest to be there for the big things like Christmas or birthday parties. But her job is huge and there's a lot of weight on her shoulders, so she's often called away anyway.

Harry, obviously, is the favorite. He's the one there after all, and he feels guilty about it sometimes - feels as if he's hogging the kid - but Hermione's quick to assure him that it isn't his fault. She's the one who's up in the office at first light and often comes home past midnight. She did seriously contemplate quitting politics to be the mother her daughter deserves, but she knows herself well enough that she would never manage it.

When it's time for the child to board the Hogwarts Express, Lily jumps into Harry's arms, and they cry loudly into each other while Hermione watches a meter or so away. When it's her turn to say goodbye, Lily suddenly turns shy, and Hermione knows right then and there that everything's broken.

And for once in her life, she has no clue how to fix them.
