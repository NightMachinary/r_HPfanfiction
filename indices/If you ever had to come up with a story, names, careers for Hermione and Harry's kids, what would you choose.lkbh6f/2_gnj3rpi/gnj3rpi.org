A single daughter of a divorce on account of Hermione pursuing a career in politics and Harry actively looking for obscurity and keeping himself busy as private investigator/ handy man. Spends her time flipping between the two but enjoys spending time with her father more on account of Harry have no expectations or advice for her. Hermione is still a good person but one caught in a never ending crusade that having already ended things with Harry, has a sunk cost fallacy that if she doesn't keep pushing for reforms everything including her sacrife of her personal relationships will have been for nothing.

Harry probably spends a lot of nights drinking with the old crowd, may or may not be a functional alcoholic. Daughter might marry Scorpius or if Neville has a kid. Takes a job in a traditional magical field like alchemy because she has neither of her parents worst hangups and on account of not really having any muggles either parents really still speaks too is essentially exclusively magically raised.

Lily is a decent name as any. Or named after Andromeda on account of Sirius and if Teddy's still a thing Harry's closeness there.
