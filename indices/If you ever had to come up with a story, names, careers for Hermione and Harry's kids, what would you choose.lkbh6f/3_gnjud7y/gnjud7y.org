As a dysfunctional one. Harry would be consistently annoyed by Hermione's nagging and bored out of his mind that he has to stick to a family life where his partner is career obsessed. He would probably go off on adventures together with Ron and with Hermione when they'd get a bit of her time. In terms of kids, I dunno. Maybe one at most who would be constantly pressured to do well in school by his mom but looking up to their father.
