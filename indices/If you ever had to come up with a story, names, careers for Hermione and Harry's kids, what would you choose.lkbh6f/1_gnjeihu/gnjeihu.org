Not an Harmonian myself, but if I had to imagine...

First, Hermione is very career-oriented and wouldn't easily stop her career to become a family woman, so imo they'd have either a kid (a girl, Rose) or twins (Lily and Richard). Hermione would climb the ladder and become Minister of Magic, while Harry would be the one to stay at home, and then later either become a professor or work at George's shop.

Rose would be an only child, be born soon enough after the war and therefore live her entire childhood through the aftermath of it. She's a private, witty, sharp-tongued girl, very talented academically, but develops a dislike of the magical world because of her being exposed to people that got deeply traumatised by it. So, after her first Hogwarts year (when she is sorted in Ravenclaw) she starts learning the muggle curriculum, takes her A Levels in Maths, Physics and Chemistry and goes on to study college Materials Science (of course her Hogwarts grades aren't very good, but she doesn't care). She finds a job in a small firma that develops medical materials. She still has a good relationship with her family and their friends (and basically lives "between worlds") but prefers her Muggle life and mostly lives in that world.

If it were Lily and Richard, for them I imagine a different life. They are born later, about 10-13 years after the war, and lived in a world that has already mostly healed. Richard is a Squib (but had he been sorted he'd been a Gryffindor-Slytherin hate tall, for he is as audacious as he is ambitious and cunning), but with a deep intuition for physical sciences, and has a warm and friendly personality, while Lily is not that good a witch (think a bit better than Neville in the first years) and has a shy and meditative personality. Richard has no animosity not real envy towards the magical world, but strives to be a part of it and to reform it. So he goes to college, studies Engineering and then comes back to the magical world and works with his mother to integrate technology and muggle innovations in it, both to integrate squibs and magical creatures and to bring that world out of the stagnancy it had fell in because of the wars. Lily, who gets sorted in Hufflepuff, chooses to live a quieter life and instead works for a while at the Leaky Cauldron, before then opening her own magical shop. She loathes the spotlight that being the child of 2 war heroes brings, especially since she is very different to both of them, and developed a particular relationship with her "Uncle Ron".

P.S. first, sorry for language and format, but English is not my mother tongue and I'm writing from my phone, second I intended Richard to be named partially after Fred (the names share part of their rispettive etymologies)
