  Many people can't read another 'Hermione is being bullied for being smart, and only Harry realizes her beauty'

Yeah, we need more plotlines along the lines of "They tried to bully Hermione. Once. Because, with wands around, 'Knowledge is Power' is not just a pithy phrase."

That said, there's linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), where Hermione gets bullied early on for being Muggleborn in Slytherin. To say that it doesn't last is a bit of an understatement, though.
