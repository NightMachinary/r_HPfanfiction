This is the only one I can think of at this exact moment and it is less bullying and more about being ignored and then rising from the ashes like a boss. I know there are a few interesting Hermione ones, Alexandra Potter by Taure and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]] (this other Alexandra one) have some good bullying parts and just non-acceptance by peers. But those are also super AU. You should be able to find some where Tom Riddle Jr. is bullied and it leads to his evilness. If you want to stumble on bullying in its simplest form anything with Snape should have some level off that.\\
