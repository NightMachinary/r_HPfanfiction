linkffn(The Slap Bet by Cardboard Tube Knight)

It's an alternate universe where Harry's parents never died, Harry has a younger sister (because of this first change). Voldemort is in prison and Ginny and Hermione are in love. I wrote it sometime ago and I'm thinking I might go back and do an overhaul.
