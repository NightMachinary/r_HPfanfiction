I remember reading Corwalch's unfinished stuff on HPFandom, which he didn't post on fanfiction.net. Also the in my opinion rather cute 'Royal Ward' story was posted only there, before the author decided to put it up at ff.net too. Agree with you in general though, it was difficult to find those gems amidst all the slash there.
