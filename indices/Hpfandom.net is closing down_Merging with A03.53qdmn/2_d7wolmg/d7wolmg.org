Yeah, I actually shared the Ao3 blog post about this and the Hex Files being imported when it was first posted.

Ao3 is great about importing smaller archives before they fold - usually for lack of funds. And you can still browse imported archives as a collection. I think those stories will actually become more findable, not less.
