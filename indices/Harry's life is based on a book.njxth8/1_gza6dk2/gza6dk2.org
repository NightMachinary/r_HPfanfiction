Sarah1281 of "Oh God, Not Again!" and "When In Doubt, Obliviate!" fame has a short one-shot called "Nice Try, Potter" where James Potter discovers the books at Hogwarts, reads them, then shows them to Lily Evans in an attempt to convince her she should date him because they're destined to be together.
