I don't have that story nor am I familiar with it and I don't know if araceil was the author but I do know that araceil deleted their entire FanFiction.Net account. They have some stories on ao3 and still actively post their. You could try and pm them to see if it was their story and if so see if they will send it to you. I know it's a long shot but that all I've got. Hope you find it
