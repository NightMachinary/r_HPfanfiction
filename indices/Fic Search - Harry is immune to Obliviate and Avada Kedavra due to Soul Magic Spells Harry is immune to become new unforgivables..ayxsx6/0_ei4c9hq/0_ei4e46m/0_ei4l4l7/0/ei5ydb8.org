If this is the fic that I'm thinking of (but can't remember the name) they (mostly Hermione?) realized that Harry had abnormal reactions to certain spells which included the unforgivables and this led to them expanding the list of unforgivables. Also, Harry only recovered his memories after sleeping for a few hours.
