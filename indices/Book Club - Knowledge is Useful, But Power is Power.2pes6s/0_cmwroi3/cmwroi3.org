It's been a long time since I'd read it, but my impression was generally negative. Here's what I remember:

- It had interesting, original ideas.

- The technicals were good.

- The character interaction was generally good, they were generally IC, though I recall Harry and Hermione being somewhat OOC in the fanonish direction.

- The premise involved huge, plot-making/shattering differences in arbitrary, unearned, costless magical power; and, arbitrarily giving an arbitrarily chosen character overwhelming unearned power always leaves a poor aftertaste, at least for me. It doesn't mean that it's not worth reading, it just means that the rest of the story needs to be that much better.

- Perhaps I am forgetting something --- so please correct me if I am wrong --- but I don't think the narrative gave due consideration to the notion that it may, in fact, be a /good thing/ that the society --- however flawed or corrupt --- binds its most powerful wizards: in a world where randomly selected individuals are endowed with overwhelming and unmediated (by things like society, the way power of wealth is) personal power, it may, in fact, be morally justifiable to limit their ability to exercise it. I am not taking any particular stance on whether it is justified and how it should be done, but I recall the story being entirely one-sided in that respect; please correct me if I am misremembering.

*Edit:*

- To expand on the above point, consider the very title of this fic: it's basically a dismissal of something that is earned through investment of time and effort, something that can be shared and accumulated without being diminished, in favour of an arbitrary magical power meter specific to a given person that appears to be set at birth. Which side are we supposed to be rooting for, again?
