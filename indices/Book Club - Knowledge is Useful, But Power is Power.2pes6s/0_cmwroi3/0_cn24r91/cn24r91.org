Character interactions were a touch weird. Harry didn't consult Hermione enough and it left them basically avoiding actual discussion.

Overall it was a good read, my one point of technical complaint would be the different aspects of magic. Find it hard to believe a single person could awake "Magic" and then manipulate it.
