  Character interactions were a touch weird. Harry didn't consult Hermione enough and it left them basically avoiding actual discussion.

I remember thinking that it was a pretty standard Gray!Indy!Harry dynamic in that respect: Hermione gets sidelined, occasionally popping in to provide strawman arguments about the morality of what Harry is doing or planning, while Harry does his Gray, Indy things to Do What Must Be Done, etc.. In other words, OOCish in fanon direction. In this case, the premise exacerbates this dynamic, since the whole thing about only one of those two having Power in effect means that only one of them has any agency.
