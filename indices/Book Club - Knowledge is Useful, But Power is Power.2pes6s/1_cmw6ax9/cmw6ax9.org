I liked the story and thought it well-written, exploring some lesser known aspects of magic (or Magic if you will). However, I feel like the author bit off more than he could chew by giving Harry the power of 'channelling' magic, and the side-plot was kind of pointless. I liked the character interactions, as well as the ideas of a corrupt ministry. I think it was a well-done story that wasn't over-clich√©d but could have used better planning.
