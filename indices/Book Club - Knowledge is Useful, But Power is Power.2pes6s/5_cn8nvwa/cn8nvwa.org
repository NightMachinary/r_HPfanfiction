The bits about enchanted objects that build up incredible structures really struck home with me, just that made this story one of my favorites. It's such a good idea I just want to see more of it!\\
One of the reason why I love Hogwarts so much is because the building feels to me like it is rooted in magic, secret passages, towers and dungeons that in my mind are like some Escher drawing incarnated (and that's why I didn't watch the movies, the castle just looks too plain). If you know stories with similar concepts feel free to point me that way!\\
On the minus side:\\
* The plot of the story is captivating but fails to deliver in many aspects and after a while strays from the original path and wonders off in other, interesting but ultimately unimportant directions.\\
* Hermione feels a bit pointless overall, I expected her to be either in or out of the game, not some kind of walking moral system for Harry\\
I liked the story but I have the feeling that I loved more the ideas that were put into the story than the actual story itself, does it make any sense?
