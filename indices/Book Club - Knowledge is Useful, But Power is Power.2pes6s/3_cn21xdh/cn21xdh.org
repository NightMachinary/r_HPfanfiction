The story started boring, then had some really good spots when Harry was powerful and all the angst about the weak fearing power.

Then it became this absolute dumpster fire when it tried to make "Magic" into a woman. The story messed around for 3 chapters going no where and losing it's initial vision: Harry bringing down to corrupt government.

You could see the author going "Screw this!" and ending it on the very last episode, leaving all sorts of plots lines hanging.

Ultimately, a very unsatisfying end to an otherwise interesting plot and a decent build up.
