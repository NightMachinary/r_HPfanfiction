- I really enjoyed the idea of Magical Oaths controlling the power players to limit their power

- I thought this was one of the best original ideas in order to cause a 'Harry vs the Ministry of Magic' scenario

- I really disliked the premise that you were either born with Power or you were not.

There does not seem to be the possibility of increasing one's power by any means, thus causing Harry to essentially be a Gary Stu. He is powerful without a powerful enemy.

I think that the author realized this later in the story and then invented another antagonist, Magic. Because this section was not part of the author's original plan for the story, and grew as an idea almost out of a plot bunny, it did not mesh very well with the rest of the story.

IMO, it would have been best to end the story with Harry ending Voldemort in the Crystal garden and to allow the reader to imagine now the world reacts to Harry's changes.
