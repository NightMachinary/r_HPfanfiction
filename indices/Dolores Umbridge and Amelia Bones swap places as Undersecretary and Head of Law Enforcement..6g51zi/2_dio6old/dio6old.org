Dementor "accidents" rise significantly. Might even get a dementor vs werewolf war as Umbridge tries to wipe all the werewolves out. I'd like a story where Umbridge decides Bones isn't doing a good enough job capturing Sirius Black and so convinces Fudge to give her Bone's position, much as she did in regards to Hogwarts.
