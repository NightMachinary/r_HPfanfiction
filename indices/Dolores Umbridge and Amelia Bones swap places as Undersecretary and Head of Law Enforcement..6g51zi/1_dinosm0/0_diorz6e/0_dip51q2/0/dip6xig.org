We just don't understand yet what he did with the gun afterward.

The ones in my precedent com are actual registered causes of deaths of black activists in prison during the apartheid in South Africa. Though quoted from memory.

There's Fran√ßois de Grossouvre, a French politician, who committed suicide by shooting himself twice in the back in the middle of the Elysee Palace.

I've never understood how people (powerful people, anyway) can get away with things like that...
