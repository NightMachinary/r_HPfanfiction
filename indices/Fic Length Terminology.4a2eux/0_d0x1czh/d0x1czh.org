Interesting little thing that my brother mentioned (I think he saw it somewhere around here), the first 2 books were under 80k words which tend to be too short of stories for me on fan fiction. Even Lord of the Rings was only 177k. Since reading fan fiction, my concept of how long a book should be is absurd when I sit down and think about it.I regularly read fanfics with 150+k which is a mark that only the last 4 books reach. In fact, I set the search parameters to be 100k at least.

TL;DR: Fanfiction has spoiled me on story length. 300k or bust to even begin to call an epic.
