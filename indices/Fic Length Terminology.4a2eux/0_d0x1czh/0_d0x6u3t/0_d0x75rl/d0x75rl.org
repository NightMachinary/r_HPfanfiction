For me, I'm not reading polished professional works in FF. I'm reading someone's desires in an established world.

Combine that with most aren't able to condense their words as well as professionals I've found that they can't tell a story in less than 80k words.

I've found for the most part (and of course there are exceptions) if the fic is marked complete and is less than 70k words somethings going to be missing. The 10k difference can be negligible here.

If an author does a lot of FF overtime you usually see improved writing so they get better at using less to say more but overall they need the length to help convey ideas.
