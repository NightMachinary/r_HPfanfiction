The thing to remember re: the length of the earlier books is that they were aimed at children, so it understandable that they'd be notably shorter.

That said, I read something once a while ago saying that a novel averages at 90-130k, which from my experience is pretty on point. (I've started logging my digital books and their information, including word counts.) I've noticed that first novels tend to come in a bit shorter (70-90k) while later ones can be longer, but the longest in a series is not often the final one. (OotP, the 7th of 8 Dexter novels, the 37th of 41 Discworld novel). Stories aimed at young adults and teens tend to run shorter, but fantasy fiction sits higher than average (usually upwards of 150k). (When I say fantasy fiction, I mean the action/adventure focused stuff rather than fantasy romance, both of which I've not read a lot.) (Also, don't take my word on any of these or jump on me about errors; I'm only working on what I've seen and what I've noticed in the 200 books I currently have on my list, which I'm still filling in.)

Prefered lengths in fanfic probably vary depending on why someone reads. Most of the time these days I only read fanfiction sporadically, usually a little before bed or while in the lavatory, so for me short fics are better. (If it's longer than 15k but looks interesting, I stick it on my "To Read" list, which is growing longer and longer because I haven't been bothered to actually read anything on it in ages.) Others, like yourself it would seem, are looking for actual novel-length stuff, presumably preferring full plots and world- and character-building that you can't establish in short fics.
