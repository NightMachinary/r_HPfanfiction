The reason Moody is such a feared Auror is because he keeps thinking he was "just a little too slow to get the shield up in time" and so he keeps working himself to the bone getting faster and faster without realising he's immune to the shield charm. Eventually he's so fast nobody can dodge the sheer quantity of spells he puts out and it's only when he was fast enough he didn't need the shield.
