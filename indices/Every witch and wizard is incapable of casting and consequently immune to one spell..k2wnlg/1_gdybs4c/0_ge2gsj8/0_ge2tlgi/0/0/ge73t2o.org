I like Robst. When I first started reading FanFic; Robst was one of the first writers I found. It's well written, light-hearted, fun and yes sometimes a bit "fluffy". Sometimes after reading a gritty, harder version of HP in Fanfiction, I just want to smile a bit, laugh and just enjoy a good read. Robst provides that for me. I usually re-read his " A Different Halloween" once a year, because it makes me feel good; and sometimes I need/want that. No writer ( professional or amateur ) can appeal or appease all their readers, but considering how many Follow & Favorites Robst has, many many ppl enjoy his work. I for one am grateful for his hard work and his willingness to share.
