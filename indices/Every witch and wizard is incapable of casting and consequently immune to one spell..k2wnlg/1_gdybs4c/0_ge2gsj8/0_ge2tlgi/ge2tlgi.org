Sort of on this topic: one of my most favorite fanfiction scenes is in Robst - No Hurry at All.... Where Harry having been portkeyed to the Head Master's office after the Dept of Mysteries, decides to escape, but first pees in Dumbledore's pensive. Both Dumbledore and Snape use the pensive, the next day the whole school witness both men with washed & cut hair. Sometime later the whole school finds out what happened and even more hilarity ensues.

If your interested - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6755363/1/No-Hurry-At-All]] Chap 2 & 3 tell the tale
