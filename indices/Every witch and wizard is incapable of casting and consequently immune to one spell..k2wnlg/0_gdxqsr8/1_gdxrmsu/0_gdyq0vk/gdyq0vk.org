I'd think it would certainly make sense for Voldemort to be immune to the Tickling Charm, though after his return, I doubt he has much in the way of a sense of touch to begin with.

(On the other hand--or foot--Luna being immune to the Tickling Charm is either absolutely perfect for her, or the absolute opposite of what I'd expect for her).

Also, if Harry is immune to one of the Unforgivable Curses, does Voldemort also become immune to it after taking his blood? That could be trouble.

Edit: Though the thought occurs to me, Luna being immune to the Tickling Charm does not mean she'd be immune to tickling itself.
