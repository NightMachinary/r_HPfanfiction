what would harry's unforgivable be? AK or imperio? he has bene under both and broken out of both, probably ak and just a natural at throwing of the imperio but not immune. I think hermione should be the one with the imperio since it fits best with her character with her advocating freedom. I can see her use a torture curse faster than ron though, so ron would get the torture curse immunity. harry not killing, ron not torturing, hermione not controlling? idk
