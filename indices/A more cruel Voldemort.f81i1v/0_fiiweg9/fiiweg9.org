Holy shit. This is an awesome and horrifying prompt. Apparently Hermione used a different spell than obliviate to modify her parent's memories so there is no cure for obliviate besides the dubious one of torture. Imagine a Hermione getting so desperate that she begs to be tortured by Harry and Ron to get her memories back, risking the Bertha results.
