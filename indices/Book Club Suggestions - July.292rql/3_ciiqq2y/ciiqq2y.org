[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]], my favorite fic out there. It's a one-shot of under a 600 words so just give it a shot.

Other fics I'd recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][Lessons With Hagrid]], after Snape kicks Harry out of Occlumency lessons Hagrid takes them over. Hilarity ensues. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All The Dementors of Azkaban]], a incredibly silly story. It's great fun though. Luna gets sent too Azkaban in an AU where she got Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny. Harry disagrees and decides too camp next too her cell in progress. Lots of hilarious stuff follows.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]], less lighthearted, still amazing. A one-shot where Dudley realises how the Dursleys are abusing Harry after a class asignment about abuse. Incredible and a must-read imo.
