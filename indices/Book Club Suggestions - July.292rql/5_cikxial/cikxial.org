How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]]?

*They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.*

It's very funny and has a good plot. The epilogue is a bit OOC and rushed, but Unspeakable Things remains on my list of favorites, regardless of the lack of slash.
