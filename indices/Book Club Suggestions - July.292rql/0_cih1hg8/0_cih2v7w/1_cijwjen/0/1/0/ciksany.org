After reading some of the sporking that [[/u/Manu_V]] posted, there was definitely a lot of stuff that I remember annoying me when I originally read it that I'd forgotten about.

#+begin_quote
  ignoring the epilogue and word of god
#+end_quote

This isn't really a valid complaint, though. No one is bound to comply with canon. Probably half the fics out there ignore the epilogue, or more.

The gender issues were what I remember really getting on my nerves.
