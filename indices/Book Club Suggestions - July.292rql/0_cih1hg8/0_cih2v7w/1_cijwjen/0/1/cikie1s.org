To name a few:

- Over dramatic/gritty for drama's sake.

- Flanderization of characters. Snape is a big one here.

- Unnecessary violence/gore for violence/gore's sake. Goes back to the first point really

- Unneeded original mechanics. All that Irish/Scottish magic crap.

- Cannon foddering of nearly every characters that isn't explicitly mentioned, and ignoring the epilogue and word of god.

- Exaggeration of gender role/Double standard/Excessive chauvinism

And that's before the entire author thing, which is a base breaker in its own right
