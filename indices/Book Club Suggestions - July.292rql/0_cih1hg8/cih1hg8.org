/Saving Connor/, if you can stand the investment, is literally my favorite piece of literature. If anyone knows the author/a way to contact them, tell them I want to send them money.

/Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ is close to my heart for being perfectly written AND canon compliant; I love seeing canon from another POV. Along those lines, /The Snape Chronicles/ are another favorite of mine. The characterization in that one is so good it's become my headcanon.

/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ is very well written, non-Harry POV, unique, and clever. Just generally a great read, even if you aren't into DnD.

The /Alexandra Quick/ series is also delightful. It reminds me very much of reading canon back in the day, with the whole book coming out at once, published-level writing, etc.

I have several other stories that I personally enjoy as much as the above, but for less... objective reasons. >_>
