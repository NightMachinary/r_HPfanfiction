My problem with it is not that it's bad (it's actually rather good, I suppose). It's not the writing (it's well written, and I've read over half). It's not even the plot (read worse and better), the characters (though they're quite nice), or the cliches (they exist everywhere). The problem is that it's not maturely thought through - there exists nothing nuanced, nothing delicate.

The story just tries to be a steamroller of angst and drama and while those score extremely high with older teens, at this point I just have other fan fiction stories that do it better. But that lack of subtlety is exactly what makes sure that this will always have fans and will always be highly regarded... and will in essence be fan fiction, needing those extra crutches to build itself upon.

I could have been vicious here, lambasted the two-dimensionality of characters at critical points, joked about how many slash cliches slip through, but in the short term: "that poor super-powered hero made of protectiveness and love that everyone adores" elicits very little emotional response from me, especially when said "everyone else" isn't particularly extraordinary all things concidered.
