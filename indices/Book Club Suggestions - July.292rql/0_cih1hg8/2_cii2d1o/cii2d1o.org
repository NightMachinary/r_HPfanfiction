I honestly really tried to like Saving Connor, but around the fourth book it just started feeling like filler. I wouldn't /not/ recommend the first or second ones, they were entertaining, but I can't recommend the whole series.

The other recommendations are excellent, even though Alexandra is one of the least likable main characters of fanfiction ever.
