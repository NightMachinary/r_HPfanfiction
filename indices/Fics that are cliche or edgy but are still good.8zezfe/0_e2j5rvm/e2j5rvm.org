linkffn(Defiance; Resurgence; Paid in Blood; Saviour of Magic; The Last of the Peverell; The Legacy; Fraterculus)

The Legacy is in my opinion the best marriage contract fic there is, followed by Contract Invalidation, simply because of the tone and the relationship is a lot more believable than on CI. Saviour of Magic is bleh at the best, but fist your bill (EDIT I saw this error but preffered not to correct because it just tickled my funny bone). Paid In blood has a bad rep mostly because of the uses of -- instead of " for speech, which in my opinion is just a way of being a bitchy person that can't possible accept that in some countries ppl are used to use -- for speech and can't respect that. ANYWAYS, going on a tangent there... It has a lot of Slytherin politics, Ron, Hermione and Neville are 3 pieces of shit of a huge scale, Dumbledore is at best neutral, and IIRC there's some talk of magical cores, which for the life of me, can't understand why people bash so hard on this. My personal opinion on this is "IDGAF its still magic" and I like the idea of repositories for magic because it reminds me of Eragon.

The rest is good, I'd give a 7.5/10 overall, with some parts being better than most fics, while failing in others.
