occulumency is not a mindscape. occulumency is just clearing your thoughts so that if someone tries to read you they'll find nothing. basically it's just 'head empty, no thoughts'. it's not about barriers and defenses either. the second and most advanced form of occulumency is hiding only certain thoughts and memories so that if anyone uses legilimency on you they'll only hear the thoughts that you didn't hide and they have no way to know you're using occulumency.
