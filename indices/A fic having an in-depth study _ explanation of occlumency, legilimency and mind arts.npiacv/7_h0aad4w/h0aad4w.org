linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It borrows some ideas from linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) but it expands on them and makes them it's own. It's a really well thought out take and even subverts a few of the common mind arts tropes. Doesn't really go in depth until year 2 though.
