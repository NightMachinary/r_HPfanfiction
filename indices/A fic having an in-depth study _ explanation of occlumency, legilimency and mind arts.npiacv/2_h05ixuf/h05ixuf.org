I don't have a fic for you, and I feel bad commenting on request threads without a fic, but I really hate these descriptions of occlumency. This doesn't gel at all with the canon description of it requiring intense concentration, emotional control and focus. Nor do I think it would be such an immensely rare skill if it was just "lol build a mind castle and put moats and shit everywhere". I always preferred The Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived description of Occlumency, where it was a constant mental vigilance of your emotions and thoughts, not a passive defense you can just set and forget about but an active effort to notice and root out foreign influences in your mind. Something that required constant effort, honest knowledge of yourself, your emotions and your thoughts, as well as willpower and all the standard jazz.
