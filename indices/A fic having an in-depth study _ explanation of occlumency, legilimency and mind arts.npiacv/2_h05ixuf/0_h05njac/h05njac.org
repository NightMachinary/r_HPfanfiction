True, canon occlumency is wayy different than the fanfiction ones, but the ones explained in fanfics are detailed with a pretty logical explanation. Ill try to explain it as i know it.

Most of the passive occlumency is actually an involuntary action, like raising your arms when you are attacked or pumping of your heart. Everyone has an inherent amount of occlumency, just the way babies get scared when something approaches them quickly and they try to shield themselves. But you can train your reflexes in a way that it becomes almost on a spinal level and hence very easy passively. Also it needs months, maybe years of training and dedication to achieve that. Fanfics generally skip those training part. Also I guess it feeds on the magical core (unlike heart muscles which draws energy from the food we eat)

And about the mindscape, i find it easier to remember a flashcard if i imagine keeping them in a folder or a box in my head, not unlike how we store it on a computer. Not foolproof, but a bit better than rote memorising. Mindscape is, I think, an extension of that stuff.

Canon description of occlumency is VERY lacking, even official sources say very little. It feels like an untapped resource which we can extrapolate to make sense of it.
