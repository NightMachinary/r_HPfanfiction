I think part of it is other places that have the mind-arts often use some sort of mind-scape, as they tend to be more visual forms of media. The one that immediately comes to mind is X-men, and other comics. They often utilize mindscapes to display and search for a person's greatest fears, etc. That being said, I don't think it works as well for Harry Potter occlumency, as it seems to be an entirely different thing. Also, the Xmen one isn't usually a chosen mindscape, rather its a manifestation of a persons mind, and only the super advanced telepaths could alter it. Either way, I agree, I'm not a fan of fanon occlumency
