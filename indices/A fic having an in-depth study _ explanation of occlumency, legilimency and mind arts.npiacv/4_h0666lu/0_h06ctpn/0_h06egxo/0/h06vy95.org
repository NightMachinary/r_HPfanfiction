It's a very interesting story, but I personally cannot get back into it. I read it once, finished it, and have no chance of getting back into it. For me, there's simply too many sidestories and irrelevant subplots that make it interesting, but a bit too messy, long-winded, and all over the place at times. It's not my cup of tea, but some may enjoy it.
