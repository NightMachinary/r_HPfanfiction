What happened at the scavenger hunt? Link is broken. I'm guessing it was GISHWHES but holy shit this stuff keeps happening. Remember Andrew Blaze? Damn. People need to be careful who they talk to.\\
I knew a girl in passing who was associated with Misha Collins' charity Random Acts and lied about her housing situation to the point of getting the fandom to buy her new furniture and a new apartment. It got Misha's attention and he reached out to her and put her up in a hotel to go to the Chicago convention a few years back and I just remember instantly hating her overly-bubbly persona even before I knew what she did. I don't know what happened to her but she had plenty of followers on tumblr.\\
Fandoms are rife with scam artists and people need to be more aware of the risks of supporting and speaking with people.
