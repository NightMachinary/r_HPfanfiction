How about no. There are certain people I don't respect. Respecting somebody's choice of name/title/pronoun is contingent on them having my respect in the first place. That would be like someone saying "Even if Hitler was an asshole, we should still respect his title and call him the FÃ¼hrer.

No thanks.
