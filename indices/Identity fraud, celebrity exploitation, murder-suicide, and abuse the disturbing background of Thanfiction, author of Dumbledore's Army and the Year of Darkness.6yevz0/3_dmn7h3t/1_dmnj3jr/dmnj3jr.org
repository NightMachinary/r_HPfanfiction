  I know this is an unpopular opinion... But is this necessary for the enjoyment or disenchantment of the work in which the author penned? Does it matter if the author is a psychopath?

Entirely depends on your approach to the text. For me, it differs depending on the seriousness of their acts, how excusable they are, and whether I'm giving them any money. But it's 100% fine if your porsonal response is not to allow it to influence your reading. I have that easier here, as I'd never got into DAYD.

I'll second [[/u/Moosebrawn]] for why this needs to be said even if everyone approached it like that: because this person is a legitimate danger and their dangerous history should be well known to protect people.
