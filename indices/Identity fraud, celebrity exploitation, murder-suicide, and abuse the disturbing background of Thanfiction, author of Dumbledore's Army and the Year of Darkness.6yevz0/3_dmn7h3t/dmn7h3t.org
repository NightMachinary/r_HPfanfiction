I know this is an unpopular opinion... But is this necessary for the enjoyment or disenchantment of the work in which the author penned? Does it /matter/ if the author is a psychopath?

I know that when we say that Poe had depression, and it showed in his writing, it does not take away that the work was enjoyable. The same curterousy should be extended to those who write fanfiction. Is what this person did terrible? Yes. Does it make me never want to meet this person? Yes. Does it mean that their work is absolute shit and should never be read by anyone ever? Not really.

I honestly feel that while interesting information to have on an author, it honestly doesn't matter. At most it stops people from reading their work simply because they are bad people. Which, for some is a good argument; however, I am not one of those people.
