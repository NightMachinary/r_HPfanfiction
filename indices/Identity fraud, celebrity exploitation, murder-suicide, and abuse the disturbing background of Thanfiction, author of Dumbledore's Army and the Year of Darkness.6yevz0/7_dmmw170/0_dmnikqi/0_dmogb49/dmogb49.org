Fair enough.

It surprised me to see it here is all since for most who have been around awhile in the fandom, this was discussed in exhausting detail on most every HP fanfiction forum back when. It's part of why I never read DAYD back when it was updating. (WIth the exception of the time I picked up /Less Than Zero/ by Bret Easton Ellis for a long flight, I almost never read prose by writers I know to be subhuman jerkwads.)
