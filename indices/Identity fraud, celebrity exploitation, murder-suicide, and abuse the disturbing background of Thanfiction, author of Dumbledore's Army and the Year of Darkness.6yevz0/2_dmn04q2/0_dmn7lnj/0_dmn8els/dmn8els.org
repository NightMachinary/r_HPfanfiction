I don't really mind violence as long as it makes sense in the plot. I'm a GOT fan and I also have dysfunctional, cross-gen ships with power-struggles so I get the appeal.

However that story is simply /not good/. The violence is excessive and pandering, it's highly misogynistic and the characterizations are out of whack. And it's fine if that's what you're into, I guess. The worst part is that I see it recommended as a canon-compliant, alternate 7th year fic and I have to wonder what series people have been reading.
