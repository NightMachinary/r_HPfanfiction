IIRC, Death Eaters raping and doing all that is fanon. It could be implied with some of them, but that'd be more fanon creative license territory.

But, yeah. As a Death Eater, I fully expect Snape to have killed innocent people: his worst memory is of the girl he had unrequited feelings for being called a slur and a bullying situation.

Not, you know, killing innocent people like muggles, muggleborns, half-bloods, and "traitorous" pure-bloods.
