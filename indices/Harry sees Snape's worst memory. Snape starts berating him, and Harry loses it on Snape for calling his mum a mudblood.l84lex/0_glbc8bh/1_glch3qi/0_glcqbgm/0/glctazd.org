Yup exactly my point. Lots of people fighting against Voldemort were suddenly and mercilessly cut down. Snape also being one of them doesn't gain him much on the karmic scales IMO.

The fact that he decided to fight gains him some points, but his initial reason loses him points. As does his actions against the kid he helped cause to be orphaned.
