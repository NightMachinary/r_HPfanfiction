I think the worst thing is that beeing held upside down showing underwear and calling lily a mudblood is considered his worst memory. Murdering, raping, etc as a deatheater was no biggie, it shows Snape has no empathy for those he killed/raped, but any slight against him is bliwn wildly out of proportion.

Snape namecalls and bullies younger students? Well the marauders "bullied" him so hes totally innocent.

The fact snape only became a spy because lily was targeted makes me ill. Any other baby voldemort coukd have gone after, and Snape eould have been completely content to continue murdering.

Bah.. Snape at no point even tried to redeem himself in canon. The fact that if Harry hadn't been there when Snape died, he wouldnt have known he was a horcrux is just.. urg.
