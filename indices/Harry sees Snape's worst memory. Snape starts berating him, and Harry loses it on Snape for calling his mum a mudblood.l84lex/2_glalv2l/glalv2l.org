Snape is also so angry that he actually smashes the jar of beetles in Harry's head and accidentally kills him. Now it's Voldemort that's angry because a Death Eater disobeyed his order of leaving Harry for him and after prolonged torture, he kills Snape. Now Dumbledore has to train Neville to fulfill the prophecy and is happy to do so because now there's no link to Voldemort that could snoop into their discussions.
