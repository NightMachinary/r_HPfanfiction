You know, /Ron Was Fat and Ugly/ was amazing, but while this, too, is quality crack, I don't feel like it's up to the same standard. The percentages are funny, but I think it has too much random bloody murder towards the end, and the technically correct but terrible and nonsensical writing in the first one made it funnier ("quirking his eyebrows quirkily", "he expertly manipulated the demonic fire into the shape of a large spork").
