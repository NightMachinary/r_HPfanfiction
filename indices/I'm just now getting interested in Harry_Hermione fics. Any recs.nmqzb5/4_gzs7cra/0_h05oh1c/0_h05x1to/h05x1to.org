Yeah it's definitely slow moving. I enjoyed the chapters as a Sunday reading activity because they really pack it in there!

But I really love the house elf stuff, and it's just a really nice story.

The other one is definitely a different tone but I love the dynamic as Harry and Hermione didn't grow up together. I hope you'll enjoy it! That author has a few Harry/Hermione stories but I think this one is my favourite of them
