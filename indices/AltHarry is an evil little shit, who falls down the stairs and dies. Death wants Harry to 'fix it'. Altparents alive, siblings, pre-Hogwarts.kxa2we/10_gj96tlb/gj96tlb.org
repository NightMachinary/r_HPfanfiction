is it gen?

if so, check some popular gen harry potter fic lists. as well as lists of fics where he's not the boy who lived. and parents are alive fic lists. etc.

do a major ao3 check.

just write down what you know and divide that into tags(eg. neville is the boy who lived, bad/dark harry, etc.) then just search for those.

this is the best help I can do, I don't read anything but drarry and have never come across this specific fic.
