I read one where Harry joined Voldemort, killed his brother, and was essentially the second most feared wizard alive, after Voldemort himself. Something happened, a ritual gone wrong, and he swapped worlds with canon Harry. Canon Harry was pretty quick on the upkeep, especially when he gets attacked, stunned, and bound. I think his sister helps him escape, and she was under some sort of spell from the evil Harry.

Cannot remember the name, but it was a good read.
