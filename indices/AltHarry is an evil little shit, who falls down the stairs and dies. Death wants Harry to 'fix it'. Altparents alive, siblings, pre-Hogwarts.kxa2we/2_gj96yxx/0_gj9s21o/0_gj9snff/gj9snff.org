After he gets to the new world the only person who likes him in his new family is lily. She has always wanted her son to love him and he was a shit so when he shows up really nice and wanting hugs and making breakfast for the family she just eats it up. Its a slow slow slow burn for that ship. His father is a piece of shit and cheat on lily I think and this new amazing harry just shifts lilys world to him instead of james. James totally deserves lily abandoning him in this story. Harry ends up the strong male who takes care of the family and after a Ministry event where he tries to lure out voldermort or something voldemort allows the whole who wants to join me in this pureblood team thing and james basically gives up his wife and kids saying he will let them die so he can live, theres a big fight and after that lily sees him more as the man she wanted james to be and after that they are together I think, its not fleshed out well but it is pretty cute and I love this story.
