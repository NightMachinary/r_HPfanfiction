I've read this...

Isn't this the one where he wakes up in the Godric Hollow graveyard where his alt self killed himself, he goes inside and everyone freaks about where he was, only his mother really cares about him, his father and 2 sisters hate him, sirius has a kid the same age who his alt self made mad at him and everyone's basically wondering why he is now trying to be good but his mother is all over loving him and even sleeps in his bed once the good new harry is there.

Right, that one?

(Edit) Is this one of the ones where harry is at privet 4 in the summer and dies in his room to get sent to the AU New Dimension World? Its not a reaper challenge flic right? I'm trying to find the story but not having luck yet.
