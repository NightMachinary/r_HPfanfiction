Not read them, just located them. Someone else reviewed them don't know how accurately.

*Wand of Uru* - "Stay the fuck away from this one. It's not only unfinished, but it's just /bad/. "

*Girl Who Lived* - This one's average for what seems to be a fixit fic. It's proofread and has good grammer. The first part follows the original pretty much exactly.

*New Lives and New Battles:* "It's the same shit as all the others for the first few chapters. I'm sloggin through another variation of this. I'm sure if you squint it's an okay story. "

*Steve2* - "On the bright side, the Hat is a sarcastic asshole. As I mentioned earlier, I love that. Too bad we have Harry Sue as the main character instead of it. "

*Smaster28, an excerpt -* "Don't worry they are my family too. I am a true earthling or the member of the very first human race. We have more powers then you can even comprehend. We expanded our civilization across the universe. The stronger people amongst us could move from one planet to another in an instant. They could destroy galaxies at their whims. A long time ago before I was born, a deadly war broke out because the people got greedy because of their powers. Our Emperor stopped the war. Barring his allies and family members he took everyone's powers; thus creating the modern day human beings. The theory of evolution is just a hoax created by us to hide our existence. I am the Emperor's youngest son. Recently my own powers were increasing at a rapid rate. Fearing that I may not be able to control myself, I split my essence into two equal parts."
