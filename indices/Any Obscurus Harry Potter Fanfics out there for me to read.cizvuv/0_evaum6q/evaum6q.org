Could be a fun prompt, if nobody's done it yet; Dumbledore decides that the 'power he knows not' is an Obscurus and has been deliberately trying to make Harry one. Sticking him with the Dursleys, mind rapes with Snape, all the deadly threats year after year with no support or aid, basically the worst bits of Manipulative!Evil!Dumbles.

Whether this is a full fix or just an angry rant from his portrait after his death belongs to the writer.
