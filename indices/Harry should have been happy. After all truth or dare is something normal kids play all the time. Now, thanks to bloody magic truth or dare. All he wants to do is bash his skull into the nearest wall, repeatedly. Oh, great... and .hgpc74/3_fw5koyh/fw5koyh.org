Im creating something up in my head. Trying to figure out a punishment for players. Player b has to answer a question given to the crowd and player bs answer has to fit player a.

If b is wrong they have to do things like take shots, and maybe very 5, 10 and 15th question they ger wrong really embarassing shit happens.

Also on flip side maybe player a on a wrong answer has to do dares from the group or pick a punishment from a box with their partner...

So many fun possible things... this is the tyoe of game couples dark secrets get known. People break up, sexual tention is released or known. I swear i am up to no good shit.

Gotta think on this one. Will reapond after i sleep.
