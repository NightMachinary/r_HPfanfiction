The best two Harry / Gabrielle stories are both by [[/u/TE7]]: Vitam Paramus and Twelve Days. linkffn(13459233) and linkffn(9444529).

Neither story is smutty and neither bothers with any kind of Veela "allure" or anything like that. Vitam Paramus is a story of shared loss and two people healing each other. Twelve Days is a Christmas story that brims with love. Don't want to say much more than that to avoid spoilers.
