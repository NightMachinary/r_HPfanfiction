While I enjoyed the tale, as much as the author has written and published so far, it would be misleading to say that there is some kind of crossover component in the story. It would be more fitting to say that the author borrows the basic concept of the movie and changes it beyond all recognition; the Harry Potter style magic doing all the work.

That said, I think the closest alternative I know to The Wizard from Earth is a story by Rakeesh called /A Long Journey Home/ linkffn(9860311). It does things quite a bit differently and features a fem!Harry on top of that, but the basics (time-travel into the far past, immortal!protagonist, "ancient" magic, etc) are all the same.
