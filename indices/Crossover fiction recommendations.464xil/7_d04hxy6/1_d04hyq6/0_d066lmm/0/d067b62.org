I was gonna make it a real crossover, y'know - I just haven't got that far into it. Since Harry's a wizard and can memory charm someone, I figured they'd travel together for a while and eventually Harry would depart back to the Wizarding World & remove the risk of John knowing too much when it comes to magic, keeping wizard from catching on - when they meet again he can just give the memories back and pick up where they left off. I figured that time when John sees someone he thinks might be like him would be Harry, right after the memory charm.

I might get back to writing that fic, but it could use with some drastic pruning.
