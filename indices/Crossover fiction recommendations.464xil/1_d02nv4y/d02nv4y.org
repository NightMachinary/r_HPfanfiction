tons of good stories that havent been mentioned, you didnt say what type of fics u want(smut, adventure, angst, friendship, poltical intruige, pardoy, humor etc) but I believe all of these are no pairing/platonic pairing and no smut btw: all also are in HP universe with OC/Xover chars joining them

harry potter and the natural 20: (DND player transported to HP universe, munchking abounds, never played DnD still found very enjoyable//humorous) linkffn(8096183)

the best 7 years: Calvin from calvin and Hobbes disapears to go to hogwarts, meets susie again when hes 18 and tells her about the past 7 years linkffn(2760303)

Then I also read a good sherlock/harry potter crossover where Harry ends up raised by sherlock and watson (might of been !femWatson) but cant remeber the name, harry expermints with magic, is a serious/non silly fic

harveste addams: what if harry potter is raised by the Adams family ?(borderline actual crack, its mainly a Darkcomdey) linkffn(6343441)

something grim this way comes: billy and mandy Xover only without the stupid anoying billy cuz harry basically replaces him only is still harry. Grimm is the best character. another darkish but lighthearted comdey fic linkffn(2666277)
