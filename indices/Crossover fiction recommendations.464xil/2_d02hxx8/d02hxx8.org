Most crossovers have only Harry going alone. I found a few with Ginny going, but since you don't like Harry+Ginny, these two shall suffice:

*Reinforcements*, linkffn(8009056), has the Twins and Ginny going to LOTR world.

*The Witch Queen of Essos*, linkffn(11362863), put Ginny and Sirius in GoT world after falling through the veil.
