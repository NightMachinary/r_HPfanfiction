  When Harry goes on vacation with the Dursleys to America, he will learn a skill that may be just what he needs to defeat Voldemort. Of course, because he's Harry Potter, it doesn't quite go as expected. Now, with an incessant, caring Death backing him, Harry doesn't think he will ever get a break. At least his dogfather will be proud that Harry takes after him. Animagus!Harry
