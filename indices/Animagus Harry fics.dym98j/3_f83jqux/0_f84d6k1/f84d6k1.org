This story is a wonderful departure if anyone is looking for a more light-hearted fic that doesn't involve a ton of dramatic, angsty, hyper-mature, or dark themes. For example, there are several instances where Draco Malfoy tries to rile up Harry and Harry throws him through a loop by never taking the bait. Harry just sort of automatically assumes everyone is doing their best and overall has a very positive attitude toward everything. Even when the Dursleys try to abuse him, Harry doesn't really mind, because he intrinsically treats his cupboard under the stairs like a miniature lair, and he can eat pretty much anything so he doesn't go hungry; he even enjoys doing the gardening because he just eats all the plants that need to be gone. It's fantastic.
