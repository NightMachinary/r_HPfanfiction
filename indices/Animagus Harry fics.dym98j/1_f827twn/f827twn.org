Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) is one of my favorites and Hermione is an animagus. It's quite central to her character because after reading that which animal you get depends on your personality she uses psychology trickery to modify her personality to ensure a highly useful animagus form, and while she thinks she has it under control her personality warps more and more with every scene from her perspective. The animagus form is also quite plot relevant since after getting the form she wanted she uses it practically everywhere.

She turns more and more into a crazy cat lady, and becomes obsessed with using the cat motif, catburglar in a catsuit with a cat mask and she can turn into a cat, which makes it a little too obvious for the investigating aurors.
