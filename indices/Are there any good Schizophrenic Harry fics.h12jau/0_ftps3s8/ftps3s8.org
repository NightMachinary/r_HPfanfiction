Schizophrenia isn't as entertaining as people make it out to be. To make it compelling you have to do an unrealistic, romanticized portrayal of the debilitating disorder and that's enough to kick the suspension of disbelief for me. There's plenty of psychopath, depressed and even multiple personality fics out there though.
