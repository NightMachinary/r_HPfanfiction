I suppose it would depend on the severity of depression; there is a real lack of understanding about the depression and anxiety. Particularly when it gets to a stage when people are unable to maintain a job. Nevertheless, I agree it's easier to find people with the experience to write it or at the very least describe it in a way that people find easy to empathise with.

Given the estimated range of prevalence for DID, it works out as slightly more or less than schizophrenia. It's extremely rare to find a decent portrayal of it as it's also quite a complex disorder.

I am aware of the nature of schizophrenia (particularly where its got further into the course untreated), but I appreciate that most people don't.
