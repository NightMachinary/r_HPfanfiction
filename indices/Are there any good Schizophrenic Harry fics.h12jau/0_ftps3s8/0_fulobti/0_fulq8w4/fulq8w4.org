Affective disorders are more common than psychotic disorders, so they're more likely to be accurately represented in fiction. But psychosis is difficult to describe accurately from an MCs perspective. There's delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms, cognitive decline, social isolation, etc. Many schizophrenics end up with severely limited verbal capabilities and total loss of introspection.

A realistically portrayed descent into a deep depressive episode can be compelling without challenging my suspension of disbelief because everyone can at least empathize with it (like you said); but a psychotic break from the perspective of the main character would be difficult to even portray realistically. You'd have to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of the character's likeability.
