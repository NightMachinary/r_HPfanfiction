It's cursed, that's what matters, much like how no healer can fix a cursed wound (such as an ear lost to sectumsempra) there's no undoing the harm it deals, and naturally you need a specific (and apparently not taught in 6th year or under DADA judging by how noone knew it DH) counter curse to end it, you can't just put it out like mundane fire.
