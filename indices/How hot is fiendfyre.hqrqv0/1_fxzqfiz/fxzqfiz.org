Probably cursed fire. The diadem was completely incinerated in the ROR. A flame capable of completely vaporizing metal and gemstones would probably be hotter than the surface of the sun. Just standing within a few meters of it would be enough to kill you out right and they escaped with minimal injuries.

If you went the none cursed route it would make the spell infinity more deadly than just some pissed off fire.
