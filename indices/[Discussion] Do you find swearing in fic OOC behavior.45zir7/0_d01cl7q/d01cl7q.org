It doesn't really bother me, though I suppose I'm guilty of having characters swear liberally in at least one of my fics (though it makes sense given the tone of the story). I can certainly see why others would be annoyed by it, because no one ever explicitly swears in the original series, and suddenly seeing implied profanity explicitly detailed in a fic might be off-putting to some readers.

As for it being OOC? I dunno. This is a series that takes place in England/Scotland in the 90s, and features a cast of mostly teenagers; the fact that their language is so sanitised is what I find far more OOC. Of course, Jo had to clean up the language because HP was first and foremost a children's/young adult's series, but, having spent some time living in northern England as a child, I have a very hard time believing /only/ Ron swears with any regularity.
