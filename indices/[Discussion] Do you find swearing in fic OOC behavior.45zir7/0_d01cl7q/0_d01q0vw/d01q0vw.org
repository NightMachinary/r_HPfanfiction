Pretty much this. I would've been a decade younger than the trio, but I still can't imagine a time where English teenagers /never/ swore.

If you're going for a strictly canon feel, it's probably worth just saying "____ swore/cursed," as JKR did as a compromise. Otherwise, as long as it sounds well-placed and the story is rated appropriately, I can't see much of an issue with frequent expletives.
