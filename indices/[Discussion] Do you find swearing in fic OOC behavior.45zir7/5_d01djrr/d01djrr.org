Well...too much profanity is a turn-off no matter what I'm reading. If every other word is vulgar, that's overkill no matter what. I don't care if the characters are hardcore gangstas, it's distracting.

That said, a moderate usage really depends on the character's age and origin; it seems natural for the teenaged characters to swear occasionally. The parent characters...less so, depending on who they are. The fact that Molly Weasley, for example, doesn't swear is what makes her 'you b----' so powerful and awesome. The lack of profanity in canon doesn't bother me at all, either, so either way is fine.
