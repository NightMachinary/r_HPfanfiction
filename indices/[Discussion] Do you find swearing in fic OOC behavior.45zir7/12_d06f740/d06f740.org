The problem with swearing is, that colloquialism doesn't translate well geographically. Sure, the basic swear words in the English language are the same everywhere, but outside of that you have a distinctive national/local flavor of swearing in different regions.

That's the reason why I tend to dislike excessive swearing in Harry Potter fanfiction. If you ever see an American try to do a British accent, those familiar with it will just shake their heads sadly and bemoan the colonials' lack of culture.

That also works the other way around. If you're doing it right, people might not understand it as you intended. I'm not a native English speaker for example and only grew to understand the less formal way of communicating in several English-speaking countries around the world after long years of practice. Put some of the less common swear words in front of non-native English speakers - and lets not forget, that this is a not inconsiderable part of fanfiction readers after all - and it will likely fly over their heads.

My point is: better leave it out if you can't do it right, but even authentic swearing may not be the best choice for an international audience.
