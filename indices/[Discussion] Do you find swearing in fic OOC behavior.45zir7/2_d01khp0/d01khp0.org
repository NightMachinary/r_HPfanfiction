There's a ton of "___ swore," as you mentioned. Some of it goes unnoticed, but it's actually fairly frequent in the later books.

JKR has pretty much said that she had to limit the swearing due to the nature of the audience:

  JKR: Well, I think - I've got a feeling I've told Stephen this already. My editor won't let any of the characters swear. Which is sometimes difficult because Ron is definitely a boy who would swear. So you will have noticed that I get round that by having him - Ron used a word that made Hermione say "Ron!". So I do that quite a bit with Ron.

Ron likes swearing, but I can't imagine him peppering his speech too liberally with cursing because he wouldn't dare curse in front of his mother. So cursing is still going to be a sort of subversive act. Same with all of the Weasley brothers. They would swear, but it wouldn't easily slip off their tongues in regular conversation.

I've always been a fan of precision swearing for Hermione. I don't think she would ever be that into it, but if you're writing Hermione/Ron, it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't wear off a little. And after all, Hermione does tell Ron "where he can stick his wand" and calls him an arse after he returns in DH. She's not completely opposed to swearing.
