I think there's suspiciously little swearing in canon as it is already. All teenagers, away from their parents? Harry didn't have a mother figure growing up, so there's nothing to stop him from swearing like his life depended on it. Ron and Ginny probably learnt a lot of very colorful language from their older brothers, and a lot of teenage boys simply swear because it makes them sound cool.

So I think swearing is far from OOC. In fact, the only important character who probably doesn't swear a lot is Hermione.
