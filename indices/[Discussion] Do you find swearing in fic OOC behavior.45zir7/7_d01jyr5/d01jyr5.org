I dislike it when characters pepper their speech with swears. It's not how they talk in canon, and it doesn't really fit. Wizards and witches don't seem to have much access to muggle pop culture, and they go to boarding school, so they aren't exposed to those sorts of speech patterns enough that they'd likely imitate them. You don't swear as part of normal speech unless the people around you do as well, or you deliberately like to sound vulgar.

On the other hand, canon characters obviously swear sometimes in canon, although it's often implied. Most everyone swears when they stub a toe, or when they're furious, so I don't think it's weird for even the most polite characters to swear then. I can also imagine Ginny swearing to get a rise out of people, but that's still a deliberate decision, not a casual part of normal speech.
