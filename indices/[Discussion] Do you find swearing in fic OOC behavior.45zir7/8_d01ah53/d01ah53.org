  So, what about in fic? Do you find regular swearing in fic sounds ooc because the characters are limited in canon? Is it sometimes overdone in fic? Or do you think they just wouldn't swear much even if they were allowed to in canon?

I tend to think of swearing as a crutch for writers with a poor vocabulary. There are, however, notable exceptions to this. For example, I recently finished a book in /The Expanse/ series featuring a diminutive, elderly woman with an absolutely filthy mouth as protagonist. She swore in moments of tension not only as a way to relieve her stress, but to assert her dominance and push her worldview on the other characters. I don't know how else the authors would have 'shown not told' these particular facets of this character in such an easily relatable manner.

Your views about the canon characters' use of profanity makes sense to me, but I don't remember enough about Ginny's dialogue to say whether or not she was particularly creative in that regard. In HP fanfic, though, nine times out of ten authors use swearing as a method to make their emo!Harry seem 'cool.' I think it's OOC and don't see why Harry would use casual profanity in any context.
