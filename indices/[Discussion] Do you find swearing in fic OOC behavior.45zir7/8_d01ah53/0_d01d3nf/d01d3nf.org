I quickly back away from fics that try to make Harry 'hardcore' with constant profanity. Often, it's not even a creative use of profanity. It's just one or two words on repeat. Swear words - any dialogue really - should be representative of a character's personality or situation. If it doesn't do that, it's unnecessary.

As for the Ginny thing, I admit that's more headcanon. I can imagine Molly not wanting her to pick up swear words, and Ginny finding it wickedly amusing to do so. The inventive ones would be specifically dropped in front of her brothers just to get a reaction.
