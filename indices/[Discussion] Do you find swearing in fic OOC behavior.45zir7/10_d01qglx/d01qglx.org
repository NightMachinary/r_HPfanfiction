Swearing in stories doesn't bother me except when done badly - like anything else. If the characters start effing and blinding left right and centre, that's always going to put me off. But another thing is when American authors try to swear in a British style: "Bloody buggering balls" is a phrase I see far too often, and which has never, ever been uttered by any British teenager.

And trying to spice up wizarding expressions can be awful too. "Merlin's saggy left buttock" and nonsense like that. Just no.

In an M-rated story, there's nothing wrong with having a character say "shit!" or similar. If you're writing for a younger audience, just don't do that.
