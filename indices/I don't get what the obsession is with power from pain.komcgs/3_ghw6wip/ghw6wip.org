It may be because it strains their mana/muscles/energy source so much that it hurts. When a character gets a new power it may hurt because of their body getting used to it. They just got a new power, so their mana/body/energy source needs to adapt. In most Fiction stories the energy source is like a muscle, meaning the more strained it becomes, the more it'll heal, and the more powerful it will get. The energy source most likely strains to get uses to the power. Example, What would happen if Harry suddenly got, I dunno, telekinesis. Well, his Magic core would need to grow so that it could hold the power, and grow so he has enough energy to actually use it. His body would most likely also need to grow because it would need to insert the power into his DNA. This sudden growth would result in constant strain, and healing. Causing a lot of pain. Again, this is just a theory.
