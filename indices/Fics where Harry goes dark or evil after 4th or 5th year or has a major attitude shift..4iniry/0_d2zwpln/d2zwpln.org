*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): the horcrux in Harry was sentient and it made a deal with Harry after year 5. The resulting Harry became extremely powerful and far more ruthless. Voldemort was no longer his worst enemy though.

*Rise of the Wizards*, linkffn(6254783): Voldemort's possession in MoM changed the nature of the scar, and Harry became different as a result. Voldemort, again, was no longer his worst enemy. [[/spoiler][Later he would fight Hermione for more than a century]]

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): Harry went dark after Voldemort's fall for political reasons, and his friends joined him. This is one of my most favorite stories.
