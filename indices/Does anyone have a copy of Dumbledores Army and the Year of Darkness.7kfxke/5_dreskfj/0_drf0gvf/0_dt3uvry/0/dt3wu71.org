Well, all right, I have three here. :)

"The Lions of Gryffindor" is fairly short, but well-written. It's essentially Neville's story, with flashbacks to his parents and grandmother.

"Not from Others" has Ginny as the main character and is pretty Weasley-centric, but features Dumbledore's Army well.

And "A Call To Arms" is multiple-POV and the longest of the three fics.

All of these are tons better than "Year of Darkness."
