It was about what Dumbledore's Army got up to at Hogwarts while Harry, Ron and Hermione were out on their Horcux hunt.

Apparently they all turned into total OOC versions of themselves with all the boys becoming Manly Soldiers and the girls all becoming delicate nurturing flowers who spoke a secret language or some rot like that, and Neville turned into a total douchebag that everyone worshipped for some reason, and everything turned REALLY bleak and dark and depressing.

I wouldn't bother with it if I were you. There are lots of better "Dumbledore's Army at Hogwarts" fics out there.
