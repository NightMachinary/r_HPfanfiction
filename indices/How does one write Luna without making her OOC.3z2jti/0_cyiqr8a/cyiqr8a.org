You're certainly correct that authors often do a poor job with her character. I had some thoughts [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xtmhe/luna_as_a_seer_misses_the_point_of_her_character/cy7nvqs][in the Luna-as-seer thread.]].

Use her strangeness as a vehicle to drive growth in the protagonist(s), not to foreshadow or overly complicate plot points. Having a character act strangely just for the sake of being different will bore the reader unless there's an underlying reason: a moral to be learned, a way to test the protagonist's patience, etc.
