I would agree with most of this. However; I'd argue that if it is going to be a romance, the oddness CANNOT be a turnoff. It should make her something along the lines of endearing yet embarrassing.

Such an important aspect of a person being a turnoff would lead major problems in a relationship. If you can't handle how someone acts regularly, it doesn't matter how much you like/love them, you won't want to marry them.

Endearing yet embarrassing could easily lead to a slow build romance where Harry would avoid her at first because of peer pressure, but every little interaction would bring out more reasons he likes her. Eventually, he would screw peer pressure, ask her to hogsmeade, and they'd live happily ever after once the stories conflict is resolved.

Also, the author will need to address the wrackspurts, at least for their own character profile. As you said, she needs to be fleshed out beforehand since there is a lot of leeway for her character. As a main character of any reasonable length fic, Luna's odd creatures and odd behavior will be questioned. The handling of this would be imperative. Regardless of the ffn authors given (or withheld) reasoning behind them, to change/remove the odd aspects of Luna would immediately make her ooc.
