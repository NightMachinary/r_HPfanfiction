True, harry is stubborn, but harry also doesn't like to be talked about. so he may still avoid luna before getting to know her. Note he is uncomfortable around her on the train ride to Hogwarts, another indication that he would avoid her at first. Without a reason like knowing her somewhat, harry won't start to think about ignoring peer pressure. He wouldn't just "not bow to peer pressure" to be contrary
