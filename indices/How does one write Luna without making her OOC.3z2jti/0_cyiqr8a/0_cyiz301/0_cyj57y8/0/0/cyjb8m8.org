I think you're both OOC-ing Harry a bit. Luna is strange, but Harry's not exactly the type to bow to peer pressure. Look at the chemistry Dan and Evanna had in the film. She reminds me in many ways of Dobby, another slightly (incredibly) odd character who Harry didn't understand at first but was patient with where many might not have been, and developed empathy for.
