When the reader is first introduced to Luna in the original series the only things we know about her are from her reputation around school. In these early chapters of OOtP, she tells us practically nothing about herself. Rowling waited around 250K words to bother giving Luna any qualities other than 'extremely strange.'

Too many fanfiction authors overwhelm the reader with /thorough/ descriptions of Luna's personality as soon as she appears in their story. They force her to display her very best qualities /immediately/ and this condemns her to Mary-Sue status. Her extreme oddness is only ever briefly mentioned by writers who are trying to move her to the forefront from her regular place in the background. If Luna is likeable too quickly, then the reader gets bored because the inherent mystery of her character is solved right away.

I think the best way to fix this problem is for the writer to take bold steps to flesh out the rest of her character. If I have to make an OC, then I make a separate document that answers several questions about them. I think the same thing could work for Luna. How do they behave in a crisis? What is their greatest fear/hope? What causes them to grow as a person or, conversely, to stagnate? If the writer puts a lot of effort in their characterizations before the first chapter is written, the reader reaps the rewards.

It would be extremely challenging to draft a believable HP/LL romance. Most of the time it's poorly executed because writers try to pare down Luna's rough edges to make her a better fit for Harry. There are probably several ways to avoid this, but the only way I can think of off the top of my head is to make Luna's oddness an initial turn-off for her potential love interest. Her better qualities that invariably provide the foundation for believable romance - profound empathy, love of her friends, etc - should be prevalent much later.
