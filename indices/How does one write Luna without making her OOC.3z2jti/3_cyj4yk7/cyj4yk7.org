It's kinda like talking to someone who is watching TV and not really listening to you. But they somehow still get the conversation right, or close enough.

It doesn't matter what she is distracted by (the future, fake animals, imaginary friends) but write her as though she isn't exactly always in the moment, and save her lucid moments for big scenes.

I've written her as both "just odd" and as a seeress of sorts, I think the one that makes more sense depends on why you are including her in your story. But the best way is probably to remember her mother died when she was young, her father went crazier than he was before and she believes every word her father says or writes. Therefore she thinks she's the normal one and everyone else is just a bit off. Why would she change who she is if she's the one that is right?

She is intelligent, she is odd, and most of what she says could be imagined as being a conspiratorial whisper.
