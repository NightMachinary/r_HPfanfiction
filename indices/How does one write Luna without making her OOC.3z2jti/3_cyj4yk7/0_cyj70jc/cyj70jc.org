This. Fics that have a memorable luna keep her 100% lucidity to a minimum. Stages of Hope (see other post in this thread) does this very well. Luna can shift from mostly gone to mostly there, but only when it's absolutely necessary should she leave her animals and theories behind. Some fics it won't be needed. If you do need it, be sure to have laid groundwork for her to breach into the "real world", or for her to return to her "normal" ways
