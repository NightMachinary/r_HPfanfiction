Personally, I think it's better to go about writing Luna from others' perspectives. To that end, the best I've ever seen is /Faith and Understanding./ The writer wisely keeps the story mostly "Missing Moments," and we basically see Luna just be herself, through the lens of her friendship with Ginny.
