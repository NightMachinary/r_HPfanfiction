You can believe in things no one else does without being crazy. You can behave differently than others without being in a separate world. You can use uncommon references for advice and still make sense. you can choose to ignore people bullying you while still being aware of it happening.

Basically, you can make her a social outcast that sticks to her beliefs in spite of peer pressure and bullying to change, without making her act like she's high on every drug at the same time.

But if you want her as a side character, not main, than use her as a marker or mechanism of character or plot growth as others more eloquent than I mentioned, not just because "luna was in the books so she must be in my story too"
