Reminds me of that one severitus, Snape takes Harry to his vault, and where Harry is overjoyed because WOW MONEY, Snape is internally monologing how while it will get Harry through school, that's it. Realization how Potters must spend all of the old money they had, I think most Dumbledore took as contribution to war or something? Can't even remember the plot, just this one scene XD
