I can think of several, though quality will depend on your preferences I think:

- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): a 2nd person action adventure fic depicting the summer after OOTP. There is some bashing, but its moderated later by what you learn and you realize its not as cut-and-dry as Harry's initial POV. No titles or extravagant wealth. The 2nd person gets better, and works more if you listen to it rather than read.
- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): in the top 3 Slytherin!Harry fics, easily. Canon Harry in Slytherin goes about as well as you would logically expect, and we see how the distance it creates affects Harry's choices and behaviors. Good Cedric friendship stuff too.
- linkffn(A Mother in Law's Love): more of a comedic fic than anything else, but this fic definitely lampshades numerous trope in both the wider HP fandom and fanfiction (including the ones you mentioned initially). A good read, if relatively short.
