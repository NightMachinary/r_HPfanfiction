I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] which I really enjoyed - it's a 'what if Snape had retrieved Harry from the Dursleys' instead of Hagrid' story, really well written and thought out (she brings up a lot of problems with the magical world, then solves them!) and there's a sequel :)
