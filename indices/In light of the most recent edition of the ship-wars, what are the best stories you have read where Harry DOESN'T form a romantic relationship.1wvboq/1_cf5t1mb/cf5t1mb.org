I always liked Make a Wish and it's sequel Back in Black. Can't remember the author, but I remember it was a very long story, quite odd but good. Basically Harry, thinking he's going to die at Voldemorts hands, decides to live first. And then there is hilarious timing, coincidences and shenanigans.

Also, if i remember correctly Trinity (I think it's called) by Katling (hope that's spelled right) was a fantastic read with no romance. It's one of the first fics I ever read, actually, and remains a favourite.
