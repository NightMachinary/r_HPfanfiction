[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/][The Basement]] by Marz1. Third Year AU; has an unfortunately abandoned sequel. (For some reason, having just looked at it for the first time in a while, it's appears to all be in bold font. Don't know why, don't recall it being so the last time I looked, but thought I'd mention it. Regardless of this formatting issue, it's a good fic.)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/][A Different Fate]] by lordhellbore: "JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Avada Kedavra cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou. My favourite fic that shows the strength of the trio's friendship, but it's far from fluffy. Warnings for drug abuse.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/][Harry the Hufflepuff]] by BajaB: "Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story."

[[http://web.archive.org/web/20050215071817/http://www.schnoogle.com/authors/lostgrl/SS01.html][The Smallest Stars]] by lostgrl: "On the infamous night of the Voldemort's fall, the presence of a magical creature greatly changes the future of the wizarding world. Several years later, a strange child appears in Draco Malfoy's nursery. This new playmate calls himself Harry, and has control of a magic Draco has never seen before. Eventually, despite Harry's attempts to stop it, Draco begins to grow up, and Harry is forced to follow, if kicking and screaming all the way."
