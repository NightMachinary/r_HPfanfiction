Linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) - Kinda.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger) - This one is crass and kind of silly, but it fits. The only thing that could hope to oppose him is Sauron or a really unleashed Gandalf/Saruman, nothing else stands a chance.

Linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg) - Maybe.

Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter) - A Song of Ice and Fire being the setting it is, a wizard is unstoppable.
