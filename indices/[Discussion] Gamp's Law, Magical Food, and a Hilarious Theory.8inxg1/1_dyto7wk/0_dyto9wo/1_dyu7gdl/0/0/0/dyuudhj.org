Good point, but it's possible to muck about with the magic system to close that plot-hole. We know you can't /Accio/ a human being, not without a tremendous amount of magical skill anyway; so I propose that living beings' inherent magic interferes with attempts to Summon them. This makes summoning an animal very difficult, summoning a Muggle near-impossible, and summoning a wizard right out of the question. Now, if we accept this prior, we also know that it's harder to Summon an object out of some abstract concept than if you've got a very good idea what the object is like, and, ideally, the general area in which it is. So between the "living creature" block and the "'fish' is pretty vague" block, /Accio Fish/ would presumably be something Dumbledore could do, but not a teenager.
