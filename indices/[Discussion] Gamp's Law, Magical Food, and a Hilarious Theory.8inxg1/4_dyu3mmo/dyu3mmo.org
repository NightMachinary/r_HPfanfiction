This explanation hinges on the belief in a law, within a system of magic: this mean shared education and culture. For all we know, the exceptions to Gamp Law are universal across human cultures at least : this means that it hinges on the notion of humanity.\\
The law exceptions exists, because they points to our limits as human beings (goblins and Veela probably included); Voldemort trying to not die is stretching the definition of human quite a bit (some would doubt he is human anymore), but he still do not die instead of coming back; Flamel seems to be able to create money (although we don't know how much work is needed), but he does not try to do anything with it as far as we know.\\
The limits reagarding what can be done with magic are not limits of Magic, they are a limit of magicians. Soft ones (Dumbledore in his NEWT breaks some) who allows to know who got the biggest wand, and hard ones (Food, Money, Death,...) that defines us on a fundamental level.
