Would it still be a pig after you killed it though? Does the spell last past the pig's death?

Or would you start butchering a pig and end up turning a desk into firewood?

This also raises an interesting question about Animagi. If an Animagus dies in animal form, is there an animal body to bury, or do you have a human body?
