Far more ridiculous is the idea that a government full of wizards and witches with magic cannot track down a single, ordinary wizard who is wrecking their economy with the little amount of gold the could get from the muggle world. There's literally no way that would work, people are too fallible to get away with it for long, especially against motivated people with magic. You cannot stay completely hidden from everyone. Even with the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry was discovered in DH when he entered Hogsmeade, so no one short of a Voldemort or Dumbledore would have a chance at pulling this off for more than a few days.

Besides, as I said, gold isn't currency in HP, minted galleons are. Goblins aren't going to take in a bunch of material and mint them if it's going to break their place in the economy.
