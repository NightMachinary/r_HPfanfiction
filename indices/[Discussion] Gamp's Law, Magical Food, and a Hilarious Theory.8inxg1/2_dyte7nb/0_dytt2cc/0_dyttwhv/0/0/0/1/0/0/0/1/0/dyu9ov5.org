The Wizarding world is really tiny, the amount of gold available to a wizard in the Muggle world is probably around a few tens of tonnes at the least. If you buy slowly and hang on to it, it shouldn't be spotted, considering the manipulations of various governments on this market.\\
Anonymity is the crucial point here, there are spies and undercover agents in canon. I refuse to believe they're all on the level of Voldemort and Dumbledore, and lots of them were never spotted. So they can't find you outright. As all the plan can be done by one wizard alone and a few mind-controlled Muggles, there are no risks of traitors either. The distribution part could probably be done within just a few days or less, this is the only part where you do something that might get you spotted. Before that part, good luck figuring out what's going on anyway, if you indeed attract attention.\\
Gold isn't the currency of the Wizarding world, it doesn't mean you can't break the economy with it. You're attacking the market, not the currency. Probably less disruptive, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be.

Then, there's the little part you forget where the ministry is canonically incompetent to an extraordinary point. If the Goblins find out something's going on, there are chances they'll just wait for you to come cash in your gold in the only bank of the wizarding world, which they happen to control. Because this is the cheapest efficient way to react to this kind of things. That someone is trying to derail the entire economy rather than simply acting on greed is something they'll never think of considering their Canon personality.

So dangerous? Probably. But certainly not as much as you think.
