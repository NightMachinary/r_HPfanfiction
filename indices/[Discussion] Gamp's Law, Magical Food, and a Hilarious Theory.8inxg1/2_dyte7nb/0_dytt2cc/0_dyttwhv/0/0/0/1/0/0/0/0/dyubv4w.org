The germans tried something similar in world war 2. They dropped in counterfeit money to destroy the British economy but so much got turned in the government figured out what was happening, changed the design and exchange the non-counterfeit orignals so it failed. Not saying the same would happen in this scenario, just that it has been tried and failed.
