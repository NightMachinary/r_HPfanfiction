Are you seriously telling me handing out gold anonymously is impossible? Is this a joke?\\
Not even considering magic, nothing stops you from just discreetly drop a few kilograms right in front of peoples' doors. Then drop more of it into public places where you know people will find it.\\
With magic assistance, this would be trivial.\\
What would stop me from banishing large amounts of gold pieces into Diagon Alley from a few streets afar and then apparate away? Or home-deliver it through confounded owls, or any other method?\\
The idea that anonymously giving away stuff as precious as gold is difficult is ridiculous.
