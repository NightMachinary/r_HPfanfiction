I don't think so. Conjurations are less an issue since (with the apparent exception of the hand Voldemort conjured for Pettigrew) all conjurations fade away after a little while. Transfiguration in general though does present a problem. But then, now that I think about it, how much does the wizarding economy even depend on those materials? Most products seem to priced based on how, er, magical they are as opposed to the materials making it up (best example would be goblin-enchanted silver being more valuable than normal silver). Can't really transfigure an enchantment into something, you have to charm it.
