Eh, isn't this kinda the same thing fans have suggested for ages? Like how you can't transfigure gold presumably (although silver apparently works) to prevent economic issues. Seems unlikely anyone would just drop it, kids in particular would probably have figured out that it worked long ago since they try all sorts of things people say are impossible.

I think it's more likely that the inability to conjure good food from thin air has to do with the complexity of the living things the food comes from. Perhaps if they had a better (i.e. scientific) understanding of living things they might be able to.
