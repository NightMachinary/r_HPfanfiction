It doesn't become a crossover until part 2 and I am not a crossover fan, so I dropped it at that time but the first part is entertaining.

I do remember one I enjoyed with sg-1 but forgot the title. An op Harry deals with voldemort and the gets an obsession with space travel. He is visited by an ancient that tells him what he has to do and he ends up fighting replicators with the asguard fleet
