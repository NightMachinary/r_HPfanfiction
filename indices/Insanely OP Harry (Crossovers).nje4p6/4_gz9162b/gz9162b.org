based on how you wrote your request, I assume those 5 are examples, not the entirety of the list you want.

The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh\\
Lord of the Rings isn't on your list but The Power He Knows Not By: Steelbadger is incredible so I'm including it. Steelbadger also has a series of DC comics/Harry potter stories that you might want to try.\\
Toppling Heroes, the second of the two so far is closer to what you're looking for and the two are interconnected but you can read one with out the other. Just know Harry was in Gotham before the start of the story looking for Neville and you should be fine.\\
Browncoat, Green Eyes By: nonjon which is firefly is incredibly well written.\\
I have a one or two mass effect stories I could dig up too if anyone's interested
