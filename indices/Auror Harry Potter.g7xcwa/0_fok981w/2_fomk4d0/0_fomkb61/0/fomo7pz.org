Thanks, then i look forward to read all of this author's stories. It's such a great feeling to find a good fanfic author, especially when they have written a lot. And i love that this isn't just a creative rehash of the same story of year 1 to 7 of Hogwarts, it's fresh and new. And the characters stay believable and true to how we got to know them. I can believe that these characters are the grown up versions of the characters we got to know in the books.
