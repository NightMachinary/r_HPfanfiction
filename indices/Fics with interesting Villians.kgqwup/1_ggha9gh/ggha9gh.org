When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Harry got 99 problems and Voldemorts is only 1. Excellent fic. Complete but has an unfinished sequel. FFNet.
