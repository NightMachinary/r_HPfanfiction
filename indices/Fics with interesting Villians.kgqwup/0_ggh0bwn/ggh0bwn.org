There's one I'm reading right now called, 'The odds were never in my favor' . The fic is based around a Neville is the BWL while James Potter was supposedly the Longbottom's secret keeper and James got arrested while Lily was killed and their daughter, Alexandra, was sent to the Duesleys by Dumbledore. She is shunned when she comes to Hogwarts cause of her 'death eeater' father. There is plenty of bashing in it but Voldemort is anything but a massive threat and Alexandra is very dark-neutral. I've been enjoying it a lot.
