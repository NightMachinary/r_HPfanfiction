While not really related to OP's request, I want to recommend the completed Naruto equivalent to Seventh Horcrux by the same author that's only on a forum: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/reader][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]]

Oddly enough the author mentions this story on their profile, but they never posted it on FFN.
