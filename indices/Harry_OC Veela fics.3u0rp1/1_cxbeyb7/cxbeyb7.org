It's not a pairing between Aimee and Harry at the present time but in Deal with a Devil Harry has a Veela friend pre-Hogwarts. The fic is still ongoing, with regular updates so who really knows if they'll end up together. No... hm, now that I think more about it, there is actually quite the chance that their relationship will remain platonic.

Give it a go anyway, it could be to your liking.
