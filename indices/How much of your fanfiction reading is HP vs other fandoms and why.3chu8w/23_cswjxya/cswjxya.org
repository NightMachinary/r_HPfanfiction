Honestly it used to be about 25% HP and 75% anything else, but over a few years it's now about 70:30 in favour of HP. The HP fandom is massive and keeps churning out new fics daily. Some are good, some are bad, but each one is set in this magical universe that I think everyone here would love to actually live in. That's what continuously pulls me back.
