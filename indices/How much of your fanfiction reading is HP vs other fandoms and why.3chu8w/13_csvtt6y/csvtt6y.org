for the most part i mainly read hp fic. like when i get into a new fandom or get back into an old fandom ill go for however amount of time just reading fic for that, but eventually i get into the hp crossovers with it, and then that leads into straight hp fic..... its a neverending cycle rly. i think its mainly that hp is such a big part of my life that its like, a given that i would find the fic always interesting. also theres just so much fic for it? and such a wide range of topics? that even when i get bored i can jsut take a short break and then have my interest resparked within like a week because ive found somethign completely or mainly new.
