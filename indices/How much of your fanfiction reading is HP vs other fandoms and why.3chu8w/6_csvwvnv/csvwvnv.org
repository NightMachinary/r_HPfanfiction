I mostly read MLP:FiM stuff, and usually just read HP stuff when something is recommended to me. This is not because I don't like to read HP stuff --- I just find FFN impossible to use. I was fine with it before I discovered FiMfiction.net, but after using that for a while FFN is nearly unusable in comparison. The lack of proper voting causes a lack of proper sorting, which means you have to scroll through three pages of crap to find something good.

I've also been starting to read fanfiction of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]]. If you haven't read Worm, go read it right now. It's completely worth the month or so it'll probably take to read. Seriously go read it. The problem with the fanfiction is that it all seems to be posted in Spacebattles threads. I haven't gotten very good at finding it yet. What I have managed to read has been pretty great, though.
