Most of what I read is /Naruto/, /Harry Potter/, and /Friendship Is Magic/. /Naruto/ and /Harry Potter/ have cool applications of magic. /Friendship Is Magic/ is mostly goofy slice-of-life stuff, but can provide some actually-interesting long-form works on occasion; also, FIMFiction.net is way better than FanFiction.net, so it's easier to find good stories.
