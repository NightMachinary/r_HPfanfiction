It's hard. Just like in fiction there is a ton of crap to wade through.

Except FF doesn't get the polish a good editor provides.

Combine that with fandoms that aren't as large as HP and your quality is lacking.

The best Pokemon fic is almost drivel in HP.

There isn't enough diversity and growth to help the fandom grow.
