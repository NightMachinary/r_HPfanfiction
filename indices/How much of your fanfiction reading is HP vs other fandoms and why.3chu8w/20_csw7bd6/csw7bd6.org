I used to read HP fanfic almost exclusively. But over the last several years, I've been reading less and less of it, and these days I'd say I'm about 50% HP and 50% other stuff. Largely, it's because whenever I pick up a new HP fic, I feel like every idea in the story is something I've read somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, I'm not accusing the authors of plagiarism. I think it's just that so much HP fic exists, that for any idea you have, there is about an 80% chance that someone else has had that exact same idea, and unfortunately for me, about a 50% chance I've read that other fic.

As with a lot of people in this thread, apparently, I'm reading a lot of MLP:FiM (probably 50% HP, 40% MLP, and 10% other stuff). I'd say the main reason is because that community makes the good fics so easy to find. Discovering a new HP fic that's good can mean hours and hours of slogging through FFN, and after a long day, I'm just not interested. Finding a good MLP fic is just a matter of checking what's hot/trending, or setting your sorting appropriately on fimfiction. It goes to show just how important discovery is to building a community: I'd only call myself a casual fan of the MLP TV show, if even that, and I still vastly prefer Harry Potter. But the bronies are really, really good at showing off there works (fanfic/music) to best effect. Heck, try getting into Wizard Rock these days: there's no community for it, no reddits (as far as I know), no websites, podcasts, etc. All of the above actively exist for pony music.
