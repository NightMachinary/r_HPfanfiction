  Would you be kind enough to explain the MLP:FIM fandom?
#+end_quote

Oh, boy. To be blunt, I can't. Sorry! As someone who is completely blind, and was born that way, I'm afraid that my reasons for liking the MLP fanfic (and even the TV show a little for that matter) are completely different from the average MLP fan. I'm not sure I can even speak for them at all. I could speak for myself, but I don't think that would go any way towards actually answering your question. Plus, it would probably be objectively wrong; I've learned from experience that my opinions about TV shows, and especially cartoons, usually are. Maybe [[/u/gameboy17]] can chime in, here?

  Is there a specific reason it lights people up like us HP nerds?

I tried to answer this once, four or so months ago, and arrived at the wrong answer. If your curious, and enjoy walls of text that don't really go anywhere, that discussion is here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFanfic/comments/2yjjz4/even_my_precious_world_of_darkness_cant_be_spared/cpa8qqb]]

If you go down far enough, there are even fic recs! Somewhere. Eventually.

Edit: all lies. The thread is so deep they don't even show up on that page. Gotta start deeper in to see them: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatTheFanfic/comments/2yjjz4/even_my_precious_world_of_darkness_cant_be_spared/cpaznhx]]

  do you have an example that could "convert" me?
#+end_quote

Well, the fic that converted me, sort of, was /Friendship Is Optimal/: [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal]]

I say sort of because at the point I read that, I knew absolutely nothing about the characters or world of MLP. I just enjoyed the fanfic so much that I decided to read other MLP fanfics. In fact, it was months and months before I even agreed to try a single episode of the actual show, because the fanfics were so enjoyable I was absolutely sure it would only disappoint me. Fortunately, It didn't. But I'd still rather read a fanfic.

If you enjoy rationalist style fanfic, maybe that'll convert you, too. If not, it probably won't.
