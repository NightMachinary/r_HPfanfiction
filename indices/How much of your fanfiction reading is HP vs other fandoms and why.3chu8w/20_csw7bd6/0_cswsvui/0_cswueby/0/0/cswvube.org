Sure it can. A blind person talking about a TV show he can't see can be wrong in just so many fascinating ways. We're only perceiving about half the content, after all. I still enjoy TV shows, but I recognize that I am inherently wrong about them much of the time, because I can never base my opinions on all of the facts. And when I'm not wrong, because the matter of opinion is subjective, I'm not sure that my subjective opinions are of much use to you.

But the thing is, being wrong is OK, at least in matters of fandom. As long as you're enjoying yourself, you're doing it right. That's why it pushes my buttons so hard when people try and tell us what fics are good, and what aren't, and what fics we should all hate. And that happens far, far, far too often in this community, and in fact drove me into a rage-explosion as recently as this morning.

This is all kind of unrelated to your original question, though. I hope at least one of those links turns out interesting for you!
