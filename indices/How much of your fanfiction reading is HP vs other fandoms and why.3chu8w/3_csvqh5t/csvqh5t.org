I occasionally read stories set in Tamora Pierce's world, and one of my favorite HP fanfics is a crossover with Torchwood, but I mostly stick with HP. Why? Part of it's because I'm not into a lot of fandoms that generate a lot of fanfiction (Star Trek is an exception and I sometimes do read stuff there, but not often). I don't even know what Naruto is except that people love to write about it.

The other part is that Harry's story is the only book series that the child in me doesn't want to say "The End" to. The first book came out when I was 11 and while I never got my Hogwarts letter, I enjoyed returning to school with Harry every year or so until I started college. I don't want to cut off my connection with the child that I was, so I keep reading fresh, new stories of Hogwarts.

Finally, while there are some wonderfully written fanfics out there, there is also a never-ending supply of excellent, original, published novels that I want to devote the majority of my limited reading hours to.
