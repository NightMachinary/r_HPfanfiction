I read quite a bit of HP fanfiction, probably more than any other fandom these days. Largely this is due to the enormous variety of fics, but the reason I started in the first place was dissatisfaction with the canon events in the last three books.

When I find myself reading other fandoms, it is usually for a similar reason - Ranma 1/2, for example, lends itself to continuation fics. Some universes are just fun, though, so you want to see more of them. Crossovers, of course, are a mixed bag, but they can be enormously entertaining. Any sufficiently popular fandom is going to have a few interesting stories at least. HP has volume, age, and enormous crossover/fusion potential on its side.
