I'd love some good fanfics set in my favorite fantasy universes, but they simply aren't out there. For example, I'd love to read some Conan fanfics set in Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age, but fanfiction.net has 13 Conan fics, with only one over 10k words. By comparison, ff.net has over 700,000 HP fics. It does seem to be somewhat generational; fanfiction authors seem to be younger and my favorite fantasy books were at the height of their popularity long before Harry Potter got big.
