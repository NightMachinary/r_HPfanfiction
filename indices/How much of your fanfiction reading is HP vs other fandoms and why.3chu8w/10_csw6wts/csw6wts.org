I read a lot of everything, Harry Potter just happens to have the most content and the best recommendation sites. Currently, apparently like a few others, reading a bunch of Worm fanfiction. Other than that, I've read a lot of Sherlock, Marvel stuff, Naruto, etc. Sometimes I end up reading or watching source material -just- so I can read the massive stores of fanfiction a fandom has (Supernatural is an example)
