Ooh I can answer this one. Supernatural is what I consider my main fandom and the one that got me into fanfiction. There are some overdone tropes like there always are, but then there are also the standouts. (Honestly, everything after season 5 I just consider to be only ambiguously canon, so the fics I read are either AU or pre-s5.)

When I am feeling angsty, I love reading "amulet" fics where Dean realizes how awful he was to do what he did that one time. (Not spoiling anything, haha.)

Destiel has a ton of fics that I've never read because I have the unpopular opinion of hating Cas, but if you ship it, there's quite a bit to go through.

Then there are a bunch of case-fic stories that are set within canon and add depth to certain seasons without changing the plot. K Hannah Korossy is one if my favorites as is Disasteriffic Kaz.

Well, probably told you more than you cared about.
