I got into fandoms through Supernatural, so those will always be first in my heart. Unfortunately, I'm a bookworm and fanfiction has spoiled me. You can pick genres AND characters AND relationships AND plot without being overly picky. Plus I always have my phone on me. So when I say I've exhausted multiple fandoms, I'm not kidding. I went from Supernatural to Merlin to Sherlock to X-men to Harry Potter with some Avengers sprinkled in.

The issue I have with Harry Potter is that because it's been among my favorite books since I was a wee lass, I'm picky about what I want to read. It's a massive fandom, but there are some common pairings and tropes that I just can't read which narrows down my options by quite a bit.

With Merlin and Sherlock and etc, I am more lenient. Oh, another story where Arthur doesn't realize Merlin is magical? Great! Oh, John and Sherlock have immense sexual tension but never act on it? I can read those stories for months!
