Most of the fanfic I've read has been Harry Potter. There' such a variety of works, and since the fandom is huge, the fics keep getting churned out.

However, I do read other fandoms on occasion. Some of my favorite fanfics have been from "The West Wing." The writing tends to be more mature than Harry Potter, probably because members of the fandom are older.
