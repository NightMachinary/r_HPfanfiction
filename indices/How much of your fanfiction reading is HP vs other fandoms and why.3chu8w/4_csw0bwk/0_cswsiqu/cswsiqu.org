  So many characters. I think honestly though, its because JKR leaves so many things ambiguous and only touches on so many aspects of the world, so fanfic authors have a multitude of entrance points even before looking to create an AU with differences to canon.

You know, I think this is it for me, too. I feel like her "bad guys" are also fully developed or at least moreso than most worlds. You can turn almost any character in any way and make it canon-ish with a few adjustments and that is because the characters are so REAL. Just like us.
