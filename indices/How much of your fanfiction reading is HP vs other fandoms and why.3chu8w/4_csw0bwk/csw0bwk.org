/So many characters./

I think honestly though, its because JKR leaves so many things ambiguous and only touches on so many aspects of the world, so fanfic authors have a multitude of entrance points even before looking to create an AU with differences to canon.

There's also the fact that unlike many fandoms e.g. Naruto or MLP, Harry Potter was an absolutely global phenomenon that has reached a huge audience, so probably statistically is already likely to have more 'good' authors.

And it was the defining series of a generation (probably my generation). I can't think of anything that comes close to reaching its scope and influence at the minute (maybe game of thrones, but at the minute that's adults-only, so it loses some crossover appeal) so until that happens, HP will continue to hold its place as the top fanfic fandom. It has a dominance similar to Stat Trek now I would say, and that gets made exponential the more it branches off in different directions hitting different audiences (e.g. love it or loathe it, Methods of Rationality, which brought a lot of older readers into the fold).
