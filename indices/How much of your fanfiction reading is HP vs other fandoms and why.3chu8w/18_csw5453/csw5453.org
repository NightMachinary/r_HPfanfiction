Like a lot of people are saying, the most consumed FF would be HP, but I actually had a lot of fun reading the gigantic stories (400k+) set in Stargate SG1. There are only a select few purely Star Wars stories that I enjoyed, but they were awesome. And of course there are crossover stories. There are quite a few HP/SW and HP/SG1 crossovers out there that are very much up to snuff. I can give concrete examples later if you're interested..
