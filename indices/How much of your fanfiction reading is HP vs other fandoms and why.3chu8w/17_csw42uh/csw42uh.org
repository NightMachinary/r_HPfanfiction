Mass Effect used to be my major indulgence, but HP has taken its place mainly because there's more to indulge. Basically, I need the world itself to be something I pine for, so to speak, and so far ME and HP are the only two that have moved me to such a degree that I just can't let it go. Fanfiction then allows me to stay in those worlds indefinitely.
