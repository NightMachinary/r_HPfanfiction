For me it's not that I've run out of good things to read in the HPverse, it's that I've run out of new things to read. Time travel? Yawn. Snape dad? How original. Ron's a little bitch? Kill me now.

It's like reading that scene where they're turning matchsticks into needles. It's in every. Single. Fic. After a while you just skim that scene because you know exactly what's going to happen.
