I used to exclusively read HP fanfiction, but despite the enormous pile of HP fanfiction out there, I sort of feel like I've tapped out the good stuff. So I've moved on, mostly. At first it was Naruto, but I've lost interest in that too for the same reason.

Nowadays I'm basically binging on Worm and Mass Effect Fanfiction. I still read HP fanfiction, but it's hard to find fanfiction for this fandom which is both good (in a technical sense) and interesting.
