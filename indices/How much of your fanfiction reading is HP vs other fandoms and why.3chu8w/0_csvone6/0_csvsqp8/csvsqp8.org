I agree completely. I've been reading fanfiction for Worm (by Wildbow) for the last few days, but after the first few dozen fics, it's hella hard to find decent works because there's just a lack of material.

(plug) If you're interested in reading Worm, which is one of my favorite ebooks of all time, head to parahumans.wordpress.com . It's really good. (/plug)
