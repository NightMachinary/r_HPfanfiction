The withdrawal syndrome was so real, for a month or so after finishing Worm ~1.5 years ago, I just couldn't read anything else and it was horrifying and back then there wasn't much in the way of fanfics either. Got over it somehow, though chances are it might consume me again if I allow it. But I would rather finish Pact and catch up with Twig first.
