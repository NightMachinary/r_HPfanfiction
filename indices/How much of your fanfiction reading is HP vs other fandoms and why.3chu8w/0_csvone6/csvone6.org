Harry Potter is not my favorite fandom, but I have read the most HP fanfictions by far.

Why? Because the community is the largest. And when there are so many people contributing and reading, people take notice. This leads to people sticking around for longer, putting more effort into their work, which leads to longer and better stories generally. This in turn attracts even more people to the community. It's sort of a snowball effect.

I would love to read fanfictions for other fandoms, especially ones I enjoy more than Harry Potter. But sadly, the quality just isn't there. Most other fandoms I explore have a handful of good, lengthy fics at the very most, which is kind of depressing.
