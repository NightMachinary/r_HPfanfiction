I read a lot of Naruto ff, too. I started there before moving to HP after running out of good fics to read. Right now I tend to read much more HP. The reason for that, and for why they're the only two I read with any real frequency, is that most fanfiction is utter shit. The ratio of good to bad is simply horrendous and gets worse the smaller the fandom, so Naruto and HP are the only two with a real amount of quality stuff. Even then, I've read most of the good stuff already. Also, some series lend themselves better to fanfiction than others. Naruto does this fantastically, so there tends to be a bit more of it. HP, not so much, but it's ridiculously popular so there's still some to go around.
