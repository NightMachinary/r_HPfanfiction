I read everything good I find. Almost always, its HP, because it has so much more content. Naruto is a good second.

A Song of Ice and Fire has some good ones, but there's just so little. I've actually read a good League of Legend fic, an ever deader fandom. Doctor Who is almost entirely stupid fangirl fantasies. Pokemon appears to have almost no competent writers. Most anime and manga has very, very little, including big ones like Fairy Tail.

I think other than Naruto and HP, the only size-able fandom is Twilight, and I refuse to touch that with a ten, no, hundred foot pole.
