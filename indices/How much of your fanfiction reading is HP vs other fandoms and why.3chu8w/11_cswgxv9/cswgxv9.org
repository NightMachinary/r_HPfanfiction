At the moment I read exclusively Harry Potter fanfiction. This means it's very difficult to find anything new and good to read. I used to read Stargate and HP fanfiction, but now there's not a lot of good new Stargate fanfic and I've basically read everything I want to read already.

I write both HP and Stargate fanfic though in pretty much equal amounts - I have two series on the go, one in SG and one in HP, and both of them have ~70k words written.

I read loads and loads of other things, usually fantasy genre, but for fanfiction the only stuff I really want to read is Harry Potter. I think it's because Rowling created a really cool world, one that I wanted to live in as a child, but also left out a ton of details. I think the HP universe is an excellent framework, and even the plot itself is really good to explore, so fanfic is just so diverse and varied.

I can read something set basically in the canon universe, or I can read a radical AU, or I can read something a bit more in between. There's so much content, too. In smaller fandoms there may only be like, thirty or forty fanfics total, and more than half of those can rate 'terrible'.

I used to read fanfic for Disney's 'The Gargoyles', but that fandom is pretty much tapped out by now. The big name authors all retired, or moved on to other fanfics, and even the release of the comics failed to really kickstart any writing that I wanted to read. I was writing my own fanfics for that, but eventually I just gave up because the interest wasn't there and I'd moved on.
