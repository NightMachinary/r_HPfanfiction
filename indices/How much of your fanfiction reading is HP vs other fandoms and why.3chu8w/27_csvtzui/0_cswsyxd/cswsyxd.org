I can see what you're saying. I guess it depends on what you look for. For the first year, I was a strict SS/HG reader. A friend told me I should keep an open mind for HP/DM and sent some options. I am not afraid of slash or explicit content and am honestly more likely to read well written smut than a boring rated G story. (I'm open to good examples if you have any on that, though!) I learned to keep an open mind to almost any story and it's helped me find some really beautiful pieces that I otherwise NEVER would have found.
