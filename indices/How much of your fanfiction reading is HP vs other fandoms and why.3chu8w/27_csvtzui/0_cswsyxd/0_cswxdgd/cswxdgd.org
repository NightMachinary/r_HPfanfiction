It definitely depends on what one is looking for! It's always reminded me of the idea of fetishes, you know - how each person has a different fetish and it might be weird and incredibly particular. Same with fan fictions! I'm so picky. My favorite type of HP fan fiction is canon-compliant or close. So those "missing moments" of Dean at Shell Cottage, or Harry's Best Man speech at Ron and Hermione's wedding, or what I'd LOVE to read is decades later an excerpt from a biography on Harry's life or a collection of articles or something (so one-shots, I guess, long fics I have trouble getting into because I'm always worried they will eventually turn out bad). I've found stuff like this, but I generally have not been impressed with the writing. I used to like fics of young Harry at the Dursleys, but they always went unrealistically overboard with the violence.

I'm also just not into romance, which is 99% of fan fiction. Even if it's canon. I don't care about reading Harry and Ginny's marriage, and I definitely don't want to read them having sex.

But I've enjoyed the fics of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1704793/OwlPostAgain7][OwlPostAgain7]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] quite a bit, if you're looking for some examples!
