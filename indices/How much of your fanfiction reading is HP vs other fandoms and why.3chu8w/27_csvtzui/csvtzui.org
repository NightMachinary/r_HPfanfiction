Everyone here is saying Harry Potter fan fiction is best, but that has not been my experience. I've found good ones, because of course there is just so much of it - but I find that that's the problem - there is /so much/ of it, that it becomes difficult to find the good ones, and I tend to not like the ones people recommend. The only other fan fiction I've read is Daredevil/Marvel and it's more consistently better written than the Harry Potter fics I find.

However, I LOVE the idea of fan fiction and Harry Potter is still 99% my favorite - just so hard to find anything good in my opinion.
