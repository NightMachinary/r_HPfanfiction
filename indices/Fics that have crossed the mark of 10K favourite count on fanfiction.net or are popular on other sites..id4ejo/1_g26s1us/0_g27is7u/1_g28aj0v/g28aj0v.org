  I remember #3 [Poison Pen] being pretty good.

We have... very different definitions of the word good. The story /completely/ eviscerates Dumbledore's character and is... not badly written /per se/, but the writing is rather pedestrian.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (linkffn(11191235)), on the other hand, is very good.
