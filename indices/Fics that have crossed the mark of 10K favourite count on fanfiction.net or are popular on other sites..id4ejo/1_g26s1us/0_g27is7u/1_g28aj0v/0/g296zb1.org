While I agree that this fic is one of the best (or least worst?) of the list, I'm not sure I would go as far as calling it "very good". There is a big pacing problem (1M words, year 3), and from what I remember is also fall in the "kid master politicians" trope.

But it's still a readable fic, even an enjoyable one, something I can't say for most of the list.
