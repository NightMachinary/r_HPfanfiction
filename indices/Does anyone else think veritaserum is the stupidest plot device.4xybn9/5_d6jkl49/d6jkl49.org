Regardless of if it's stupid (I personally feel it's alright - could be a little pesky, but Dumbledore did mention in HBP that it's not foolproof or all-powerful, not to mention it's supposed to be a hassle to brew or even obtain), it's in the books, and it's an established (and rather significant) part of canon, and therefore you should already be planning against that if you're going to write a fanfic set in the universe. Personally it's rather annoying when an author says "I know what you're thinking, but I just don't like that part of canon, so I'm going to plain ignore it" without warning the reader beforehand and without giving sufficient reason other than "I don't like it". And if you're going to pretend it didn't exist, you better have a damn good reason why this thing doesn't exist in your AU, and not just because it's convenient this way and otherwise it'd debunk your whole plot. Erasing a part of canon just for the sake of plot is rather uninventive and lazy writing, not to mention completely unconvincing and jarring.
