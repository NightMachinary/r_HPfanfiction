Why? How is it significant? It doesn't erase my plot at all, it just removes tone and suspense. It's not like it's a major part of canon either - it affected canon plot precisely once, and even then it's debatable if it was even necessary. After that it was completely forgotten about, despite there being many times it would have been useful.

It's not like I'm removing people being able to use wands, or being able to apparate, or the concept of potions entirely. I'm just not bothering to go into tons of detail to explain why I'm not using a particular potion that was used in the series one time. I may as well also include a throwaway line as to why my character doesn't use a timeturner to get her paperwork done.

I can accept that I should maybe have written a throwaway reason for them not to use it, but I really don't see why it's a big deal. I don't see how it's lazy to omit something that would have been a giant, overpowered short cut for the characters.
