  what's the most powerful, potent potion, a good portion of them are gonna answer Veritaserum.
#+end_quote

Citation needed. Potions like polyjuice and felix felicis have a far more visible affect on the plot and are visibly used more than once.

#+begin_quote
  trying to work a solution for the suspense
#+end_quote

I'll give you that, but my issue is that that the use of it wouldn't actually "solve" anything, and the areas where there is a lot of suspense don't offer the opportunity for it anyway. It's like people are expecting my character to just randomly drug people for no particular reason.

#+begin_quote
  You don't have to go into tons of details - all it really requires is some explanation.
#+end_quote

I've said multiple times in this thread that in hindsight I should have used a throwaway couple of lines, and I've made it clear that based on feedback this is what I am now going to do. There was absolutely no need for you to call me lazy like that.

#+begin_quote
  Man, there are countless choices here - just give the readers something.
#+end_quote

I did, I told them I wasn't going to use it. My issue is that as a concept it's completely overpowered and feels very much like when people say stuff like "why doesn't Harry use a gun". The vast majority of my readers have continued to enjoy the story and haven't mentioned it - it's a small group of very persistent people who just can't let it go that I'm not going to use it. It's nitpickiness, and it's wanting an author to use overpowered and lazy plot devices at the expense of the story.

#+begin_quote
  As to timeturner - that's a different matter as obviously it's a more restricted substance/machine than Veritaserum, and you can't very well create one yourself with a handful of ingredients, some dedication, and a working potions lab.
#+end_quote

A certain new story disagrees, but I appreciate that's not really regarded as canon.

I'm not picking timeturner specifically - you could say the same for why doesn't Harry carry around a sneakoscope the whole time, or why doesn't he use a foeglass, or why doesn't he use Muggle technology or, as one reviewer mentioned, why hasn't he mastered legilimency within three years. There are plenty of times in the canon books when veritaserum or multiple other objects that have popped up along the way would have been useful, but JK Rowling didn't feel the need to run through each and every potential scenario and why it wouldn't work. It's ok to keep the pace of the story going by not mentioning things that aren't relevant. I haven't mentioned Veritaserum for the same reason Rowling didn't mention it when Harry and Co were at Malfoy Manor. The action is happening and it's jarring for characters to suddenly launch into issues of sourcing potion ingredients. Like, sure, you can imagine that as an alternative method, but that's not what the characters have done, and as long as what they are doing makes sense, that's fine.

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention in canon, that shit's supposed to be gone after the MoM debacle in fifth year
#+end_quote

She mentions them smashing, but had to clarify many times n interviews and on her website that they were ALL gone, they would not appear again, and she admitted that this was because they were overpowered. This is basically what I've done. I've clarified it's overpowered and that it's not going to appear.

#+begin_quote
  The reason why I personally see this kind of thing as lazy writing is because, like I said above, this thing is visible in the series, rather very visible in fact.
#+end_quote

I completely disagree. Veritaserum is barely used in canon, and it's not lazy to make life a little more difficult for your characters.

#+begin_quote
  I imagine it could be that your readers were too nitpicky, or too out there with what's really feasible in the story, but it could also be that they have a point.
#+end_quote

I've accepted that they have a point that I should have had a character mention they won't be using it. I do not think they have a point that it should be used. There is a middle ground.

#+begin_quote
  However, just saying "this shit is stupid and should never have been in the series to begin with, it's just a stupid plot device, I'm gonna ignore it" doesn't really cut it for me.
#+end_quote

People do this all the time. It's the basis for a huge number of fics. It's why people ignore the epilogue and Cursed Child. It's why people completely ignore Quidditch. It's why timeturners are constantly used even when they were meant to be destroyed in canon.

#+begin_quote
  That's fine, if you make it clear that the Aurors system is different from what's in canon, then I could be fine with that.
#+end_quote

That is made abundantly clear in the fic. From the start it's drummed into the reader that Harry is trying to clear up an inept and corrupt department.

#+begin_quote
  So if your character didn't use it in interrogation or investigation, then whatever, it's likely that it's illegal to do so.
#+end_quote

This is the case. People are annoyed that a) a character didn't use it on her boyfriend to make sure he's a good person (???) b) that Harry didn't use it on someone he invited round for dinner but who was acting shifty c) That Harry doesn't use it when questioning people in custody

#+begin_quote
  Just that, with what you wrote in the main body of the post, it sounded like you just would rather ignore it than give some reasoning to your ignoring it, which could be off-putting for the readers.
#+end_quote

I can accept that I'm feeling a little defensive and grumpy about it. It's unbelievably frustrating to build up a detailed and complex plot, to make it clear to people that veritaserum will not be used, and to wake up to reviews calling you an idiot and saying "yeah I saw your reasoning but still veritaserum". It doesn't feel like constructive criticism, it feels like "GOTCHA!" and it's particularly hurtful, after so many months of effort, for someone to call you lazy for making your characters actually work to solve a mystery.
