  Citation needed. Potions like polyjuice and felix felicis have a far more visible affect on the plot and are visibly used more than once.

I feel it'd be reasonable to say that this would be the case because it's something Snape said in canon. I don't remember the details, but I clearly remember him commenting on Veritaserum with some such claims. That leaves an impression. It did on me. (I think it was in book 2.)

#+begin_quote
  I've said multiple times in this thread that in hindsight I should have used a throwaway couple of lines, and I've made it clear that based on feedback this is what I am now going to do. There was absolutely no need for you to call me lazy like that.
#+end_quote

You misunderstand me. I was afraid you'd take "lazy writing" as the same thing as saying "(you are) lazy." It is not. It has no bearing on the quality of the writer, merely the writing. It's two different things. Lazy writing for me doesn't equate lazy writer. Even the most diligent of writers may feel the impulse to save breath and effort on some things, the only difference is where.

#+begin_quote
  I did, I told them I wasn't going to use it.
#+end_quote

See, personally as a reader I hate that stuff. Just saying in the AN "okay, I know how canon went, but that's not how it goes here. No reason, just cos I don't like it." That feels like deus ex machina. Just because you say so, it is so. That's liable to jar me out of the story. What I'm saying is, even if you feel it's stupid - and believe me, I have some issues with some aspects of canon, too - what's written is written, and what JK wrote is already a part of canon, and what people accept as rules in this verse. If you want them to accept a different set of rules, you should ideally do it in the story, not in an AN. That's telling. The fact that it's an AN doesn't excuse it, only makes it worse. What does it take to retcon cannon with a few lines in the story? Personally I've been convinced of far, far more outlandish things than the absence of Veritaserum when the writer makes the effort to convert me within the text. I suppose an AN might be sufficient for some readers, but others (like me I guess) will just feel like it isn't enough.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not picking timeturner specifically...
#+end_quote

You make some good points here. Yes, I can see your reasoning. Without having read your story, however, I can't really make a judgement as to whether or not it was illogical for Veritaserum to have not made an appearance in the story. For the sake of argument, however: there are good and easily imaginable reasons for why Muggle technology, Sneakoscope, and Foeglass aren't used regularly (goes against wizarding customs/wizards aren't knowledgeable about it/etc., unreliable and you won't know why it's squealing only that it does, and Foeglass as seen in Moody's office is rather cumbersome to carry around.) Malfoy Manor - they didn't have it on hand, maybe Snape's been putting off brewing it by begging Headmaster duty. Even though I personally think it's stupid, but it seems in canon that other than Slughorn, the only one in England with the capacity of brewing it was Snape, so supply would naturally be short, and even if Voldemort has it, it isn't likely to be in the hands of a bunch of disgraced Death Eaters, a werewolf, and some lowly snatchers.

#+begin_quote
  I completely disagree. Veritaserum is barely used in canon, and it's not lazy to make life a little more difficult for your characters.
#+end_quote

I guess this is part of why you and I disagree. It left a strong impression on me from my times of reading it, but I guess it didn't do the same for you. Also - making life more difficult for your characters isn't lazy, but it should also at least make sense within the universe. It needs to be convincing for me. If available magic in canon simply disappears, just to make stuff harder, then it isn't convincing for me. Do some explaining, then I'll buy.

I'm with you on that it would probably be wise to mention the illegal thing earlier in the story. (But again, without having read the story, I can't say if it was really necessary or otherwise. My original argument stemmed purely from your text post.)

And - changing part of canon's *happenings* as a premise for the story is different, I feel, from simply changing its *rules* without adequate reason (but even in the case of the former, the suspense of disbelief only goes so far for each person. It would depend on what the author is changing.). If you're doing it not for a premise ("What if Veritaserum was never invented, and Barty Crouch Jr. never spat out his secrets in book 4?"), but simply for the convenience of it (e.g. so that this way they'll have to go through various obstacles to achieve a certain something), then that could be frustrating. I've seen it happen before.

From your descriptions it sounds like your story would have been fine on the three instances where readers think Veritaserum should make an appearance, but my disagreement rests mainly on the AN that states "Veritaserum doesn't exist here." I feel it would have been better if you provided actual reasons that would work within the story, instead of "what I say goes." (I know, you're already planning on doing that, it's a moot point.)

#+begin_quote
  It doesn't feel like constructive criticism, it feels like "GOTCHA!" and it's particularly hurtful, after so many months of effort, for someone to call you lazy for making your characters actually work to solve a mystery.
#+end_quote

I get the feeling, truly I do.

#+begin_quote
  It's unbelievably frustrating to build up a detailed and complex plot, to make it clear to people that veritaserum will not be used
#+end_quote

Thing is, maybe it wasn't that clear to the readers that it won't (since you were aiming to make it appear as though it's not even there), and the reason for /why/ wasn't all that clear. I don't know. Some readers like myself prefer to have a reason and explanation for every change made to canon happenings and rules unless it's a complete AU, and the presence of Veritaserum in canon was a lot stronger in our minds. Some of your readers didn't share a headspace with you - most of them won't, in fact, and it's why I prefer to think an explanation beforehand is always preferable when it comes to erasing and rewriting canon rules.

I guess it would also be interesting to post a survey asking "Which potions made the strongest impression on you from the HP canon?"
