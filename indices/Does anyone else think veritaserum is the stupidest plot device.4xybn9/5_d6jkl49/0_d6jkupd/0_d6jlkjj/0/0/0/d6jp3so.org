  I feel it'd be reasonable to say that this would be the case because it's something Snape said in canon. I don't remember the details, but I clearly remember him commenting on Veritaserum with some such claims. That leaves an impression. It did on me. (I think it was in book 2.)
#+end_quote

Yeah, it really didn't on me. It perhaps would have if it had ever been used effectively.

  You misunderstand me. I was afraid you'd take "lazy writing" as the same thing as saying "(you are) lazy." It is not. It has no bearing on the quality of the writer, merely the writing. It's two different things. Lazy writing for me doesn't equate lazy writer. Even the most diligent of writers may feel the impulse to save breath and effort on some things, the only difference is where.
#+end_quote

Thank you for clarifying, because I'll admit I was pretty hurt at that. I still believe that the quality of my writing in this particular fic would plummet dramatically if I had the characters drugging people, but clearly that's subjective.

  Just saying in the AN "okay, I know how canon went, but that's not how it goes here. No reason, just cos I don't like it."
#+end_quote

I'm simplifying somewhat, but I did make it clear in the authors note that there was reasoning, I was just being honest in the biggest reason - that I hate it, and think the entire concept is deus ex machina.

  What does it take to retcon cannon with a few lines in the story?
#+end_quote

I don't know how many times I can say that I've accepted this is the case and I'm now doing it.

  Malfoy Manor - they didn't have it on hand, maybe Snape's been putting off brewing it by begging Headmaster duty.
#+end_quote

But this is sort of what I mean. I feel like readers could infer - they don't have any, it's not allowed, they don't have time to get permission/brew it, etc. I've accepted now that I'll just have to scatter a few lines in to make it clear, but can you see why I feel that readers are nitpicking?
