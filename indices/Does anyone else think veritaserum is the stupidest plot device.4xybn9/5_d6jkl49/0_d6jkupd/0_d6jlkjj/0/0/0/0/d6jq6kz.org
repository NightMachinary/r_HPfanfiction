...It was rhetorical, man. Don't mind it. I'm not even a native English speaker so some of what I say could come across as rather rude and I wouldn't even know. I was more speaking to the bunch of fics I read where the author comes in with an AN halfway saying "okay, character A can't do magic without a wand in canon, that's stupid, I say he can!" or something like that anyway. Good luck with your story.
