Why it's significant: it's a rather visible potion in the series, one of the most well-known, up there with Polyjuice. If you ask readers of the HP verse what's the most powerful, potent potion, a good portion of them are gonna answer Veritaserum. In-universe speaking, it's important, and even more so in war times. It's repeatedly mentioned - Snape threatened Harry with it as early as in second year, and it's only made more repeated appearances since then. People remember that stuff, and they're gonna think of it when they're trying to work a solution for the suspense, which is what readers are supposed to do and a rather important part of the reading process, and something writers are supposed to take into consideration.

You don't have to go into tons of details - all it really requires is /some/ explanation. You could say they don't have the money for the ingredients or to buy it. You could say the crop for a particular ingredient that's required is short this year, and it's been ruined by excessive rain or galloping gargoyles or something - just have a character mention it, takes two lines, tops. You could say they tried brewing some before, but it was sabotaged, and someone died in the resulting explosion and they're not trying that shit again anytime soon. You could say most of the competent potions brewers are dead, and the remaining ones are either arseholes or unwilling to help or both. Man, there are countless choices here - just give the readers /something./

As to timeturner - that's a different matter as obviously it's a more restricted substance/machine than Veritaserum, and you can't very well create one yourself with a handful of ingredients, some dedication, and a working potions lab. Plus it's well-established wizarding knowledge that you don't mess with time just-cause. Not to mention in canon, that shit's supposed to be gone after the MoM debacle in fifth year (don't know when your story's set in, but say it's post-books, then this works. No explanation needed. If any of your readers ask "why don't they use a timeturner?" then they're either idiots or not very careful readers of canon, and that's not your fault. Not providing reasoning for the sudden disappearance of an established aspect of canon, however, will be. It's not even like it takes a lot to do it.)

The reason why I personally see this kind of thing as lazy writing is because, like I said above, this thing is visible in the series, rather very visible in fact. I don't know the context of your story, but I imagine it could be that your readers were too nitpicky, or too out there with what's really feasible in the story, but it could also be that they have a point. However, just saying "this shit is stupid and should never have been in the series to begin with, it's just a stupid plot device, I'm gonna ignore it" doesn't really cut it for me. If I knew the context of your story, I could come up with a reason myself if I were reading - say, maybe the Aurors excluded the potion from the procedures at some point prior to the story's beginning. That's fine, if you make it clear that the Aurors system is different from what's in canon, then I could be fine with that. If the Aurors system looks much the same as it did in the books, however, I'm going to question why you chose to ignore some things while keeping the others.

If it's a bunch of unauthorized personnel trying to dig around themselves, then it's only natural they don't have access to it. Death Eaters? Maybe Snape was bullshitting to get out of brewing it, fine, but it should at least be brought up.

Canonically, it's allowed to be used in court cases. So if your character didn't use it in interrogation or investigation, then whatever, it's likely that it's illegal to do so. But if there's a court case, or if the Aurors are supposed to be rather immoral and doesn't give a shit except for finding out the truth, then it should be within their options to employ said potion. It all depends, and without the context of your story I can't say more. Just that, with what you wrote in the main body of the post, it sounded like you just would rather ignore it than give some reasoning to your ignoring it, which could be off-putting for the readers. Assuming it's not your readers that are being unreasonable, of course, like if someone suggested "just steal a time-turner and correct everything!!!jk".

Edit: and also, if you're only posting here to rally support for your view rather than gathering opinions, then you should ignore this, because obviously we aren't going to agree on this thing. Not saying you are. Just. You know, in case, cause I get rather tired of arguments if the other is already convinced of the thing.
