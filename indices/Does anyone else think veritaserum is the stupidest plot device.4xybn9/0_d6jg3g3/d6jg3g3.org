I think it's a weak (lazy even) plot device. It's a bit of a deus ex machina; maybe to save time, maybe so that the good guys don't have to resort to torture. But it's there and it's firmly canon. If you don't use it when it seems the obvious thing to do, then you probably need to present a reason not to use it.
