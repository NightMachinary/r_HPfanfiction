I re-read your story several times (it's great). It won't be lost on readers like me, though you may get some more back talk about the changes! Can't win them all.

I'd say leave it out to be honest, because it is jarring to insert that I think. Because you'd have to go back and edit more than just the chapter with Dennis because ... Why not use veritaserum on Fischer? Or anyone who's been captured really? And you'd have to explain why it's not used (too OP, violation of human rights / privacy/ Kingsley is very liberal, idk)
