I was just going to write passive aggressive bit with Dawlish when Harry shouts at him about the Dementors haha Something like:

Dawlish: ...and we want to be able to use veritaserum again.

Harry: You fucking lunatic, I don't know how many times I have to tell you it's completely unreliable and unethical and it's been banned for a reason. Stop bringing it up.

...........But that might annoy the people that have been badgering me about it, huh? :P
