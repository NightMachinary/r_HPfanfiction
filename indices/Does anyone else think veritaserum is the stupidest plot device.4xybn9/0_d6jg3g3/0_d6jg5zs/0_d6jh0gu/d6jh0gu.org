I'm someone who has no qualms about going back and editing changes into earlier chapters whenever the mood takes me. So I would just write it into an earlier chapter myself. It's not set in stone like a published book. It might be wasted on people who have already read it and won't reread, but at least it's there for new readers. If you plan to leave the story up indefinitely it makes sense to take a long view.
