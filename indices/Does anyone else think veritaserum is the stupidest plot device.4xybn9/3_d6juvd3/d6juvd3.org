There are several overpowered plot devices in Harry Potter.

Veritaserum, Polyjuice, House-Elves with their apparently very powerful magic, Moody's eye, and the Goblet of Fire's power to force people into a magical contract.

And so very underused in the books considering how powerful they are.

Drown all marked Death Eaters in Veritaserum, impersonate the bad guys to disgrace them, use House-Elves for more than cooking and cleaning, let Moody check trunks and post for dark items, throw Tom Riddle's (and Voldemort's, to be on the safe side) names in the Goblet of Fire and wait for him to turn up or lose his magic.

Polyjuice would probably be dead easy to get hold of, considering how immensely popular it would be for sexual purposes, both legal and illegal. Polyjuice would be cheaper than Harry's loose hairs...
