I think I'll go back and edit something in, and perhaps briefly mention it in an upcoming chapter.

The thing is, it's a pretty detailed mystery/suspense, not an examination on the inner workings of government and wizarding law. I guess I just really hoped that putting in an authors note (something I usually hate doing) would mean that I didn't have to disrupt the build up of suspense with an awkward excuse. Ah well. I'll edit something in anyway.
