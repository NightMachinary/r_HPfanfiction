I like it in stories, but you can always go for some of the reasons its not used always. Like, maybe they have to consent to it, if you want where the government is pureblood oriented you could have so purebloods can't have it used against them(maybe it was a law set up by death eaters), then there is also if it's talking about children that it may lead to growth deficiencies. Then there is resisting, you could say that there is an antidote and some people carry it around in their mouths(they have magic so why not?), or Occlumency or a similar mind art can block it.
