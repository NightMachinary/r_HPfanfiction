It's not like there isn't magic in the rest of the fic, though, some of it new and very useful to the plot. And like I said, no events would actually be solved, they would just be hurried along.

I've been completely honest that I'm sweeping this element of canon under the rug. I don't like it. I don't have to use it. I can reluctantly accept that I should have given more background to it, but there's no reason I should have to use it in my fic.
