I get where you are coming from, but, I mean, MAGIC. Magic breaks all boundaries. Trying to apply story conventions, when literally Magic escapes it, seems like a fruitless endeavor. In my mind, the only limits are due to people not willing to put the effort into studying.

AND you are trying to sweep under the rug canon. I don't mean any offense, but if I was reading your story (whatever it is), I would be very agitated that events which could be solved via veritaserum, weren't.

I feel like you aren't embracing the idea of Magic at all. Its so broken, by design! That's Magic!
