Except in all of those examples, doing them without magic is just as boring storytelling. But with truth finding, well, that can be interesting and compelling. Like, we've got all these shows on TV like NCIS or Castle that are about solving crimes, so that doesn't really compare to having to walk through a castle for 10 minutes whistling instead of flying to the roof.
