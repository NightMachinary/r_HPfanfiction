As I've pointed out in a post above, Veritaserum is not a magical solution that allows you to solve crimes easily. You have to have a suspect before you can use the potion on them. That means investigating. And between Polyjuice, Fake Memory Charm, and Obliviation, Veritaserum won't help that much with investigating.
