I could kiss you right now. Thank you so much for your lovely response.

I still keep changing my mind as to whether or not to add a little scene in a previous chapter saying something along these lines. I think I've found a spot where it could work, but I've still got some stubbornness about it and I'm still worried it would disrupt the flow.
