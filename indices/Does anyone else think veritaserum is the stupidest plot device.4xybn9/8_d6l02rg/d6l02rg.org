Bit late, but I'll add some thoughts anyway. I definitely agree with you in that it's completely ridiculous, and should never have been introduced to the story at all. I'm sorry that you've been getting hassle about it, even after mentioning it in at least one AN. It's not something that'd ever bother me, as I'm completely fine with authors picking which parts of canon they want to include in their story.

With regards to veritaserum and canon (it's been years since I read the books and this might be contrary to something stated by JKR), I'd imagine that it's something one builds up a resistance to very quickly. As in, one or two uses on somebody at most. It's also expensive to brew, requires specific, rare ingredients (which require a legal permit for each transaction) and a complex recipe, so most people capable of brewing it are unlikely to do so without the Ministry noticing.

I'd also imagine it is like sodium thiopental IRL, in that its effectiveness is over-estimated by the general public, and that it's a fine line between using enough of it to get the truth from someone, and poisoning them. Umbridge is an idiot who buys into the whole automatically-spill-all-secrets thing, whereas Snape plays on public perception of it to intimidate Harry.

Finally, I, for one, love 'The Aurors' and really hope to see a sequel!
