Lie Detector tests aren't admissible in court because they don't detect lies. They only detect how nervous a person is. If the interrogation room is too hot, and the suspect is sweating, the lie detector might assume all his answers are lies.

For Veritaserum, I'd just make it so it is very easy to trick. The questions have to be very specific, and it is easy to tell half truths. For example, if Harry had been behind the attacks in the Chamber of Secrets and they'd interrogated him with "Are you behind the attacks?" he could say no because it was the Basilisk, and he is only controlling it. If they asked does he know who is behind them, he could say he doesn't, because while he knows it is the Basilisk behind the attacks, he doesn't personally know the Basilisk's personality, how he was created and stuff like that.
