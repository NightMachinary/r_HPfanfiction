We also never see it used in any kind of legal, sanctioned way. Dumbledore doses Crouch Jr on his own authority, Umbridge tries to dose Harry (unknown to her that it was fake) and Rita doses Bagshot to get the dirt on Dumbledore. I suppose you could argue that Umbridge was allowed by the Ministry to use it, but since she did a lot of things on her own in book five, it could just be seen as her justifying her attempted use of it. Too many problems in the HP universe would be solved so easily if they just used Veritaserum...but there are always ways for people to squeak past justice. Claiming Imperius is hard to disprove, especially since under the Imperius Curse, they would believe it was their idea to do it all, so they'd confess. Then, toss a bit of money at some higher up, and you get it wiped from your record.
