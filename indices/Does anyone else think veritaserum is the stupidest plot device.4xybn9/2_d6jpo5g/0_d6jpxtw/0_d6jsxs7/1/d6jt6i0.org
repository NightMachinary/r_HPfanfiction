Yep. No idea why people want me to use it so much. The plot is already complex enough.

I'm very aware, rereading this thread, what an arsehole I look like. I honestly do appreciate everyone is giving me valuable advice and I can accept I need to make a few changes. All I can say in my defense is that it's crushing to write a complex story with suspenseful interrogations, conflicts that are fuelled by whether people are telling the truth or not, moments of action with clear and horrifying deadlines....... and to wake up to a review saying that they're not sure if the author is an idiot or the characters are for forgetting about a potion we see used once in canon.
