I hate fics that throw out Veritaserum as the solution to everything, so I'm perfectly happy for you to ignore it in yours.

Honestly, I fail to see a problem here. Canonically, Veritaserum is "controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines", so it would make sense that any request to use Veritaserum would need permission from the wizengamot, or would need permission from multiple sources which would bury it in bureaucratic red tape.

Given false memory charms, occlumency, wandless magic etc, it isn't hard to see why Veritaserum isn't admissible evidence in courts either. A good analogy from the real world would be lie detectors. Just because they exist doesn't mean that interrogations and law courts are irrelevant.
