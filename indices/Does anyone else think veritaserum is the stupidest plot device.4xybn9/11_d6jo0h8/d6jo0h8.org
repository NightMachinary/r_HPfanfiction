No. The Wizards have so many means to commit crimes stealthily, the cops and aurors should have their own countermeasures.

In addition, Veritaserum could be beaten by Occlumency or training, so it's not fool proof.

If you pluck out canon elements just to make lives difficult for your protagonists, what's that different from manufacturing angst or creating unneeded drama?

Just make the guy trained in resisting Veritaserum, and since they didn't have time to weaken his mental defenses, Harry had to do it the hard way.
