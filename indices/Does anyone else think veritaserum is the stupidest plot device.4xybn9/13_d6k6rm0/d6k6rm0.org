I don't think it's stupid as a plot device. It's a major part of the world, and it has to be treated as such. It's not a small thing, so it's not appropriate for all stories.

It's nothing compared to the fact that you can use the Imperius curse on another person, maintain it for years, and have them cast it on someone else.
