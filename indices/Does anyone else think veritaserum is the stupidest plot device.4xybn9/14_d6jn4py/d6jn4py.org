I think it's hard to make, expensive, and very time consuming to make. However, I think the Ministry would have quite a large stock of it made by their own Potions Masters or people they contract. Remember, the Ministry doesn't spend its entire existence waging wars and using potions stocks in large quantities daily. So I believe that the Ministry's stockpile of Veritaserum under a stasis charm would be very sizable and I believe they would have enough to, at minimum, dose hundreds of people.

We have differing opinions on it. In OOTP, Snape says it would make even Voldemort spill all of his deepest, darkest, and most cordoned off secrets. In HBP, Dumbledore says it isn't all powerful. I prefer Snape's point of view, if Veritaserum can be defeated, then what is the point of using a difficult to brew and expensive potion in getting the truth out of criminals who've gone through quite a bit of trouble in avoiding the law? If it can be resisted by even the most talented Occlumens, then in my mind, its effectiveness should be put into question. After all, if it's not all powerful or too expensive to make, then surely some people might put some effort at remedying it? It is a truth potion. Yes, it is said that it is the strongest one out there, but it would be questionable to me if it wasn't truly effective.

I think an "all powerful" Veritaserum is fine, if it isn't used on everybody. A slightly flawed Veritaserum, while it bugs me, seems to be more reasonable in the context of the stories I read.
