  So I believe that the Ministry's stockpile of Veritaserum under a stasis charm would be very sizable and I believe they would have enough to, at minimum, dose hundreds of people.

On the other hand, imagine the damage a minister could do if they dosed the 100 most powerful and influential people and got all their secrets. I doubt pure blood wizards would risk that. (hell, maybe that happened in the past, resulting in a limit?). There is also the possibility that Veratiserum use is considered immoral, since you force a suspect to confess. In the muggle world, forced confessions aren't admissible in court.

Considering this, you could say the ministry has only 3 vials of Veratiserum in stock. Enough to use in life or death situations [[/s][The Aurors Spoiler]] but not nearly enough for normal day to day use.

Then its just a matter of destroying this small stockpile (sabotage, ingredient scarcity, ministry incompetence?).

In the case of The Aurors: [[/s][Spoilers]]

I can understand not wanting to use Veratiserum especially since The Aurors is a great story but it is, unfortunately, a part of the world of Harry Potter. Ignoring it doesn't remove it from the memory of reader. It made the ministry, Harry included, seems a bit incompetent by "forgetting" and that the outcome could have been better if someone just remembered it existed.
