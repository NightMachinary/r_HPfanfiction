Considering he'd already started confessing the whole thing to Harry beforehand just to gloat, and that he wasn't fully sane by this point, I wouldn't put it all on veritaserum even if it's just about him talking a lot. The fact that it's possible for some people to resist veritaserum means that its effect can be affected by the mental state of the affectee, so if you need it to work less potently on someone in your story then you could do it and just use Junior's state as a justification for his talkativeness and there wouldn't really be anything to contradict it because it hasn't been used enough times in the main story for any kind of baseline to exist.

But yeah, I get your point. I just think that there could or could not be extenuating circumstances with Junior's reaction.
