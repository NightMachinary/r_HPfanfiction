Not at all. Here's a small quote from the book:

/“Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.”/

There's no cheerfulness there, and though he talks quite a bit, all of it is related and all of it counts as answers to the questions he'd been asked---meaning there is not a single thing he says that is not an answer to something he'd been asked and said of his own initiative---and furthermore one could argue that the time he spent under the Imperius curse could have caused the effect of veritaserum to be a bit more pronounced on him in that regard (or, alternatively, he might have actually wanted to tell for whatever reason; he was not exactly sane, after all).

I do not know where you took the “cheerfully confess everything” bit from, but I assume the movies, and in any case the answer is “no”. The one important bit is that you are dealing with an automaton of sorts as far as the person under veritaserum's answers go, and how much information they give when asked is up to you as the author; but they have to be asked to say things, which is the point that so many fanfic authors are missing, alongside the fact that it's a controlled potion and that it takes at least a month to brew and is not the easiest one at that.
