I don't think it's all that stupid, to be honest. Badly played, sure, but it does not have to be badly played.

I mean, thinking about it, it is nothing more than a potion that forces the one to whom it is given to answer the questions asked them with what they think is truth. Nothing more and nothing less. And what this means is that without properly formulating questions it is possible to get answers that are true and yet completely useless, and it also means that it is not wholly reliable because confounding or obliviating oneself before taking it can be used to change what the person thinks the true answer to be; the same about occlumency, in that one does not know if the answer really is genuine or if it's some rubbish the person basically self-hypnotised themselves into believing to be true. The glazed look could also suggest that the person's actual consciousness is, at the time right after taking it, so foggy that the person isn't really capable of acting on their own other than simply answering the questions and nothing more than that.

For example, I like to imagine that if someone actually asked Sirius, right after his capture, if he “killed the potters”, the answer they'd get would be “yes” as Sirius's immense guilt and not exactly stable state of mind would have led him to believe that his decision to make Peter the secret keeper killed him and as his decision it makes him directly responsible; after that, nobody would bother with asking how it is his fault or why he thinks so. Remember, the potion stops you from lying, not from saying what you think is true due to your own bad emotional state and the associated delusions if it just happens to not be the objective truth.

So really, all those scenes in fanfiction where it forces the characters to tell the truth and makes them incredibly eager to confess everything but does nothing to their mind, or where it acts like some sort of weird truth detector for confessions are, in my opinion, crap written by people who either don't know or don't care how veritaserum works. It could be used in stories well, as it is a plot device with clear purpose and fairly clear strengths and weaknesses, but when people ignore those because it's more convenient for them of course it will feel shoddy.

Also, I like to think that it is a fairly difficult potion to brew. I mean, they hadn't learned it in the first six years, whereas even something like amortentia (which is a heck of a potion) is covered in sixth year, so it is at the very least a NEWT-level thing and quite possibly something going even beyond that.
