Just saying, though, canon magical law enforcement is incompetent enough that I wouldn't be surprised if they have no idea how interrogation should work. They don't seem as advanced as Muggles at the criminal sciences - mostly because they've got magic, but they just aren't as tightly trained because of it.

See: Sirius Black's case. There wasn't even a trial. I won't be surprised if during the first war, all Crouch did if he ever used Veritaserum was ask "Did you or did you not have a part in the torture/murder of who and who?" and then if it's a yes, then to the Dementors with you.

Of course it all depends - if your Auror's supposed to be a smart one, then sure, don't stop there.
