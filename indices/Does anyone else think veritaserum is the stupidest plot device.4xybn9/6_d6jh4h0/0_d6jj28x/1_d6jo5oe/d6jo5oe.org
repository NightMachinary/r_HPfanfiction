On the other other hand, it's canon that veritaserum is not admissible court evidence in the wizarding world, due to the fact that it may be beaten and thus is not reliable, so I'd do the same if I were to ever write anyone investigating anything. That said, my point with the question to Sirius was that it's possible to get answers with veritaserum that are incriminating and yet could not be further from the truth as far as the actual crime and stuff go; someone like Barty Crouch, if he'd actually bothered at the time, would have taken it as sufficient because of the (fabricated) evidence of guilt already found ... which is exactly what happened in canon but they took Sirius's ramblings as truth and didn't even bring out veritaserum.
