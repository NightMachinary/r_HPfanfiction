On the other hand, all those stories where Veritaserum will not reveal the whole truth as the dosed people know it are crap written by people who have no idea how interrogations work.

You don't ask "Did you kill the Potters?" and then stop after hearing "yes"; you ask for details. You ask for motivations. You get the whole story.

When I use Auror investigations, I generally have them focus on finding the suspect. Sifting through memories in a pensieve (and checking for signs of memory modifications by checking other memories). Getting witnesses. Finding clues. Veritaserum generally doesn't play much of a role, mostly to confirm suspicions - finding and arresting the people you want to use it on is the challenge.
