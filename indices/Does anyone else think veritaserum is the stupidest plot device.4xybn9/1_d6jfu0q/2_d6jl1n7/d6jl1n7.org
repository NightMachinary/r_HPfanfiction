I'm pretty sure that Veritaserum is a controlled substance in canon. Snape says "Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines". So, Snape is a teacher and can likely brew things to teach about them, but it doesn't seem like something a random brewer in Diagon Alley is going to be allowed to make from random Joe#3. I think Dumbledore says something like "The truth is a very powerful, yet very dangerous thing".
