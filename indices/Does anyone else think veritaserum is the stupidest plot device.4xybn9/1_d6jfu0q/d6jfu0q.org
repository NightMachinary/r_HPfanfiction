I like to believe that it's hard to make and is very, very expensive. Severus Snape can make it as he's talented and able to make his own, but not without expense. I dislike that people can beat Veritaserum. In canon, Severus states that one (or three) drops would make even Voldemort spill his deepest secrets.

So, yeah. If I want to avoid a 'just use Veritaserum' scene, I just have a character state that no one can brew it and that unless x person wants to cover the cost, then it's not being done.

Edit: I do agree that it is 'overpowered', but it's like the Killing Curse. It depends on your characters. If you have a character that would toss the potion down someone's throat, then go for it. You could even make said character attempt to brew it and ruin it, almost killing the other person. Then, it could be banned and decided as an 'illegal potion'. Actually, that's not a bad idea, making the potion illegal.
