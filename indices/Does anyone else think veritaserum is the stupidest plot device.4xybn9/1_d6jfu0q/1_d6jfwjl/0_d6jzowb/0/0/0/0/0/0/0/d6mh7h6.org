Human rights generally aren't judged as being absolute and inviolable. Instead they are formed as a compromise between the rights of the accused and the needs of society. That's why, for example, the police can detain you before you are found guilty by a court.

Also note thst you cannot administer truth drugs to yourself to increase the credibility of ypur testimony, or administer truth drugs to wintesses with a waiver of immunity. That's all that would be needed to satisfy the 5th amendment.
