I edited my post, just adding rambling. :x

Is this for your Aurors fanfic? I haven't read it yet, but it is on my 'to read' list. I'm not sure of your characters, but you could have one of them state that they think it's morally wrong to use it. A few lines discussing it as they walked towards the interrogation rooms would be a good idea, as well.

I personally try and avoid Veritaserum as it's, as you said, overpowered and it can jar certain scenes. Nothing worse than having what could be an intense interrogation ruined by a potion being poured down a throat.
