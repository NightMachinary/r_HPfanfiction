Ah! Unfortunate.

I actually think that could work. I'm not sure how you could work it in, but there's plenty of ways that you could make the substance banned. If Harry's fifth-year happened, then you could use that as a reason. It's not really used in canon after that and we have no idea if it was used in the trials after the final battle.

I'd personally blame Umbridge... that's always a good thing to do!

Edit: It could also be a limited substance and no more can be produced, hence why it's used scarcely.
