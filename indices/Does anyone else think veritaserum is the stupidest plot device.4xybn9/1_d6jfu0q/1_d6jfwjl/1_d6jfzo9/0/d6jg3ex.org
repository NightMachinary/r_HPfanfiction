All the interrogation scenes are over and done now, though :/ I mean, I would do that in the future because it's a good idea, but I'm now on my very last chapter and I'm still getting reviews with an "AHA GOTCHA!" tone pointing out veritaserum would have solved the whole plot chapters ago. Which is like, yeah, it would have, hence why I'm not using it.

The last chapter will include a trial, I thought about throwing in "since the ban of veritaserum blah blah blah" line in there. Do you think that would work?
