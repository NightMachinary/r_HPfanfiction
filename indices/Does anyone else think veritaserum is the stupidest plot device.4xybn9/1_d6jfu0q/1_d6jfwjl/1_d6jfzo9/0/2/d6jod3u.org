No. After the second war and the whole fiasco with Imperiuse defenses, the Ministry and Wizengamot should be very inclined to dose every suspect with Veritaserum.

However, it's not fool proof and can be beaten by people with Occulmency skills, strong mental discipline, or training. So accompanying evidence and witnesses are still necessary.

In your current story, I would still have Harry and Co dosing him with Veritaserum, but with little success as the guy was resistant for whatever reason. Of course they could still weaken his defenses through things such as sleep deprivation, but they didn't have the time.
