  No. After the second war and the whole fiasco with Imperiuse defenses, the Ministry and Wizengamot should be very inclined to dose every suspect with Veritaserum.

Why? As you yourself have established, it can be beaten. Not to mention it would probably be highly unethical, and I've made it clear that Harry is trying to remove dodgy behaviour and shady dealings from his department. Drugging every suspect completely removes bodily autonomy, a human right we give even our worst criminals. You can argue that the wizarding world is different, but I would argue that I've made it clear in my fic that Harry keeps to the straight and narrow.

  little success as the guy was resistant for whatever reason.

I feel like any reason I could come up with would be incredibly tenuous/contrived and weak given that he is not an experienced wizard. It's far easier for me to go back now and provide reason for the potion not to be used.

  they didn't have the time.

No, they didn't, and this is what I don't understand about the criticism. I can see the reasoning and logic during the final interrogation, but canon suggests that it's so highly controlled that they wouldn't have received permission to use it immediately, especially not in the middle of the night. But the other times people have suggested I use it were ridiculous - you'd think they expect Harry and Theia to be carrying it around with them, drugging people on a whim.
