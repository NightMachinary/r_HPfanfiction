Actually, use explanation is far better than AN, which is really the ultimate Deux Ex Machina. For those serious criminals, they should know what to face if captured and would make preparations.

Again, it was mentioned in canon that Veritaserum was not all mighty. Yes, it was very useful and should be used, but it also failed in many cases. The aurors should have simple test and trick questions to determine whether the potion worked or not. In your case, they simply found out that guy lied right through his teeth.

On the contrary, I think Harry was very much in support in using the Veritaserum because it greatly enhanced the odds of separating the guilty from the innocent. Veritaserum could be just used as a mean of self defense as opposed to an interrogation tool. Wrongful convictions would be cut down dramatically, and that was something Muggles dreamt of having.
