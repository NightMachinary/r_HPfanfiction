Not using it because it can be beaten just means that wizards are really bad at logic, which causes issues elsewhere in a story.

Say you give it to them and they say they're innocent; you're back at square one, no idea if they're lying or not. You're in the same place you'd be without using veritaserum. But if you give it to them and they say they're guilty, you have new and trustworthy information.

In a sane society veritaserum would be used only to establish guilt, not as a proof of innocence.
