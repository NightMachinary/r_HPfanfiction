Well yeah, think about it; the Ministry is a very controlling government, especially in the wake of the first war with Voldemort. The Ministry keeps records of everyone's birth and has a magical Trace on them until the age of seventeen. They control the press to a frightening degree. Travel outside of the country, unless you used muggle means, would involve a Ministry restricted Portkey, Apparition License (limited by personal power to travel extreme distances) or the Floo Network, which is monitored. Then you have the Auror Corps, who have authorization to step outside Ministry regulations in order to fulfill Ministry directives about who is or isn't a Dark user. You have Legilimency, which can pluck the thoughts from your mind and display them to the court, as well as an entire corps of Obliviators who are trained in making people forget anything and everything, as well as crafting false narratives that wouldn't be able to be cracked without special training in memory charms.

Now, on top of all that, you have people who have high amounts of Hubris and Self-Righteous behavior as well as the stuffiness and pettiness that regularly infuse Muggle bureaucrats. This would make /anything/ that could compel the unadulterated truth to come out to be restricted as highly as it could, since it could lead to the entire government collapsing because of whatever leaked.

*The Ministry might seem like a bungling group of cowards, but a Ministry which turned all it's guns on you would be a very scary thing indeed.*
