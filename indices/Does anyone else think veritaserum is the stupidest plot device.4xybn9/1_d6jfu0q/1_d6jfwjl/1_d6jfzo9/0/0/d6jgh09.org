I respect that you're not taking the easy out with your plot on that one.

The main reason I think that Veritiserum wouldn't be used heavily is the effects it has on the body. Much like Sodium Pentothal in the muggle world, it's probably hard on the heart and liver, and using it too often would result in burning your target out or possibly killing them.

The truth /does/ hurt after all.
