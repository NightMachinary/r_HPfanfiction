In a crime mystery suspense story, I agree it probably doesn't make sense as its a bit OP. I would just put an authors note in the beginning saying that it doesn't exist in your universe. No reason you have to have everything be exactly the same as canon. I don't see a problem with using it in other stories though where solving crimes and thus interviewing suspects isn't central to the plot.

It could also be an interesting plot device if you(not you specifically for your story, but someone in general) modify it so while it requires the person to literally say the truth, they can say something that will be interpreted one way, but means something different and lie by omission. So the user would need to pay very careful attention to their wording of the questions they ask and the person being interrogated's wording of their answer. Like with the Aes Sedai in WoT.
