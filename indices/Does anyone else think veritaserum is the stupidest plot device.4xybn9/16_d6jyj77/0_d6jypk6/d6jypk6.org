This is post-DH so Snape isn't in the picture, and (completely honest here) while what you've described sounds very exciting and the basis of a good sub-plot, it's way too complex for me to insert into my fic as it is and doesn't quite mesh with the bad guys. In all honesty I'm just going to edit something in so people will stop asking me about it.

I would love to see something like this in a fic though, and may borrow it in the future. This experience has taught me I will never get away with just ignoring shit I hate :P
