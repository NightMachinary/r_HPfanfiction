Haven't delved through all 90-something comments yet but have you considered the idea of a counter-agent? The 'bad guys' get the sense that Veritaserum is going to make their clandestine actions much more difficult, so they order Snape to come up with a cure. Since the counter-potion is equally rare and expensive to make, and still won't counter the potion until the two get to mix, he takes another tack- finding something that will neutralize it before the truth-telling effect would take hold. The best he could find was an inoculation of [obscure but common creature gland]; if the inoculate is given Veritaserum, they'll die within seconds as the two substances turn toxic.

The first time the Aurors discover this is post-war when capturing one of the ex-Death-Eaters on the run. He retched and turned orange within five seconds of the first drop entering his mouth. Only by autopsy did they discover the cause, and the Healers have no way to tell who has been exposed to the substance that would cause the toxicity. Therefore use of Veritaserum is a possible death-sentence without any truth in the bargain.

And rumour has it that the Dark Ministry had put /something/ into the Ministry water fountains, as it tasted different starting the first day of Pius Thickness' Ministership...
