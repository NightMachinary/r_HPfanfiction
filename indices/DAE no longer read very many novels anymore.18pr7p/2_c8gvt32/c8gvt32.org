Not for me. Sure, I find reading fanfic easier than novels. I don't need as much thought, and I can just burn through some interesting story featuring characters I already know and love. But, ultimately, I enjoy novels for different reasons than I enjoy fanfic. Fanfic can't replace novels.

But then, I haven't read much Sherlock.
