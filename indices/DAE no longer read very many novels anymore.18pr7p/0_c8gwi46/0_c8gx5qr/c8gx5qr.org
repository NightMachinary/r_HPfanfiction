Hahaha, I had been telling myself for some time that Is what I have been doing, taking a break from reading " real" stuff. But I graduated in December of 09', so I really should stop using that excuse. ಠ_ಠ I have an Ipad that I /said/ I was going to use to read real books with, but it just makes reading fan fiction so much more convenient!! Perhaps I should just stop worrying about it and just read something published whenever I feel like it, even if its only now and again. Or maybe, if I get some really good recommendations, that would inspire me, too! Fanfiction, especially the pairing I read ( usually SS/HG....so indulgent) , can just be so good at building up romantic tension, and I get addicted to it. Anywho, if anyone has any amazing recommendations, I would be all for them. I have already read a lot of the fantasy mainstays, like His Dark Materials, Sabriel, and LOTR, so something new would be great!
