Thanks for the recs. I can offer some good recs for SS/HG. I've been reading them for ages o_o.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/532103/1/FALLING-FURTHER-IN][Falling Further In]]

[[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]] ( it has a sequel, read it too!)

[[http://www.witchfics.org/anna/tango/][Last Tango in Paris]] I'm going to give a trigger warning on the very first bit of that one.. There is one scene that makes me uncomfortable, but it is still quite stellar! Also as two sequels!

[[http://www.witchfics.org/riley/ptq/][Pawn to Queen]] I haven't read this one in forever, but there are some bits in that one that make me uncomfortable too.. It's unfinished, and hasn't been touched in like a decade, but it's such a stand out piece in the shipping fandom that it's kind of a must read!

Hmm. I think those three are really obvious choices; ones you might have heard of already. I wish I could think of some good reads that are a little less know, and I know there are some, but those are the main ones that come to mind!
