Ha! That is a good one.. I started reading it a while back, but I haven't finished it yet. I've gotten sidetracked with Sherlock fics lately. I have the originals on my Ipad, as well, that I need to read. I have been trying to get through the Hobbit, but I get distracted by things quite easily. I would also kind of like to reread Wuthering Heights! Part of my problem is that some books strike such a cord with me that I just keep going back to them, rather than picking up anything new!
