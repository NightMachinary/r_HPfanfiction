Oh, thank you! I mainly started reading SS/HG because I read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family]] - it's a Snape centric story that adheres to canon as much as possible, but I thought it was just so, so well done. It really opened up the character of Severus for me... I never really got into his character reading the original series, but I loved this fanfic.

I've been reading a lot of older works on my Kindle... I've started reading the original Sherlock stories/novels, and just before that I finished reading through Austen. I have a line-up of classics that I'm ready to head through also. Re-reading them was a good jumpstart for me back into real books! haha
