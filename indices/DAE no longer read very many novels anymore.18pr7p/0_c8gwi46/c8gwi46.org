I found myself going through this trend during college, when I just needed a brain break from studying and wanted to consume mass amounts of material. I was a molecular biology major, and when I finished studying sometimes I just needed something mindless to let my brain recharge.

HP fanfiction did this for me. I'm not at all trying to say that the stories and authors I read were subpar; I always looked for rec sites and only stuck with really well done stories. But since I was always reading fanfic, I already knew the backstory and the characters, and the 'brainpower invested' vs 'payout from reading for fun instead of for school' ratio was great.

Now that I've graduated, I find I have more time and energy to read 'real' books. I also noticed the fanfic only trend in myself... I, like you, missed reading like a fiend! That much was enough to get me to start seeking out new books. Also, I got a Kindle for my birthday, so that really kickstarted my "Read Real Books!" campaign. haha
