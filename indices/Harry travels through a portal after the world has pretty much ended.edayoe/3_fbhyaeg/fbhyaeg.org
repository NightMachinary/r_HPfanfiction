The "I'm still here" fic inspired hundreds of other people. If you look hard enough you should be able to find similar fics. For example in one fic Dracos Ghost comes back. In another he somehow travels with Harry to avenge his dead son and betrayal of his parents. "I'm still here" is definitely one of the best fanfics out there.
