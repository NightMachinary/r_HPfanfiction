There is also two other fics that are *heavily* inspired by I'm Still Here. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13035363/1/I-m-back][I'm Back]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025350/1/From-Ruin][From Ruin]]. From Ruin was updated recently and the other may be abandoned.

Also there was one with a older Harry from another world but I don't remember the title. Only that Riddle isn't Voldemort but there is still a Dark Lord similar to what he was in the original universe. Bella is his daughter in law and she has a daughter named Dorea. Riddle took the Slytherin name if I remember well. Someone may know which fic it is.
