Harry Crow is a pile of shit, but there's a reason why people like it. For the most part, people read fanfiction for wish fulfillment, rather than for actual enjoyable, fully-realized characters or a competent plot. If Harry's awesome, then it's good enough for them, and Harry's makes god look like a shitheel in /all/ of robst's fics, let alone Harry Crow. Better yet that it's H/Hr and filled to the brim with juvenile Weasley/Dumbledore-bashing, which is sure to bring militant Harmonians with a grudge against Ron out of the wood work. Robst's writing is grammatically competent and reads well, even if it is a bit soulless, and his stories are so chock full of fanservice and wish-fulfillment that the average FF reader would go hog wild over it.
