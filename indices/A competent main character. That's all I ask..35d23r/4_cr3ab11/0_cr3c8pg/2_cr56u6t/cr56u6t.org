[[/u/PsychoGeek]] there's no reason to be so hostile.

My favourite thing about this fandom is that people are free to pursue their own ideal through different stories. I don't like TMR/HG fics. In fact, they go against almost everything I believe about Hermione's character. But I'd never tell someone that they shouldn't enjoy stories featuring that pairing or be a part of the fandom. Your comments cross a line for me.

Robst is well known for three things: extremely helpful goblins, very powerful main characters, and fluffy H/Hr. Don't like it? Don't read it. There are plenty of people who /do/ like those stories and I don't see any of them here shitting all over your preferences.
