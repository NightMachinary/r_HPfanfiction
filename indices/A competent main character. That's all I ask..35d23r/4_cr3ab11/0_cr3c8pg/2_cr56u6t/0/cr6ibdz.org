  There are plenty of people who do like those stories and I don't see any of them here shitting all over your preferences.

Oh, I wouldn't mind at all if people actually found fault with my reading preferences, as long as the criticism is legitimate. You see, thing is, Harry Crow is objectively terrible. It is a bash-fest from the beginning to the end, and I consider bashing to be inherently disrespectful to canon.

  Robst is well known for three things: extremely helpful goblins, very powerful main characters, and fluffy H/Hr.
#+end_quote

Yes, and the first one contradicts everything we know about goblins from canon, the second one is bad writing and the third.... well, I refuse to recognize those ... those /things/ Robst writes as Harry and Hermione from canon.

Like I said, objectively terrible.

Besides, I do like to think I am doing people a favor. Someone actually recommended the story, and I just .... provided more information. And if there are people who don't mind long bash-fests with a Harry-who-isn't-Harry-at-all and who is more powerful than God, then they should actually like it /more/ now that they know what the story is about.

Meanwhile, anyone who doesn't like such shit (I was tempted to write /anyone with half a brain/, so I'm actually being generous here) can happily ignore the story and move on with their lives.

See, everyone wins.
