Harry Crow is the biggest pile of shit I've ever tried to read. Doesn't Harry outshine McGonagall in his very first transfiguration lesson?

#+begin_quote
  Minerva had been a transfiguration prodigy and now held a mastery in the subject, an eleven year old goblin-trained wizard had just totally destroyed everything she held to be true. She was a powerful witch but couldn't even contemplate repeating the feat this boy just achieved when she was the same age. It wasn't just that though, Harry Crow just threw the transfiguration rulebook out the window. Where the hell did they go from here?

/Fucking Hell/. But this is hardly the worst part -- there's the whole Dumbledore/Weasley bashing thing that makes me want to strangle somebody, preferably the author. And those fucking Goblins. The whole thing is a butchery of the /Harry Potter/ books. How on earth can anyone like such utter drivel?
