It sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]] would be right up your alley. Lots of friends from all four houses. Martial arts. Very powerful magically. Apprentices with Nicolas Flamel. Has like, a dozen girls all over him, including a vampire princess. You want wish-fulfillment, this has the whole nine yards. Fairly well written honestly, currently in-progress and over 500k words including the two sequel series: Heir of Slytherin and Ties that Bind
