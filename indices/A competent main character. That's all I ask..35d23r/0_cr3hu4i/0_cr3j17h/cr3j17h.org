Yup! Don't get me wrong, I read FFN with actual plot/characters, but right now I just want fluff and wish fulfillment.

Also, I'd count Hogwarts Battle School as something that fits this, but Harry definitely faces challenges and is set back many times (Starts losing to Hermoine, whole house turns against him, Snape puts him in battles impossible to win), but I like that he's very, very competent throughout it, even while failing. He's also portrayed as a complex character with his flaws, but finds ways to hide them.
