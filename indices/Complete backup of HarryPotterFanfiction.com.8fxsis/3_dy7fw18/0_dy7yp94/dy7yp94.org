How did you download it? And more importantly, the story archive has been taken down two days ago. It sounds like you're still trying to download it, which will by now only show the [[http://www.fanfictionworld.net/404.html][404 error not found page]].

Having a full mirror of the original website might be nice indeed, but when I started my process I thought it would not be worth gathering or providing that much extra data, since the dynamically created content would all be static anyway.
