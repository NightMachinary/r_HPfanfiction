Lol you beat me to it. My computer has slowed down significantly, and I have a suspicion that they throttled my internet speed, so there's still a part remaining. I will have the entire website downloaded (or as close as I could get), as in the actual website complete with assets and what not, but I'm still having the final links written, so it'll be in another 5+ days before that and my upload (maybe even more) finishes. If anyone actually wants the full website, it'll be available then.

Edit: I just checked the download. Apparently the full folder is nearly 5Gb, but somehow, I've seen my download reach 30Gb+. The current download is about 8Gb. What the hell happened to the restâ€½
