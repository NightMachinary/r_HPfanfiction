I might take a crack at making a searchable database/online reader for this. I did something similar once for another site, but several archives for that one already existed. It might take a while before I have time to do it though.

Edit: Just in case I never actually do this, I've also created a torrent file of the archive, so even if the files are unavailable through the links on the OP, they might still be if people help me seed it a bit.
