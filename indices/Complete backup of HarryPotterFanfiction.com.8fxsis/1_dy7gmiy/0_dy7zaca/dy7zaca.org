That would have been a good idea for the operator of HPFF.com to do, because losing such a big fanworks collection is always a sad thing to see.

As an uninvolved third party however, I'm not in a position to talk to them about it. In fact, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/tos#V.D.][terms of service]] of their Open Doors project specifically exclude anyone /but the maintainer/ of the archive from initializing a transfer of such a collection.

There are more requirements as well, such as the ability to contact content creators so they have the choice to opt-out of the transfer process or orphan their works.
