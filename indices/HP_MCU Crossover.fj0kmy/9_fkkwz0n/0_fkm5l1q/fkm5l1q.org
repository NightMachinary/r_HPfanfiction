Yes! This is something I'm trying to avoid in a story I've had kicking around my drafts awhile, where Hermione is sort of skirting the edges of the law trying to help mutants find sanctuary from the regular humans. It seemed to fit, given her stance on House Elf rights. Other characters would do things too, it's not terribly hard to find something they might also do in a crossover.
