I suggest not bothering with this world colliding bit. Just make them start off on the same world. The magical world is already shielded from Muggles, you don't need the dimensional stuff.

Either don't make the MCU magic work like it did in the films (where technically muggles could learn sorcery) or make the differences between HO magic and MCU sorcery clearly different. Like, MCU uses sorcery, where you draw the magic in from an external source or a higher being (like Dormammu) to do supernatural stuff, while HP magic is just the wizard's own power. The HP magic seems way more varied, though arguably less powerful in some areas.
