It seems like a very interesting concept, I would love to read it!

If you're taking suggestions I would recommend not using overglorrification of the muggle world. Yes it is a big world with lots of good, but I speak as someone who actually lives in real world when I say that the world is not perfect. Making the magical world incapable of beating technology is a real bummer for me. Try to make magic capable of making some real damage, remember, Grindewald almost destroyed Paris with a cursed flame and it was magic, not technology which stopped him. Make Voldemort a real danger for the world as a whole instead of a fool living an illusion.
