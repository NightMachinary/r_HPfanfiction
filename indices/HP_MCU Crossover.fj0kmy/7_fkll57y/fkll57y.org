Don't leave out the Sorcerers! I'm interested in the interactions between the two, like perhaps an older, Auror!Harry has learned to see the signs of dark magic, and instantly notices the source of the Ancient One's long life? Perhaps both of them team up, or the sorcerers are absorbed into the wizarding world.

How might the wizards react to (what amounts to) muggles being able to learn magic?
