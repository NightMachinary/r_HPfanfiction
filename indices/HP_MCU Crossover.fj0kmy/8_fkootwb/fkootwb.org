As other have said, yes many would enjoy that. A few words of advice, it's OK if While the Trio and the Potter Extended cast is Involved don't make them God's compared to the Marvel heroes as well as don't make the Potter characters weakling in need of being saved by the MCU characters. Sure Harry can be a Hero or whatever and stronger or more involved than lets say Luna or George or even Ron, they shouldn't be getting mugged by a guy on the street.

Another thing is when everyone is introduced Harry and Team Potter/Wizard/Hex/Warlock should have their own adventure AFTER, Like Iron Man goes on to fight AIM and Thor goes on to fight The Dark Elves Harry and the team shouldn't be sidekicks where they always have to be around a Marvel Hero, helping and not really effecting the canonical story of those movies.

Finally you have 70 years of comics, there are Giant Monsters, Vampires and Werewolves, Villainous Sorcerers. You can easily take one and they can become villains for a short story for the Potter Crew. Modred the Mystic, Varnae, Fin Fang Foom all three can be very interesting villains for Harry, Hermione, and Ron
