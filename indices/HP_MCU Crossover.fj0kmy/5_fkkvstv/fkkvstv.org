Yes i'am but please dont use those tedious tropes.

Make Harry adept with technology, or at least know how to use it.

Dont nerf magic, buff everything else.

Give Harry some quirks, like damn he is a human not a soldier.

Dont make Fury say "TaIl ThE UnKoWn!" Have Harry be found by saving someone.

Dont limit yourself to HO magic only, I would love for Harry to study at the Kamar-Taj or have him learn Asguardian magic.

And finally if there is pairings dont do cross over pairings, their are only two I like in the vast amount of stories. Blood Stained and Child of the Storm/Ghosts of the past being both.

If you merge, might I suggest change the timeline.

Like have Chapter 1 go about Voldemort doing a ritual that goes wrong and the timeline is fucked beyond repair, or space time continuum paired with Thanos snap creates alternate pathway.

Maybe make Thor Harry's dad... like mess the fuck about its fanfiction and I love the MCU and HP!

Shit, I might wrote this now...
