Its a harem with Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, and Harry/Natalia. The last is an original character. Don't let the fact that its a harem put you off though. I'm not a fan of harem fanfics, and almost missed this story due to that. It isn't like most harem fanfics, where Harry is having a threesome every chapter. There are actually reasons why Harry gets with three women. The worldbuilding is also pretty great. Not to mention Natalia might be one of the best written oc's in any HP fanfic I've ever read.
