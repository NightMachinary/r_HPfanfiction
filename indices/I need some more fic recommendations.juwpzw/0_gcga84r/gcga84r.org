Anytime someone asks for an OP!Harry fic, i have to recommend mine.

Slow-burn powerup, creative combat, action-heavy, and believable. International travel, to places and settings almost never used in fanfics, canon is thrown out the window after First Year.

Just updated it, only 1 more chapter til it's complete. If you read one action story this year, make it linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)
