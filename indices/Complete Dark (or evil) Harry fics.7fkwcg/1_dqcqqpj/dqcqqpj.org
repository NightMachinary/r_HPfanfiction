This is a serious question, not trying to hate, but I am baffled:

Why are Evil!Harry stories attractive to write/read?

With proper character development I can understand a Dark!Harry that cares more about results than methods, but straight Evil!Harry seems to me to be a complete contradiction of his character. If the main character needs to be evil, there are plenty of other well-known canon characters that are already evil or can be twisted to be. Why use Harry when the only thing about him that remains intact is his name?
