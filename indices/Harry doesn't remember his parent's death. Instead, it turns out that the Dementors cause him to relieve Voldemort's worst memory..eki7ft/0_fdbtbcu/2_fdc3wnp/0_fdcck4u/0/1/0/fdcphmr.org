More fun? Absolutely. Better written? Maybe - the beginning of HPMOR has some serious flaws, and Yudkowsky took too much of his essay writing with him when he started fanfiction. Seventh Horcrux, on the other hand, is hindered by its devotion to comedy, and relies a lot on your knowledge of canon in order for certain scenes to make sense. At its best, it is really good, but at its worst it reads like bad /Naruto/ fanfiction. In terms of plot, I think HPMOR is better. HPMOR really drags out in the middle, but Yudkowsky is juggling a lot of plot threads, /most/ of which resolve in a clever and satisfying way in the end. The only place where I feel he really dropped the ball is with Dumbledore acting in arbitrary ways according to prophecy. It explained why certain things happened in-universe, but you could tell it was just a hasty patch over the few plot holes that remained.

Still, Seventh Horcrux succeeded where Yudkowsky failed, in that it doesn't sound obnoxious or opinionated. If that decides whether or not a work is readable for you, there's no changing it. A book is only worth what it can give you.
