For me, MOR really stutters along because of Less Wrong's determination to have Harry scrutinise the minutia of the Wizarding World in absurd amounts of detail. I understand that that's the point, but on a similar note, the sheer absurdity is the whole point of Seventh Horcrux. The writing is stylistically designed to mirror the viewpoints that Harry has, which are oftentimes insane. Seventh Horcrux is one of the best stories on the entire site, in my opinion. It accomplishes what MOR tries to in a fraction of the content (a radically different Harry) and it is a lot more fun because it doesn't read like treacle.

Also, anybody who reads FanFiction WITHOUT understanding the canon does so at their own risk. Authors have no obligation to spoon-feed readers.
