HPMOR has its flaws, but anyone who thinks it is bad enough to be the fanfiction-that-must-not-be-named is severely overestimating the quality of fanfiction as a whole. Not to say your impression is wrong - I enjoy it, but a hell of a lot of other people don't. It's just not /that/ bad. That having been said, if you want the same twist without all of the baggage, /Seventh Horcrux/ is basically HPMOR minus the drama.
