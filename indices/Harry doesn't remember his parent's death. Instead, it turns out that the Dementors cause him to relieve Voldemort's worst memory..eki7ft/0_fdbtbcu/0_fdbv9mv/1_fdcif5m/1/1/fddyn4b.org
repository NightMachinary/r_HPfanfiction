Eh, I see the Goblins having treaties for stuff like that with at least the Egyptian magical government. Where they are required to do it, for a reasonable fee. Maybe for also agreeing to work for them for a few years since he is a parselmouth. Which I think should be a permanent ability.

You can have Bill get into serious trouble with the Goblins for telling that information. Until Bill tells them about the Malfoys and Lestranges. Then he becomes their favorite curse breaker.

I can see the Goblins willingly going to war for that. They get a war, lots of gold, and force the ministry to revisit some treaties. And potential profit by having a parselmourh work for them for some time.
