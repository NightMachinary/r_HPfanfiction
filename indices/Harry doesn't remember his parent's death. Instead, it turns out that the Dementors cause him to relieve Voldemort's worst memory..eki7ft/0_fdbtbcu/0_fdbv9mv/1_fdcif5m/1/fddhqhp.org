If I'm being honest, I'm OK with the idea of the goblins having a fairly decent amount of knowledge in the realm of Horcrux destruction (what with their work in Egypt, and the Pharaohs known obsession with living forever); but if I were to ever write a fic where Harry goes to them to get the soul fragment in his scar removed, I would make it cost him a metaphorical arm and a leg, and literally the majority of the gold in his vault, along with some other unspecified, but quite possibly horribly unfair things.
