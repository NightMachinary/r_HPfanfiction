I agree... it does make sense, but it's still funny because it's pretty overused. And not used well, at that.

It would be cool to delve into the substance of ancient egyptian history... or even ancient greek history, considering Herpo the Foul was credited with creating not only the first Horcrux, but also the first basilisk. But alas, this would require someone far more interesting than Binns.
