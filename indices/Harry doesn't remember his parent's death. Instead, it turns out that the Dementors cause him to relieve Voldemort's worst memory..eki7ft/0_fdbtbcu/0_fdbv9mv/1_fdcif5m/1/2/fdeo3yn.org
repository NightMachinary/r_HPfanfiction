Which makes sense when you look at it from a mythological/historical context, too - in most of these stories, a curse as bad as being a Horcrux is usually cast by some deity, higher power or somesuch, and requires you to undergo journeys and adventures and trials and usually still ends in a bitter ending with a sacrifice of either the life of another, or part of yourself.

Within the context of HP magic, you could say that the Horcrux wasn't so much just on top of his own soul, but entangled there and slowly reaching deeper and deeper as it learns to slowly circumvent Lily's protection. it's slightly damaged by the Basilisk in his second year, but also strengthened by Harry's proximity and interaction with the Diary, and then it gets a massive boost when Voldemort Prime manages to stop Lily's protection from hurting him, and starts sending him targeted visions. Then the team start carrying around another Horcrux, the locket, which again strengthens the one in Harry's scar, and it digs deeper and deeper.

And then it's violently torn out, ripping apart Harry's soul in the process when the barbs and hooks it's got in his soul are removed by the Killing Curse.
