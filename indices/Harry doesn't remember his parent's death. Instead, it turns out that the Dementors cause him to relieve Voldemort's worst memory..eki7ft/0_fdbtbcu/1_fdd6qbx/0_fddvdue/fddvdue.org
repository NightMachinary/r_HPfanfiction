Well, coming to Voldy's capacity to love, he was never shown to be cruel to snakes (until he was disembodied in Halloween, 1981 after which he possessed snakes, birds, squirrels and Quirrell) and valued one of them so much that he literally put a piece of his soul in them. I am sure that Dumbledore's conclusion about Voldemort's ability to love came from observing his interaction with fellow humans not snakes.
