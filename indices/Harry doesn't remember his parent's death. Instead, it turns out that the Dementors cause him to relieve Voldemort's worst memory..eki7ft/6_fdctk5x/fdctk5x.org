It can't be, because we hear James saying "Lily, take Harry and go" and then we hear Voldemort killing Lily.

If we are reliving Voldemort's worst memory, we would have heard 1. James saying Lily take Harry and go. 2. Voldemort killing James 3. Voldemort killing Lily.

From Harry's point of view, there's no memory of Voldemort killing James because at that moment, they were in the other room.
