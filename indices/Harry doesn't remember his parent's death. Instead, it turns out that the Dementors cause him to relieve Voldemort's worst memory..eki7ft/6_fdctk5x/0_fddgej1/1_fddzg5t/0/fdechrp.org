If I was to continue playing devils advocate I'd say ; Dementors dont strip a memory completely of everything non negative. You still have basic context, things you feel neutral about (like say walls, or the floor). Killing james would theoretically be actively joyful, and killing Lily could be explained away by saying he felt mildly irritated at having wasted the time to speak with her.

I dont think this theory makes sense when looked at too closely tbh. I agree with the guy I first replied to when he said it's not likely Voldemort's memory.
