Hey now, being asexual aint like that. It doesnt mean she/he wont/doesnt want a family. Maybe it's important to the plot or simply a fact? The story is still just getting started so lets see then.

But it is still just a fanfic. I think we should just simply enjoy it. I like the fanfic because the dynamics of Lunar Harmony on this. They are like a family so thats plus points from me.
