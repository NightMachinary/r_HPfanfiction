  Hey now, being asexual aint like that. It doesnt mean she/he wont/doesnt want a family. Maybe it's important to the plot or simply a fact? The story is still just getting started so lets see then.

Of course it won't change his desire for a family. He will just have a pretty tough time to find a partner to do it with. That's why I feel it's like piling crap on a character who has enough shit to deal with. In contrast to what tumblrites belief... having a rare sexuality isn't cool or trendy, it usually comes with lots of problems and challenges... particularly if you lack sexual desire, which is pretty basic for almost all romantic relationships and intimacy that goes beyond "we're best buddies".
