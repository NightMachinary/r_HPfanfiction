being open about there dark magic habbits is more of a fan cliche that sets it up as a separate culture and power. 'dark wizards have a reasonable reason for what they do,' and such. in cannon a dark wizard is someone who kills and tortures to get there way, or wants too. i imagine a dark-griff would be someone who went to war like a general, or possibly like a bunch of vikings. just go off and kill and pillage the people who don't want to work for you. less speeches and games.
