I think that while a Gryffindor (dark or not) is far more likely to lead from the front than a Slytherin, that's not the critical distinction. We see unsubtle Slytherins (e.g., Draco) and Slytherins who lead from the front (e.g., Voldemort); and we see subtle Gryffindors who can scheme with the best of them (e.g. Dumbledore and Hermione).

In my opinion, the critical distinction is a that a dark Gryffindor would do dark things to make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not), whereas a dark Slytherin would do dark things for personal power, social position, and just plain stability and comfort for him and his or for her and hers.

To make a dark Gryffindor, take Dumbledore at 17, and kill off Arianna in a way that, rather than filling him with guilt and fear of his own power, reaffirms his belief that wizards should rule over the Muggles, so that he joins Grindelwald in their plans for the Greater Good.

Or, take Hermione and show her vividly that the wizarding society in general and the Ministry in particular is fundamentally rotten, with no hope of fixing it by working within the system. (Once scenario I like is a divergence in CoS, where Hagrid does not survive his stay in Azkaban, and there are no consequences for Fudge for sending him to his death: most people just shrug about it --- a penniless, wandless, uncouth half-giant who wasn't that great a wizard even before he was expelled evokes pity, but no action; Dumbledore regrets it deeply but isn't willing to take the matter into his own hands since he sees it as retribution; and even the other Gryffindors just want to move on.)
