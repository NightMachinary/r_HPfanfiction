Even postwar canon facts could support a 'Dark Gryffindors' takeover.

It's very likely that their generation was totally fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

I don't think they would just become your average corrupt politicians, but ruthless revolutionaries who gave up an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly merciless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Once you have control of the police, the media, and the street, there are lots of options in how you can deal with your enemies. You don't even need to get your hands dirty, just let your followers know whom you don't like, and they will take care of things for you. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

As someone said eloquently, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
