One of the fics I loved when first began reading was Lord of the Werewolves, which is a Canon Divergence from Bill and Fleur's wedding and follows a darker Remus.

He goes from follower to leader of the werewolves in a convincing manner, but I can't remember more beyond him preventing Kingsley to sit at the minister's chair before complying to his (and the werewolves') conditions.
