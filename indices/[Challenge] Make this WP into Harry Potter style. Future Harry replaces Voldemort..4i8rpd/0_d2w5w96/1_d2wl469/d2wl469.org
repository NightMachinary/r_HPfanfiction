That was... surprisingly good. I don't think that anything in your writing itself necessarily jumped out at me, but but but. This premise. Oh my god this premise. Like... I considered jotting down a little something-something for this WP, but I didn't, because I wasn't quite sure how to interpret it. You did it utter justice though, truly - and just because I wouldn't have interpreted it this way (though I think this was a better way to go about it) - the ending was such, such such n unexpected twist for me. I loved it.
