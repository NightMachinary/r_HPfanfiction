Another plot twist: you'd want a Muggle relative. Let's ignore the "famous in the Wizarding world" part, although that's certainly a concern. They just went through a civil war. People are lying about what side they're truly on - yeah, Peter was the traitor, not Sirius, but still. If you try to find a distant Wizarding relative, you don't necessarily know what their true politics are like, if they're just trying to collect a paycheck. I remember in one fic, Dumbledore told Harry that he did manage to find a distant Wizarding relative, but he didn't actually know her, so there were all of these questions of whether she could be trusted, and if she would handle the responsibilities well. Those questions make a case for just taking the safer route and leaving Harry with Muggle relatives.
