It just, I always thought of it being there to protect Harry, therefor it being tied to HIM through his mother, but he himself is genetically half his father ... erm ... if that makes sense. Like his mom said 'I am his relative i want him protected' and he'd be protected by anyone related to HIM. HIS blood relations. - though thats probably a stupid assumption.
