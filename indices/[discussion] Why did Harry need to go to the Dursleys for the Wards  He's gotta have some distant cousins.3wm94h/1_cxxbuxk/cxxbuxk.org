First, wards aren't canon. They are fanon elements that don't exist in the HP universe. What Lily had done was a powerful protection charm (or a counter-charm to be more precise).

So, why wasn't Harry taken to any Wizarding home? First, as MasterofDebt said, it might be because Lily was the one who made the protection, so the relatives must be related to Lily, not James. It may also be because the protection might be stronger if the relatives are more closely related to Harry. But that's all conjecture.

The reason stated in the canon is that it was because Dumbledore, at this point, believed (correctly) that living in Privet Drive was the safest option for Harry. This was because of two reasons.

1) After Sirius' "betrayal," absolutely nobody could be trusted. After all, Sirius was James' best friend (and a part of the Order). So, if he was a betrayer, anyone else could be potentially dangerous.

Of course, Dumbledore could have made Harry's protectors make an unbreakable oath of not harming Harry or something. However, this can further be explained on the second point.

2) At this point, no one was safe (as proven by the attack on the Longbottoms a few days later). Even the Fidelius Charm, which was known to be the most potent protection, failed at this point. Voldemort's fanatic followers were still at large, and there was nothing that could guarantee Harry's safety 100%, other than Lily's sacrificial charm.

So, canonically, we can conclude that being sent to the Dursleys was the best chance in Harry's survival. While Harry did not have the best childhood, at least he was alive.
