Glad to help ;)

Yep, there isn't a single mention of wards in the HP canon (books, movies, games, pottermore, interviews, etc).

Actually, I lied. It is used [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Janus_Thickey_Ward][once]] in OotP, although it refers to a different kind of ward :P

Anyways, it happens to most people who read fanfiction, so you're not alone. For me, it helps when I take some breaks from fanfiction and re-read the canon every once in a while. Helps me appreciate the canon more and refresh my mind from all the bad fanfic tropes.
