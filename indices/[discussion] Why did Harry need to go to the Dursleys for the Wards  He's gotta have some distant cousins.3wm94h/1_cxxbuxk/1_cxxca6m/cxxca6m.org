Thanks , some things make more sense to me now! And the wards are fanon? I thought the protection is canon, but saying they are blood wards specifically is fanon ... I think I've read to many fanfics if I already mix up stuff in my head - on the other hand keeping half a dozen books straight in my head isn't easy either :)
