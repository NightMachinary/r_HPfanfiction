Thing is, the wards used in fanon are often things used in canon itself, like anti apparition/disapparition. Or Fidelius. Anti intruder jinx. Imperturbable charm. Muggle repelling. Basically charms/spells/hexes that affect an area or protect an object.

Fanon just goes overboard, turning into an entire field, when the word ward isn't really used in that context at all in canon. It /works/, but it's not a thing.
