Wards aren't canon, true, but in this case it's "a rose by any other name" type of thing. Wards aren't a class of magic in and of themselves, but any charms or jinxes combined with a trigger (such as motion past a certain line) which are then used to defend a stationary target, such as a home or a piece of land, are essentially wards. Without the trigger, you've just got a cursed house. Since Harry's protection is centered on Harry, and Harry is not stationary, it can't really be called a ward.
