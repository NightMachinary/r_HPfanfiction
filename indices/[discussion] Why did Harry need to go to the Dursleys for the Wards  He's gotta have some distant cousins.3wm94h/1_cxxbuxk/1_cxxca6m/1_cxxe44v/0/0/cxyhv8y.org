The protection is centered on Harry. The reason why he had to stay with the Dursleys was because doing so was the /condition/ of the Bond of Blood. However, this does not imply that the protection is centered on the house. It protected him from Quirrell in Hogwarts (which, certainly, was outside Privet Drive).

The reason why he was told not to leave the house was because 1) breaking the /condition/ (not location) of the Bond of Blood will disable the protection and 2) the Order was on their way to get Harry, and they did not want him to do anything rash (like try to run away as he did in PoA).
