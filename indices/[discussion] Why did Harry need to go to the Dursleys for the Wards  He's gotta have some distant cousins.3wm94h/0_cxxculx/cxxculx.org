What you need to understand is that the one who sent Harry to Dursleys to isolate him from the magical world was not Albus Dumbledore. It was JK Rowling (yeah, sounds dumb but hear me out).

The entire story hinges on the fact that Harry and Voldemort are so similar to one another. Both of them were orphans and grew up without being loved. Harry was feared for his magic by the Dursleys, much like Tom was in his orphanage. Harry was isolated from the magic world up until the age of eleven, much like Tom was. Both of them had the qualification coveted by Salazar for his house (as demonstrated by the hat wanting to put Harry in Slytherin). Even their names were similar in that both of them were quite common.

Had Harry followed the hat's advice and went to Slytherin, with his fame and abilities (specifically parselmouth), he would have grown up to become a very different wizard. Perhaps, not dissimilar to Voldemort. However, he chose Gryffindor instead, and made friends who helped him and supported him and the rest is history.

So you see? Rowling engineered the situation so that she could make Harry's childhood the same as Tom's. And that was done to illustrate her point, it is not our abilities or situations that define us, it's our choices.
