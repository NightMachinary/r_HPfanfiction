Even though Lily would have had to have a magical relative at some point in the family tree, how far back would it have to be before it didn't count? Go back far enough and I'm every redditor's distant cousin.

Even if that magical relative's other descendants counted for the protection, who's to say they'd actually be any of the families in the UK? In that region they're basically all related, but this one relative could've been from a different part of the world entirely, where their only magical relatives are in, say, Brazil or Canada. I don't really see the rather closed off Ministry, or even Dumbledore, sending their cherished prophesied one to some distant country for the next ten years.

It wouldn't matter that Harry almost certainly has magical blood relations through his father's pureblood line (assuming his line is from the British wizarding world). James didn't use the sacrificial magic, Lily did. So the relative had to be on Lily's side.

We know his grandparents were dead by that point, that Lily had no other siblings, and there's no mention of any other family implying their parents could have been only children (which is entirely possible).
