It sounds like you're describing a specific fic. In this case, you should be using the 'What's that fic?' flair and not 'Request'. According to Rule 7: 'Request threads are for recommendations. Fic Searches are for finding a specific fic. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested. Flair accordingly.'
