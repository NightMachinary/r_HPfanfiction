  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

  Sequel to Fugitives of Azkaban. Incomplete and probably abandoned. Harry and Sirius have escaped Azkaban and against considerable odds survived, but Harry can't escape his fate. Warning, big parts of this are missing in the middle and it has yet to be complete, but I have not touched it in years so figured I might as well post it as is and maybe get inspired to finish it.
