The failure to have short term memory converted to long term memory during sleep as seen in "50 First Dates", and even shorter spans, like in "Memento" are not fictitious conditions. It is also not the result of disease but is rather caused by an acquired brain injury which affects the memory centre of the brain.

Are you wanting to make up an illness which causes a broken heart in its sufferers or are you wanting only those suffering from a broken heart to be vulnerable to catching your disease? Your request isn't very clear.

There is in real life a disease referred to as "Broken Heart Syndrome" it mostly affects women and is usually triggered by emotionally stressful events like the death of a loved one or a breakup/divorce. This combined with presenting with similar symptoms to a heart attack is how it earned its moniker. Perhaps much as we have chicken pox/small pox and the wizarding world has dragon pox you could create a magical equivalent to Broken Heart Syndrome.
