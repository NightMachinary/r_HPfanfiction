Here is my imaginary disease. Feel free to use and/or change anything you like.

Morgana's Memento Flu is a disease commonly found by teenagers and young adults. It is a highly infectious disease which spreads by negative emotions. (Only to people which dwell on negative emotions). Some believe this spread is based in accidental magic but this has yet to be verified.

When infected, the disease will drain memories during sleep which will be permanently gone. The disease has limited intelligenge and systematically destroys memories to change the behaviour of it's host. It desires to cause its host and others to have negative emotions. To infect others, it is known to drive the host to do drastic things like picking fights and commit suicide.

Although the immune system can fight the disease, there are several methods to improve this. Potions like a dreamless sleep potion can stop memory loss. This reduces the disease's ability to affect it's host. Unfortunately, those potions can be addictive and are therefore not used extensively. A pensieve is sometimes used to counter memory loss. However, this is a difficult and time-consuming process.

EDIT: Changed the wording a bit.
