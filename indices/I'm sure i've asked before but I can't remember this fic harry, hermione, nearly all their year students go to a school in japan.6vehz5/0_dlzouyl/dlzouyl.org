I remember that story, too.

I loved it at first, but everyone had crackfic-level powers by... second year IIRC, and there was no believability to there being any conflict at all.

It was also one of those fics where Magical Britain is backwards isolationist to a ridiculous degree, and everywhere else is more or less a utopia.

Yet no-one uses any of their stated gained abilities in even the most blindingly obvious of situations.
