The thing is Radaslab has very detailed, lore-rich worlds that he creates for his fics. It's why I dove into them in the first place. But as cliched filled as they may be what turned me off then was the intense focus on weirdness/squick, especially in The Harem War, which is simultaneously both better and worse than that name implies. A 750,000 word novel set in that world could be an enjoyable read for the most part. But there are, to put it lightly, age issues in both directions, among other things that forced me to give it up.
