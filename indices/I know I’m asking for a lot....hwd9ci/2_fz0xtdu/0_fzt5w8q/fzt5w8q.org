Agreed. Firebird is the most horrendous, horrifying take on the HP-Verse of any fic I've ever read either. Definitely worth the read for the uniqueness though, if you can stomach it.

Also, yea, off the top of my head... Trigger Warnings For Rape, Reverse Rape(female forcing male), Major Character Death, Child Abuse, Forced Marriage, Torture, Sexual Torture, and Underaged Sex at an absolute minimum. Definitely a dystopia.
