I must say, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird]] trilogy is the most disturbing, dark and gritty story I've ever read.

It's three books, all complete. An AU that completely overhauls the way magic works and takes place in a dystopian world.

Trigger warnings: Read at your own risk.

It does have a harem of sorts, but trust me. It's nothing like any other story and it's part of the dystopian world the author wove.
