  From the time they're eleven years old, Ron is always there to help him find his peace in those dark and lonely hours of the night. Turns out, Harry has helped Ron find his too.

  Albus Dumbledore never dreamed he would have such a person on his hands. He had never imagined how quickly even the best laid plans could be derailed by something as simple as love. Snippets of the Harry Potter series from Dumbledore's point of view. Will eventually cover all seven books.

  Do you- do you think I can't handle it? Harry, we've been through hell, haven't we? We've both seen hell, and we're both still here. I'm here, like I've always been here. I think I've proven whatever it is, I can take it. I'm not going anywhere.” Her voice had taken on a defensive edge, but Harry could hear the hurt beneath it. She thought he didn't trust her. She was wrong. She was so wrong.  “I know. I know you can. It's not that. It really isn't, it's just-” There are things we haven't talked about. Things I didn't want you to find out, not like this. Things I shouldn't tell you like this. He coudn't bring himself to say it, but she was watching him with those eyes so he took deep breath and tried again. //One shot set after the war. Harry and Ginny are living together and just trying to get by. Harry has a particularly bad episode and he and Ginny talk a little bit about what life was like for him at the Dursley's. Because they've all been through a lot and Harry needs to start dealing with his childhood trauma, dammit!
