I've seen the cleaning thing in a number of Severitus/mentor!Snape fics. Two of them off the top of my head: Crime and Punishment linkffn(12951919) has him doing it originally to spite Snape ("you call me lazy, ha, I'll show you"). Later there's a minor subplot about the subconscious meaning of cleaning as proof that he's a member of the household. A Very Slytherin Harry linkao3(11047995) has a similar subplot of him feeling useless and using cleaning as a way to calm himself down.

The second Ninja Wizard has a great subplot about how living with the Dursleys screws up his relationship with Sirius once he goes to live with him. "You have a bad attitude, go to your room and stay there" does not normally mean "you can't come out to eat meals or use the bathroom or send letters to your friends until I explicitly say your punishment is over."

  "Emergency food stores?" Adeline said quietly.

  Oddment nodded.

  Sirius let out a shaky breath, feeling rather sick.

  "A kid his age should have porn, or at least racy photos of teeny boppers in bikinis hidden in his room, not food."

  "Does he have anything else hidden?"

  "Medicine, bandages and weapons."

  Adeline closed her eyes and covered her mouth, while Sirius clenched the back of the chair he was standing behind in a white-knuckled grip.
