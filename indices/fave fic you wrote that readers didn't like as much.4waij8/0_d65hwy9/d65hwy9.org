I wrote a fic that had this premise:

The DoM battle in 5th year gave Ron the ability to throw himself forward in time for an initial span of twenty seconds. He could see and hear everything, but he couldn't interact with the future time. He used that ability to better himself in school, Quidditch, and with his romances, but the spans of time start stretching longer and longer until he starts watching the return of Voldemort and the death of his friends. He doesn't know whether or not his actions will lead or even matter in regards to the future he sees and starts to go mad.

I wrote the first few chapters and it received only a few reviews. It was fun writing a non-Harry centric fic. I've since taken it down, but that was a story that none of my readers really got into.
