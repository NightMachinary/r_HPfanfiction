None of mine have ever been remotely what you'd call popular, but this one has a far lower read-through rate from first to last chapters than the others do. It's my most recent multichapter, and I thought - and still think - it's better written and plotted, more complex, and deals with more interesting issues altogether. But people don't seem very enthusiastic about it. Though I don't think I'd change it because it still pleases me, I honestly wish I knew why. linkffn(11662486)
