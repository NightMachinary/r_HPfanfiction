Yeah maybe. I mean there were several factors that probably don't draw people in. Namely:

-We know so little about these characters that they're basically OCs. People don't really like OCs. -It's femmeslash, but only mild sexual situations. People only seem to like gay stuff i it's porny. -It's an unusual pairing which takes a character (Astoria) from more popular pairings (Harry, Draco) -It's a doomed ship fic, so the reader knows it's not a ship that will sail. -The challenge stipulated that it had to be inspired by/in the theme of this Florence + The Machine song, which makes people think it's a song fic. It's not, fyi. -The summary doesn't say a lot and is not intriguing, but because I knew it wasn't going to be popular I didn't bother putting effort into it. I'm ok with it being just for me, but I'm still proud enough of it that I wanted it up somewhere. -It's just a one-shot and I was a fairly new writer when I posted it.
