Definitely my newest fic, linkffn(11804414)

Obviously, it's a crossover, so it's never going to get as much attention as just a regular HP fic, but the review, fave, and follow counts are all pretty low, even for that archive. The lack of readership for it bothered me for a really long time, because (and I'm not /trying/ to sound like a dick here, but I will) I felt that my fic was a better read than anything else in that archive. Now, however, I think I was just trying too hard to be clever and original, and it backfired spectacularly.

Essentially, the story isn't really a Harry Potter-Witcher crossover, so much as it's HP re-imagined in the Witcher world some 200 years before the original Witcher books/games. That means there's no jumping through the DoM veil and landing on the other planet; Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dumbledore, you name 'em, they were all born in the Witcher world, grew up there, and have no concept of England, Hogwarts, or any of the stuff from HP canon. For those of you who have read the Witcher books, I modeled the fic after the first two books in the Witcher series as a collection of short stories from Harry's life, as sort of a spiritual prequel to Geralt's adventures in the canon series. But, due to the fact that it's set so far back in the timeline, there isn't much interaction between Harry and the main cast of characters in the original Witcher series, because only a few of them are even alive at that point. And the characters Harry does interact with are mostly characters mentioned in the Witcher books, all of whom would be unfamiliar to people who have only played the Witcher games. And I think those are the vast majority of people outside of Poland who are familiar with The Witcher.

I've since realised this is all pretty much a non-starter with crossover readers, who aren't really looking for that kind of story. Even though the fic is definitely more Witcher-inspired than HP-inspired, people just look at it, see that the main characters from the Witcher series aren't in it, and decide that it's not really a crossover. It sucks, because I feel like it's the best fic I've written, and the reviews I have gotten are really positive, but the interest just isn't there, I suppose. I'm still working on it, because it's genuinely fun to write, but I've learned not to expect a lot of reviews or favourites for it.
