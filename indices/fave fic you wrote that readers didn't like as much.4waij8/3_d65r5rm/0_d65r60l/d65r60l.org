#+begin_quote
  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an interesting life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. AU featuring HP characters if they were born into the Witcher world.
