Huh, I guess I'm misinformed. Did anyone other than Sirius or Harry talk about them living together in cannon? Sirius makes the offer when he thinks they have Pettigrew but did Sirius actually have any claim to him? I never thought about it before but I doubt Lily or James really thought they were going to die. If they did, they probably thought Harry would be right behind them.
