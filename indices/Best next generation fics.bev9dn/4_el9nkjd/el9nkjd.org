linkffn(12383732) - not a happy read; aside from dark magic, sexuality, and violence you find in many Harry Potter fanfics, its amount of incest and child abuse is noteworthy.

linkffn(10139126) - lots of it is focused on romance, but neither it is romance-centric nor smut-centric. Neat world-building. I remember glorification of hazing, but my memory might not be the best. Not only is it complete, it also has a sequel.
