I have to recommend linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity). It's top-notch fiction, the kind which you desperately re-read several times once you've finished. It's complete and stand-alone, though there is some chance of a sequel eventually. It's not Cursed Child compliant, but that's not exactly a bad thing.

Inverarity also wrote linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and its sequels, with book 5 coming out soon this year. The characters are all OCs and the setting is America, but it's a lot better than JKR's worldbuilding for America. There's even a subreddit for it.
