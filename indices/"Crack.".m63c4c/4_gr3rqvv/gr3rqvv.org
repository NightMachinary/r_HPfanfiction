The biggest problem with crack cocaine is that racists use its existence as an excuse to hurt people of color. But that's not a problem with crack, it's a problem with racists. If it weren't this, they'd find another excuse. Racists would survive a nuclear war, just so there would be someone being a bigoted dick in the irradiated wasteland that followed. The fuckers are like evil cockroaches. You can't get rid of them by doing something as easy as avoiding a few words and phrases when titling fanfics.

Compared to the hydrochloride salt (i.e., powder cocaine) taken orally, freebase ("crack") cocaine by inhalation has way faster kinetics, which makes it a somewhat greater addiction risk. In reference to the kinetics difference between crack and powder cocaine, "crack" is a decent description for some of these stories, because they do tend to pack a lot more humor into less reading time. All we need to make the similarity perfect is to have a group of bigoted, violent people attack the people who like crackfics for no good reason.
