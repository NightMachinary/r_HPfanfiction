When people use the term “crack fic,” they are not thinking about crack cocaine, and this fic type is not tied to racism. It's a specific type of fanfiction that goes beyond humorous into the realm of absurdity. I'm not sure how the term for this type of fic originated per se, but this is what people use it for. I think you're trying to create an issue where one doesn't actually exist, that being of crack fics being related to crack cocaine and then to racism.
