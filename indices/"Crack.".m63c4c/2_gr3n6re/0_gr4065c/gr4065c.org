In regards to the origin of the term crack fic here's a quote from TVtropes.

" Crack Fic is often considered the result of a challenge, either from someone outside the author or from the author him/herself: "This idea is completely unworkable, but I bet I can /make/ it work." The name stems from the notion that [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][the author must have been ingesting some illegal substance just to]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][/think up/]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs][the idea, let alone write it]].
