I have several ideas.

One in which Interpol, the EU and the NSA are aware of the political shifts in magical Britain and together with the Inquisition of the Vatican, seek to destroy the Death Eaters. The first chapter I have follows Mongsignore Giacomo Giacinto who meets his team of US-Army Magehunters, GSG-M agents and Dr. Wolfgang Thadd√§us Poratschek (a half-goblin blacksmith and specialist in the field of anti-mage weaponry and armory). The closer it gets to the battle of Hogwarts, the more the story gets influenced by these special muggles. In the end, the battle of hogwarts is more of a full front offensive including several Armed Forces as well as organisations such as the Templers and the Freemasons.

The other circles around, Freyja, a seer-girl that gets in the same class as Harry Potters firstborn, James Sirius. Shes a bit on the shy side since her abilities make her a bit quirky in the eyes of others. She can smell souls, touch strings of fate and hear the whispers of what could be and what could've been. James Sirius, curious and kind as his parents, befriends her. Its more a romance thing, but the underlying premise is that Hogwarts opened up to all magical kin who're willing to attend (one of the many reactions, maybe even overreactions, after the war). Meaning that the school in addition to humans, becomes home to centaurs, goblins, elves, vampires,... sparking some interesting conflicts to write about.

My last idea that is somewhat noteworthy is about Aurelius Lander, a former student of the Macchu Picchu Academy of Magery (you might've noticed by now that I like OC). He gets an invitation to study at the Valhalla University of Magics and Shamanism (think MIT of the wizarding world). As an outstanding student of the fine art of Demonology and Mythology and a capable summoner himself, he dreams of seeing earth from the perspective of the moon. It is said that from there you could see all planes of existence that surround the earth. To achieve his goal he begins to study magical engineering. A few months into his studies he comes to a roadblock. He is about to give up his hopes of ever flying/apparating/flooing to the moon when a professor introduces him to another prodigy of this time. A powerful witch that exceeds her peers in knowlenge about both Arithmancy and Standard Wand Supported Manipulation Magic. Her name, Hermione Granger. (FYI: Standard Wand Supported Manipulation Magic, or SWSMM, spoken Swasumm, is the term I gave the stuff they teach at Hogwarts).

Unfortunatly, none of these stories exceeds 10 chapters since I do have to work and learn a lot for my master degree. However, I do hope to finish at least one in the next 2 years.
