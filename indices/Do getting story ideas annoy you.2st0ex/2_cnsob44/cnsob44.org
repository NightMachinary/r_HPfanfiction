yeah i have get an idea everytime i read/watch something interesting

Right now i want to write

- A HP/SG1 Similar to Isis' Bane but more about family and less about how powerful harry can get. got this after Reading Isis' Bane
- A Story where harry meet an weird girl when he is 8, she ends up being muggleborn and quite powerful (think Tom Riddle when he was young) and end up bonding because they are both considered freaks latter the girl turns into something like a dark lord and harry briefly joins her side (mirroring Dumbledore and Grindelwald) Somehow Haruhi Suzumiya inspired this story
- A fic where canon harry becomes Female but instead of focusing on who to pair him with, focus on how people treat women diferently and how the mind of male interacts with the body of a female. after reading Boku Girl and Balance Policy (NSFW/NSFL!!!)
- An Stargate Fanfic where humanity became advanced rapidly (to a level similar to the Humans in EVE Online) and how the Goa'uld get rolfstomped by them. I Am an eve player.

plus a few original stories i have in mind
