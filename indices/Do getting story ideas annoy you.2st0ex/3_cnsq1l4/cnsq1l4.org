I think what annoys me most is getting really good ideas for things that will only work as a series, but only having inspiration for one or two chapters. I put out as much as I want to, but it seems like the story's not done, and people comment begging for the next chapter, and even though I feel done with the story I crank out another 10 chapters to end it properly and appease my readers, and feel ashamed of the poor quality.

Also a lot of my stories tend to have patterns (ie. One normal chapter, one flashback, one normal chapter) and I get frustrated because I've written 10 flashbacks but only have ideas for 6 chapters or something. At the moment I'm writing a series of short stories based around potions; One chapter gives the recipe for the potion, and the next is a one shot based around the Hogwarts students' escapades surrounding that potion. I haven't released it yet, but plan to release the potion recipe a few days before the short story as a teaser/hint at what's to come. I got really excited and wrote heaps of potion recipes, but only have ideas for 3 stories, it's really frustrating that so much of my work might go to waste if I can't think up more story ideas.
