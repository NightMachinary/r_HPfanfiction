Grow Young With Me: linkffn(11111990)

The premise of this fic is that Ginny died sometime after Lily Luna was born, in a Quidditch match or training gone wrong (I don't remember exactly, if they explained it I must have skimmed over it).

Harry gets depressed, starts visiting a Muggle coffeeshop often to just get away from the Wizarding World. One of the waitresses takes an interest. Slow-burn.

EDIT: Got corrected on something - the fic does mention the exact circumstances of Ginny's death.
