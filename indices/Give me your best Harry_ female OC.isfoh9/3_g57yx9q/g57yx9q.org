The only other Female Muggle OC fic I know is Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss. A sister (I think?) of Piers Polkiss gets mildly obsessed with Harry.

There are two Magical Female OC's that I know as well.

Madley in Love is the story of a tax woman meeting post-war Hermit Harry and getting to know him.

Black Bond is the other, though I haven't yet read that because it's over a million words long and I haven't had the mindset/time to obsess over a fic for a full week. The female OC is a daughter of Sirius, IIRC.
