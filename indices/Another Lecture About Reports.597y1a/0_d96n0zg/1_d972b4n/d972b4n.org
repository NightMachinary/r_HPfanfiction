How ... the fjord are you getting reports for this thread?

I mean, it's an admin thread asking people to not be trigger-happy morons about reporting, reporting this thread is just asking to be gutted with a rusty knife (and no, I am not threatening anyone, just commenting on how stupid an action that is).

Edit: changed “admit” to “admin”; I have no idea where this typo came from the first time.
