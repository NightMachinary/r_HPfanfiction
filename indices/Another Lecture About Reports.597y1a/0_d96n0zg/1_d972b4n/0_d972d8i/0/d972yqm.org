I would call them “obnoxious arseholes” instead when they do that, but I guess I'm just a bit jaded.

That said, this kind of behaviour is just sad. The only thing they are proving by doing that is that they do not really have lives worth anything (because if they had, they wouldn't need to get entertainment out of /that/).
