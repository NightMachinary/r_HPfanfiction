Probably at least several a week, more if there's a thread that's particularly controversial. Recently someone was reporting every single post [[/u/laserthrasher1]] made for a while.

The majority of reports I get are either frivolous or borderline. It's rare that someone reports something that I think I really need to do something about, and even then it's usually just a warning to be more civil.
