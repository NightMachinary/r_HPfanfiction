Well, I can get the thing with that particular user, as he'd shown himself to be quite arrogant and disrespectful when it suits his fancy, at times using his age as an excuse (which is really bad and no more respectful towards those slighted), and some subreddits have rules against blatant disrespect; as such, it may or may not be possible that whoever did it simply didn't check the rules and reported for that kind of degenerate behaviour. I can get it even more considering how resistant that user was to actually correcting his ways and how eager to blame those around him.

That said, some of his posts were actually fairly neutral or even positive in some way, so reporting every single one is a shitty thing to do.
