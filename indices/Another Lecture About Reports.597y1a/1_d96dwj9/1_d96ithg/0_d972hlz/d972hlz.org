Even if it is taken out of context, I have to say I had no problems taking that post of yours as what you now wrote it was, without knowledge of the rest of that thread (so with no more context, really), and as someone who fairly likes the cliché that is female Harry. Because yes, switching a character's sex just for the sake of making it a “no homo” thing is, on its own, not a very good thing.

And with that in mind, I can say that the ones who reported you are overreacting ... chipmunks, really.
