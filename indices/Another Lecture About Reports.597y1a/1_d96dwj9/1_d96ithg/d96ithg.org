Hey, I'm OP of the posted comment, and a few things here were explained more specifically further down the thread. I don't have a problem with fem!Harry generally, it's the use of it to get out of writing an m/m pairing specifically that bothers me, 'lol I like this pairing but ewww the gays so he's a girl now.' Which I see...rather frequently on certain sites, and in one of my favourite pairings.

EDIT: Some of this was originally clarified further down the thread. As a single post, this is taken a bit out of context, so I wanted to add that in here as well, since people are commenting on the actual comment here.
