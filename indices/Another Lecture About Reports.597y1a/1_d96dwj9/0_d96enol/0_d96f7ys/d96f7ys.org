Yeah. The fem-Harry thing is just... weak, in a way? While there is no moral difference between male and female, the different societal expectations and whatnot can make for interesting possibilities of character interaction and avenues of action not seen in canon.

Those middle three points s/he made (No Pure Genre, Snape Apologetics, Character Flatness) are very good, and things I wish more people would think on.
