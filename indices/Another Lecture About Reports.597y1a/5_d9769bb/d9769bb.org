One of the problems is that nobody really understands what the report button does. Most people are unclear on the difference between mods and admins. But even when they know there's a difference, they seem to think the report button brings the post/comment to the attention of the admins, as well as the mods. So people who report all of one users posts want that user "shadowbanned" not just from one sub, but the rest of Reddit, too. They seem to think that there's an automated system that might even handle this, if only a user gets enough reports. Understandable, as Facebook and Twitter kind of sort of work this way. They also don't really understand the difference between "shadowbanned" and "banned", and don't seem to get just how easy it is to get around a Reddit ban. I hope Reddit steps up, at some point, with a lot more user education; it'd make things easier for everyone.
