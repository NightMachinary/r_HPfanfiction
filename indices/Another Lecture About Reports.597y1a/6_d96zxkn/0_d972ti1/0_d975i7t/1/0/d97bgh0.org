Maybe they are, but in this particular case I have to say it's the wrong answer as the question of his was about my actions.

Why the other answer has a positive score might be because of what you wrote, though, as people are usually a bit less likely to downvote a +2 or more comment than they are to do the same with a 0 or negative score one, so that one point from an acquaintance rather than a negative one from a stranger can be worth much.
