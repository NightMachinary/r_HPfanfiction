It's simple: For one, his reply was to a comment rather than to the main post, and if the one he'd replied to is fine with it then I will not get onto his case any more than I have with giving his comment my opinion via the rating system. For two, he hasn't done the same thing you have, which you have done because “oh, woe is me, everyone gangs up on me” when it's at least partially something that's happened because of your attitude, and right now you are showing that /this/ did not change in the slightest.

Age in not an excuse for not behaving yourself, and neither is anything else when you are told by others to change your behaviour, which you were told enough times that it's gotten boring by now. If you really want to play the game of “oh, let's never learn because everything is others' fault” then suit yourself, but if you do that you will soon do the same thing again and again and after some time you will piss off someone who has the power to annoy you back.

Also, since we already seem to be going the opposite of being cordial, I will add that you edited your post after I'd seen it, which is signified by the asterisk added to your post; in such a situation, unless the other person has been told to await an edit that you are going to make, the correct response it to take the edit back and make a reply out of it, rather than go “read the part that I added”.
