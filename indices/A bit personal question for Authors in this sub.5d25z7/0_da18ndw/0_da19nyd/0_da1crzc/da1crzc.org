Yeah. I mean, I knew, just based on the LF posts and what gets requested a lot. But seeing the results of the survey really reinforced for me that this sub has a very common set of interests, and my writing is not of those interests.

That said, my tumblr followers seem to like my stuff, and I've got decent feedback on ao3 so I'm probably doing just fine. But it doesn't always seem worth it to bring it up here. The last thing I need is people whining at me for not writing Harry centric fic or whatever.
