I don't use the same username here that I do elsewhere because I like that degree of separation. Sometimes I do self-plug, but I don't like to do that too often as it seems rather conceited -- which it's not, it's just that what I write is sometimes one of few examples I know of that answer a particular infrequent request and I know no one else will suggest it if I dont . . .

OP, if you're interested in what someone says, reply to their post and ask for a link. Simples.
