Those nicknames annoy me because 1) they are overused. Adults dont call kids by their nickname everytime they talk to them. Or at least normally functioning adults dont. And 2) because they are unrealistic. They could come up with a far better nicknames than pup or cub, plus do you really see remus calling harry anything other than harry? And the whole pronglet thing implies that harry is just a mini version of his father. Or that they see him as a mini version of his dad.
