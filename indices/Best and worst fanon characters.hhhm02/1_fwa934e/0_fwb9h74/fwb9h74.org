The cub and pup things annoy me; but they annoy me for different reasons.

Cub annoys the /shit/ out of me. Remus's arguably most defining characteristic is the shame and fear he feels about being a werewolf. Why in the name of Dumbledore's purple underpants would he give Harry a nickname that links to, and validates, his wolf status? It's one of the most OOC things I've ever seen and yet it's universally accepted in most fanons.

Pup annoys me less than cub, because Sirius is more comfortable with the fact he can become a dog than Remus is about the fact he becomes a wolf. BUT. Sirius does not base his whole personality around the fact he can turn into a dog. He doesn't seem to think about it, other than when he needs or wants to use his animagus form. He doesn't see himself as a dog. He's a human wizard. I also think /Harry/ means more to him than "small child of dog man therefore puppy".

I think the fanon nickname of "Pronglet" or "mini-Prongs" is more realistic, because that's giving them all a connection to James via the relationship they are developing. And Harry loves being compared to his dad, and Sirus (and to a lesser extent, Remus) love reminiscing about James.
