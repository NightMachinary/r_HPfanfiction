Ugghhh I absolutely HATE nicknames such as prongslet, pup or cub ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜  I mean, why the fandom use them? Do people really understand Sirius' pshyche? Sirius isn't a happy man, he's quite depressed and moody. He loves Harry, though.

I think people like too much what the marauders are so they think the marauder Sirius is Harry's Sirius
