I have to disagree on Sirius being written well in fanon. I think people write him way more happier and carefree and, as you say, fun than he really was. From what we do see of his teenage years he was surly and moody back then, and he was certainly troubled in regards to his family. I also don't see where he is particularly energetic in canon? I also find fanon often has him being very sickly sweet and calling Harry cub/pup/prongslet a lot which I just... don't think fits Sirius or many men that grew up in 1970s Britain.
