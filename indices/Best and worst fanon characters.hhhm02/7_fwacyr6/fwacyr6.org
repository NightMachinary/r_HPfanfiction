My favourite fanon characters are Lucius (in slytherin!Harry fics, the actual master politician), Tonks and Sirius

My least favourite fanon characters are, in that exact order, Remus, Luna (I'm-so-random-and-quirky) and, with a huge gap between her and the rest, Daphne Greengrass. I don't even have words to explain how much I hate that character. Like I've genuinely dropped fics when she was brought in as a side character.
