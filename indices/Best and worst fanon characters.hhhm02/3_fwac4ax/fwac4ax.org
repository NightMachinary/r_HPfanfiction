i usually struggle to find fics where Remus is pretty close to canon. I guess you have more freedom if you write about his teenage years, but still. I will never believe he was all confident and dashing the moment he came to that school. His characterisation is usually awful in my opinion. Sirius in canon is also very moody and hauty. He wasn't a nice person even as a teen. Fanon wants him to be. And the only thing he seemed to care about were pranks, the only person he showed consideration to was James. Fanon Sirius is far more charming than what we see of him in canon. Unless he's hiding his charm.
