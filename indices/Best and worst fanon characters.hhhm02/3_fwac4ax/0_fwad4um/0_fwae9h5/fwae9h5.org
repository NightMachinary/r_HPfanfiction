I can't say I read enough fics to be an expert on the characterisations of these two, but if this is another way they are written, I might continue avoiding new fics. Sirius and Remus are both complex characters, and we get only glimpses of their different character traits, so I guess that's why people fail at this. And the way they write Remus's werewolf condition still is one of the most horrible and nonsensical things I ever read.
