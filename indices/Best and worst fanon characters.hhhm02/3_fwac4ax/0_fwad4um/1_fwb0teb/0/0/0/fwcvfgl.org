It's hard to pick the worst as they're generally pretty similar, but I think it was in an independant!Harry fic where he was moping about being a werewolf every single time he appeared. The "Harry I'm a monster" sort of moping. Refusing aid, refusing jobs, just sorta moping without any real purpose to it.
