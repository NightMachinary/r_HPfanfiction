Far as I know, Barb Purdom, or B. L. Purdom as she's known as on some sites, has not written anything outside the HP fandom... or if she has, it's under a different name.

Her current main project is "QUANTUM HARRY, THE PODCAST" which is a podcast version of her book "Quantum Harry: A Unified Theory of the Potterverse." Haven't actually listened to the podcast, but you can find it [[http://quantumharry.blogspot.no][here]] if you're interested.
