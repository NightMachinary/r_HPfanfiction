I can't share the whole document, most of the notes are personal to keep track of things that are useful to me in categorising fic. It's not likely to be helpful to you for me to list stories that are WBWL vs searching this very subreddit for the very regularly requested WBWL recommendations.

Some of the ones you have just listed like The Hardships of Family and Silence is Silver are not ones I have read, or I read prior to the spreadsheet and I have forgotten them. Others are only on the list because they are SO BAD I need to remind myself not to start reading them again as they pop up on recommendation lists.
