Ah, just give me the whole list, I can go through them one by one. I might be mixing up two stories, the way that these plotlines are all so similar. The Hardships of Family is very close, it has the cake thing and a bit about photos, but no breakdown of Lily because of the hours she spent staring at the photos. Maybe I just mixed two stories together in my mind. Silence is Silver has the St.Mungo's thing. Could have sworn there was one story that had them both though.
