For fics focused on their romance, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861?view_adult=true][half awake and almost there]] and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24745156/chapters/59824753][mind the gap]] by Annerb, linkao3(8941561;24745156), are excellent.

For fics featuring them as a couple and in a major role, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is the best. This is however not a Muggle AU, but a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though.
