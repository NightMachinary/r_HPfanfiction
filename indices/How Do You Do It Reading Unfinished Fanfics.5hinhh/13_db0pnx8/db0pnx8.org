What's the point of a finished fic over an unfinished one? You know they're going to defeat Voldemort and live happily ever after 99% of the time. I'd personally take a fic with good writing and some new ideas and interesting situations and emotions over a mediocre finished fic, or even over a good finished fic with a bad or sad ending.
