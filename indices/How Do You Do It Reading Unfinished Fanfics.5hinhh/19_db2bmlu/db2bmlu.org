Don't start reading uncompleted fics in the first place for starters. To me, a terrible fic with an ending is still better than a good fic that just dangles on, without an end because at least for the shitty fic, there's some closure. You can put it aside and forget it, whereas with a good but unfinished fic, the "what-if" question of unrealised potential can be agonising and i just do not want to deal with that.

Really, it's true that 90% of fics are crap, but even so, considering that Harry Potter has like hundreds of thousands of fics spread across dozen of sites, there must be still hundreds or thousands of solid, completed fics out there. Worse, come to worse, read one-shots, because really they cut down on the exposition a lot and leave you just reading the character's feelings.

Yet, let's say you are a masochist and you love getting the metaphorical cockblock. The most important thing then is to check that at least the author updates regularly. See their bios, check their fic to see if the author's notes give some indication of an update schedule. Look at the status of their other fics to see their habits if they have any. Sometimes the best indication of a completed fic is the author having done so before. If you see the author having multiple fics, but only one or no completed indicators between them, then you might need to be wary that the author probably has a lot of ideas but is prone to abandoning them regularly.

Maybe the author is more private or doesnt want to write long-ass author notes, so you dont get any dates. What then? First thing i check is the last updated date. Dont expect any new updates for one if the fic hasnt been touched this year. I mostly avoid these fics unless the premise is extra compelling, otherwise i go on to the next step.

Then, i check the date published and the number of chapters. Do some basic math to see the average periods between chapters posted. If you see a 10 chapter fic for example, just updated last week, but was first published June 2007, you know this guy has issues putting his ideas down to words. Generally, a good update period is about 20 chapters per year, 12-15 if the story is really addictive. Give the author abour 2 weeks between updates to account for the fact that fanfic-writing is a hobby. That said an author that updates weakly like Starfox5 or White Squirrel are the best people and you know you will get a story every week on the dot. Philosophize is another author who has recently completed a trilogy of a Fem!harry/Hermione series and her profile is nothing but completed fics with an author-note that she updates twice a week, which is quite frankly insane and she deserves more views and like for her work ethic

Lastly of course is fic length. It's best to get some meat when starting a fic. It sucks stumbling upon an interesting premise in the summary, only to discover upon later reading the author's only got 3 chapters, 8000 words that have just barely diverged from canon yet you can see the potential direction where the author is taking the fic. It bums me out whenever i start such fics and it ends so abruptly. Also if the fic starts Year one when Harry wants to be badass and punch the Dursleys or something, i better get at least a 100 k of content that has covered the first year or so. I frankly wouldnt start HPMOR today because even Rational!Harry doesn't sound like that when he's only 11 years old
