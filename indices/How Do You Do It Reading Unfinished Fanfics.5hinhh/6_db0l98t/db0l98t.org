I prefer complete stories too, but in the past few months it's bothered me less and less, to the point where I'm quite good with reading unfinished fics, as the enjoyment I get from them isn't diminished by not having an end. [[/u/Lane_Anasazi][u/Lane_Anasazi]] put it beautifully into words.

The strange thing is, nowadays, I much prefer abandoned fics to WIPs. At least these ones I know that this is as much as I get, well, it isn't complete so move on. WIPs give me issues, especially the good ones.
