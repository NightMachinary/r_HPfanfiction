I have a pretty good memory, that certainly helps. Another thing is with fanfiction your working with familiar characters so even if I don't remember the details you can guess based in the characters.

If a particularly complicated story updates or a story has been on a particularly long hiatus I usually just see it as an excuse to reread the story.
