I'm with you here, 100%. Too many times I followed a story to have it end up abandoned or not updated for so long that I completely forgot what was going on in the story. Now I check that a story is complete before I even start to read. If someone recs a WIP and it looks good, I mark it to read later and check back to see if it's done from time to time but I won't read it until it's done.
