So, here's the sad truth: most fics suck. There was once a day where I had no filter and I could read pretty much anything all the way through without caring, as long as it was HP words. But still, it got tiring reading the same retread ideas over and over, magical cores, ice queen, inheritance, same shit over and over just with a different title. So, it takes a really good story to actually hold my attention, Chances are, even if a story is complete, it's going to have to be really good for me to even finish it. So, the fact that a story is unfinished to me doesn't matter, since by raw statistics alone, I'm unlikely to make it far enough for it to matter.
