What do you consider "active"? Or I suppose what's the best way to know if a story is active? On FF, it only says the date of the most recent update, but I've never found anything about when the chapters were published, so even if someone was updated this past November, we don't know if it was after a 2 year break or not. I know that this is completely on the author's own time and its unreasonable to ask for a consistent schedule, but I've read some good stories and it irks me to find out that they're unfinished.
