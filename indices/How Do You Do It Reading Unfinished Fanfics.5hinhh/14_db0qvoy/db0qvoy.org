Personally, I'd rather read an unfinished fic than a 200k monster of a rambling mess (which I consider most 200k+ fics to be). For me, it's about quality. It is indeed frustrating to really love a story and then have it cut off without an ending, but does that change the fact that I really enjoyed what was there? If I limited myself to only completed fics, I wouldn't have much of anything to read.
