Pick a story length that works for you. If it gets finished, great. If it doesn't, you get to see a good amount of the story and situation. That's what I do now. The unfinished fics that really disappoint me are 1-5 awesome chapters setting up an interesting idea with absolutely no follow through. Reading 20-30 chapters can bring you deep into a good story. Imagination fills up the rest. Plus, there are some fics that should end but the author drags it on past making sense. In that case, you make some point your headfanon ending, and it's like a complete story.
