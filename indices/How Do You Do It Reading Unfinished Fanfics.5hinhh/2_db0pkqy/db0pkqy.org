People can't write endings. You'll read a lot of completed fics and before long you'll probably find that the best bit is around the middle somewhere, and that the endings are rushed/poorly planned/dull/over simple or just bad. Then you start to read fics that are great but don't have endings and realise you still get plenty of enjoyment to make it worth your while.
