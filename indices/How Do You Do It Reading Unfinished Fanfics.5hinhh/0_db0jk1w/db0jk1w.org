I suppose it's about what you're in it for. I've long since scratched my itch to see Harry and his friends in certain specific situations, to see JKR's world stretched to its limits. At this point, as a reader, I'm in it for good writing, for that feeling of immersion, for the sense that I'm in capible hands and being told a good story.

I'd compare it to, say, listening to a song I love. You don't need to hear the whole song to get a sense of its style, its soul. It would be great to hear the complete song, but there's just so much enjoyment to be had in individual beats and moments. A song doesn't need to end to sweep you up, to make you feel something, to make you think something.

I'd absolutely love it if every fic I enjoyed were finished, but I'd never not read something that looked interesting and/or well-written just because it doesn't have an ending.
