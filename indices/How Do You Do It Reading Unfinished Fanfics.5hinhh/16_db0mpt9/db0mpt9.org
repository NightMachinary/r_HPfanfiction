I'm usually in the same boat, so I go after finished or established stories. The last one is harder to identify, but last update date together with number of words per year usually gives me a good idea of what to expect. A fic that has under 100k words per year will probably be to slow for me (or point to greater non posting periods or hiatus from the author).

I also skim A/N fir the 3 newest chapters. Any mention of "I'm back" or similar gets the fic put on a "maybe later" list that I can come back to after 2-3 months to see how many new chapters were written, to avoid the typical one chapter post and then disappears again.
