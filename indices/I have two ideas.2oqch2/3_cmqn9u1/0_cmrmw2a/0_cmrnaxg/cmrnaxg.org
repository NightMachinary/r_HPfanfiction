Never really liked that tack. Dumbledore's decisions may have been suboptimal in places, but they were mostly justifiable, even rational. (For example, training Harry from birth to be a killing machine would not have helped him defeat Voldemort; it would have made it so that he could not.)

You don't give a reason for Harry's disappearance, but the most plausible one given what you wrote is that Voldemort had gotten to him the moment he turned 17 and lost his mother's protection, because that would be the most logical thing for Voldemort to do. How would Harry even survive, without a wand or any training? (Unless, he is actually dead. Then, I guess it's up to the others to find the horcruxes and discorporate Voldemort one last time.)
