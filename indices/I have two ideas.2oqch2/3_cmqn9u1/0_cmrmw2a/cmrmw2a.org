it's definitely a Manipulative!Dumbledore situation. He doesn't see Harry in Idea 2 as anything more than some sadly necessary cannon fodder. He's a little sorry he has to do it, but it's for "the greater good."

I was fortunate enough to read HP as an adult and thought some of Dumble's choices were strange. Reading fanfic has only reinforced the idea that he is not really a force for good. At best he's a force for grey.
