I've wanted a good story with Diary!Tom ever since Black Comedy brought up the idea. As for who picks it up, a Slytherin wouldn't work, but someone in Hufflepuff might. Maybe Susan, only because I'd also like to see a fic where Amelia goes batshit crazy and/or super saiyan on Dumbledore/Voldemort after something happens to Susan. Though, as you mentioned, Sally-Anne Perks or Lockhart would be a good scapegoat as well

Over all they're pretty neat ideas.
