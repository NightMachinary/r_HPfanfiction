That's probably what he meant by having Ginny lose the diary, only for someone else to pick it up.

For what it's worth, OP, you might have an easier time convincing readers to invest in Idea 2, though you would really have to give both divergences some deep thought.

With Idea 1, why would Ginny lose the diary, and when? If you do it earlier, say in Diagon Alley, then anyone could pick it up. If you wait until Hogwarts, then Ginny might have already grown attached to Tom.

As for the second idea, the Dursleys were shown to be pretty helpless when it came to stopping him from going to Hogwarts, but having the Order look for a older Harry does sound like it would be more popular. Mostly because of the Indy!Harry vibe, especially since you'll be writing him as a little more sarcastic than canon.

As for ships, shippers will scream for H/Hr in Idea 2, most likely. There's no real reason not to keep it canon, though, should you wish to.
