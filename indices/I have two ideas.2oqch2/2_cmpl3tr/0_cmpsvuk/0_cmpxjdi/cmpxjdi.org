I've come up with three scenarios for why Ginny doesn't have the diary at the end of CoS:

Scenario 1: Ginny drops it somewhere accidentally and it's picked up by someone else. Maybe this could explain what happened to Sally-Ann Perks. The diary finds whoever it is more willing to go along with it's plans to unleash the basilisk.

Scenario 2: Ginny is caught writing in it during class when she's supposed to be doing something practical and it's confiscated. I can't think of any teacher that would do that other than Snape or Lockhart (because he's upset she's not paying attention to him). I'm not totally satisfied with this one, but it gets it out of her hands.

Scenario 3: Lucius fails to get it into her cauldron in Diagon Alley, so he gives it to Draco and tells him to slip it to her. Draco starts writing in it and the diary finds him easy to manipulate. Draco dies at the end. I kind of like that because I hate Draco and it would really impact Lucius. He'd work even harder to get rid of Dumbledore from the school and have more ammo to do it with.

I'm thinking that most of the story until Cauldron Voldy is reborn would be from Tom M. Riddle's POV as he's finding out what happened to his other self and recruiting a new set of Death Eaters. The old ones, like Lucius, wouldn't take him that seriously because he's a 16 year old and while he's powerful they've got a lot more experience. So he's going to have to find others that are sympathetic to his cause.

That's about as far as I got thinking about this one.

Idea 2 is kind of less formed. I thought that they'd find Harry in the first chapter, but I kind of like the idea of having a longer search now that you say something about it. In my head there are a lot more divergences with this one. Ginny is the only Gryffindor on the team. Hermione was a Ravenclaw in school, Neville was in Hufflepuff, and Daphne in Slytherin. They work well because they're mixed and their strengths complement each other. I don't think the Dursleys would have any real problem keeping Harry from going to Hogwarts. It was brushed over pretty easily in canon, but they are his guardians and get to decide what happens to him until he reaches adulthood (I assume that's 18 in the UK). Dumbles said he needs to go, they said no, they argue about it but he decides it's their decision. Ultimately, he only wants Harry as a sacrificial lamb anyway, so getting him trained up as a wizard isn't really a priority for him.
