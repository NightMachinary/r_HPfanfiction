Another idea is that the diary works and Tom Riddle comes back to life, but stays in the school, he can then perhaps kill and impersonate a teacher each year?

Idea 2 has been done, though is a Snape/Harry fic. I quite enjoyed it, nonetheless ;) - I forget the name though, Harry is a submissive type and Snape has seen him before in a BDSM club or something.
