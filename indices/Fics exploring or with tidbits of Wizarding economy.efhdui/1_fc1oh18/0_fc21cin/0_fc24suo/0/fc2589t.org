It might be in the way it was built and then expanded? Maybe it was a normal-ish house, and then over years or generations they added on to it a piece at a time.

Draco's comment on meeting Ron suggest the Weasleys have a history of large families.

One thing that is certainly odd is that a few of the expanded tents together, or expansion charms in each of the rooms, could give to a bigger living space without the ramshackle appearance.

I wonder if JKR had the expansion charms idea before Harry went to the Burrow. Oh! Didn't she later say that Charms wear out after a while? That would certainly answer my thought... if the family got lazy about renewing them and just wanted something permanent, or I guess it is normal in “old” countries to seek that permanence in housing.
