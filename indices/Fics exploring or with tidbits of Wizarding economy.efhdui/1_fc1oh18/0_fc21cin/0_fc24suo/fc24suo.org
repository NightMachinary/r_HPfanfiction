IIRC the Burrow gives the best example of houses seeming to be limited. I think it was described as being obviously held together with magic. That it was all sorts of different pieces stacked on top and next to each other.

If houses weren't limited why couldn't the Burrow have 8+ rooms while still looking "normal"?
