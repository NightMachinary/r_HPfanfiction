I always took wizard money in the HP universe to be deliberately nonsensical, more a concept of money than anything fixed to any meaningful value. That's why 1000 galleons could be a massive amount of money sufficient to act as seed money for a business, while 700 can be about the cost of a vacation to Egypt for a family of 6, and 10 is a stadium price for a pair of magic binoculars. No single value makes sense in all cases.
