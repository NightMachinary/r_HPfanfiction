Voldemort and some Death Eaters could throw around killing curses with the same effort as casting a stinging hex because they where all deranged, murderous psychopaths. To properly cast the AK you not only have to have an extremely strong will, but also have a /desire/ to cast it, a *need* for that person to be dead, you have to have 0 empathy otherwise it simply won't work.

So outside of fighting Death Eaters remnants and the occasional murderer post-Voldemort, 99% of people, even Aurors won't see a killing curse in their lifetime, let alone have to worry about people tricking them with copy-cat spells.
