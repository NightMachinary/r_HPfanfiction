It always strikes me that while it has a lot of magic that is lethal at concealment, tracking, mental manipulation and sabotage/assassination, in direct combat the Wizarding World has very little in the way of squad-or-larger-scale combat tactics. Most battles boil down to one on one or two on one (or for exceptional combatants, three on one) duels that mostly amount to throwing curses and hexes at the other guy while trying to dodge or block what they send at you. There doesn't seem to be any sort of real unit-level cohesion or tactics. Even in a bigger battle, like Hogwarts, its pretty much the same on a bigger scale, with the addition of an opening bombardment at range to take down the enemy's defensive spells.

It makes a certain sense, I guess- their population is too small for large scale warfare to be a common occurance, and their magic and society are both geared more toward cloak and dagger than open battle, and its a traditionalist society who's main weapon (the wand) has fundamentally not changed in hundreds or thousands of years. But innovations like this could be as deadly (on a smaller scale) as the machine gun and poison gas were to European armies that hadn't learned much since Napoleon.

Also think about working as a squad, rather than individual duelists- one guy shields or transfigures barriers, a couple others lay down suppressing fire, a couple others try to flank, while another throws area-effect curses or animates statues or something from the rear.
