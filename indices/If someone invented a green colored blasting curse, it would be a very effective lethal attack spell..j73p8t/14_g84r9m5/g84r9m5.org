I honestly think, realistically, magic fights would be over in like 15 seconds. You can't dodge forever you know, and there's so many spells, teleportation, hell for all I know you can clone yourself and make your enemies outnumbered. It's like those fights in movies, if your killer has a knife and he's standing close to you and you don't have anything to defend yourself with, you're dead (unless you know martial arts or something). There won't be a fight that lasts 15 mins like in the movies, they just stab you and you die..

I'm sorry, I forgot what I was trying to say oof
