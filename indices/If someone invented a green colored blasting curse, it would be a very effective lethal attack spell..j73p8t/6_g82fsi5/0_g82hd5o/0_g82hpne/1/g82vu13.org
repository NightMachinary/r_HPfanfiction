I could've sworn that in book 6 when they were learning to cast silently there were issues with casting "subvocally" or something, basically like murmuring or silently mouthing the incantation, which didn't really count as true silent casting and students were being disciplined for it.

Course, I could easily be mixing up a fanfic idea given how common that is and the wiki didn't seem to have anything on this concept so yeah...
