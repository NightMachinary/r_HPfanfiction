Ah, so I'd guess the term "sub-vocal casting" is from a fanfic (and a google found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6238824/1/The-Sorting-Hat-s-Stand][this]] which I think I read once upon a time), kinda like "wards" being used instead of "protective enchantments" in fanfics (course those are also buffed to heck and back compared to canon barely doing jack outside of stopping apparition and siege mode but whatev lol).
