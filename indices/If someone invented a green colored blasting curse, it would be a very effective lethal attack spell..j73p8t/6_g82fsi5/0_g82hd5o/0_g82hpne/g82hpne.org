That might work. I'm not super well versed on the, ah, extensive canon that JKR has put out but I have always had the feeling that since Avada (and maybe spells in general?) are fueled by intent that screaming kind of comes along with it. Or maybe that's because battles are crazy and humans yell when stressed.

I'm pretty sure in GoF we have a calm Avada used on a spider by fake Moody, so who knows.
