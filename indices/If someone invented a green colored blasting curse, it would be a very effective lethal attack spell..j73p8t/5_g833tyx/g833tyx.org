The thing with Unforgivable Curses is that until the rise of Voldemort they were not really used. They seem to us, the readers, as something done on a daily basis because many of the book scenes focus on instances where they are used. Furthermore, as we directly see from the battle of DoM (despite only Harry and the Prophecy being of interest, other than Bellatrix, no Death Eater fights to kill), the battle of the seven Potters (the only kill is done by Voldemort despite the Order being outnumbered at least 3 to 1) and the battle of Hogwarts (the casualty number is way less than you'd expect for an army of children fighting experienced dark wizards, giants, dementors and acromantulas), the Death Eaters themselves do not seem too eager to throw killing curses.

Also there are other green flashed hexes and jinxes such as Ron's slug vomiting one.

That's why I think most people that did not actively fight in Voldemort's wars would not even associate a green lighting with the killing curse. Or at least not in the heat of the battle when you need to think really fast.
