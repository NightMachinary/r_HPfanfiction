Very interesting idea, but if I ever wrote fic, I don't think I'd do it. Too many possibilities. I'd like to think my Fanon is that optical effects of spells happens mostly because of their magical components. I.e. a lot of really dark charms or stuff to do with death is coloured greenish, while a lot of normal curses are on a sunset spectrum, i.e. yellow, orange, red, blue, purple.

It'd be very interesting in a fic with my fanon because duels would have less ambiguity. See an orange spell heading for you? you don't know what it is, but because it's orange in colour, it's probably a schoolyard spell, so you can probably reverse it with a finite, or a higher level finite-like spell.

Interesting idea though, it'd be a big bruh moment if that happened. Imagine you think you're just about to take a simple Stupefy, but then your entrails explode out of you.
