When JKR named them "Unspeakables". You don't label a group like that unless they have the oomph to back it up.

Making them the CIA/Final Defense of the Magical world in addition to research just makes sense.

Because only researching time, love, and the veil of death does not warrant all of the funding they clearly have.
