Also a good idea, but depending on what the rules for spellcrafting are that might be significantly more difficult.

While there's many ways to kill people - and many ways to cause things to blow up - as far as we know Avada Kedavra is unique in several ways.

In the spellcrafting rules I'm using, it'd be relatively easy to create new blasting curses that blow things up in new ways but very difficult (like Nobel prize level) to modify or reverse-engineer the killing curse.
