Besides Arithmancer there is also HPMOR, which is nerdier imho, but does more violence to canon so it's polarizing here. See hpmor.com or [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]]. It doesn't talk much about spellcrafting per se, but it has considerable reverse engineering of magic. Actual creation of new spells is described as very dangerous, so the most powerful wizards are the ones who have collected secret ancient lore. It actually describes the exact way that the killing curse works.
