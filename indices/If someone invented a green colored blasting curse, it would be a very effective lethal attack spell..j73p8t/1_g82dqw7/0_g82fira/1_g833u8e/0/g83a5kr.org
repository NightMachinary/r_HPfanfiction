[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][The Arithmancer]] by White_Squirrel does stuff like this. White_Squirrel's stuff is generally very well developed (their Accidental Animagus Verse is my favorite) but The Arithmancer is basically an AU where Hermione instead of being a bookworm is a Math Genius who tests early into Arithmancy and becomes a spellcrafter.
