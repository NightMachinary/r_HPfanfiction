As a software developer the concept of reverse engineering spells is insanely cool to me. Can you recommend any HP fan fics / other fiction that explores a scientific approach to spell crafting? Brandon Sanderson has some fun magic systems but I haven't seen “magic as engineering” explored from off the top of my head.
