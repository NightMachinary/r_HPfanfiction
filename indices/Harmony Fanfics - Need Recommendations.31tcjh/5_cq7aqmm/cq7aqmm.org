This is a relatively new and very promising one, with interesting worldbuilding:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][/Patron/ by Starfox5]]: In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

Other fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] are also Harmony, but I've found his treatment of the canon setting to be downright hostile, so when he writes in what he sees as the canonverse, it often comes off as bashy, in a way that /Patron/, which he views as a heavy AU, does not.
