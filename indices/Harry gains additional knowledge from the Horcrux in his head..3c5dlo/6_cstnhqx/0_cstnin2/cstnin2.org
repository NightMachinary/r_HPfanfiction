  When Regina becomes curious about the two notebooks constantly tucked under the Sheriff's arm, she vows to discover their contents. Doing so, however, leads to a much deeper discovery-the discovery of a side of Emma Swan she had never even known existed; a haunted past, a complexity, a talent, and a beauty unlike anything she had ever expected to uncover. Rated M for content.
