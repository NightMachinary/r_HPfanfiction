I remember reading one recently where Harry and Dumbledore manage to destroy the Horcrux in Harry by having Harry absorb it. Harry becomes a mix of old Harry and Voldemort to become a new, yet similar person.

I thought it was in my recent Alerts but I am having trouble so I will post it when I can find it. If it rings any bells for anyone but they aren't sure if it is the one I am talking about, I also remember Harry joking and calling the process the Harry-Dumbledore Bridge.
