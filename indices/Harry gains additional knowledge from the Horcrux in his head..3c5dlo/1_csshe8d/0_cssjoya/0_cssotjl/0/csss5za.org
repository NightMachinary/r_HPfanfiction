I completely agree, I enjoyed the premise of the story and I greatly enjoyed the first 30 chapters but I had to stop around chapter 60 or so. Pretty much nothing happened for the last 20 chapters and it felt like the writer didn't actually know where he/she wanted to take the story so they were just stalling until they figured it out.
