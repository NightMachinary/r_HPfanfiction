  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Days later he awakens, magic flaring uncontrollably, his soul seemingly still in one piece. But is it? With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.
