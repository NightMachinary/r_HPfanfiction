[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium][Moratorium]] is a fem Harry story wherein the horcrux plays a fairly pivotal role. Definitely one of my top five favourite fanfics.

Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore.
