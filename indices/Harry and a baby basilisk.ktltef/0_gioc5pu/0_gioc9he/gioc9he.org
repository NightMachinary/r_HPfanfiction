  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.
