  I feel like you're misunderstanding Ginny's quote at the funeral. I don't believe she is referring to happiness in the sense of “hunting Voldemort makes Harry happy,” it's more of “Harry cannot be happy until Voldemort is gone.”

Yes, exactly. Ginny gets exactly what Dumbledore got. That, prophecy or no prophecy, Harry will not be happy /sitting back and leaving it to others./

It's personal with Harry and Voldemort. Neither can live while the other survives, not because the prophecy says so, but because of the burning hatred they feel for each other. Harry wouldn't be able to not try, with everything he has, to end this, to destroy the person who took everything from him before his life could even begin.

Ginny gets that. She gets that there's no point wanting him to not, there's no point crying and weeping and emotionally blackmailing him, because this is his /cause./ She absolutely doesn't think "hmm, what would make Harry happy? I know. Murder! He wants to go off and do a big ol' murder!" She thinks "he cannot rest until Voldemort is gone for good. He won't be happy in a world where Voldemort lives and he has to constantly look over his shoulder. I'm going to be really mature now, tell him I understand, and then I'm going to cry as far away from him as possible."

  What we needed instead of the epilogue we got was one where it was just Harry and Ginny talking about what transpired between them and where to go next. Just to fully flesh out the relationship between them, how they changed over the year(s), and what now that they actually can be happy (eventually).

Yes. She's not a Mary Sue, she just suffered as a character from being an Extra Elevated To Love Interest in books 5&6, and then barely being included in book 7 until the end chapters. Obviously that can't be helped as the books are from Harry's perspective, but absolutely, an epilogue maybe with Harry and Ginny talking to each other and their kids about how they rebuilt everything (metaphor rebuilt, not a brick by brick account of how Hogwarts got fixed!) which could also explain how their relationship progressed would have been so much better.
