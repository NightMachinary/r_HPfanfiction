I feel like you're misunderstanding Ginny's quote at the funeral. I don't believe she is referring to happiness in the sense of “hunting Voldemort makes Harry happy,” it's more of “Harry cannot be happy until Voldemort is gone.” And he tells her as such during the funeral, when he says to imagine how he would feel if it was hers. Even though he never confided the specifics of the prophecy to Ginny (as far as I can recall) she understood what it was that he had to do.

Ultimately this is incredibly well-written, and I do agree that Ginny could have used more development. But I don't think she's the Mary Sue that people make her out to be. She just suffers from bad writing on Rowling's part and not being part of the main trio or a figure of prophecy. There's great nuggets of characterization in the books that offer a lot of promise that just never got developed.

What we needed instead of the epilogue we got was one where it was just Harry and Ginny talking about what transpired between them and where to go next. Just to fully flesh out the relationship between them, how they changed over the year(s), and what now that they actually can be happy (eventually).
