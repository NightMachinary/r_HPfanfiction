I am a Harry/Ginny shipper fanfic-wise for the most part, but I agree on the part that she needs better character-development for it to make sense.\\
Her canon journey isn't the best-written, and part of that is down to her complete absence in books 3 and 4 - her Book 5 characterization, while great, kind of comes out of nowhere.\\
And then Book 6 goes and undoes all the interesting parts of her characterization, turning her into a flat Mary Sue love interest.

That said, she still makes /some/ sense as a love-interest in the books - there are hints throughout of Harry paying attention to her, which is more than I can say for the movies where she's practically absent.
