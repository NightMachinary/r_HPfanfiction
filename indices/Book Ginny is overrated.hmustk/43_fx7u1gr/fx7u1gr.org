First of all I am a hinny shipper and this comment is quite long so please bare with me. I promise u wont regret reading it. Now back to the topic. I completely agree with the fact that ginny's character needs improvement and wasnt written well.

Now coming to the better characterization of cho. According to me Cho was written in detail because she was harry's first crush. Rowling had to go into great detail because it was the first time the readers were reading about harry's interest in girls. It was the first time he was acting like a proper hormonal teenager.

As for ginny's characterization. Rowling has written her so poorly (one of my all time dissapointments) that she had to fit in small details about her through that random hogsmeade shopkeeper and slughorn's comments.

Ginny's weakness or faults. She has a hella temper which was highlighted during numerous occasions. She says things she doesnt mean when she is angry, like during her confrontation with ron about dean behind the tapestry. She said that ron is jealous that he didnt get to kiss anyone which led to that whole lavender fiasco. She is stubborn af(department of ministries). Harry didnt go through that shy phase with her because they grew up together and knew each other all along.

She wasnt just waiting for harry the last year while sulking around. She was in the DA and gave it her all to help the students there. She never wavered to help people around though she was a 'blood traitor '. But i just dont see cho doing that. Harry needs someone who understands him and gives him space all the while being there for him. None of the other females did that INCLUDING hermoine. She doesnt cry all time like cho and is practical which helps harry. She is so much like harry when it comes to protecting their loved ones. She doesnt let harry's temper affect her like their discussion after sirius's death. In a sick/dark way she knows how it feels like to have voldy inside her head. She didnt step down when harry commanded her to not to come to department of ministries and the ROR during the war. This just shows that she is a strong woman.

As for her not being shown with any weaknesses. Isnt it obvious?. The chamber of secrets!!!. It practically destroyed her childhood which changed her. For gods sake, her whole character started with her getting possessed and almost killed by voldy so ofc she is going to be strong later on. So yeah thats all i got to say. Peace out(btw if any godly ppl have read until the end, I salute ur patience)
