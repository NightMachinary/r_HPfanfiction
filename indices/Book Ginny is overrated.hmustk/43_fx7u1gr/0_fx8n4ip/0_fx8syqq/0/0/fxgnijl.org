Oh no, u got me all wrong. I dont think her crying is something to be ashamed of. I am just comparing cho with ginny as the post is implying that ginny isnt compatible for harry. I am only saying ginny is better at handling her feelings. I mean ofc ppl have different ways to cope up. Here cho likes to put it all open and mourn while ginny deals with it more silently. Cho needs sympathy from ppl bcoz she feels loved when ppl coo over her (not a bad thing) while ginny doesnt like ppl knowing abt it. I was just comparing. Thats it
