Yes but harry himself lost many of his loved ones. I dont think he can handle the sobbing and everything. He is also not good at consoling people and isnt really smooth around her so their relationship will just not work out.

Anyways harry needs someone to bring him out of his guilt whenever people die bcoz of him. I dont think cho is upto that job when she has her own demons to fight. Cho cries her heart out and talks about it as much as she can while harry tries to get distracted i guess. They have different ways to cope up with their loss.

So yeah I think thats the reason they arent compatible. Dont get me wrong i dont think she is doing anything wrong by crying over cedric. I am just saying it will just add onto harry's guilt more and more. I could have done a better job at explaining this without sounding like a heartless bitch but...well it is 2:30 in the morning and i am like a goddamn zombie so excuse me....
