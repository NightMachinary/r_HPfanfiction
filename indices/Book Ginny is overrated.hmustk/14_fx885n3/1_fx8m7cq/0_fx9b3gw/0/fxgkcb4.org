I can only see it as bad writing because that statement can be interpreted in multiple ways. One way says that she doesnt like the actual harry potter who hates his fame and wants to be left alone, but the hero he doesnt want to be. The other is that she knows hes a reluctant hero. Either of those could be true. And we dont really have enough to go off of.
