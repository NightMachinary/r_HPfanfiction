Yes! Harry would absolutely, 100%, no questions asked, /rather/ be playing quidditch than tracking Voldemort and his horcruxes.

But that's exactly why he /must/ track Voldemort and his horcruxes. To create a world where one can indeed choose to do nothing but play quidditch without some bastard ruining your day by trying to kill you.

He has to finish it so his normal life can begin. That's what Ginny understands. That's what she means by this quote.
