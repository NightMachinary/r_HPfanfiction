  /“Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.”/

  Ginny seriously misunderstands Harry's motivation. She makes it sound like he's going to hunt Voldemort because this is what makes him happy in life. Well, it's not. Harry is a reluctant hero; if he had his druthers, he'd be living a quieter life. But Harry sees wrongs being committed in the world, and he feels compelled to stop them. That's very different from the swashbuckling adventurer Ginny seems to believe she's dating.

What? No, she's right. Harry can't be happy unless Voldemort gets taken down, and he wants to be the one who does it, as per his previous quote. She doesn't think that he'd /rather/ be doing that than anything else or even that he enjoys it, just that doing anything else would be an exercise in misery for him. That's the whole point of why the prophecy is bogus - "neither can live while the other survives," not because of fate, but because neither one can go on with their lives while the other one is living. Voldemort has to kill the one giving Britain hope, and Harry has to defeat the guy who hurt his family and threatens his friends.
