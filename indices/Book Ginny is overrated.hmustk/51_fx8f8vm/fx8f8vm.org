I am personally don't have a favorite ship but I absolutely hate Harry/Ron or Harry/Hermione. Their too much like siblings

I agree that Ginny is overrated. In a lot of fan fictions I hate how Hermione and Ginny are portrayed. Like seriously I started hating Hermione at some point until I rewatched the movies and realized absorbed in Fanon I was.

I. Never like Ginny much and agree with your points
