I feel like the argument that she's not very developed could be applied to most of the students aside from the golden trio, and maybe Draco and Neville.

She changes a bit, which is more than most of the side characters (she's not exactly more developed than the other Gryffindors, for example). Even Hermione doesn't get to develop too much in the series, in comparison to Ron. I think that's just an issue JK has with writing girls / women, for some reason. they never seem to have the depth or development that the boy / men characters do, unfortunately.

I suppose the issue is less that she's not too developed, and more that Harry is paired off with someone not very developed, which is obviously unusual for the protagonist of a children's series. I chalk that up mostly to JK not being too into writing romance, and also the desire to reflect Harry's parents, so it had to be Ginny (Lily, for example, has very little complexity compared to James, so that fits).

The dislike of her is bizarre, though. Probably stemming from a shipping thing. She's not necessarily the most complex, but she's one of my very favourite characters in the series.
