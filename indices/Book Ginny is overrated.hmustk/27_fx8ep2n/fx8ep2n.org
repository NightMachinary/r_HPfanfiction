This is what I've said about this before:

  To be fair, Book Ginny wasn't developed much at all either. I think there were so many opportunities with Ginny, to turn her into a fully fleshed character, but then I read HPB and DH and it just felt like JKR went: /"oh shit! totally forgot to give him a love interest... wait, here's a girl"./ She should have gotten more page time.

  Yeah, she spends time with them, but what I mean to say is we don't get to explore much of Ginny's personality. She's not constantly around like Ron and Hermione, so we don't get to know her through observing her, and we aren't told much about her as a person either. I firmly believe we should have gotten to know Ginny, not /just/ through her interactions with other people (though that is a huge part). I've said this before; I don't know if you've ever watched/heard "Hamilton", but this is the same problem I have with Eliza. We only ever get to see her in relation to Hamilton, and then at the end, she has a song in which she tells us how she told his story. A lot of that would have been more impactful if we knew more about her. But my biggest problem with the character of Ginny is that we don't see any of her flaws. We're told that Ginny and Harry have this deep, meaningful relationship, but we never get to see what makes the relationship meaningful, what's right with it, what's wrong with it, what they fight about, etc. Even if we know what Ginny's vibe is, we don't really know Ginny until we've experienced her flaws. She just comes off as a generic cool girl.

  EDIT: Also, I totally think she should have been with them for at least part of DH. But then I also think the Horcrux Hunt should have been much, much, /much/ longer, which, surprisingly, most people don't seem to like, so.
