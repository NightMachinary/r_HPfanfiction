And did any of them suffer consequences for those transgressions? Pretty sure Hermione should be in Azkaban for kidnapping an adult and magical assault on a fellow student for no reason beyond jealousy.....actually, that assault can count as worse due to what she did to Marietta Edgecombe as the scars were still visible a year later. Hell, even a detention not sanctioned by Umbridge.
