  Ginny was written to be absolutely flawless, because the author needed to constantly remind us that Harry eventually wanted her.

This is *blatantly wrong*. She's only /flawless/ in Harry's eyes, but to a neutral observer, some of her actions were aggressive, cruel, and mean. For example, she beat up Zach Smith twice for asking dumb questions and making stupid comments (not even insults). She mocked Fleur mercilessly behind her back. She brutally insulted Ron for his lack of 'love' experience. And these were only actions seen by Harry directly. But he actually like these!

I can't believe you fell for this "unreliable narrator" literary tool.

Every main character in the Books is flawed and have their nasty moments, and I prefer them over those bland Movie characters any time of the day. Do you want me to list Harry's and Hermione's transgressions?
