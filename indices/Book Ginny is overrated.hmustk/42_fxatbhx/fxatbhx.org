That's not what a fucking mary sue is. People constantly use that term to refer to powerful (or sometimes just) female characters, like you just did. I've never seen someone call Harry a mary sue, or Dumbledore, both of which exhibit much more bullshittery than this.

You're reaching and it shows. Frankly, the sexism in this fucking community is driving me up the wall. We get constant threads about how bad it is that Hermione's smart, or that Ginny isn't a subservient tradwife.

Y'all need a fucking vibe check.
