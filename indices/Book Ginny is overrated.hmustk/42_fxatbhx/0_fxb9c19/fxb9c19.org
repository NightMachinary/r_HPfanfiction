This forum is definitely an interesting read on how men think women/teenaged girls should act.

One thing I find puzzling in these sorts of threads is that it's acknowledged (by Hermione, I think) that Ginny grew up and got sick of waiting around for Harry so she does her own thing. Harry has quite a narrow view - I'd argue lots of teenage friendship groups do, so he doesn't see Ginny develop.

Yes, maybe it would have been cool if we'd consistently seen Ginny in the books, but teens change considerable in development. It would have been stranger if she hadn't had leaps in development with the amount of attention Harry gives to her.

Also, surely developing feelings seemingly out of nowhere for someone the hallmark of teen relationships? It seemed that way to me. But then again, as a teen the 'chest monster' sounded like a reasonable metaphor for crushing.
