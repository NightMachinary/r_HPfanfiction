I never understood why people were such die-hard Ginny fans, especially when they pointed out that book Ginny is so much more awesome and badass than movie Ginny. My internal reaction to that has always been like... really? did i read a different book? what was so overwhelmingly badass about Ginny in the books?

It's always made me uncomfortable that Harry and Ginny end up together. There's something Freudian in that energy, as if Harry is subconsciously marrying a Molly Weasley mother figure in Ginny. But that's just me.

The Changeling is the only fanfic that's made me genuinely excited with Ginny and I think it fixes all the complaints you've laid out. I made a post recently about my dissatisfaction with canon (I got roasted to no end) but one of my main points is that a lot of the time, our heroes aren't really pushed to change or overcome their own flaws. As you point out, so many of their instances of cruelty are laughed off or painted as badass and rarely are they ever challenged to see a different point of view. Which hey, I get it, there's lots of good reasons for that and you can excuse a whole lot with Harry's unreliable narrator argument, but fics like The Changeling really demonstrate how more complexity can be introduced into these stories without losing the plot or the wonder.
