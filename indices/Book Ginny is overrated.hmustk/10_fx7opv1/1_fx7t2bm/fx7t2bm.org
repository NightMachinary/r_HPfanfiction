I'm not saying that the OP is one. Let me be clear on this. I am in no way implying or insinuating that the OP is one.

But ever since the first-generation readers, there have been a lot, and I mean, A LOT of people who have chosen to make their life's aim to bash Ginny simply because she was Harry's love interest. I believe that so many of these people hero-worshiped Harry Potter - the character - so hard, and the arrival of a dapper Daniel Radcliffe on the scene made it ridiculously easy for them to construct all kinds of fantasies about poor ol' Harry Potter. They absolutely loathed a fictional red head girl because the author envisioned her to be his one true love.

As regards to the OP, he/she has a point that at times the character feels underwritten. indeed, for many people the first outright hint that Harry has the hots for Ginny is when that.. ah.. scaly monster erupts (yes, it is a poor choice of words by Joanne) in his chest. But Jo needed to give her hero a reason for living, and for most novelists writing YA fiction, that reason is plainly and simply a love interest. Ginny was there, and would do nicely enough whereas using Hermione would complicate matters. So Ginny it was. TBH, it feels Jo did it because it had become an issue at that point and Harry's love life was something fans were clamoring to read about.
