I agree she was underdeveloped and that has a lot to do with JKR not wanting to break the trio apart. The idea that she's overrated when most people dislike the character is something I cannot get on board with.

This has always bothered me because I always remember this scene:

  He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.

  “Fancy trying to find a compartment?”

  " I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,” said Ginny brightly. “See you later.”

  “Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school.

H/G was always planned as, I believe, she wrote the ending before the middle. There's an essay somewhere by a H/G shipper who points out the many times Harry notices Ginny over the course of the series. The H/G development is way too subtle, but it's not not there.
