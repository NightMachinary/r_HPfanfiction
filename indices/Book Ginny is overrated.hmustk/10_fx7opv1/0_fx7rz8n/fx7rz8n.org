  Ginny was often cruel and reacted with violence. Harry not acknowledging the flaws of a girl he likes doesn't mean she doesn't have them.

Being a Mary Sue doesn't mean you're perfect, though. It means that everyone /in the text/ sees you as perfect and you don't get called out for your BS. When does anyone ever tell Ginny that she's out of line? In HBP she becomes female James Potter, a jock who goes around Hogwarts cursing people who annoy her.
