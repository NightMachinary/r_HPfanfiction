I think the example of Harry being made seeker his first year after breaking the rules of no flying while Hooch was gone would be appropriate. As far as we know he was not given detention, and Im pretty sure if she wanted to show us that despite being rewarded he was still punished, she wouldve made sure that we knew Harry got detention after pulling that stunt.
