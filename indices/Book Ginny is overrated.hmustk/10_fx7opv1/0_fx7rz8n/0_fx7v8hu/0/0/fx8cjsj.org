The question was "when does anyone tell Ginny she's out of line?" I provided two moments where both her mother and professor told her she was out of line.

Mrs. Weasley not looking good where Fleur is concerned does not negate that she told Ginny to stop calling Fleur names. Nor does it negate that McGonagall yelled at her for crashing into the commentators box.

  I'd be surprised if Ginny got so much as one detention from that

Why would this be surprise when McGonagall hands out the most detentions?
