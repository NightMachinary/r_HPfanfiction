Mrs. Weasley is not at school, so she doesn't even see most of this behavior. And even in the Phlegm scene, none of the women come out looking good. Ginny and Hermione are all petty and jealous (calling Fleur stupid, making fun of her accent, immediately jumping on Harry when he doesn't join them, etc.). Mrs. Weasley is trashing Fleur behind her back and trying to break up Fleur and Bill by throwing poor Tonks into the mix.

And Professor McGonagall has a history of ignoring bullying (see: all of Gryffindor House turning on firstie Harry, the Marauders, GoF) and rewarding naughtiness as long as it gives her Quidditch team an advantage (Harry breaks the rules and gets to play Seeker; McG didn't even /ask/ why he'd done it). I'd be surprised if Ginny got so much as one detention from that.
