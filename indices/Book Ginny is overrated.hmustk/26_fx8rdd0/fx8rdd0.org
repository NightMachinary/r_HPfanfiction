Exactly!! She's nothing more than a Mary Sue that Harry is just /supposed/ to fall in love, I've believed this since ages and it is nice to see someone with a shared opinion.

There's not a single flaw that comes to mind when I think about her. The only thing that comes close is that she has a temper, but that is hardly a flaw. Her fiery temper has never landed her in trouble as compared to Ron's insecurities, Harry's recklessness and insatiable desire for truth, and Hermione's narrow-mindedness and believing that she alone has the right answer - these things bore actual consequences for the Trio. If anything, it is used as a cute character quirk. She could also be mean at times, especially humouring herself by making fun of someone (Phlegm comes to mind), but again, it is used as a quirk rather than something that bears actual consequence for her.

After CoS, she was shunned in the background with barely any noteworthy action and then she appeared out of nowhere in HBP.

In Half-Blood Prince, information about Ginny was constantly bombarded to the readers. She is beautiful (even Slytherins like Blaise Zabini thinks so), she is popular (everyone loves her), she is magically powerful (even Fred and George are scared of her Bat-Bogey Hex while Slughorn is impressed by it). That Ginny and the Ginny before HBP are hardly the same.

She cannot do anything wrong and suddenly. She's hardly ever called out for her actions.

I would've preferred if she had lost her self-esteem after the debacle of Diary, and she went to being a quiet, reserved and shy girl, and the rest of the books had her gaining her fire back and trying to be more outgoing and engaging. It would've been much better if the Diary laid some long-term trauma for her that took a lot of time to fight out, and it would've made for an inspiring story unlike the one we actually got.
