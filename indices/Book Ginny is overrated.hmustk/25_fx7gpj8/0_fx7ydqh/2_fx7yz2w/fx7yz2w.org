Earned in the sense that, from a narrative perspective, it came out of left field. Although I'm not definitely not the biggest Harmony shipper I'm the world, it makes sense to me how so many of those shippers felt let down by the final two books. There was a tremendous amount of buildup to Harry and Hermione's relationship; not romantically necessarily, but at least they /had/ a relationship. Ginny has very very few moments on page with Harry. And the one thing they both could have bonded over (being possessed by Voldemort) is never addressed except for a one-off comment. In literature, moments need to feel earned. They need to feel organic. It's why so many people had a problem with the final season of Game of Thrones. The moments were not earned. They weren't organic. I feel the same way about Ginny. Her role as the love of Harry's life is not developed over the course of the series. It just sort of happens.
