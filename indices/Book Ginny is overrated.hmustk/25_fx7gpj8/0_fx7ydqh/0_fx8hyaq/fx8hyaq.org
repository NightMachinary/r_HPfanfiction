I agree that saying Ginny didn't earn the relationship is fucked up, but [[/u/Flower_of_the_East][u/Flower_of_the_East]] said "it's not an earned relationship." I interpreted that the same way one would understand "it's not an earned climax": the author didn't give it enough buildup.

I don't think they meant that Ginny wasn't a well-rounded character, so she didn't deserve to be with Harry; I think they meant that Harry didn't feel anything romantic for her, and then suddenly he did. That's not putting the blame on Ginny, that's putting the blame on JKR.
