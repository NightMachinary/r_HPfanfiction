Exactly how do you /earn/ a relationship??

Edit for those who might have misunderstood: You don't /earn/ a relationship by being a well-rounded character in the narrator's eyes. Claiming that you have to /earn/ someone's affection or relationship IRL makes someone come off as a bit of an arse who places a value on someone else's attention. A bit nice guy-ish, if you ask me.
