Ginny always struck me, after she became a relevant character and not just some blushing girl, as an almost stereotypical “mean girl.” I never liked her and she seems to come out of nowhere in the narrative as Harry's crush. With Cho, at least she was mentioned in PoA as being very pretty and IIRC her looks were distracting to Harry in the Quidditch match. Then there's Harry's failed attempt to ask her to the Yule Ball in GoF, culminating with their failed date and all that tension in OotP. That's /three/ books of buildup for a /failed/ relationship!

With Ginny we are given zero indication that Harry feels anything other than friendship and familial (adoptive) attachment to her. Then, all of a sudden, CHEST MONSTER. It's not an earned relationship whatsoever.
