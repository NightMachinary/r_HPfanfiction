Should Harry should have ended up with Hermione? Maybe. I could see the argument either way.

I do think they were by far a better fit than Ron and Hermione. Ron was awful most of the time. Harry at least appreciated her and interacted with her in a meaningful way. Way more relationship development there than with Ginny.
