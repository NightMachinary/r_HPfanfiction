Yeah the switch from book 4 to book 5 was a total heel turn in personality. If I think back to elementary school - high school, I can't think of one person who was quiet and introverted who suddenly became one of the most popular kids in school. For most kids that i went to school with, their personality, grades, and friend groups stayed relatively the same throughout most of school except some kids stopped taking school as seriously.
