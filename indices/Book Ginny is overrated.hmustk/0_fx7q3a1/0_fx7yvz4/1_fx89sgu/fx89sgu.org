It happens, a lot. My former best friend was one of these people who did a complete 180 and became the most popular girl in school. The attention she got made us drift apart for a bit, and our friendship isn't the same it was before precisely because of that. I think it's plausible that Ginny had the same arc in high school. After all, Ginny had other friends than Harry and generally functioned in a different social circle, especially because she was a year younger. That applies more if her friends were already popular in her year and she just caught on. However, if we were given a general nudge throughout the course of the series towards her developing into that person, it would've been better.
