I explain the switch from book 4 to book 5 was Harry starting to actually notice her more. We see the wizarding world through Harry's eyes, and so it makes sense that he doesn't really pay much attention to Ginny until book 5 and then starts to see things about her that were already there, but he hadn't paid attention to yet.
