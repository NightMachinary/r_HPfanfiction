I'll admit I like Ginny because +I don't ship Harry with Hermione+ she's generally the type of character that attracts me. However, there are two things that really irk me about her character. Firstly and most frustratingly, Cho is character-assassinated and brushed aside when she's obviously feeling pretty crap about how Cedric has died and nobody bats an eyelash. She's a teenage girl that's suddenly going through quite possibly the first death she's ever experienced, and it's also close to her. Rowling dismisses her in the text as someone who's weepy and weak, and the fandom blindly follows that narrative.

Secondly, all of her awesome comes out of nowhere. First book: regular Harry Potter fangirl. Second book: possessed girl. Third book: ??? Fourth book: is Neville's date to the Yule Ball. Fifth book, she suddenly becomes awesome, and is the coolest girl at Hogwarts. It feels so fake and such rushed development, like Rowling suddenly thought 'who's Harry going to end up with?' and remembered that Ginny existed, and she can fit the Cho bill but 'awesome'. It probably didn't help that the text keeps pointing about through different characters how awesome she is every other chapter. Overall, it could've been a much more interesting relationship had Ginny actually had development. Hell, Harry/Luna is more organic than Harry/Ginny.
