  Even minor characters like Cho underwent some changes across the books.

This is just wrong. You spend most of this post pointing out how Ginny goes from one character and becomes another, quite different, character whilst also concluding there is no change!?

  Ginny started off as a fangirl who then enrolled into the school and got possessed. She was then saved and, well, what then? By year 5 she gave Harry a little scolding on knowing what it felt like to be possessed, she became a star Quidditch player who (plot conveniently) replaced Harry.

Ignoring the changes that you yourself are describing is... I don't know how to describe it.

Ginny is very far from flawless. We spend almost the entirety of HBP with basically only Harry actually caring about what Malfoy's up to. He's continually being told to let it go, basically. He doesn't and, yes, it turns out Harry's right (about Malfoy) but that doesn't make the reasoning he used right or the scepticism he received wrong. Ginny, in contrast, basically only knows that Harry nearly killed Malfoy and /still defends him/.

These are books written from Harry's perspective. Ginny doesn't get criticised for things like this because Harry either actively likes Ginny's takes or because he doesn't care about them at all. In contrast, he spends basically every interaction with Cho being confused about what's going on or in an earlier version of CHEST MONSTER.

(And to go back to the HBP Malfoy obsession... Harry spends most of the book unhappy with how unseriously people take Malfoy. And you wonder why pretty much the only person who doesn't comes off looking good?

And, yes, it's just one particular instance but it's representative of the way the Harry focussed viewpoint and moral lens in the book affects interpretation. Read, for example, The Pigman which is an alternating first person text with two narrators. It gives a very different lens on the book's plot to what we get with Harry in canon. I mean, [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hmzk46/if_you_had_the_choice_of_reading_hp_from_any/][there's a reason why you get posts like this wondering about different POVs.]])

  that she's dating some bloke named Harry, not Dudley Do-Right with a wand---she's going to be sorely disappointed.

As the sectumsempra incident shows, Ginny knows /exactly/ what actual Harry is like. Hell, you can even look at the way he casually forgets about the most traumatic thing Ginny's ever experienced...

Actually, let's talk about OOTP a bit more because I've seen quite a few people ITT talking about how it fits in with canon Hinny. It doesn't. OOTP is merely the first time Harry's really interacting with anyone outside of Ron and Hermione. There's a reason why we know so little about Daphne and the other Slytherin girls even though Harry spent six years in classes with them. In fact, if it weren't for the troll, it's quite conceivable Harry would barely know or care to know Hermione, too. He made one friend really early on and, probably due to having had no friends before this, was entirely happy with just that one friend and a bunch of casual acquaintances (several of whom he slept in the same room as). That we begin to see more of Ginny is no different to seeing more of Neville, Luna, Cho or, yes, the Twins (even though they'd previously been on the same Quidditch team as Harry).

So... now we go from no Ginny, basically, in books 3 and 4 and Hinny in 5 and 6, to no Ginny, basically, in books 3 and 4, to Ginny in book 5 and Hinny in book 6 (/because/ of the time interacting with her as a group member in OOTP and in the smaller social scene of the Burrow in HBP). And, unlike Cho, it means Ginny actually has an existence in the books beyond "object of Harry's affections" or, as Ginny was in CoS, "human macguffin".

Now, maybe there are other issues with Ginny. She's meant to be popular and I think there's some stuff that even Harry "spends years not noticing people who share classes with him" Potter notices, but I'm not sure that suits Ginny's experiences. Maybe it's part of the mean girl thing someone noted earlier (to Harry's *checks character's name* Aaron?) but even then. It seems to me that Ginny wouldn't bounce back just like so from CoS. I mean, it's not just her brothers but everyone that failed to notice what she was going through. She seems destined for being surly and aggressive, although we do get the latter and it is an era where "choosing sides" matters. But, then, we only see Harry's perspective and I cannot fail to emphasise this point enough... Harry barely cares about anyone other than Ron and Hermione. Whatever's happening offscreen could be pretty much anything.

I would similarly stick to fanfiction for good Hinny but I really don't think anyone holds Ginny up as one of the best characters in the series except insofar as she's a supporting role in the back end. It's hard to see her as being overrated, unless you mistake "movie Ginny sucks, book Ginny's much better".
