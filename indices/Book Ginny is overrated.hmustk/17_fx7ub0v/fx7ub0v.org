Didn't Ginny help lead the DA or the “anti-death eater” group of Hogwarts students in book seven while the trio were gone finding Horcruxes? And even attempted to steal the Sword of Gryffindor from Snape? So technically she wasn't just “waiting around for Harry to return”, she was fighting back and defying Snape and the Carrows.
