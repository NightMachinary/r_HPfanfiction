I think the Hermione stresses Harry out thing is over rated. Even in the Books Hermione regularly puts everything on the line for Harry: Book 1 she goes almost all the way with him. Book 2 Hermione damaged a book which is a big deal for her. Book 3 she bends time to help him. Book 4 she works hard to ensure he survives the first task. Book 5 she helps Harry feel confident enough to start the DADA and then the monstrosity that is book 6 happens and helps launch the Weasley Love Potion trope because Harry and Hermione act so out of character.
