At 17/18, they could well have been too awkward to approach having sex. I know plenty of people who hadn't had sex at that age. I first had sex at 17 and was the first of my group of friends, though I certainly knew of a few people in the school who'd had sex before then.

Sure, some people in the castle would have but the stats for having sex young aren't as high as people make out.

Also, not everyone wants to have casual sex. Especially when Hermione liked Ron so much.
