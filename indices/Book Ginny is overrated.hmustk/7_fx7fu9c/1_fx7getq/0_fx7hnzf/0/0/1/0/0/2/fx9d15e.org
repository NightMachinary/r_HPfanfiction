Have to disagree.

By the end the characters were older. Hence why it wouldn't make sense for a sex scene in previous books but would by then.

Plus they were hormonal teenagers and under stress alone in a tent for months. Both were never described as anything but attractive (even with puffy hair). There was definitely a connection there.

Nothing makes a sexual situation between them out of place. It actually would have made them more realistic and again it wouldn't have made sense beforehand but it would for older teens in that situation.

It isnt bad writing just because you dont like that type of thing. I think the only reason it wasnt in there was because of the age group the books were aimed toward. Had they been aimed older or even just less directly at children then the characters would have been more realistic.

Even before the end it would have been more realistic. You cannot tell me a castle full of hormonal teenagers all sleeping under the same roof never had anything going on.
