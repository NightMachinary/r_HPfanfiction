It wouldn't have been for 'no purpose than to satisfy a tiny minority of fans,' and would have fit the characters and tone just fine again if the books weren't written for children.

They whole lot of them were moody hormonal messes throughout the books falling in and out of crushes. It would have fit just fine if it wasnt for the intended target audience. So to put a full on sex scene at the end could have been out of place if not done perfectly right BUT a realistic sexual overtone sprinkled into the story would have been realistic and fit just fine with the mood swings and all the characters were constantly going through.
