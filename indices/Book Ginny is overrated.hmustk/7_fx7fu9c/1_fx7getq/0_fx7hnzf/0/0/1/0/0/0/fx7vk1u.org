Seeking human comfort in desperate times is a lot more believable than chaste pining comparable to the medieval ideal of chivalry (which we see Harry do in DH). There's a reason why military bordellos were a thing. And given that for a few months, Harry and Hermione were literally the only two people out in the field (the rest of the Order had their regular homes, a lot of them safe under the Fidelius), they would have no one else to turn to.
