Okay, but I can't stop seeing them as solely platonic friends, like the idea of them being together is odd, hell, her being with Ron feels odd because when I read the books I felt like they only felt platonic, familial love. Maybe it was bc I read the books at age 7 and didn't see the point of romance, but I feel like all of them should stay friends.
