  But Half-Blood Prince, she becomes the most hyped up human being in the history of time and space with a one liner every other sentence.

I think it's important to remember that the story is told from Harry's POV and he is a horny teenager at this point. Of course he is going to see Ginny as the greatest thing ever, with zero flaws. He's seeing her with his small head, not his large one.

That said, all character development we see is via Harry seeing and noticing that character development. It's why Arthur goes from the bumbling dad to the outright badass who survived a ministerial purge and has the political pull to sit in the Minister's box. /Harry's/ view of the character changed, and thus how the characters were presented in story changed as well.
