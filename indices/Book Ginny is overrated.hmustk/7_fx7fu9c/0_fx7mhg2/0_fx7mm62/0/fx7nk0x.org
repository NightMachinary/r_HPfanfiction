Well yes. Because they're two completely different people with two completely different outlooks on relationships. Harry sees relationships as very black or white: you're either amazing or you're not (look at how he view his father, for instance). Ron on the otherhand is used to seeing relationships as something more rocky-his entire homelife is filled with arguments but ultimately still loving each other in the end.

If the story was from Ron's POV it would be "Hermione is so annoying, bossy a know it all, she infuriates me...but gosh I love that insufferable know-it-all." Harry, on the other hand, approaches relationships much differently. Look at how many times he flips on either Ron or Hermione for a single slight, and then immediately flips back to them.

Edit: Also, look at how Ron sees /Lavender./
