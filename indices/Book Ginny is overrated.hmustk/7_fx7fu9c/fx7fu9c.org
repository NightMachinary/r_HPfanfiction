That's a whole lot of words and I agree with a whole lot of 'em

I think Ginny's fine in Order Of The Phoenix. She has her own personality and comes into her own relatively well. But Half-Blood Prince, she becomes the most hyped up human being in the history of time and space with a one liner every other sentence. I didn't mind them at first, but as I reread the book, I really started to grow tired of how much of a one liner factory she is at points.

It's one of the reason why I feel a Harry/Hermione romance would have been infinitely more satisfying. Because while people have their beliefs on if their personalities would work well and whatnot, at the very least, both characters felt like real people with an organic connection, which is vastly more interesting. And I've never felt that way about Harry/Ginny.
