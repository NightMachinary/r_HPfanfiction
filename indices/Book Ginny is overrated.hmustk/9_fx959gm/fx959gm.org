I'm late to the party, but I had to work today. So here goes.

#+begin_quote
  I believe the correct terminology to use in this case is 'Mary Sue'.
#+end_quote

That really isn't an accurate term to use, and even then, as a term, 'Mary Sue' has been used so often, that it's lost all nuance.

#+begin_quote
  (For those who are quick to exit an anti-Ginny answer, at least take the time to read my opinion below the bold text at the end).
#+end_quote

I'll grant you that. Our culture, especially these last few years, has demanded absolute adherence to pre-given positions, with no room for dissent or discussion.

I dislike where this leads us, so I will hear you out.

#+begin_quote
  The honest truth is that Ginny was one of the bigger Mary Sues across the series, and everything about her was written to merely end up with Harry.
#+end_quote

While I agree that Ginny was planned to be Harry's love interest from the start, I wouldn't dismiss her out of hand like this.

#+begin_quote
  Even minor characters like Cho underwent some changes across the books.
#+end_quote

Cho Chang makes for as good a foil for Ginny as any, so I agree that it's a worthy comparison.

#+begin_quote
  For example: she started as some random Quidditch player (in our eyes), then she became the apple of Harry's eye (figuratively speaking).
#+end_quote

I wouldn't necessarily call Cho "random." Even with her introduction, we learn that she's not actually that strong a flier. From Oliver Wood, we learn that she's been injured before, badly enough to risk missing matches.

We also learn that she flies a Comet 260, which is the worst-performing broom we ever see in a Quidditch Match.

And during the match itself, she keeps blocking Harry--to be fair, she doesn't stand a chance against a Firebolt, and it's nowhere near as dirty tactics as Malfoy, but it's also not particularly skilled.

#+begin_quote
  Then she lost her boyfriend followed by trying to make it up with Harry. She grieved like any normal teenager would but was mocked and turned into a caricature by the text. Why? Because I believe it was to show us that no girl could suit Harry... yet. (Only Ginny later on.)
#+end_quote

Her grief for Cedric is meant to be a contrast to Harry. I wouldn't call her a caricature though. Cho wears her heart on her sleeve. Harry bottles his emotions up.

#+begin_quote
  After this, they had a bad date and, later, it was Cho's own pal (Marietta) who betrayed the D.A. However, Cho stood her ground and stuck by Marietta even through the insults and hating.
#+end_quote

This betrayal nearly got Harry expelled, if not arrested. By proxy, it got Dumbledore driven from the school entirely. This allowed Umbridge to tighten her grip over the school even more.

And Cho herself likely risked expulsion--the entire list of DA members was discovered.

Harry is /well/ within his rights to be furious at Marietta, and Cho's defense of her /does/ trivialize the situation.

#+begin_quote
  By book 7, Cho probably realised how overbearing she was with Harry and tried to reconcile by wanting to take him to view the statue of Ravenclaw's diadem in her common room. But then Ginny blocked that by suggesting someone else.
#+end_quote

I have no real objection to this description.
