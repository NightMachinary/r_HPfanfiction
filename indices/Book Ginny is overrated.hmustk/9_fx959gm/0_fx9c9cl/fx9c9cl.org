The last point, about Ginny blocking Cho going with Harry. Well, yeah. What sixteen year old girl /wouldn't/ make a fuss about her sort-of-boyfriend wanting to go off with his ex girlfriend? That's a perfectly normal expression of teenage jealousy. It seems daft to the reader, because the reader has access to Harry's thoughts and knows Ginny has nothing to worry about on that front. But /Ginny/ doesn't know that, and teen girls are by their very nature jealous of other teen girls!
