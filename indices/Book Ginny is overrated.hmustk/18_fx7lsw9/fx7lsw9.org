I agree, but I still like the Hinny ship because I like the Romione ship, and if Hinny didn't happen, Romione most likely wouldn't have happened.

It would've made sense for Ginny to kill Nagini, but Harry /asked/ Neville to kill Nagini in case he and the rest of the Golden Trio died. Neville was fulfilling a request as well as defying Voldemort. Ginny could've defied Voldemort alongside Neville, though, and Neville could've still killed Nagini.

But yeah, I would've liked some more character development from her.
