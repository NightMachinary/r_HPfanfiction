I would agree with this. Luna I think /gets/ Harry in a way his other friends don't, because she is off-kilter enough that I think it short-circuits his defense mechanisms and so he lets himself be vulnerable around her in a way he doesn't even with Ron and Hermione (and probably rightfully so, as neither of them have dealt with loss at that point in the same way Harry and Luna have and are not really equipped/prepared to deal with Harry in the throes of it).

I think similarly that while Harry definitely doesn't /get/ Luna, and finds her odd, he is closer to her than any of their other friends are, and they have a lot of genuine affection for each other even if he never quite understands her in the same way she does him. At the beginning, the others mostly seem to tolerate her as Harry's weird, off-putting new friend, and while eventually they recognize her value, they never seem quite as close with her as Harry is (even Ginny, who's known her far longer). He's also willing to go to bat for her against her bullies at the end of OotP, even if she asks him not to.

I think this happens because we get to know Luna so well and what makes her tick, even by the end of book 5, and she gets some really good scenes with Harry. Ginny doesn't get either of those things (barring the nice moment in book 5 where she challenges him on the Voldemort possession thing), and I feel like Luna feels like more of a round character at the end of book 5 than Ginny does at the end of book 7, and one with more of an established relationship on the page. (That relationship certainly doesn't have to be romantic, though.)

It's not that what's there for Ginny is bad, entirely, or at least it could be good...it's just that there's not a ton there, especially for the love interest of the main character of a seven-book series who's been there since the beginning. Ginny should have had a larger role earlier, and have been developed more. A character introduced in book 5 of 7, and with a fairly small role in 6 and a small but key role in 7, shouldn't be more compelling.
