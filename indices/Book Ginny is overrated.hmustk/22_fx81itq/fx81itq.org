Lowkey the girl with the most on screen chemistry with harry is Luna, shes probably the only character in the series to actually make harry look inward on his actions and while harry sometimes thinks Luna is weird all of thier moments together have been them supporting eachother.

In the movies this is amplified like 10 fold with how much more lone wolf and confident movie harry acts, Luna is by and by the only character other than sirious (and maybe Hermione's during the sadder scenes of DH) to get to see Harry's more vulnerable side.

And plus out of all the characters in the series luna is the one that's shown the most doing her own thing separate to harry, because she very clearly lives a life outside of harry and harry respects that to some degree even if he sometimes thinks shes weird lol

Idk, I think an argument for cho or hermione for book harry over ginny can definetly be made, but when it comes to the movies I'd say that luna was pretty much the only person who he had actual chemistry with.
