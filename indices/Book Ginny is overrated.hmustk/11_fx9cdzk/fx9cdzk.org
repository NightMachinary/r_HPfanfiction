Sorry to clutter the thread, but I'd rather leave many comments that are somewhat concise rather than only one or two that get cut off.

#+begin_quote
  The author also had Ginny praised so many times by random folks for what reason, exactly? I recall a random Diagon Alley merchant saying Ginny's pretty, then there was a compliment from Slughorn later on, and even a Death Eater at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower said Ginny's 'pretty'.
#+end_quote

The "merchant" was a street vendor selling "medallions" that were to defend against Dementors, vampires and Inferi. He called Ginny a "little girl" who had "a pretty neck."

He was trying to manipulate Ginny and her parents. He was, frankly, a slime ball.

Slughorn thinks Ginny's got potential, but I don't remember him praising her looks.

And the Death Eater was an even bigger slime ball than the street vendor. He's trying to distract Ginny so that he can curse her. Because he's a bad guy.

Bad guys do bad things.

#+begin_quote
  Why stress that across the text?
#+end_quote

These are characters, and characters interact with one another.

#+begin_quote
  Because Ginny had to be accepted, even with her minimal character development, by us readers. She's just a generic 'fiery gal best friend's sister' type.
#+end_quote

Given that Harry has no family of his own to speak of, Ginny's more than generic. She's part of Ron's family and she accepts Harry into their group. This is a huge part of how Harry sees the world.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Weasley was written as the flawless, token reward for our hero.
#+end_quote

To describe Ginny as a "token reward" takes away her own agency.

#+begin_quote
  But she's goddamn lacking in the character development befitting of the main character's spouse-to-be.
#+end_quote

I don't deny that Ginny's got a considerably weaker arc than I would have liked, but I don't think it's worth swearing for.

#+begin_quote
  Nearly everything went her way, and she simply could not be faulted at all.
#+end_quote

Ginny was just as insecure about her family's financial situation as Ron, she struggled to find her place in Hogwarts, and she had a huge target on her back as a blood traitor.

#+begin_quote
  I speak the truth: Ginny was just a bit more than an object across the books, really. This is especially true when comparing her to someone like, say, Hermione Granger.
#+end_quote

Hermione was a far more present character than Ginny. To compare them really isn't fair.

#+begin_quote
  There was enough time and space in the plot for the author to have better shown us WHY Ginny was as good as implied.
#+end_quote

I actually think Rowling did a good job, all things considered, but I'm trying to see your side.

#+begin_quote
  Rowling wanted people to like Ginny and to recognize that she's the only girl for Harry, and so she hammered in the “Ginny is awesome” message in Half-Blood Prince without caring too much for realism or consequences. The fact that Ginny gets invited to Slug's Club for hexing another student is meant to showcase that Ginny is just so badass, she's too cool for rules.
#+end_quote

Slughorn is ambitious and cunning. He knows when to bend the rules and in so doing allow someone to prosper. But he does have lines he won't cross.

Ginny jinxed Zacharias Smith and she explains that he wouldn't stop badgering her about what happened at the Department of Mysteries.

Given that it's frankly none of his business what happened, and Smith had consistently shown a great disregard for others' feelings and abilities, and Ginny nearly died--and lost a family friend in the battle--she has the right to want to be left alone about it.

#+begin_quote
  Rowling considers that Ginny hexing people because she's annoyed with them or Hermione assaulting Ron with canaries is “badass” and “empowering”. Unthinking “girl power” mentality at its finest.
#+end_quote

While I greatly dislike the scene where Hermione injures Ron, it's quite a bit beyond what Ginny does--a temporary hex that will wear off and is more gross than hurtful is not in the same league as Hermione drawing blood.

#+begin_quote
  Now if we try looking at it from a Watsonian perspective...

  Harry. Quite simply, Harry.

  Harry is head over heels with Ginny, and he's a 16 years-old boy. When you're sixteen years old, clocking one to the guy that annoys you is one of the awesomest things ever, bonus points if you don't get punishment for it.
#+end_quote

That's a part of Harry's character, but it's not really an indictment of Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny has both Harry and Rowling on her side: Rowling makes Ginny's actions, dangerous as they may be, have no consequences, while Harry is crushing hard and thinks that everything Ginny does is awesome.
#+end_quote

These actions of Ginny's are not quite as bad as you imply, but Harry's admiration of her is not necessarily the same thing as the text itself condoning the actions.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a little less patience for Hermione's actions (especially when she's criticizing his use of the Half-Blood Prince's Potions manual) but Hermione doesn't get much in terms of consequences - aside from Harry being colder to her - because she has Rowling on her side.
#+end_quote

Whatever Hermione's flaws, she's actually got a /very/ good point that Harry copying unofficial instructions is extremely dangerous and doesn't actually help Harry understand the theory of Potions.

#+begin_quote
  And Rowling doesn't like to make her self-insert look bad.

  She unintentionally ends up doing so anyway, because she seems to think that a girl unleashing a flock of canaries at her best friend's face is okay behaviour, or that a girl attacking a man is completely fine: like I said, peak unthinking “girl power” mentality, “it's okay when it's a girl who does it”.
#+end_quote

While this double-standard is pervasive in nearly every aspect of media imaginable, I wouldn't say that Rowling herself condones it.

Ron holds a grudge against Hermione for some time because of the canary attack.

#+begin_quote
  Warning: Highly unpopular opinion incoming:

  Even Neville Longbottom, fricken NEVILLE got more character development than Ginny. I don't care about Neville or his sad parents backstory... we have enough of these in the plot. I would much, much, much rather swap some of Neville's development for Ginny.
#+end_quote

Neville is a hero among heroes. But I will hear your claim.

#+begin_quote
  Just imagine if it was Ginny who stepped up to berate Voldemort in the courtyard (what a conversation this would've been!).
#+end_quote

I actually agree that this would be interesting. Ginny was one of the first victims of the Second War with Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Just imagine if it was Ginny (Harry's future wife) who got the hat placed on her head which Voldemort tried to burn.

  Just imagine if it was Ginny who struck down Nagini while still thinking that Harry was dead! A furious Ginny would've been awesome to read about.
#+end_quote

This would be interesting, but I feel that it would only fuel arguments that Ginny is a Mary Sue.

#+begin_quote
  But no, it had to be ickle Neville Longbottom at that moment.
#+end_quote

While you have a point about Ginny, you're forgetting that Neville's defiance was in part a direct continuation for Harry. Harry asked Neville to finish the job, to kill the snake, for the sake of the war.

Neville did not know the full ramifications of this request, but he trusted Harry.

And this was the last time Harry talked to Neville.

Neville's actions were trying to fulfill his friend's final wish.

And it was indeed awesome.
