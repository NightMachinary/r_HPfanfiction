Are you me? I agree with everything you said. I mean, I remember back in the day when H/Hr forums were a thing and we were calling HBP Ginny "Ginny-Sue" for all of the reasons you mentioned. But of course, anyone else dismissed it as shippers being bitter.

I'd even started a tongue-in-cheek fanfic in which Ginny decides she's going to save the world with her "hard, blazing looks" and does things like shoot Bat-Bogey Hexes at the Longbottoms to heal them, but I never finished it. I just wasn't feeling the inspiration.
