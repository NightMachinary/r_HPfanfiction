Cho being in DH is a mistake from the off, because she was in the year above Harry - she should have graduated by then.

I don't really agree with your points, but they're well written.

Yes, Ginny started as a fangirl, but so did every single character. She was further intimidated by the fact he was older than her. What ten year old girl isn't going to be intimidated by a child star coming to stay at her house. The equivalent of Justin Bieber or Macaulay Culkin at the height of their fame.

There's a lot to address, so what I will just say is...

The criticism that Ginny is underdeveloped could be applied to a lot of characters. /Even Hermione/. There's a great retelling of the stories that I'll look out, but essentially it's a re-read that focuses on Hermione, and...in the actual canon text, she really isn't there a lot of the time. She's remembered as being /more/ impactful partly because of imagination and partly because of the movies, but the boys spend a /lot/ of the books without her, or when she is there, complaining about her.
