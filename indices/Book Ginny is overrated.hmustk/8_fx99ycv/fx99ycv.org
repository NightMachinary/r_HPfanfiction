I didn't want to risk running out of room, so I started a new comment:

  Now let's compare that to our hero's main girl of the series:

  Ginny started off as a fangirl who then enrolled into the school and got possessed. She was then saved and, well, what then? By year 5 she gave Harry a little scolding on knowing what it felt like to be possessed, she became a star Quidditch player who (plot conveniently) replaced Harry. Add insult to writing injury by having Ginny beat Cho in year 5, and the latter was said to be throwing tantrums.
#+end_quote

"Fangirl" is a little harsh. Ginny was ten years old.

And in the fifth book, Ginny actually is the best character to confront Harry over his fears, because she is actually the only one who lost complete control of her body.

Her status as a Quidditch player is not that surprising, given that several of her brothers are players.

And she isn't a "star" yet. She knows how to fly well, but she's not nearly as good as Harry.

She catches the Snitch twice, but only wins one match--Harry notes that she hesitated in the match against Hufflepuff.

  Ginny then became a hot chick in book 6 with exactly the same personality as her younger self: feisty and fiery. Oh, and she defeated Cho yet again which ended up winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup.
#+end_quote

She's grown more confident, and we've already established that Cho really isn't that good at Quidditch.

#+begin_quote
  By book 7, little had changed except that she waited for Harry to return in the end. Cue the epilogue and they were happily married thereafter.
#+end_quote

You missed the part of Ginny */leading the resistance against the Death Eaters./*

Between Cho and Ginny, I prefer even the background development of the former over the years.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny was written to be absolutely flawless, because the author needed to constantly remind us that Harry eventually wanted her. This whole 'chest monster' thing was also an absolute cringe to read as well.
#+end_quote

Ginny's not written to be flawless at all, but if Rowling foreshadows Harry's eventual feelings for her, then that's not actually a flaw.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing that Ginny did ended up being truly, if at all, punished. Not her vandalism of school property (Quidditch commentator's box in book 6), not her Hexing of a student, not her eating toffees with Harry in the library (book 5, Pince just chased them out... that's all. Fricken Pince didn't even follow up on students munching such messy foods over her books).
#+end_quote

McGonagall spoke harshly to her about the commentary box, but there really isn't a way to prove the damage was deliberate.

She hexed Zacharias Smith on the Hogwarts Express, which is before term started, and therefore Ginny couldn't actually be punished for it. Harry and his friends fight Malfoy several times on the train and there's never any punishment.

If you mean Slughorn, he's not exactly a paragon of rule-following, but Ginny didn't actually look that happy to be "included" in the Slug Club.

And seriously? You object to Ginny sneaking Harry a chocolate egg in the library? Sure, she could have waited till dinnertime, but she wanted to make Harry feel better.
