Rowling is just not great at writing romantic chemistry. Pretty much everyone had a partner appear AFTER everything ended.

Pretty much every YA novel I've ever read as a kid had that problem. If there wasn't an absolutely 100% clear, you can see it coming from a mile away, it's only a matter of time, love interest...it was pretty forced. Sort of like a closed loose end love interest, who has to be immediately seen as â€˜good enough for the hero.'

There is a major difference between a Mary Sue and an underdeveloped love interest.

If she wanted to actually invest in the romance at all Ginny would have become a more prominent character after book 2.
