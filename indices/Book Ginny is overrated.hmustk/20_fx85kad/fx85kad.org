I think you misunderstood the last Ginny quote.

#+begin_quote
  I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Ginny doesn't assert that Harry is happy hunting Voldemort. She asserts the he wouldn't be Happy if he didn't hunt him.

It's similar to saying "I knew it wouldn't rain because there are no clouds". That doesn't mean that if there were clouds, it would rain.

â€‹

If Harry doesn't hunt Voldemort then he can never be happy because he will always know that he could've hunted Voldemort and he could potentially have saved lifes, if he did. It's in his nature, and that nature is what Ginny is referring to when she says "That's why I like you so much".
