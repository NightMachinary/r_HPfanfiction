Yeah. Fanon has written some good Ginnys, but Ginny is not a good character in the book(not as in good/evil dichotomy, but high quality/low quality).

I don't mind stories that have Ginny with Harry, but frankly, it feels like the romance just comes out of nowhere in 6th year in the canon books. She's a bit part in the first book, a plot point in the second, and from then on, is more or less a non-entity(more or less just appearing collectively with the rest of the Weasleys) until /Order of the Phoenix/ where she talks to Harry about Voldemort and possession.

The thing is, IIRC, Rowling was actually planning on Harry ending up with Hermione, but ultimately changed her mind, but it was several books in, and she hadn't developed Ginny as a character at all, which lead to the rather jarring and sudden romance.

On a side note, I remember getting into a rather baffling argument with someone over /when/ exactly Harry became interested in Ginny(the other person saying he liked her since 3rd year), and I guess they must have mixed up canon with a fanfic they read, because the only character I can remember Harry expressing any romantic interest in at the time was Cho during a Quidditch match(apparently when she blocked him during the match, it was enough to give him butterflies in his stomach).
