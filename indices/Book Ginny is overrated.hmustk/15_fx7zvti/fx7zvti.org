Cho/Harry for sure got a better-paced relationship arc than Ginny/Harry.

Book 3: Harry notices Cho is pretty. Cho flirts a bit.

Book 4: Harry asks Cho out, gets rejected, but is left with the idea that Cho does like him.

Book 5: Cho tentatively pursues Harry while grieving for Cedric. Harry is (understandably) not emotionally equipped to deal with Cho's (understandable) guilt and depression. They date briefly and break up, partially as a result of their (understandable) complete loyalty to their respective best friends.

As opposed to...

Book 1: Ginny has a raging crush on Harry, to whom she has never spoken. Harry barely gives her a thought except to be embarrassed by her attention.

Book 2: Ginny has a raging crush on Harry, but is still too shy to speak to him. Harry barely gives her a thought until he needs to save her life... whereas he develops a friendship with Ron's other close-in-age siblings that nearly stands on its own apart from Ron. If Ron had evaporated, Harry still would have been Quidditch buddies with the twins, but would never have interacted with Ginny.

Book 3: Ginny continues to have a crush on Harry. Harry, if possible, notices her even less than ever.

Book 4: Ginny manages to open her mouth in Harry's presence but has no substantive interactions with him. She's still not on Harry's radar even when he's living with her family.

Book 5: Ginny is suddenly a Quidditch star. Manages a few substantive interactions with Harry about being possessed by Voldemort and breaking into Umbridge's office. When Ginny shows up to break into the Ministry at the book's climax, Harry still wishes someone else could have come in her place.

Book 6: Ginny is the hottest, most popular, best Quidditch player in the school and Harry has a dragon in his chest.

Book 7: Harry pines for Ginny while once again not interacting with her at all after the book begins in earnest.
