That was an interesting read, thank you. I find myself quite agreeing with you overall, but here some counterarguments for the devil's advocate:

- Ginny starts dating Harry quite late because she is young (although she dates boys before him but it wouldn't be 'correct' if her and Harry started dating 'too early', it's intended as a children book..). While she has some good action scenes when they are at the Burrow, she stays in Hogwarts a*nd the books say nothing about how they experienced this episode*, aside from the fact that it was obviously painful with all these death-eaters. *Thus her personality could not be deepened during the last books, which is a shame as she finally became a prominent character.*

- Hexing people and sending birds in their face was shown as brave b*ecause... the book was written ten or more years ago, and that was how girls were shown as 'strong and fiery' before.* *And despite Rowling's 'progressive' opinions* (don't get me started on the last twitter polemics, I don't have anything to say about that), s*he still has deep gendered bias that everyone had at that time because gender didn't matter as much as now, and while we now know that this 'girl power' mentality is overrated and not the best feminist vision, we can comprehend the fact that Rowling could not think differently at that time.* It's like this thing about fat-shaming, where Dudley is stupid AND fat, which makes him detestable all the more. Now she would proudly defend herself, but fat-shaming wasn't even a thing when she wrote the books. *Thus we cannot criticize her for internalized bias that now seem obvious to anyone.*

- *Now to this awfully idiotic line* ' Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much'. Yeah, that is not the most clever thing to say. But I don't think that is why she likes him anyway. She didn't know that when she was 11 and crushing hard on him: *I have trouble to think that an eleven-years-old girl might like a boy because he's famous.* His physical appearance and the fact that he was older than her, hanging with her older brother, is more likely to have played a role. And then Quidditch, etc etc...

Now I do agree with your overall argument, which is that Rowling did not give her enough personality and made her fantastic all of a sudden, especially based on physical criteria, which is the easiest but certainly not the most convincing way. As a fanfiction writer, I must acknowledge how pleasant it is not to be constraint by burdensome personality traits when I write about her, and I love to think about ways she could be 'fiery and strong' to give her more personality. That is for example the reason why I hate writing about characters such as Malfoy or Fred and George, because some of their personality traits are really annoying and yet you must use them if you want to stay true to the story.
