Thats the point, it was a fangirl crush,she didnt know him, she didnt know the real Harry Potter. A lot of celebrities have hordes of fangirls/boys and yet in person they are huge assholes.

With him saving her in book 2 then that wouldnt exacerbated the fangirl and also she wouldve hero worshipped him.

Is it possible she outgrew that? Yeah, but based on what we have, I dont know if she did or not, its inconclusive at best.
