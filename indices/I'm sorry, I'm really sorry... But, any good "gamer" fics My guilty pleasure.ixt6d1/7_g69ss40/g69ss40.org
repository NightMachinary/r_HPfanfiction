linkffn(13638854) a grown Harry dies and is transported to another universe with the gamer ability. The entity he met after he died tricked him by saying he can't go to the afterlife and must go to another dimension, which it said was a place where he wouldn't face any troubles at all. The reality of it was that universe was where most of the dangerous stuff gets sent to so its technically exponentially more dangerous than his home universe, hence the name the dumping grounds.
