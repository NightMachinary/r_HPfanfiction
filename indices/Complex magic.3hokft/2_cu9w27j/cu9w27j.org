I liked Kaleidoscope at first, but holy shit did it go downhill. Harry was overpowered as hell the whole time, but on top of that there's like a dozen train wrecks going on. I'd say it got unbearable just after that tournament and I only finished it because I was so far in. It starts to jam in Nasuverse magic which isn't horrible, but just derails so damn badly. And seriously whatever happened to Daphne and Hermoine was just weird.
