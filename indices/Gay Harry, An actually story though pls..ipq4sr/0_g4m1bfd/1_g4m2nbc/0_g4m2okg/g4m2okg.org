  Harry Potter travels back in time on behalf of the Order of the Phoenix to retrieve a thirteen-year-old Tom Riddle. When they arrive in the future, Harry and Tom must wait for an indeterminate period under sealed wards as the timeline rights itself in Tom's absence.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
