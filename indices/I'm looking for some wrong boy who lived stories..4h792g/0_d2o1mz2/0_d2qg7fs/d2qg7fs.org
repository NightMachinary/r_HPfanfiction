I always go in hoping that they'll be good, but they always manage to fail in some way. Usually because Harry becomes the ignored child (if the wbwl is his brother), Neville becomes some sort of narcissistic asshole, or it just devolves into some sort of angst-fest.

What I want to see is a fic where the bwl is Harry's brother, and Harry becomes a magical badass, not because he's out to prove something, but because he feels that he has to protect his brother from Voldemort.
