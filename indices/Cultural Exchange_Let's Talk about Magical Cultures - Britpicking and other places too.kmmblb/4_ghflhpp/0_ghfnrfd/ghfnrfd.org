Pavement is the word we use for the Pedestrian footpath that runs parallel to the road.You can also just call it the path. People will get what you mean. The surface of the road is called the ‘Tarmac' at least where I'm from (Glasgow, Scotland) because it was, at least historically made of Tarmacadam. Nowadays, any macadamised material is used as far as I know. It may not be actually Tarmac but it's still called that.

So for instance, if someone has a crash or other accident and is flung clear of the vehicle, and hits the road, we say they either ‘hit the tarmac' or they just ‘hit the road'. If at speed it can be ‘He hit the Tarmac at x mph and slid, fuckin' nothin' left o' him by the end o' it'.
