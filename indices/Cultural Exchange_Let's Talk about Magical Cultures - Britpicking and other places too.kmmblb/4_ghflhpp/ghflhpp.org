Can I ask about the word "pavement?"

I wanted to use the word "sidewalk," but I had a suspicion in the back of my mind that that's a North American word. Google told me that in British English, the word is "pavement." But to an American, "pavement" is the surface of the street (or any paved area).

In British English, does "pavement" only mean "the path beside the street on which people walk?" Is there another word for "surface of the street," or pavement in the American sense?

(I ended up completely rewriting that section of the story because I knew using the word "sidewalk" was wrong, but in my American mind "pavement" seemed to say the opposite of what I wanted to say. And I suspect it would have been a problem for my American readers too!)
