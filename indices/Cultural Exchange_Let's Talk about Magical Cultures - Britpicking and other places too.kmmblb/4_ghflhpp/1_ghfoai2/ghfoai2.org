Yep! Pavement = Sidewalk! Used exactly the same way - it's the paved side of the road that folks walk on. Interesting tidbit - sidewalk is actually the older term and you'll find it in Shakespeare and other similarly aged works. It was part of the language the traveled before the languages split to British English and American English!
