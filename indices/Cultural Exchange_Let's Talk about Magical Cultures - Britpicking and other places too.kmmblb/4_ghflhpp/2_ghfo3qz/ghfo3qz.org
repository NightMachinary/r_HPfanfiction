Pavement is indeed the British version of Sidewalk, yeah. Sidewalk is very American-sounding, even if it isn't American itself.

In terms of the 'surface of the street', it'd depend on the material. There's a lot more variety in what our roads are made of (since they've been built, rebuilt, removed, added to, and maintained in one form or another for centuries), so we have a lot more variety in how we refer to them. We might have cobbles (the floor of Diagon in the movies) or tarmac (the bitty-looking black sludge that most roads are lined with, but it's also used generally for most paved roads) or a few other things as well that I forget atm (I think 'slabs' or 'paving' for big paving stones was popular at one point, but I'm not sure if I'm imagining that or not). Hell, there are specific names for types of country roads as well. Also, the little glowy reflectors in the centre lines of bigger roads are called 'Cats Eyes'. Not sure what they might be called in the US (or if they even exist) but they're a thing here.

If you're saying it in a "Walk on the pavement, not in the street, you utter moron" sense, it'd definitely be pavement regardless of material, though I have heard some mothers in my northern town yelling "Stay at the side of the road" at their children as well.
