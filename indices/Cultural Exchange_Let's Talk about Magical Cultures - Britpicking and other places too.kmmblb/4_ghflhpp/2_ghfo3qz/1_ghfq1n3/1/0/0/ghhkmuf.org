Exactly. Technically still 'roads', even if no cars go on them, so I figured it counted for the OP's question. :)

And yep. The big slabs are actually part of the 'technical definition' of paving, too. The people I remember using it might just've been the type of people to stick to dictionaries/technical manuals, or it might just've been a regional thing, or maybe I really am just imagining it. I really couldn't tell you. :)
