Tends to be in older or more 'decorative' footpath-type roads than any main roads that cars would go on, like a more restricted cobblestone. I haven't seen it much recently, I'll admit, but it was a thing in some of the older cities.

They're mostly used for the pavement now though, wherever tar isn't likely to be used.
