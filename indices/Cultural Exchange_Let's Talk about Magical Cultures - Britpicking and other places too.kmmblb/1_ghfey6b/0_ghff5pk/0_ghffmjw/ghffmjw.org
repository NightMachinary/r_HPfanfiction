There are a few kind of sombreros and some could stick to you even if running away from an Hungarian Horntail. (Though a sombrero-wearing wizard would probably keep a hand on the broom and another holding the sombrero if it's speeding too fast, no one wants to lose his favorite sombrero)

Muggle mexicans mostly wear sombreros in rural areas or typical folk music dances. They are great to cover from the sun.
