Culturally speaking people sometimes use it without a sun in the sky, like even indoors. Again, mostly in rural areas, but some cities use them for typical folk dances though they are different kind of sombreros. Rural sombreros are more practical. Sombreros in the southeast, near Cancun, are usually smaller. Sombreros in the north are more inspired on texas cowboy hats. Even in some cities people would wear them indoor or at night for dancing at regional concerts.
