Of course, it must be written by somebody who knows what he is writing about, but still I would like to see some stories appreciating that The Battle of Hogwarts was just 22 days after The Good Friday Agreement. I know about only one story which mentions on the side GFA (“Sanctuary by Sheankelor” linkffn(12015723)), and I would like somebody to appreciate this fact more.
