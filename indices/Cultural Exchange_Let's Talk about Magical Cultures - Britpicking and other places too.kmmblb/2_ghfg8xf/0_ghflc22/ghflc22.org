This, especially given that the Troubles were still ongoing at the time of canon. The Good Friday Agreement was signed until 10th April 1998. That being said there is a difference between the Provos and the IRA that belonged to the Republic, involving Michael Collins, De Valera etc. Irish rebel songs like Oro 'Se do bheatha abhaile and Come Out ye Black and Tans are pretty popular singing.

I always imagined Seamus as being from the Republic.
