Yeah. I think that's a thing a lot of Americans just haven't been able to get their head around. I've noticed a lot of assumption that Europe and the US are roughly equivalent (The old "I'm going to Europe!" telling you absolutely nothing useful thing :D) and the same underlying stuff applies. Like that idea that it's normal-ish in the US to go drive three hours for a special event (a concert or a family get-together or a camp-out or whatever) without necessarily leaving the state, but in Europe, driving three hours is pretty much enough to get you to a new country.
