There is something I'd like to address. I've seen a lot of authors refer to ‘Europe' as crowded. Its really not. The populations across Europe are dense. Densely populated into relatively few cities, but rurality is very easy to find and you don't actually have to go far. Take Scotland, ~70% of the population lives in the Central Belt, around Glasgow and Edinburgh. I live on the west coast, and I can drive for half an hour from my house and be in the arse end of nowhere. Hell, I can walk 15 minutes from my house, and be in miles of vast hills and moorland that will kill you if given the chance. The vast majority of the Gàidhealtachd (Highlands) and Southern Uplands are deserted. It's similar in Ireland, Wales and the Nordic Countries.
