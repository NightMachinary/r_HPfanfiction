One thing I would really like to see is a realistic portrayal of how world events shaped magical cultures outside of Europe. If we assume that by the times of the books, outside of maybe a few tribes the muggle and magical world have separated, then why did that happen, when and what does that make the magical country look like.

Take the US. The European Statute of Secrecy was at the end of the 17th century, about the time that large-scale emigration from Britain to the US started. Given by this point the societies are separate, and Magical Britain already seems to be scattered small communities with minimal government oversight, then none of the reasons Europeans moved to the US seem valid for magicals. They don't have to worry about muggle religious conflicts or wars or the Irish potato famine. Bare in mind that in canon the magicals seemed to completely ignore both the World Wars. So unless you come up with your own justification, most white magicals in the US must have come from a few generations worth of muggleborn.

In contrast the magical Native Americans would have had a far better survival rate than their muggle cousins, even if they had stayed with them and suffered through the same pandemics and genocides. So logically the magical world in the area of muggle USA should be mostly dominated by Native Americans and muggleborn or recently muggleborn immigrant descendants. Then you have were magical Africans able to avoid slavery and transport to the US, or was the slave trade muggle and magical. While much of this can be chosen by the author as there are no right or wrong answers, especially when the personal preferences of influential figures can change things, there is far more depth and 'what-if' than Rowling has in her 'same as our world but magical' approach.
