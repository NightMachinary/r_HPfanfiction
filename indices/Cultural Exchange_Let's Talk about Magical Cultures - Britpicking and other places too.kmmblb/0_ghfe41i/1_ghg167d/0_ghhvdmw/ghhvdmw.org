I read the first chapter. Didn't go far becuase Draco and Hermione ain't my thing, but it's really well written! You got the attire bang on and to be frank even I don't know what Ahmi means lol. Thanks for not butchering my culture. I wish you all the best. Please feel free to drop me a message if you have got any questions about India. I will try my best to answer them.
