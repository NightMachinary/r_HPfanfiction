Here's one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1784066/1/Armilla]]

There's a whole lot of Snape in it, love him or hate him, but it's very well-written, everyone is in character, and it has a well-developed Ravenclaw OC. There's also an unfinished (apparently abandoned) sequel.

It follows the canon plotline of OoTP but from the perspective of the OC, who has an interesting story of her own.
