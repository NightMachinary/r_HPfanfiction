The way Julian was mad at Barry for getting away with breaking the rules because he was the "golden boy" (not sure if that was the actual words but at least something similar was said) also seems to work quite well with Draco Malfoy. Running to an authority figure to try and get a colleague into trouble for rule breaking? If that's not something that fits well with Malfoy character wise, what does? He was good at potions and that could be seen as being kind of similar to forensic sciences. We don't know Julian that well yet but I think they actually intentionally played with similarities to Malfoy because it's pretty funny.
