I don't know anything about the CW Flash, so I wouldn't know how to set up this kind of story.

At the very least, it'd have to be adult Draco post-canon; I can't see a pro-Death-Eater young Draco Malfoy hanging around with a muggle superhero...

You've got me wondering something different, now, though.

What if Harry Potter met Ignatius Perrish? The one with the magic horns who attracts snakes and causes people to spill their secrets?
