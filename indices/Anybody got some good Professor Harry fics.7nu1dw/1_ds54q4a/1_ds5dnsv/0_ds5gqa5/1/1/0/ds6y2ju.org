I don't donate to any of Patreons (if it was Patreon) so I don't know how it works beyond, "pay $x/mo to support this person/group and you get perks (exclusive material, bonus episodes, etc.) in exchange."

I just remember that one day it had hit its goal and the next day there wasn't new content posted (either to the patrons or to the public at large) and people got pissed. The next day, the amount donated was less than the day previously.
