If the "Lord of Family" trope was true, and we even try to make it even vaguely like how inheriting of actual titles work... then Harry would ONLY qualify as Lord of the House Potter.

A lot of fanfic love to make him Lord Black, since he was Sirius's heir, but that's not how hereditary titles work. Harry was never part of the Black family. He wasn't born into it, he wasn't adopted into it. Sirius named Harry his heir, yes, but that only means Harry got his worldly possessions... his money, his house, his things. Those were Sirius's to do with whatever he wanted; so if he wanted to give them all to Harry, he could. A TITLE is completely different.... If Sirius had actually had a title, then he could not pick a successor. It would go to his biological son, or it wouldn't go to anyone at all. There's no third option here. That's the thing about titles, you can't transfer them to whoever you want, not even if they're your godchild and you "would have adopted them if you had the chance."

If Sirius really had a Lordship, then Harry would have no claim to that title. And neither Sirius nor Harry would have been able to do anything about that, short of claiming that Harry was actually Sirius's son. But in that case he couldn't be Lord of the House Potter, since then he wouldn't be James's son.
