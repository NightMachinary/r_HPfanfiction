It depends on a couple factors, namely which families have Lords and how heirs are named. If the Potters are noble, then Harry would have that, and if Sirius can name anyone as his heir, Harry also could be Lord Black. Technically, once Voldemort dies and/or if Voldemort hasn't claimed a Peverell lordship, Harry could have that too.

It gets more complicated if you add in rules where only direct descendants can inherit or only males can inherit, because the Peverell line could have died out, and Draco would inherit the Black lordship before Harry would since he'd be the next closest male after Sirius.
