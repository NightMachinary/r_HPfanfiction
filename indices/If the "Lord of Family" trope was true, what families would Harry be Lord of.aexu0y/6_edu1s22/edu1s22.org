Realistically, so to speak, it would just be Lord Black. The Potters were wealthy commoners, probably landed gentry or Esquire. It's my personally theory to add “Sir Peverell of The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of The Round Table” to lean into the Arthurian connection. Just as Arthur is “The Once and Future King” so too are the Knights.
