Potter by blood and Black by heritage if the Canon Universe isn't changed and Sirius still named him as heir.

Some fics make him "secretly" the heir of the Peverell house, which makes no sense because there is no way nobody in the Potter family through out history found out about that when they went to the bank and claimed it.

Plus, with all the inbreeding and "everyone is a cousin" there is no way there aren't other people related to the Potters in some way that are older and have a better claim.

So, canonically, Potter and Black are the houses he would have. Anything else would be fanon in action with made up rules like "conquest" and secret bloodlines.
