We're pretty sure Potter ISN'T a noble house. The Potter family is old, but decidedly commoners; they're descended from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, also known as "Linfred the Potterer," who was a potioneer and a healer.

But.. we're not sure that the Black family is a noble house either. Yes, I know Sirius once called it the "Most Ancient And Noble House Of Black," when presenting his family tree to Harry... but given that he was esssentially presenting them as a group of evil, fucked-up, racist monsters, he MAY have been sarcastic...
