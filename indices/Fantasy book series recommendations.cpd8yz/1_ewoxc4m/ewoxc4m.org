The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher is /almost/ like a grown up HP living in Chicago and becoming a detective. Really bad childhood, people thinking he's evil, massive saving people thing, etc. Obviously there are differences but it's a really great read. The first two or three books are not great because they were the first ones he had gotten published. They get far better as the series goes on.

He's also got a few other series too that are great too.

Other Urban Fantasy series I enjoy\\
Sandman Slim\\
Magic 2.0\\
Monster Hunters Inc

I could go on but that's off the top of my head. You might also want to check out [[/r/UrbanFantasy]] for more recommendations.
