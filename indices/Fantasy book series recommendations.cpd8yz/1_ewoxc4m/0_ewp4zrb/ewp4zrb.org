I used to say that Dresden Files was like an adult version of HP, but 15 books in, and that's just not really the case any more (if it ever was). I think it's always been just a catchphrase used as a selling point to try and get more people to read the books. I used to love the series, but I'm completely over it these days. Maybe it's one of those things that you're only supposed to read once, but I think with 15 books, there's 7 good ones and 8 bad ones, and I have a feeling we will be getting a 9th bad one.
