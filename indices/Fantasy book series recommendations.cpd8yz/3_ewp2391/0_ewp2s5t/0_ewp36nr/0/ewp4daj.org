The /Soldier's Son/ series /is/ pretty weird. It's the only published fantasy series I know of that focuses on a character struggling with body image issues and obesity. It's well written, and the author deserves a lot of credit for having the creativity and courage to explore that topic, but I stopped reading part way through the second book because it reminded me too strongly of feeder/feedee culture (even though I know that was not the author's intention).
