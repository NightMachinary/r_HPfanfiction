I learned of many great fantasy (and scifi) series from reading HPMOR. That fic contains tons of shoutouts/homages to books, TV shows, movies, other fanfics, etc.

In particular, HPMOR set me onto reading Lois McMaster Bujold's books. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_Chalion][The Curse of Challion]]/ is my favorite fantasy book by her, and her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga][Vorkosigan Saga]] is now my favorite scifi book series. Bujold has a flair for writing about atypical heroes, which I love.
