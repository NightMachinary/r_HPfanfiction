The Wardstone Chronicles (AKA Spooks Apprentice/The Last Apprentice)by Joseph Delaney is a pretty good one. It is a Young Adult adventure series, but it can get a bit grimmer than you may expect, though not too [[https://much.It][much. It]] follows the main character in the Titular role as the Apprentice to the Spook, who deals with ghosts, ghasts, witches, boggarts and other phantasmagoria and things that go bump in the night.
