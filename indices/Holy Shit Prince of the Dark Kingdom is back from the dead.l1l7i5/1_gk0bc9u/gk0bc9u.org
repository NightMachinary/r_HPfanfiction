Was shocked as well! Thinking back on it, some of the storylines and aspects of the plot are questionable but I still love the fic a lot. It is easily the most detailed - and my favorite - scenario of what would happen if Voldemort won. Where the story left off has been set in my mind as the end for so long it's unbelievable to imagine anything beyond that point. I'm not sure what a remaster would have in store but only fixing the grammatical errors would do wonders.
