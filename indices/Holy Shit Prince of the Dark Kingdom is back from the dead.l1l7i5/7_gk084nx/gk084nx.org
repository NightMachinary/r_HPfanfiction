I saw the notification in my email and my jaw dropped when I read the title of the fic. I really thought that this fic was going to be one of those abandoned works that has an insane amount of words but no conclusion with the author gone with no trace. It's still one of my favorite works of fanfiction I have read.

I have no idea how they plan to turn it into an original work though. The plot is original but it still relies a lot on Harry Potter worldbuilding. The characters are written so well some of them I like better than their canon counterparts but they are still very recognizable as HP characters.

I can't imagine how much work it will be to edit a 1.2 million word fic. Even if nothing comes of this I am glad to know that the author is still around and seems to be doing fine. I did wonder what happened to them.
