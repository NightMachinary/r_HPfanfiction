A rewrite/remaster of over a million words? Yeah ... chances are that'll lose its steam after awhile. The author will definitely have to enlist the help of others for that, otherwise what tends to happen is that they get all excited and motivated for redoing the first ten or so chapters, and then lose their drive once the fixes and backtracking become too much.

It's like suffering through one loooooong flashback that you're trying to patch up. Then starts the dreaded cycle of fix, see something else to fix, doesn't quite feel as perfect as it could be, and then fix again ... over and over. And that goes for both the grammar and the plot in most rewrites.
