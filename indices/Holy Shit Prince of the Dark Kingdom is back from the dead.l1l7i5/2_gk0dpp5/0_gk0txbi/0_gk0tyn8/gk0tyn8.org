Year 6- So way back after Snape discovered Tom, Tom booked it to Germany and somehow managed to get safety in a group of vampires in Berlin. But then Britain invades Berlin and manages to hold it, and they're all trapped. Tom possesses a British soldier during this and climbs the ranks. Some time during this Lucius has had enough of Hermione being smart and independent, so he decides to marry her off to.. Barty Crouch Jr. (who leads the foreign intelligence department and is an omnipotent bastard). Crouch takes the deal so Lucius forgives some debt. Harry becomes some sort of werewolf ambassador and Germany actually does some shit - they attack some Irish villages that uphold protective wards over the British isles. Germany invades London. And remember Ron? Ron finds out that Lucius Malfoy was the reason his father was thrown into Azkaban for so long, and Arthur dies in Azkaban from illness. So Ron.. get this.. uses a pagan ritual spell (inspired by Harry) he doesn't understand to curse Lucius, the most important general, while Britain is at war. But Ron screws up and is slowly dying as well and Harry has to fix everything. In the mean time, this curse is being carried out by Tom (possessing a man named Reginald Strattus) who is slowly poisoning Lucius as his assistant in hopes of taking his place. This makes little sense but Tom certainly has drive. At some point Germany attacks Hogwarts but the castle prevails and it fails miserably. At some other point Germany gets some Italian aid. Interesting tid bit is that Italians despise Britain and Spain ignores them.

And this is kind of where the fever dream begins. At some point Harry travels to Ireland to talk to some werewolves, takes a bunch of sentinels (soldiers) with him, then they all get kidnapped by fae? Elves? Something like that. Yep. It's actually really cool though and we discover some really really important information but I can't really get into it. Tom (as Strattus) is here too and is the only one who really knows about the elves but it doesn't help much. Bobby the raven (remember him?) helps Harry escape. And here we are at perhaps the most badass part in which Voldemort shows up after returning from the frontline of the war (I think somewhere in Poland), burns down the elven city, and kind of leaves the soldiers to die but says he won't punish them if they escape by themselves. Snape and Lucius show up as well. The motive for kidnapping Harry was so Harry could fulfill the prophecy and kill Voldemort so the (fae? elves?) could resurrect him and have them be their king. This is because the king (Gulandri) can't rule forever and can't think of anyone he'd approve of to take his place. Turns out the king and Voldemort have some history and they have this insane battle. Voldemort probably would've won if he hadn't been seriously poisoned by the king's daughter, but instead they stalemate when Gulandri stabs him with a sword and Voldemort spits his blood at him (which is poisonous, by the way). Then Voldemort makes Harry chop off his poisoned / dead arm using Gulandri's sword. Yikes. The arm comes back though after he steals an arm from some prisoner, and then eventually grows his own back using like all of Harry's magic (??)

Ok rapid fire, Harry and his friends try to emancipate Hermione so she doesn't marry Crouch Jr., Lucius and Harry end up having this kind of cold war in which they definitely aren't allowed to hurt each other but still try to undermine each other. Lucius is going insane from the curse until Ron asks Harry to help him reverse it. Because Harry saved Lucius, he's forced to take back making Hermione marry Crouch. But Lucius is still really angry so instead he has Hermione marry Strattus. Tom (possessing Strattus) isn't happy but takes the offer. Then at a party the Malfoys host over winter break all hell breaks loose - Crouch Jr. tells Lucius Hermione was going to emancipate herself, Lucius freaks the fuck out (Hermione outsmarted him), Harry blackmails Rita Skeeter into helping Hermione escape (again, long story), Lucius flips out on Harry and nearly breaks his arm, Harry breaks Lucius's nose, and then the house gains sentience and makes Harry fall down the stairs. Harry is seriously injured and Tom is watching the whole thing. So Tom briefly possesses Crouch Jr, has him cast the killing curse at Lucius (he wanted him dead anyways), and the house makes a chandelier fall on Crouch, killing him instantly.

So naturally this is pretty bad during war. Nobody knows what happened, including Voldemort. Voldemort pins the murder of Lucius on Hermione but know it wasn't her. Hermione is forced to flee to France. Harry told Snape it was Ron who cursed Lucius and Voldemort thinks the curse is involved, but Snape never told him. The story instead was that Harry did the curse but underestimated it. Back at Hogwarts Voldemort smells bs and tortures Snape to find out who really did it. Meanwhile, Harry is detained at one of the Hogwarts towers and soon to be interrogated. And while all of this is going down, Germans invade Hogwarts again but now with Dumbledore's knowledge of the castle. Bad news is that Snape is really rattled, good news is that Voldemort is there and kind of sweeps the floor with them. Except it isn't nearly enough, and I can't really explain what happens but Harry and Voldemort summon a really nasty storm and the Germans have to surrender.

Year 7- ok ok this is short. Hogwarts is destroyed but they plan on rebuilding, a seventh year is up in the air. Britain is negotiating the terms of Germany's surrender in France and basically gains control over Germany. Voldemort is in some sort of relationship with the Queen (it's very much a means to an end). During the negotiations a woman attacks Voldemort (who is very much being a jerk and rubbing it in their faces). Snape is trying to win back Voldemort's favor after lying to his face and is trying to track down Dumbledore, who was spotted in France. And the entire story ends on a cliffhanger in which Harry challenges some military person from Germany who hates werewolves to a duel and Harry sort of wins the duel but is dying? And yep. That's it. I remember way too much.
