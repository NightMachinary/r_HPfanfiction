I tried to make this brief but even brief explanations made this way way too long... but this is still shorter than reading a million words I suppose.

Year 1- James and Lily managed to escape to Germany with Harry and Harry grew up there as a muggle. His parents still die during some sort of burglary. Harry befriends two muggleborn ocs (Natalie and Clyde) and Hermione. Ron is a Slytherin and the Weasley children are separated. The Malfoys are forced to adopt a muggleborn who ends up being Hermione, she and Draco are close. Snape picked up Harry from the Dursleys. Harry speaks to Nagini and doesn't realize it, catches Voldemort's attention. Quidditch rivalry results in him being stranded in the woods and somehow meeting Remus. He writes in the diary and over the summer and Voldemort somehow gives it a different body so it doesn't kill Harry.

Year 2- Tom Riddle attends as a fifth year named Thomas Rook, tries very hard to befriend Harry, and opens the chamber of secrets. Quirrel steps down and the new DADA teacher is nasty. Umbridge is brought in to help teach the course (for some reason). Tom gives Umbridge a device that lets her be understood by the basilisk and she takes over so Tom has plausible deniability. The staff claim its an Acromantula but Harry and co. figure out it isn't. Hermione and Harry get close but Snape modifies her memory and forces Harry to sign a contract so he can't speak about the truth. Harry is taken along by Voldemort for some PR thing, figures out its a Basilisk by finding a book in his library, and they do a weird pagan thing and Voldemort decides to 'mentor' Harry or whatever. Harry makes his way down to the chamber and confronts Umbridge, Umbridge is crazy and tries to kill him, Harry still kills the basilisk. Umbridge manages to escape but doesn't last long - Tom finds out she tried to kill Harry and screwed everything up and kills her. Voldemort knew it was Tom but waits until the end of the year to kill him and lock his soul away in a different artifact.

Year 3- Harry meets Remus and Sirius over the summer and is. Weird werewolf stuff but the way Voldemort managed all the werewolves is interesting. Harry is also stuck living with Snape. Moody is the crazy escaped convict instead of Sirius, and Moody actually wants to kill both Voldemort and Harry (because they're affiliated? This makes more sense when reading). Bad stuff happens to Harry all year. New DADA teacher is a former sentinel, Larousse, with a vendetta against werewolves. She comes in with a plan to marry Snape and then adopt Harry. She's moderately crazy but it actually works. Voldemort announces construction on the castle and - this is really stupid - Moody manages to keep infiltrating the place by disguising as one of the construction workers. The Order of the Phoenix is still a thing off in Germany but doesn't actually want to kill Harry, but Voldemort takes advantage of their relation to Moody and makes it seem like Dumbledore wants Harry dead and is an evil child murderer. Year ends with Moody about to blow up the castle, Voldemort getting hit by an Avada Kedavra and coming back to life (this part is kind of badass), and Larousse going to marry Snape but dying.

Year 4- Harry's been set up to be a really likable public figure and some sort of success story (child of two rebels), and Voldemort decides to have him work in the mailroom or something for German ambassadors because Harry grew up in Germany. Here he finds out the Triwizard cup is happening. Also over the summer Harry kind of gives up any chance of seeing his parents in heaven (apparently that's canonical) to save Sirius by becoming pagan, and this whole thing was kind of set up by Voldemort. The French are friendly (they're a monarchy in the story so they're cool with Voldemort's whole "absolute power" thing) while the Germans' intentions are pretty dubious. Same champions, Harry is never chosen, but the tasks are different (Bellatrix is the headmistress of Hogwarts, which is pretty entertaining, and she makes the tasks). From Viktor's pov we find out a few things - Snape is known as an assassin, nobody really knows what Voldemort's been up to outside of Britain due to them locking down, and Viktor is part of the Order. During the first task someone working for Germany releases these magical spying bugs (literal bugs) that attach themselves to important British officials. One of them is Lucius Malfoy, who is the highest ranking military official (and actually competent). Voldemort has Lucius set up a thinly disguised army. Then in the second task shit goes down and Cedric is out of commission. Cedric (again, for some reason) made Harry his second. I assume this is because Harry's known to be pretty good in the dueling club Snape runs. Then Harry does some sort of pagan ritual in an attempt to make Voldemort a bit less of a prick (mend his soul) but this ends up making Voldemort very ill and very angry for a few days. It actually almost kills him because Voldemort's immortality comes from him - get this - murdering pagan gods and then eating them, and so he absorbs a certain part of their essence (??????) - and the ritual involved the same sort of power. Harry flips out upon finding out he almost killed his "mentor" and the Celtic Studies professor that helped him imperiuses him to spare him from Voldemort's rage and escape with the fleeing Durmstrang students (who were accused of attacking Voldemort, which they didn't but they were certainly up to no good).

And before all of this Harry keeps writing letters to Tom and eventually an owl finds where Voldemort hid him. Tom possesses the owl, witnessed the magical bugs released during the first task, possesses a student, decides he wants to kill Voldemort and take his place, and writes an anonymous letter to Lucius about the German infiltration so he can watch hell break loose. Harry is in a weird limbo in Germany, attends Durmstrang, meets Dumbledore, and the German minister tries to use him as some sort of political tool to get re-elected. Voldemort viciously murders the Celtic Studies teacher and considers killing Harry before deciding to just find a way to guarantee his loyalty instead.

Year 5- Harry spends the summer with Dumbledore, Dumbledore makes some weird remarks and is pretty in character, and then the German minister stages some sort of death eater attack (which is pretty incompetent considering death eaters haven't been a thing for years) to steal Harry back from Dumbledore (the minister and Dumbledore are at odds but united in the effort to handle the Voldemort problem). Voldemort gives an ultimatum that the minister be given up to Britain for execution if Harry isn't returned (or something like that). Harry escapes during the fake death eater attack and has this crazy return trip to Britain using a dwarven tunnel. He meets a talking raven named Bobby. Snape discovers the student Tom possessed and is injured. Harry throws a rock at Voldemort and breaks his nose, Voldemort kind of tortures Harry, then they make up or whatever. Sirius kills Fenrir Greyback and becomes the leader of the werewolves, Greyback is kind of reincarnated as this wolf god / spirit of war. It looks like there's going to be war with Germany, or there already is one. Harry becomes even more of a public figure and proposes Britain take German werewolf refugees (long story). People start seeing Harry as a prince while Voldemort kind of a king. Harry is really stressed all year and has these panic attacks, but takes this pagan thing (basically some drug) that relaxes him. Slughorn is the potions professor, Snape is the defense professor. Somewhere in all of this Harry is taken along to France to watch Voldemort negotiate taking werewolf refugees and for Britain to get some military bases on the French-German border. Meets the French queen, who is cool. Then it turns out the drugs Harry were taking made it easier for him to be possessed by a Celtic spirit, so Fenrir possesses him and leads some sort of werewolf march on Germany in a tunnel. Also, surprise, the prophecy is still a thing. Neville was killed and Harry's parents lied and had his birthday officially be August 1. Snape finds out Harry was actually born the 31st (weird astrology thing with centaurs that showed up last year, then a potion). This is probably my favorite part, in which Snape is conflicted over whether he should kill Harry to ensure the reign of the regime he is loyal to, or spare the person he's grown close to. During the werewolf march / battle, Snape gets the opportunity to slip Harry a potion that will kill him painlessly, but backs out last second. Germans show up and there's even more of a battle. War officially breaks out and shit really hits the fan.

I could not tell you where year 5 ends and year 6 begins, I just know the events that happen, so this is going to be very off. And I also need another comment. Uh oh.
