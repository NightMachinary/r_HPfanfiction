The only thing that is annoying to me but absolutely understanding is that the author has grown a lot as a person. And the world, too. Things that were perfectly fine back then in a fic, may it be cultural, social or just plain fanfic common trope, might now be insensitive, wrong or overdone. And sometimes the real world bleeds too much into it.
