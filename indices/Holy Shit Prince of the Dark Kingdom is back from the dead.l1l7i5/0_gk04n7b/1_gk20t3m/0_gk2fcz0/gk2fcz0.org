Yeah, I agree. It's their story at the end of the day, we're just cheerleaders on the sidelines. Beggars can't be choosers and all that.

And yeah, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that they weren't just continuing from where they left off. Even in the best case scenario where they don't bounce off the remaster after 5 chapters, and their other projects don't slow it down too much, it's still going to take a long /long/ time for the remaster to make it back to this point 147 chapters in. And then you still have to hope that it continues past this point and eventually gets the satisfying ending that it deserves too.

I'm still here for it, but I'm going to temper my expectations because I don't think I can bear the worst case scenario of yet another "hype-lull-abandoned again" rewrite cycle for one of my all-time favourites.
