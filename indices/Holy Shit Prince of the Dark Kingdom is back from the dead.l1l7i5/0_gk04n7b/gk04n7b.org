I am cautiously optimistic. I'm always wary of "remaster/rewrite" attempts after a long hiatus, it never seems to go more than a few chapters before being abandoned again. Not to mention the author will be splitting their efforts between the remaster, an adaptation, and another project. All that being said: it's back baby. Holy crap.
