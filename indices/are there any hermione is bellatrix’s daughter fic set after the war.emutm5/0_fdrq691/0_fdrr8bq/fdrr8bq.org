this is actually the fic that inspired me to make this post, i'd just gotten to the part where they get introduced to the varinen family head and the stones reveal their bloodlines! and then i read the first chapter of the sequel just to see if it was going where i thought and it was.

i really like it so far, although weird sex scenes aren't my thing, is it worth it to push through anyway or are they super weird?
