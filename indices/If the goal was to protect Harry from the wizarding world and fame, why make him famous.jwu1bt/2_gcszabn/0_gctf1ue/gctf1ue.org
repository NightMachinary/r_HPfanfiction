You forget the blood wards Dumbledore erected at Privet Drive. Dumbledore erected those not only for Death Eaters or Voldemort, but to assure that the Wizards do nothing. Dumbledore needed to paint Harry a Hero to create Hope. Dumbledore has already a good grasp of the plan of war ahead the moment he has seen Harry Scar. It is obvious, there is no need for manipulative Dumbledore when everything is so obvious.\\
The moment that Harry is a Horcrux automatically , Dumbledore choices are very restricted because he needs Harry to have a very precise personality because everything hangs on sacrifice. As a war general. Dumbledore choices were the only one good enough.
