Ambitious...? You make it sound like walking to ones own self can be measured in terms of ambition, which confuses me. Also, quote from DH:

  “But . . .” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died --- I didn't defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”

  “And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the difference.”

Harry needed to believe he was going to die or it would have not worked.
