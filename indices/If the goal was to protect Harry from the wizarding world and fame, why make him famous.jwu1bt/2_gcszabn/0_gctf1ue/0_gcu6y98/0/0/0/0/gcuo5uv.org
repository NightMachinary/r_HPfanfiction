Ambition doesn't have to be politically ambitious, like reaching a high rank, or lots of glory. His ambition might be just to defeat Voldemort. Once Harry realized he had to die in order for Voldemort to be defeated he would still have done it because there's no other way for Voldemort to die. Harry was not abandoning; he was trusting that his friends could finish the job for him. And besides Slytherin isn't solely based on ambition.

Resourcefulness and determination both happen to be traits Harry had in large amounts.
