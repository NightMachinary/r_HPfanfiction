Nowhere is it indicated that Dumbledore knew Harry was a Horcrux as soon as he saw the scar. In fact, he only received proof that Voldemort made any Horcruxes at all when Harry gave him the Diary in second year. I have always been confused on this point as people seem to either not realize or forget that Dumbledore knew Harry would survive the AK a second time form book 4 onwards.

  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my --- my mother left in me --- he'd have it too. And he was right --- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.

Unless, of course, you interpret that as to meaning Dumbledore was happy Harry could be killed, in which case you have me cornered.
