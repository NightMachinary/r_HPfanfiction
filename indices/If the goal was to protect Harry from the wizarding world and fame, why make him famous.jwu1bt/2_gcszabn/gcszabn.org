Some people think Dumbledore spread the rumor, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me unless you assume Dumbledore is malicious enough to paint a target on an infant, stupid enough as to give his enemies such vital information, and prescient enough to predict the next decade+ of events in the wizarding world, all the way to Voldemort's defeat. Dumbledore certainly knew more than most and has his fair share of fuckups, but I'm skeptical of laying such an accusation at his feet.

JK doesn't seem terribly interested in laying out a timeline or even telling us how word got out about the Potters, so I personally headcanon this:

James and Lily aren't the only people in Godric's Hollow, and the Fidelius came down somehow (I always figured Voldemort's curse rebounding on him shattered the Fidelius, or at the very least destroyed the property enough to cancel it out), so I imagine their neighbors caught a glimpse of things, or put two and two together when they saw they could see the house again, or what's left of it.

Dumbledore must have found out pretty quick, because he had Hagrid bring Harry to the Dursleys. I would imagine he had someone at Godric's Hollow to keep an eye on things, maybe even Hagrid himself, considering Hagrid can't apparate but he got to Harry before almost anyone else. Hagrid is famously bad at keeping secrets so I imagine, if bombarded with questions by enough people, he let something slip to the tune of 'You-Know-Who was after the Potters!', and the story spread rapidly from there.
