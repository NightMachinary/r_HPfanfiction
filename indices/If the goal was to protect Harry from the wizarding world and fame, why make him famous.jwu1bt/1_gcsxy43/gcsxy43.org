You are assuming Harry can magically defeat Voldemort, but not assuming there is a magical way to tell.

Basically, that seems like an unbalanced view to me (it's a common notion/trap though). I find it plausible that Law Enforcement came to the house, "magic leaves traces", and people reconstructed what had happened in a jiffy. Combine with testimony from Death Eaters, Voldemort's absence, and the picture is clear.
