JK doesn't really provide any information on it but, as with most amazing things that have no witness in real life, there could have been a lot of speculation since at least some people knew Voldemort was hunting down baby Potter and out of the whole family, he was the only one to survive. As we find out in GoF, the dark marks faded the moment Voldemort lost his powers so a panicked group of Death Eaters might have been what gave away the fact that their master had been defeated. Also it might not be entirely outside the realm of the in-universe possibility for the Ministry to find out what had transpired by extracting Harry's memory (as young as he was, he still saw the events) or any other magical means.
