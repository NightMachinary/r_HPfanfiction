It's the little discrepancies like that, that give flexibility to fanfic authors to explore story arcs that contain a manipulative/evil Dumbledore.

On one hand you can quite easily see Hagrid in a bar crying in his drink lamenting the loss of James and Lily and how poor little Harry is now an orphan. But how do you get from that to Harry being the BWL who survived a killing curse? I mean Hagrid was kicked out of school and doesn't have a fully functioning wand so how would he know that Harry was hit with a killing curse and survived?

Isn't it more likely that Lily set some sort of booby trap etc that took out Voldemort before he could harm Harry. And that Harry's wound was caused by some falling debris rather than from surviving the killing curse, which we are told doesn't ever leave a mark.

So it's much more likely that Dumbledore put the story that Harry survived the killing curse out there. And it had to be Dumbledore who had something to do with the Harry Potter kids books because they described Harry's look correctly but no other magicals had "contact" with Harry so how did they know what he looked like.

Of course without these questions and others fanfic authors would have a lot less to explore.
