Voldemort attacked the Potters in the evening. There were still kids out on the streets celebrating Halloween, and Harry had not been put to bed yet. Around 7 pm, perhaps? Then Voldemort got defeated, Hagrid came to fetch Harry and begun to fly to Little Whinging, which is in Surrey. Godric's Hollow is in West Country. The distance is not that big. On a flying motorcycle you should cross the distance in two hours.

However, the next day Vernon Dursley overheard wizards talking about Harry Potter defeating You-Know-How. The next night after midnight Hagrid finally arrives. What did he do during the over 24 four hours he was unaccounted for? I guess he gave an interview to the Daily Prophet and showed the baby Harry to a photographer. That way everyone knew Harry had a lightning-shaped scar even though no one saw him before he first entered the wizarding world on his eleventh birthday. So, it's Hagrid who is to be blamed.

But there is an alternative explanation: Dumbledore spread the news. It was Fate that made him do so. You see, Dumbledore is famous as a vanquisher of a Dark Lord (Grindelwald), and he made Harry famous as a vanquisher of a Dark Lord (Voldemort), thus marking Harry as his equal! This is an obvious hint that the old goat is the evil mastermind after all.
