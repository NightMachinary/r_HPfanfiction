Molly didn't need a watch, she had the family clock (which could have even been something Arthur had tinkered with and created out of her watch given its apparently one of a kind).

But I'd ssume it's also traditional to give witches a watch as well since time keeping would be just as important to a witch. However, given that nearly every witch and wizard in the series is either a student, teacher, or adults related of HP and co in their homes it's unsurprising that we get no mention of watches outside of Harry's wrist watch, the traditional watches, and I think one of the Order member's that yelled at people?
