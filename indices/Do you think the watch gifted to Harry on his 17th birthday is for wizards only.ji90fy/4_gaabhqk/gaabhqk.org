Canon had no real evidence either way.

From what I can tell in a few minutes if research on the history of watches, pocket watches were mostly worn by men, and were passed down in families. Women mostly wore watches as pendants (which would basically just be a pocket watch worn differently, to be fair), and then as wristwatches.

If the intent is to mimic real life, it would probably fit more for a daughter to be given some piece of jewelry, which could still be a watch pendant in some cases. Watches are one of the only types of jewelry most men wear anyway.
