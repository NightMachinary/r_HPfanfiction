While I'm not a fan of this fic, partly because of all its cliches (WBWL, teen politicians, the whole "Slytherin Prince" with his throne and everything . . .), one of the few things I appreciate is the "innovative" way it treats some characters like Peter Pettigrew, or Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. And also the fact that it try to stay away from bashing (from what I remember, the closest thing to bashing would be James, and even there is really toned down and somewhat explained?)
