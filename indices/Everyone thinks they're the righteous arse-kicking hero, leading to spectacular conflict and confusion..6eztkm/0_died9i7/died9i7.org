Pure comedy gold.

The only /remotely/ similar fic I can think of is (unfinished) about lots and lots and lots of time travelers coming from the future to save Harry and the day. With the first few, they are suspicious of each other. When more and more still come, they realize the horror they've created and that nothing is going to work out.
