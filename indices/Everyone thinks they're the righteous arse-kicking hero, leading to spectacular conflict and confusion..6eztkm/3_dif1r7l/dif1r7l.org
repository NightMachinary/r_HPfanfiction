Well, I can't think of anything like this, although the first few chapters I've read of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3397550/1/Harry-Johnson-and-the-Headmaster-s-Socks][Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks]] seem to at least be in the vein of "subversive multi-crossover nonsense" - but seeing as I've not read much of it at all I can't say too much about whether you'd like it.
