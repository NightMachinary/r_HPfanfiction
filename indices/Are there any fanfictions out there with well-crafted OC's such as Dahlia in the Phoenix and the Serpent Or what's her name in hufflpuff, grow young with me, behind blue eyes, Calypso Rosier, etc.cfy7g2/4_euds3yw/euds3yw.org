linkAo3(Light in the Darkness by Sigrun23) The OC in question is a slimy sack of spiders seven times over, but he's pretty well developed.

linkAo3(Sweeter than Fiction by Littlerose13)

linkAo3(Magic and Mind by Preelikeswriting) It's an FMA crossover, hope you don't mind. And its sequel, Sorcery and Sigils, also has an OC.

linkffn(Winter's Debt by La Guera) Absolute tear-jerker...

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=326323][Turn to Stone]] (What code do I have to type in for the stupid bot to link it properly?!)

linkAo3(Oikogeneia: Of Curses and Kids) Oc is the villain, and scary as all hell.
