Well, when it comes to straight up OC establishing, Black Luminary does a very fine job. The first few chapters are kind of a mixed bag, to be honest, but you'll have to trudge through them if you want to have a chance of comprehending and appreciating the later ones.

The second year, at the very least, is one of the best AU years I've ever read. And the quality stays consistent from there.
