Commenting to support this comment and mention that the plots of this fic are amazing, expansive in scope, mysterious, thrilling and well developed.

I definitiely reccommend this fic, and if you are worried about Harry's weird behaviour around girls at the start, there is an in-universe reason and one of many ongoing plotlines, but it also gets much less of a thing as the story progresses, and well worth sticking with the story for all that amazing magic, characters, and adventure!
