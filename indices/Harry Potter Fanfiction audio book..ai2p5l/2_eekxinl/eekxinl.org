If you have an Android you can get @voice for free. If you have an iPhone I use VoiceDream reader. I use these toread all my fics to me via robots. You can import ebooks you download from ficsave.xyz and it reads it to you.

You need to spell out a few words to correct pronounciation. IE: Slytherin being pronounced with a hard Y. However, it gets most words right straight off the bat. Even the spells are almost always right.

Sounds a bit robotic but a lot better than I thought it would. It let's you adjust the WPM to read way faster than audiobooks as well.
