If the story is on fanfiction.net, you can use the FFN.net app which has a text-to-speech function. It's not perfect but it gets the job done pretty well.

Sometimes the AI will speak out the author's pagebreaks, and that gets sort of annoying (like one story had hphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphp between every scene)
