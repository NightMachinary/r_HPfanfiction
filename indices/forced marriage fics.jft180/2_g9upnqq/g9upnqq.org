I think you're not going to get too many. I'm aware of quite a few contract fics, but even the ones that aren't breakable tend to be "love conquers all" stories with happy endings, just because that's what people like.

Of the stories I'm aware of, linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao) fits your criteria best, and linkffn(Contracts and Legalities by fringeperson) probably comes next. It subverts the trope in an interesting way.

I'll skip the "unbreakable contracts with happy endings," because I've got a lot of them.

These don't go through to marriage, but you may enjoy them:

linkffn(Marriage in Mind by Lady Azar de Tamaran). An attempt to force an existing contract.

linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66). Dumbledore tries to force a contract on Harry.

linkffn(The Standard Potter Betrothal Contract by Marc the Unruly). Harry uses a betrothal contract to get revenge.

And this one is just strange. The Greengrass family uses a betrothal contract to extract penalties against Harry, but it doesn't work out the way they expect. linkffn(Tortious Interference by OlegGunnarsson).
