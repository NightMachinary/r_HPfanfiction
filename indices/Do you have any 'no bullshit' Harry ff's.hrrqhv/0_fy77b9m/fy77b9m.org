I like this one because Harry starts directly calling Dumbledore on all his BS. Later in the fic the other teachers start using it also.

  "Ah yes, very good." Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. "But my point still stands. She's not on the list of permitted pets and so I'm afraid she must go."

  "Ding." Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. "That's my bullshit detector." Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. "Ron has a rat, Lee has a tarantula, and therefore I can only conclude that the reason you don't want me keeping a snake is because it's a snake, and thus has ominous connotations with Slytherin and everything 'evil." Snape's mouth twitched again.
