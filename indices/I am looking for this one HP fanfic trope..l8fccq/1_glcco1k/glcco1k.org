There is one where the author is a huge fan of Draco and she's talking about her life when Draco somehow lands up in the real world (as a ferret, maybe?). She takes care of him and when the spell fades, shows him around and explains to him about the HP series. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, Hermione somehow come into the real world and find Draco and they all go back. I read this a long time ago and I remember it very vaguely. However, the writing was hilarious!
