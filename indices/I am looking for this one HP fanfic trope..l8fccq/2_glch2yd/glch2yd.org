linkffn(The Girl of Steel and the Silver Speedster by mysteryman10000) and linkffn(The Lightning-Struck Soldier by TheUnHolySmirk) both do this...kind of. In both of them, the "real world" is the Supergirl world, and the other characters in story tend to have bigger reactions to finding out that Harry Potter is real than Harry dies to finding out there are books about him.
