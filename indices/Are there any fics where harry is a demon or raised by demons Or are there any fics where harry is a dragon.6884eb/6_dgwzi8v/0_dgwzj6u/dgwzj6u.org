  On his own one night, Crowley discovers a house where he hears a child being abused by his family. He takes the kid in and adopts him as his own son. The child: Harry Potter before he gets his Hogwarts letter. This is a story of him growing up with Crowley as his father and all the obstacles that come with becoming half demon; along with also being a wizard. (Not a romance story)
