[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6616730/1/Brought-to-Order][Brought to Order]], written by Lady Salazar. is an origin story for Nero, Harry is captured by the [[http://devilmaycry.wikia.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Sword][Order of the Sword]] as they need [[/spoiler][Dante so the Savior can be brought to life]]. unfortunately, Dante is not available. hence, the back-up plan involves Harry. so as I've said, Harry is captured. and tortured by the Order until he loses the memories of /being/ Harry and all that's left is Nero.

That's all I'm going to say.
