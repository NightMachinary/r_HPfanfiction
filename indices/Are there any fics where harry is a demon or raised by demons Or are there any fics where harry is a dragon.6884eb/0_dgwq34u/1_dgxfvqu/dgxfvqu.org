Heh, I want more of Enter The Dragon style fics. Super-powerful dragon Harry who is just a big doofus.

Hmm, you know how The Accidental Animagus and a few other fics start with Harry making a wish?

Maybe there's a fic out there where Harry sees Pete's Dragon on the TV, and wishes he could be an invisible dragon so the Dursleys wouldn't bother him. And ~poof!~, he's a dragon!
