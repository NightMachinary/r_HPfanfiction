  ... can someone, anyone, please explain to me the shortage of demons and dragons on fanfiction?
#+end_quote

Demons aren't part of the cosmology of the Potterverse; the closest that it comes is the island of Azkaban and the Dementors. JKR deliberately kept away from any association with devils and pacts with extraplanar creatures so as to avoid being associated with or needing to implicitly make commentary on real-life religion.

Dragon-powers would just be over-powered, and most fanfiction writers are at least aware of the idea of Mary-Sues and wish to avoid being labelled as writing one. Also, there aren't a whole lot of love stories out there about girls and their dragons, no doubt because dragons are all scaly and massive. Not cuddly like big dog-men or sexy like beautiful, eternally-young, misunderstood goths.

That said, have some fun with linkffn(Enter the Dragon by doghead thirteen)
