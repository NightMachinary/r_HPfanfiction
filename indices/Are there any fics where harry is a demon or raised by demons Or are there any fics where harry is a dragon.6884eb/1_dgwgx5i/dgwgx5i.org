[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter__trashed/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] is a OP-as-fuck Harry-soulbond-Hermione where his animagus form is a dragon. It also has insane amounts of Weasley bashing and about as much conflict as a wet paper bag. It's well /written/, but about as suspenseful as Tom and Jerry. I enjoyed the setting, if nothing else.
