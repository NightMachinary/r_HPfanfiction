Also you can tell a woman wrote it all of the men are either bi gay or effeminate even harry. Not that thats a bad thing or something only girls do i enjoyed the hell out of it. But it is a nitpick i have with the story their were times in the story where i legitametly scoffed because a guy wouldnt do what someone im the story did. And im sure its the same way with females written by men.
