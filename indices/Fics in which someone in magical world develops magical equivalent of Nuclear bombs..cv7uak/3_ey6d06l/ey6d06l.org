Do you mean equivalent big explosion, or just equivalent weapon of mass destruction? The Arithmancer was already mentioned as one where you can't transfigure antimatter, >! but the sequel includes a self-replicating swarm of killer robots!<. And there's linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) for a Person of Mass Destruction.

There are hints of the danger of combining magic with nuclear physics in linkffn(Following the Phoenix - Flashes). They plan to test whether you can transfigure uranium and then use it to power a reactor before the transfiguration wears off - but they don't dare test it anywhere on Earth, even in the middle of a desert.
