Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

After the Statute of Secrecy is breached and magic is revealed to muggles, Voldemort sees no reason why he shouldn't take over North Korea. Once he gets his hands on some weapons grade uranium from their reactors it's just a matter of casting a bunch of duplication charms and a few chapters, one week and one almost-WW3 later there's a few million less people on the planet.
