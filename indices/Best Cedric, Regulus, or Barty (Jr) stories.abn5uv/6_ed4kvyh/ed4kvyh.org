Presque Toujours Pur is a good read. The basic premise is that Hermione is Regulus's daughter, and it really dives into his relationships and life. Some of it is a bit melodramatic but it's worth reading through. linkffn(11153333)

Eclairs is a super cute Hermione/Cedric that I adore. linkffn(4752834)
