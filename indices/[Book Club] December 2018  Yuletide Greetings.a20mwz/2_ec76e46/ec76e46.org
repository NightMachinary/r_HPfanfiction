Stages of Hope was really good until right at the end. I wish there had been more conflict surrounding the "go and come back when you're done". Maybe even just by not exposing the plan?

I've heard it said: The reader can know the plan, if it goes wrong; or the reader can not know the plan, if it goes right. I suppose it's a neat twist to know the plan, and have it go right, but I still prefer the drama of an uncertain narrative.
