Finally got around to reading all of them (aside from Stages of Hope, which I read in the past). Both of the Weasley Christmases and 12 Days were excellent, characterizations felt spot on, but they definitely qualify as bittersweet.

Christmas Spirits is canon compliant and feels on point, but it's very short.

Wasn't a huge fan of The Potter-Weasley Christmas Party. It felt like it destroyed all of Neville's character growth into a confident person that happened during the Horcrux hunt (not to mention what an additional 17 years would do).

I'm saving Stages of Hope for when I don't have anything to do and can take time to process all the feels
