  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
