Uh... the powerful magical artifact story was just written last year ish. It was originally a solo-Harry story, but the death of Chilord and our many conversations had me thinking about Ron and underutilized he can be when people really write him well. Then I changed it to make it a Harry and Ron story. Chilord just passed less than a year ago.

My muse has ADD and I struggle to write solo. I like to work with someone in writing and Plums' muse hasn't been able to wirte in any of these stories.
