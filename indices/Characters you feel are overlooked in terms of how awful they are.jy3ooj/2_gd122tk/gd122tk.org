Snape. He told the Dark Lord to kill James and his son and only spare Lily. So he thought after that Lily would return to him for comfort. So it's like that he wanted a married woman's son and husband dead so you could be with her. That's just sick. He bullies an orphan, a kid with major self esteem issues and a muggleborn who is constantly bullied by the students of your house. You put your life in danger but it was not because it was the right thing to do but because you wanted revenge. You yourself go to the Whomping Willow (nobody forced him to. He went on his own accord) and after James Potter saves you, you try to paint yourself as the innocent victim in front of Lily and discredit James.
