I don't believe that makes him awful, he's complicated and at the time this is happening, he's scared. Imagine you're in that position; you are an outcast in a society that despises your existence, but someone takes a chance on you. You get to be like everyone else for a while, but you come so close to almost killing a student and you hate yourself even more. You fight in a war, but are treated with suspicion even by your own friends, and that war ends up destroying those friends. Now you have nothing left and go to ground. One day the same person takes another chance only this time you are wracked with guilt, and your magic AIDS gets discovered, so you resign for valid reasons, and go to ground again but when the war starts in earnest again, you are there to help and fight again, only this time you lose your last friend and the last link to a happier time. You go undercover at great personal risk to help the war effort. The relationship you find yourself in, is complicated and messy and potentially toxic and you regret it. So, finally, at this point when the world seems most bleak, you run to the place where you feel most useful, only to be told that that was a mistake, and after 5 minutes you realise the truth and go running back to your wife. A few months later you die in the war that claimed all your friends.

Thats called being conflicted and being human, and i'd like to see others in the same situation try and make any different choices. Its very easy to cast aspersions about morality when you are an outside observer, but not when you've been pushed to breaking point. People are far too reductionist these days.
