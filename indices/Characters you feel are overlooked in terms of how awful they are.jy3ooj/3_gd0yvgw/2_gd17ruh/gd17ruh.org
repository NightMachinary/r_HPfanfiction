Real talk not only does he just run away, the Fanfics that say he's 100% a follower are right for this reason- Sirius dies. Harry's GODFATHER dies. And he willingly keeps Harry in the dark as he did before. No mention of the will or anything. Dumbledore is the only voice he cared about other than having Tonks in bed. I like him a lot, but when his â€˜best friends' son was once AGAIN alone with death- he ONCE AGAIN turned away.
