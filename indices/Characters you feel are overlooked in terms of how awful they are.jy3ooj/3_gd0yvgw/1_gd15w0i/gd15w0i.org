I love Remus, but I think about that a lot. He and Peter both were really questionable in terms of Gryffindor qualities, especially when it comes down to braveness. Between Remus running away when his wife got pregnant and not interfering (especially as a prefect) when the Marauders' pranks and bullying got out of hand... he's definitely a flawed character.
