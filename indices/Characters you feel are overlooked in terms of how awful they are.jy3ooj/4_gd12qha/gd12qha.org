Draco Malfoy. He said an orphan that he would die at the age of 11 that he would die like his parents. At 12 he wished for a student to be killed. At 13 he tried to give Harry information about Sirius Black and his betrayal and taunted him, trying to make him go after a supposed mass murderer. At 14, he tried his best to discredit Harry and even gave personal information about Harry to Rita Skeeter. At 15, he docked points from people because he didn't like them and from Hermione because she was a muggleborn. At 16, he almost used an unforgivable on another student(Don't give me that he was forced to bullshit). He was gleeful to be given the task to kill Dumbledore. He just realised that killing wasn't so easy. He almost killed two people. And Voldemort never forced Draco to use the cruciatus curse on Harry. It's just who he was. He was a racist, a pureblood supremacist, a bully, arrogant and an arsehole. His awfulness is forgotten and all Tom Felton fangirls start crushing on him. He suddenly becomes a a person with a golden heart hidden beneath his sneers. I have a question. What has he done to deserve forgiveness? He does marry a pureblood. (If JK wanted to show him change so much just make him marry at least a half-blood and use it according to your plot's convenience). He got much more than he deserved. He got a happy family, a job at the ministry and was never sent to prison.
