I saw a really interesting take on this in a fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]]. The author hypothesizes that Dumbledore got her the house to watch over Harry and, as a squib, Mrs. Figg couldn't hope for better than having an assigned post where she just needs to live. If Harry was removed from the Dursleys' care, she would be out of a home. It may not have been intentional, but she had a strong motive not to push too hard to have Harry taken away.
