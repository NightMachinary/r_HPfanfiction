I sometimes wonder about this. Petunia and Vernon were obsessed with appearing normal so maybe they tried hard not to make it obvious to the neighbors that they were bad to Harry. It can be difficult to notice what your neighbor is doing if they're actively hiding it.

(I need to reread the books if they ever did something so blatant to Harry outdoors. Canon and fanon writings can get mixed up in my head.)
