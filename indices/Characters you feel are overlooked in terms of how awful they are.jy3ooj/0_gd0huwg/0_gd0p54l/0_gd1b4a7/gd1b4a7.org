I definitely confuse canon and fanon, too! Here's some abuse from books where neighbors could see what was happening:

CoS:

> Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.

The paragraph immediately preceding this one takes place by the hedge, but Dudley ran to the house. It's not clear to me where this incident took place. It could be that it happened near the sink while she was washing a frying pan. It could also be that Dudley snitched on Harry and she came outside with the frying pan. In any case, the neighbors would be able to see this punishment:

> While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re- painted the garden bench.

OotP:

>he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.

This also isn't even including the more implicit stuff, like one little boy looking beaten down and miserable all day while the other boy is a bully whose violence is never discouraged.
