Fanfic isn't equal either. Ron-bashing has been done to death and fics where Harry is smarter, more cunning, more popular, hotter, etc are equally pervasive. The reason why Hermione is generally "left alone" is because fanon amps up what canon provided and her super-fans do the rest. Bringing up her ignored or glossed over flaws is fair game, and if annoys super-fans like you, all the better.
