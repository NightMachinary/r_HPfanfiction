There is a need to do that, because every thread that is about Hermione has to mention her being "abusive" when both Ron and Harry have done the same thing. Harry and Ron are never criticized this sub. There was one post about how Harry was a pretty bad friend, and it was downvoted to hell. Same with that thread that talked about how Ron was pretty shitty towards people. Both of them have around zero upvoted. Compare that with the multiple threads discussing how Hermione is a horrible person who brutally attacks innocent people like Umbridge and Rita Skeeter. Those threads all have at least 30 upvotes. Don't try to act like it's equal, because it's not.
