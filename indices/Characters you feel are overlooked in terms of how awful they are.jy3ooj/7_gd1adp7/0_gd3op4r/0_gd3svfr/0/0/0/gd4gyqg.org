  He sent an unknown orange spell at Ginny in HBP.

/Attempted/ assault at best; the spell never hit her. It's been implied by Ginny and other characters that Ginny's hexes actually hit people.

  It was after he told Ginny she was shaming the family by kissing her boyfriend and she responded that he was just jealous everyone else has kissed someone besides him.

Only one part of this statement is true. Ron said he didn't want people thinking she was a slut, not that she was "shaming the family".

  I don't think whether Ginny has attacked her brothers or not really matters.

So you're a misandrist. Gotcha. Glad we're clear on that.

  The only reason I pointed out Harry and Ron attacking the opposite gender was because I'm annoyed at how whenever Hermione is mentioned, her attacking Ron has to be brought up and how she's painted as an abuser.
#+end_quote

Harry did (thowing a badge at Ron and sending Hedwig to claw and scratch at Ron and Hermione), Ron didn't. The only other time where Ron "attacked" someone was Demelza during Quidditch practice, and that was clearly stated to be an accident. Hermione's painted as an abuser because she does abusive things. All you need to do is imagine Hermione as a guy and Ron as a girl and suddenly the tolerance for her actions during the series goes way down. But Hermione super-fans don't like to admit that because she's their goddess.
