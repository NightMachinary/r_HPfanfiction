  /Attempted/ assault at best; the spell never hit her.
#+end_quote

So you don't think attempted assault is just as bad as regular assault? The only reason it didn't hit him is because she dodged. If Ron dodged Hermione's attack, would that suddenly absolve her of all guilt?

#+begin_quote
  Only one part of this statement is true. Ron said he didn't want people thinking she was a slut, not that she was "shaming the family".
#+end_quote

*“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D'you think I want people saying my sister's a --- ”*

It's clear that he's saying he's more focused on what he'd feel in that situation. He couldn't care less about what Ginny thinks.

  So you're a misandrist. Gotcha. Glad we're clear on tha
#+end_quote

No, I am not a misandrist, I just feel that your speculation which has no basis in canon doesn't really matter in this situation. I'm not trying to put down Ron and imply he's a bad person for attacking Ginny. I am just trying to say that this sub needs to stop attacking Hermione for doing the same things Harry and Ron do. If Ginny actually attacked her brothers, it would be better for my case in defending Hermione.

Also, I feel you need control of your temper, since you reach a lot of absurd conclusions in your haste to defend Ron. Insulting me by saying I'm discriminatory towards half of the population is extremely hurtful and offensive. I've been put down and assumed to be many things because I am black. I've been called a coon, a ni**er, a knuckle dragger, an ape, and so many other names. After I got accepted into an elite STEM high school where everbody was rich and either white or Asian, I was constantly told that I wasn't worthy enough no matter my grades and how hard I worked to be the best. I can swear to you that I would never try to put someone down the way I have been put down before.

  All you need to do is imagine Hermione as a guy and Ron as a girl and suddenly the tolerance for her actions during the series goes way down.
#+end_quote

I did it, and I still really like her character. The only thing I would judge a male!Hermione harsher for is accepting Ron's disgusting treatment of him. I could get why canon Hermione did it, since from a young age, girls are told that the boys who pull on their hair and call them names actually have a crush on them.

#+begin_quote
  But Hermione super-fans don't like to admit that because she's their goddess.
#+end_quote

Again with the name calling. At least it wasn't offensive this time. Look, I will admit that there was a time where I basically worshipped Hermione. I wanted so badly to just keep my chin up when other people were deriding me, to be outspoken even when no one wants to hear what I have to say, and to fight against injustice even when others think I'm silly. But I grew up, and realized I'm my own person and that I don't need to idolize a fictional character. I think that's something you need to realize, since your obsession with Ron is unhealthy. Almost every one of your comments that I see have to either jerk off Ron or deride Hermione. The way you lash out and insult or try to hurt someone at any perceived injustice against him is a bit concerning. I honestly do not mean to offend you, and I'm truly sorry if I did. Good night!
