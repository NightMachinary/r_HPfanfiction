No, I am not glossing over their flaws. I am simply saying that Hermione shouldn't be judged harsher for doing the same things as Ron and Harry. That just seems like it's glossing over her flaws because you extremely dislike her. Regarding Ginny, it's never been said that she's hit any of her brothers, so she most likely mastered that hex without hurting anybody. You're reaching very hard just so that Ron and Ginny can be "equal", so stop trying to say I'm the one who's glossing over people's flaws.

I'm sorry I don't have encyclopedic knowledge of the books. I was wrong to not have checked the book first, but I'd hardly call that moving goal posts. Also, that quote was stating that she was shaming him, so it's not that different from shaming the whole family.

The "control your temper" comment was just because you insult people if they dare call out Ron's faults, even if I'm just trying to say that every character's faults should be judged the same. I don't know why that's so offensive to you. I really didn't mean to be insulting, and I'm sorry.

I also find it quite hypocritical for you to act like I'm the one who insults you, when your replies to me have been extremely aggressive. You can call me a misandrist and say that if Hermione bashing annoys Hermione Stans ike me, it's even better with literally no provocation, but if I say that you have an uncontrolled temper after you say stuff like that? I'm suddenly the rude one. Have a good day!
