He sent an unknown orange spell at Ginny in HBP. It was after he told Ginny she was shaming the family by kissing her boyfriend and she responded that he was just jealous everyone else has kissed someone besides him.

I don't think whether Ginny has attacked her brothers or not really matters. The only reason I pointed out Harry and Ron attacking the opposite gender was because I'm annoyed at how whenever Hermione is mentioned, her attacking Ron has to be brought up and how she's painted as an abuser.
