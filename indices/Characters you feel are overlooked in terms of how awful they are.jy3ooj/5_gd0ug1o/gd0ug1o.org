Zacharias Smith. In canon he is a big jerk to Harry during the DA recruitment session and during the first DA meeting. He also fled during the Battle of Hogwarts when all the younger students evacuated. At least he didn't betray the DA or fight against the defenders of the castle, but, still, he is a COWARD.

My head canon tells me that he was a very vocal anti-Harry proponent throughout the Tri-Wizard Tournament, even into the third task.
