I feel like saying anything but Draco here is nuts. Looking at the fandom, you would think he was a fourth member of the trio who courageously turned his back on the death eaters, I've seen it stated as if it were canon that he was second in the class a bunch of times. Like. There is literally nothing in common between the Draco in the books and the fandoms version of him. It's truly bizarre.

He was proud to be a death eater, everything he ever said and did was to hurt someone else, the only thing we know about his grades are that they were bad his first year and he showed up in potions year six, which could mean he got his potions owl or it could mean Snape let him in because he wanted to keep an eye on him.
