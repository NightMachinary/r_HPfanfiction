My least favourites are Barty Sr, who was, at /best/, neglectful at home on top of everything else... but also Snape for the reasons people usually dislike Snape, Fudge for the reasons people usually dislike Fudge, and Lupin, for much the same reasons already stated in this thread.

Further to previous answers, Lupin also never tried to contact Harry, even after he entered Hogwarts, until he became a Professor and was forced into proximity. Never wrote, even when Harry was announced as a Triwizard Champion. He doesn't seem to particularly care about him at all.
