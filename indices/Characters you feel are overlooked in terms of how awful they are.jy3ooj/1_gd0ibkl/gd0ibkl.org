None other than Cornelius Fudge. Everyone seems to forget that Umbridge's reign of terror at Hogwarts was only possible with his active support. No doubt he was behind the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet. More people should call him out for sticking his attack dog on them, the coward, instead of facing the reality of Voldemort's return and installing some safeguards to prepare Britain for war. I just really, really loathe that despicable cretin for making Voldemort's life so much easier and I feel like more people should too.
