  I don't want to not be able to help new writers grow.

Then I don't understand what the purpose of the AMA would be. Shouldn't we be asking experienced, successful authors questions of how they design and execute their fanfics from start to finish? Floreat has completed almost every story she's started. The other author you mentioned hasn't finished one since 2009. The fandom is awash in abandoned stories. Let's give our attention to the ones who see their fics through to the end.

Encouraging new authors is and should always be a vitally important part of this subreddit. I'm just not certain that an AMA would be the best way to go about that.
