This is an awesome idea! I think we should try to group authors who write about similar topics together... The questions we might ask the author of HPMoR (for example) may be different than the ones we would ask the author of Grow Young With Me, because they are fics with completely different focuses and purposes. And I wouldn't want some of the authors to feel like they can't answer half the questions because it doesn't apply. Unless I'm overthinking it.
