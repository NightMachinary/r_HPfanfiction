I've read (the first few chapters of) a few Indy!Harry fics where the author seems to believe that writing Harry as an enormous twat makes him “cool”. But I doubt that's what you're looking for.

In linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) I found Harry to be an apathetic asshole, though it's well written enough that I finished it. Haven't picked up the sequel yet though.
