True, but it's actually well-written, with interesting snowball effects.

As I recall, "Ronnie" is not particularly afraid of spiders because Fred couldn't bring himself to turn her teddy bear into a spider after she broke his toy.

Because of that, Ronnie talks Harry into seeing Lee Jordan's tarantula.

And that means that Harry and Ronnie weren't there when the trolley witch made her rounds.

So somebody else bought Albus Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog.

Which means Harry and friends don't have their big clue to Flamel's identity.
