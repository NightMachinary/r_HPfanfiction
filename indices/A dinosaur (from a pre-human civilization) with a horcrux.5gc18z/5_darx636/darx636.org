SharpFastTalons lurked in the underbrush, watching his prey as it drank from the river. He sneaked closer, silent despite his foot long toe-claws cutting into ground beneath him. The fat FoodLizard twitched, it's super-vision and danger-smelling powers working at their peak. SharpFastTalons froze, just too far away for a leaping killing chompslash to the neck of the fat FoodLizard.

SharpFastTalons flexed his legs, and his head, and his teeth and claws. He could picture it, the perfect arc that would sever the FoodLizard's leg strength with both of his feet, and land with his mouth right there on the back of it's neck. He coiled his tail, and his legs, and with a roar so powerful it gave him just enough thrust, SharpFastTalons launched himself into the air towards dinner. The FoodLizard saw it coming from the reflection in the water, but it was not enough time to do more than gain knowledge of its imminent death.

"Baaaaaaiiiiieeeeeee-" The FoodLizard cried out, cut short by SharpFastTalons snapping it's neck with one fierce chomp. SharpFastTalons drooled with happiness, and dragged its dinner away from the shore and into the underbrush to eat. He relaxed his legs and claws, but maintained his focus on flexing his head and teeth. He needed sharp teeth to eat better, and he needed his head to think better. He could already tell that his thinking helped, he had a big dinner right in front of him just waiting to be eaten!

SharpFastTalons tore into his dinner with reckless precision, flaying the FoodLizard with quick strokes of his claws and gobbling down the flesh and organs with quick bites. He continued to think, now that he could, and flexing his thinker back on itself even harder didn't seem to have much of an effect, in comparison to the first time. Which he hadn't relaxed at all, unlike his legs and claws, though his thinker didn't seem to be getting tired. His legs could only run him half a day, much less if he ran extra fast, but his thinker seemed to keep thinking on just fine with no wear. "Excellent," SharpFastTalons thought to himself. "I will be able to catch and eat anything! And nothing will be able to eat me, not even GiantScary or the SuperExtraDeath!"

... i was gonna keep going, with how the magic velociraptor taught itself how to magic, and somehow made a horcrux, and tried to take over the dinosaur world, and then killed everything on accident, including himself. so he just hung out, mostly dead for an long ass while, and i dunno what happened when he met HP or LV or whatever, but I think it was gonna turn into a horror story where it came back and then just ate everyone, one by one. i dunno. im not gonna keep going.
