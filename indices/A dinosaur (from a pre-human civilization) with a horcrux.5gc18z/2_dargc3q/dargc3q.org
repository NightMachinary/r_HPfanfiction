I can actually see this being a really good villain for an OP!Harry fic where he easily deals with Voldemort. A primordial immortal dinosaur wizard who wants to kill everything/conquer/whatever could make for a really cool and interesting villain. Creepy, but also really interesting. And I like the whole magic is older than you think theme that it would have going.
