I recall a short story where Herpo the Foul comes back to life, but it turns out he wasn't foul at all --- just an incredibly lonely fellow suffering from the stigma against Parseltongue, who bred his basilisks as an attempt to have someone to talk to (since no human would, and most snakes were too stupid), and creating a Horcrux to try and survive the numerous times the locals tried to lynch him.
