Sooner or later I should post a request for subversions of the "Yer a wizard, Harry" line.

Like, "Yer a lizard, Harry" (as you just mentioned), or "You're a wizard, Hagrid" (I've seen that in a short story where Hagrid is removed from his Care of Magical Creatures job to finish his Hogwarts Schooling), or "Yer a muggle, Harry" (idea I had before involving muggles going to the wizards dimension and overwriting the local laws of physics with their technology), or "It's yer blizzard, Harry" (Hagrid breaks the news that Harry is a mutant with power over storms)...
