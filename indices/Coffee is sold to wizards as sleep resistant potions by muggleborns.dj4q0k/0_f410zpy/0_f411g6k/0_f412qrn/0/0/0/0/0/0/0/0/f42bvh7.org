Lucas' real talent, and I say it as a HUGE Star Wars nerd, was stealing established stories and tropes and creating something grand out of it. The Original Trilogy is a masterpiece of storytelling, because it follows all the traditional tropes and paths.

What, I believe, was Lucas' greatest triumph was translating those tropes into modern language (by the standards of the 70s and 80s). He modernized them by adding beautiful space ships, droids, aliens etc. That's his true skill. Cultural translation.
