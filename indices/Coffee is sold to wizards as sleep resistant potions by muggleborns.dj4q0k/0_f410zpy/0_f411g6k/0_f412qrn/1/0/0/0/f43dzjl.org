I'm from Europe and it was totally different for us. We were computer crazy as fuck. Anything to do with new technology we took as gospel and absorbed like a sponge. Modems were common knowledge by 1993 and hard lines were common by 1998-1999. Hell we even wanted to start our own hard line in the summer of 1999 but someone, an older neighbour, beat us to it and now he has a huge company. The bastard. :D
