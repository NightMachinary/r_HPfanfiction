That's partially true - you need to remember the timeline of the books though. The battle of hogwarts was in spring of 1998. There were absolutely people who, in the early to mid 90s, had no idea what the internet could do.

Remember AOL? The mass mail campaign started the summer before third year (93), and I'd argue that's where most people's knowledge of the internet came from.... in the USA and Canada at least. I remember wanting to try it in maybe 96-97 when we got our first home computer, but none of the numbers were local so we didn't lol.
