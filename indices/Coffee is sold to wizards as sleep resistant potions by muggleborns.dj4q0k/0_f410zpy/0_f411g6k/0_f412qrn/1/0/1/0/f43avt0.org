I remember being giddy as fuck when I got win 95 on a CD. Before that time most CDs were only used for music and even games were usually on several floppies (no copyright law until 1994 and even later few people bothered with it).

But the knowledge of the internet was always there. We were all familiar with the sound: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDE9b5iU8vI]]

And if we used it, we had a timer to always stop at 9:59 or something similar, when we pulled the cable out or shut the application.
