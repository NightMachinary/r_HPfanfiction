I knew about computers running on DOS in the early 90's, windows 95 somewhere in the mid 90's and then internet in the late 90's. Banks and offices used it but personal home use was for a few privileged people. We got our dial up modem when the bank my aunt was working in decided to upgrade their modems and give away the old ones.
