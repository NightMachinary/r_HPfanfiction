I can understand Wizard's not understanding the Internet in the 90s, or being wary of television (but considering they know radio, television is probably common knowledge), but this is way outside normal levels of suspension of disbelief.

And, no, don't quote Arthur Weasley on me. JKR was as inconsistent as it comes with her world building.

I really dislike the ignorant wizard trope. Magic can do everything muggles do, but better, I'm sure Wizarding Wireless had no frequency issues or lost signal.
