Depending on how their 'coffee culture' has advanced betwixt the Statute and the present, it might be even worse than that! See, once upon a time, coffee was /hugely/ popular in Britain. It was the drink of scholars, politicians, natural philosophers, all sorts of intelligence minded folks - they would gather at coffeehouses to debate and discuss. But coffee was taxed similar to alcohol - by the gallon - so the coffeehouse would make it up in advance, in great quantities, and then when someone ordered a "dish" of coffee it would be reheated and served.

So, picture something like gas station coffee that was cheap beans to start with, over roasted, over brewed, left to get cold and then reheated. Instant actually seems preferable at that point...

Anyway, I would highly recommend "A History of the World In Six Glasses," amazing book teaching popular beverages and the effect they had on civilization's development.
