Good to know that the Isles were the same as the rest of Europe. Admittedly my knowledge of the culture, especially the food culture, of what was to become the UK is lacking. Never had any interest in that particular aspect. But it seems it was the same as everywhere else. Good to know. And validates my point even more. :D

P.S. I will definitely put more books about English/UK cuisine on my itinerary.
