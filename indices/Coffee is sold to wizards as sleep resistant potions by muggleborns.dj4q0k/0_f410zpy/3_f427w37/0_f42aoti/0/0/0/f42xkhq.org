It really is a fascinating book, I can't recommend it highly enough. Covers coffee and tea, beer, wine, and spirits (mostly rum, as it applied to the Triangle Trade and the exploitation of Africa and the Caribbean), and then Coca-Cola and how it helped spread American culture/ideals globally. It tends to be a bit micro- and Western-focused (beer and wine are centered around Rome and Greece, no real discussion of Asia or Africa), but overall really educational.
