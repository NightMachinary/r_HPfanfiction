Okay... that's the most common understanding, that's prevalent in the fandom. But dig deeper. If you transfigure snow into iron, it behaves like Iron right? It has the same properties as iron, same denseness etc.

If it has the same properties as iron why don't other transfigured things? You can transfigure items into chickens. If you transfigure snow into iron, why can't transfigured chickens be just chickens, at least for the time of the transfiguration, why couldn't it lay eggs, it has all the parts, doesn't it'?

We're delving into the metaphysical here. The intangible properties of magic, which are open to interpretation, since they aren't bound by the physical world and explaining them in the term of physics, chemistry and the like is futile.

It's magic.
