Plausible. One of the things I'm not sure is ever covered is "can you eat a transfigured animal," or for that matter, "what happens when a transfigured animal dies."

I can't conjure a chicken sandwich, but can I turn a cushion into a chicken, butcher and fry it? Is an animal transfigured from an inanimate object /actually/ alive in the first place?

(I prefer to think of them as drones - not actually alive or capable of feeling - mostly for my own moral peace of mind. There's a lot of fridge horror in Harry Potter.)
