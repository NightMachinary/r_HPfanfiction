IMO transfiguration is turning one thing into other that looks, has physical dimensions and maybe physical properties (like tensile strenght, mass, etc implanted by magic) of the desired object, but ultimately is still the base object. Otherwise there wouldn't be alchemy - a subject concerned with truly turning one substance into another. That's why you can't really transfigure food, or, for that matter, eat a transfigured chicken
