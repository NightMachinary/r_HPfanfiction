I can't believe the older students at Hogwarts (apart from the more prejudiced Slytherins) to not partake in any of the more common drugs of the 90s. As you say, they were common as fuck.

The only think that would hold a Hogwarts' drug ring back was the lack of chemicals. It would be difficult to get all the supplies during the school year.

Unless someone was a real dealer and not just an opportunistic one and had access to enough chems to synthesize enough between school breaks and restocking. An interesting prompt for a fic btw, thanks.
