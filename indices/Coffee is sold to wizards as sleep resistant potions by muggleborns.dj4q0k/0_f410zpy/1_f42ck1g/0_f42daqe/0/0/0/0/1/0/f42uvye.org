Hmmm... are drugs more complex than a chicken?

Probably not.

Is the idea of a chicken more complex than a drug?

Probably yes.

Transfiguration in JKR's world, doesn't follow any logic. Gamp Laws make it so that food, sustenance, can't be created from non-food. Probably true for drugs, which affect the body in a similar, if different, manner as well.
