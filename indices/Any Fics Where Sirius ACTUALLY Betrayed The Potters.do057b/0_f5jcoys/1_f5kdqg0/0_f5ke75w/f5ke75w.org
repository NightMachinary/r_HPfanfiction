This was the only fic I could recall off the top of my head where Sirius was like, "yep, I did it. I'd do it again, too." His motivations are understandable (if not excusable), and he was something of a tragic figure.

There's a lot of tragedy in this series, really interesting world building but it doesn't hesitate to shake things up. Lotta sacred cows get slaughtered.
