It's a toss up.

Some people cannot stand characters that aren't black or white. They want to be able to fit characters in a nice little box and throw away the key.

Some people on the other hand, can relate deeply to a character. Some saw Dumbledore as fatherly figure. His actions, knowing of the ten dark years Harry suffered felt like a betrayal.

Especially if they too were abused as children. It hits too close to home in the sense that "nobody believed me when I said I was abused." "Nobody came to rescue me, they saw my suffering and looked the other way."

I have read bashing fics that clearly felt like a stand in for someone else. The way Dumbledore was portrayed felt like it was a personal issue and it was the only way the author could vent their frustrations.

In other cases, it's just bad writing. The Indy Harry has to shine because a competent Dumbledore renders the independent Harry trope unless.

Edit: grammar.
