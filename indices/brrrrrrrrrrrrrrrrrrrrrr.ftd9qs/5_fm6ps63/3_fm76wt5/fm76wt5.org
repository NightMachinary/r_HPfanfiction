Because writing a nuanced, flawed but ultimately good character is difficult, and reducing them to a two-dimensional caricature is easier?

I always think the mark of a good fanfic is how well Dumbledore is written. He has to capture that kindliness and that power. He has to exude that sense of regret for the past, while also having come to terms with himself.

Angry or angsty (or even alcoholic in one fic I read!) Dumbledore misses the mark, badly.
