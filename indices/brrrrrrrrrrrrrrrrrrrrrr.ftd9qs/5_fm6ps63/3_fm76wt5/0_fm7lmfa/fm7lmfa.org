  I always think the mark of a good fanfic is how well Dumbledore is written. He has to capture that kindliness and that power. He has to exude that sense of regret for the past, while also having come to terms with himself.

Agreed, I normally find that how well Dumbledore is written normally reflects on the writing of the whole fic, it's always a turn off when people just make him a two dimensional evil old man.

Many fics do quite interesting character studies of him though, making for quite an interesting character.
