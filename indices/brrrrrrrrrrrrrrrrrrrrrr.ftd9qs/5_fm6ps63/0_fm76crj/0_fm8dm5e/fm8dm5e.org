It's more than that - IMO, it's mostly due to the disconnect as the series evolved. Dumbledore's actions in the earlier books are completely fine... if viewed through the light of a children's book, where things get exaggerated, the adults are made to be incompetent so that our plucky heroes can save the day despite being 12, and certain actions (eg, what the Dursleys do) is played more for laughs than seriously.

So, if the series had continued as it had for the first 3-3.5 books, Dumbledore would have fit right in.

The disconnect comes when the books become more young adult, and have to grapple with the previous years. Years and actions that were not meant to be taken more seriously, or fit in a 'grittier'/more adult oriented universe suddenly have to be explained. So instead of being able to say that the obstacle course was easy enough for 1st years so that Harry could be the hero in a children's book, we need to try to reconcile it with a serious Dumbledore. The decision to leave Harry at the Dursleys - and with more seriously treated abuse - is similar.

I think that's where most of the disconnect comes from - looking back at his early actions through the lens of a changing book series, instead of realizing that if it were written at that level the whole time, it'd have to be different.
