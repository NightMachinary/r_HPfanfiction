I am pretty sure the point was to catch the would be thief, not to leave it there permanently(Flamel would die otherwise), the obstacles allow you to stall the potential thief and give you a chance to catch them, Dumbledore did after all arive just shortly after quirrel reached the mirror and would probably have caught him and Voldemort then if Harry didn't kill Quirrel.
