It also becomes a matter of magic. Is the “obtain but not use” piece of magic an integral part of the Mirror's magic when used to store objects? Or was it an enchantment set up by Dumbledore in order to use the Mirror as storage?

Voldemort is described as a highly intelligent and powerful wizard, it is not so inconceivable that he could have obtained the stone, if not by “solving” Dumbledore's puzzle, by breaking/dismantling the enchantments.

Of course if it is the first option then probably he wouldn't have been able to break down a magical artifact in little time.
