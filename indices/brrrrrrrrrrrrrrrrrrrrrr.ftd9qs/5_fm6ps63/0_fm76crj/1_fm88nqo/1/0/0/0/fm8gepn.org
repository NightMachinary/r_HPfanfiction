Can you please explain how Voldemorts intelligence matters here?

He is faced with a problem he doesn't know the solution off, and even if he did he would only have minutes before Dumbledore arrived, there is nothing suggesting that he would have the ability to somehow obtain the stone. Just for comparison it took him months to find out how to get past fluffy and even that process required preparation.
