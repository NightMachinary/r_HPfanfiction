I did write what I consider to be a novelisation of CC, but it's probably not quite what you want or would expect. I made a few things a bit different because the plot of CC is so appallingly badly constructed, I'm sure Jack Thorne (who I wouldn't trust with an episode of Teletubbies) must have scribbled it on the back of a fag packet during a liquid lunch.
