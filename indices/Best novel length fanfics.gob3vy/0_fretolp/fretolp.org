I'm not sure if it qualifies as "best" but it's one of the longest Harry Potter fanfics in my favorites, at over 300,000 words. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11495654/1/The-Definition-of-Normal][/The Definition of Normal/]].

For anyone that's curious, the /longest/ fanfic on my favorites is a /Naruto///Mass Effect/ crossover that's over 1.59 million words long. For the sake of comparison, the entire /Harry Potter/ series of novels is about 1.08 million words long.
