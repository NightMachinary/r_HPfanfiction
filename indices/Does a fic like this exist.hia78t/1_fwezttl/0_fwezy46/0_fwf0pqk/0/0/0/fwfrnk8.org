It looks like you're not understanding the request. In this type of story, the time traveler would try to change something from their timeline, like the time Harry got expelled from Hogwarts in first year for that remembrall incident with Draco. The time traveler would get some wild plan to get Harry put on the quidditch team instead. Maybe it took an imperius curse on McGonagall to do it.
