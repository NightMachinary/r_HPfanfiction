E. C. Scrubb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When a Veela Cries]] has Harry at Durmstrang for a good part of the fic. It's a bit of an angst-fest, but might be something you'd enjoy.

Another is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] by Halt.CPM. 40k words, updated in November.

  People fear Voldemort for his power -- a striking combination of innate genius and surgical precision. People fear Grindelwald for the men he led and the system he created. Voldemort or Grindelwald, Mr. Potter, which one are you? HP/FD AU - Inspired by Santi's BWL and Fettucini's Knowledge is Power. Durmstrang!Harry with a focus on politics and economics later on.
