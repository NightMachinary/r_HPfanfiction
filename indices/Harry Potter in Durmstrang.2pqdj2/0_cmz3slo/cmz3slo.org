[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] has a Durmstrang Harry. The author self-identifies it as being heavily inspired by The Santi's story, so there will probably be some familiar elements. It has a few issues that damage my enjoyment, but it's still early enough (fic is 40K-ish words at the moment) that I'll reserve judgment. Might tide you over, though.
