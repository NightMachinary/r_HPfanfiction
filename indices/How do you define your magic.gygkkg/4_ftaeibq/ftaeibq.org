When writing, I generally do not pay attention to an elaborate magical system since canon does not seem to have strict rules besides a few which are the result of plot demands (eg no food transfiguration, which even contradicts canon since you can transfigure animals, which can be butchered for meat).

Whenever I need a particular spell, I tend to either straight-up use canon or invent something which is similar to already existing spells (eg a blasting curse which is simply a stronger reducto/movie canon what Umbridge used).

I despise duelling as a sport and tend to avoid it, both while reading and writing. In combat, most spells are either useless in the setting (the fight against magical Nazis and their extermination policies) or too slow to be used outside of cover (eg creating animals). Why would you disarm a Death Eater when you can "disarm" them with Sectumsempra? Why would you not use lethal force against an opponent trying to kill you? There is a reason the world wars were not fought with rubber bullets after all. Flashy fights work well in movies, but tend to be bloat in writing, especially if lives are not at stake (eg a duelling tournament).

This leaves you with an arsenal of ~5 spells for the good side, plus some niece ones not aimed at the enemy (healing, entrenching, stealth). The Dark side is not limited since Dark Magic is properly fucked up and gives you access to basically any way to kill a human being ever invented. And that is probably enough to describe any serious fight I might ever write. IMO it is better to describe the effects spells have and how they look rather than writing something akin to "Harry fired off a chain of spells starting with a foot-lock followed by a body-bind and (...)"
