I asked and I received a novel argument (explosion curses)

  But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood.

  “Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.

  Levicorpus (nvbl)

  While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . . that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far. Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.
#+end_quote

In either case of Snape casting sectumsempra, there is no description of a difficult or unique wand motion. Snape left notes with the special requirements of another spell. Levicorpus works fine with Harry's upward flick, seemingly demonstrating that wand motions take a backseat to magical theory. Lupin confirms levicorpus works fine and Snape left no special notes for sectrumsempra (like a wand motion needed for full effectivness)

#+begin_quote
  He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefy!”
#+end_quote

This seems to be consistent with other offensive spells as well. It seems that with enough study of magical theory, wand motions can step aside in favor of practice, magical knowledge, and experience. That or some spells do not have unique wand motions.

#+begin_quote
  “SECTUMSEMPRA!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.
#+end_quote

First cast by Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, “Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!”
#+end_quote

Later Harry casts sectumsempra with additional practice (something that makes a huge difference with other spells - we see Harry's protego and summoning charm improve immensely with practice) with little improvement in offensive capability.

#+begin_quote
  “No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. “You haven't got the nerve or the ability ---”
#+end_quote

Snape, who abhors Harry and everything he stands for (the reason for the death of Lily), takes particular care in insulting Harry's ability to cast the unforgivables.

#+begin_quote
  “You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them --- I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no!”
#+end_quote

No mention of Harry lacking knowledge or ability to cast sectumsempra or levicorpus. Along with no improvement in the spell's effectiveness from practice, it seems to be a safe conclusion that Harry is a competent caster of sectumsempra.

#+begin_quote
  Harry almost killed Malfoy with his first attempt and no proper instruction (wand movement and the like). Landing a follow up will probably be a lot easier in that case, almost comparable to outright stunning.
#+end_quote

Yes, I don't deny that sectumsempra is lethal.

#+begin_quote
  If you hit properly

  almost comparable to outright stunning.
#+end_quote

Quite telling.

#+begin_quote
  Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword.

  his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.

  He supported Malfoy across the bathroom
#+end_quote

Again we see the difference between stopping power and lethality. It certainly seems lethal enough but Malfoy (again a complete pussy) is able to move his hands, enough to have grabbed his wand and remain a threat if he wasn't such a coward.

#+begin_quote
  He supported Malfoy across the bathroom
#+end_quote

Even after time has elapsed and more blood has been lost, even after his wounds have been healed, allowing for shock and pain to set in (pain does not always set in after traumatic injuries), Malfoy is able to walk supported by Snape.

#+begin_quote
  The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. . . .
#+end_quote

Well that worked out great for Hermione. One blasting curse we see in the books bounced around, seemingly hard to control. The deadly shrapnel from the spell seems to have cut Harry's cheek and the explosion might have burnt Harry's hand a bit. Such stopping power (incidentally working against the casters) has rendered Harry so combat-incapable that a toddler could take him.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. “I'm so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have --- must have hit ---”
#+end_quote

Looks like I was mistaken, it was so effective that it did render Harry combat-incapable by snapping his wand. Of course it wasn't intended to so it certainly seems like there are easier ways to disarm people.

#+begin_quote
  The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them ---
#+end_quote

Though not confirmed to be a blasting curse, I'm going to treat it was a blasting curse (and the most successful use of it as well). As a small aside, this seems to what I was going to argue later about shrapnel with blasting curses. Treating a blasting curse like an omnidirectional explosion, I find it unlikely that it would actually result in the release of a lot of deadly shrapnel. If it hits the floor, the shrapnel will be forced down. It's why fragmentation grenades and other shrapnel-based devices rely on careful design to ensure propagation of shrapnel. Indeed, this seems to be confirmed by this passage as Fred's body isn't described as riddle with shrapnel.

Now onto my analysis of the effectiveness. It seems that its main killing power comes from the force of the blast. The curse hit point-blank a group of five people with no shields protecting them. The curse promptly render 1/5 combat-ineffective, seemingly unfazed 2/5 of the group, and both hindered and aided Harry and Hermione by throwing them away (and throwing off any potential enemy's aim. Fair enough, it's effective though a bit risky and seems consistent with other uses of confringo. Four out of five retain wands and are combat-compable afterwards. It seems like confringo doesn't always destroy wands, only when it backfires on the casters.

  the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
