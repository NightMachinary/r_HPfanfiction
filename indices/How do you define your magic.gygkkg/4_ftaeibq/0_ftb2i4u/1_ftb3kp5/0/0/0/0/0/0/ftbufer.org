Similarly, a force pushed the death eater. It was more effective, however, because the death eater was on broom.

  “Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.

Turns out we do see another explosion-based spell. This one is, given that it seems to both push and disarm Harry. Not terribly effective considering Harry can still pick up his wand but it is effective. All in all, you've made a point I agree with, though I do think you overestimate its effectiveness. We don't see Voldemort and Dumbledore using explosion curses, another hint towards them not being quite that useful. One explosion curse threatens its own caster on occasion and the other still has limited effectiveness, only pushing with no noticeable heat or shrapnel from the explosion.

You do have a point and I do think it would make a good alternative after the killing curse, stunner, and dolohov's unknown spell. That said, it really pushes people more and might only kill a fraction of some people grouped together. I'd also suspect (intuitively) that a shield charm would find defending against explosion-based curses far more easily, though obviously I have no canonical evidence to support this assertion.

  And you still haven't addressed the issue of people screaming in pain, which demoralises their side while someone needs to attend them for a lot longer than simply reversing a stunner.

Well, again lack of stopping power means someone could heal themselves. Someone reversing a stunner is going to be vulnerable (someone stunned also can't revive themselves), someone stunned is vulnerable to a finishing blow,

It seems to take a while to recover from a stunning, at a level comparable to recovery from healing via sectumsempra. And again, one can't revive themselves though they can heal themselves. If preventing healing is so important, why not use Dolohov's curse instead of sectumsempra? It's superior in every way to sectumsempra.

Back to the first part of this, I'd first like to point out that screaming isn't always guaranteed from trauma. Pain can take a while to kick in. Again, I've seen people walk off stab wounds and getting shot until the adrenaline wears off in treatment. Even if they are screaming, I find it unlikely that the Order or Death Eaters are going to be demoralized to an extent that their fighting is actually impacted. I mean it would take an exceptionally stupid person to focus on screaming (common in battles). I can't find an example in the books of someone freezing up when their colleagues are in pain or killed and I welcome examples to the contrary (I didn't search very thoroughly for this).

I think the most telling evidence is my favor is that we see aurors (elite fighters) favor the stunning spell over cutting spells, and Dumbledore and Voldemort favoring transfiguration. Ironically, it seems the most effective AOE spells are transfigurations and manipulation of said transfigurations.

Split because it was too long.
