Yes? That said, the fact that they use it clearly shows that it's very effective in combat. Neville Longbottom might be unable to use it because he isn't a very skilled wizard, but he should if he can cast the spells needed.

I can't believe you missed the whole spiel on how often stopping power is overestimated. We literally see that the spell which cut off an ear is incapable of rendering Draco Malfoy combat-incapable and he's a complete pussy. Sectumsempra may be lethal but may not stop your opponent from taking you with them.

I'd like to see you provide a novel counter argument instead of arguing the same points over and over again without evidence.

Edit: I apologize, that was rude. That said, I'm frustrated by the repeating nature of our argument.
