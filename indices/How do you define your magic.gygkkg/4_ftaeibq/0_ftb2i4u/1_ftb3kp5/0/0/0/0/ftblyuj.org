If you hit properly, your opponent won't be able to take you with him because you cleaved him in 2. Harry almost killed Malfoy with his first attempt and no proper instruction (wand movement and the like). Landing a follow up will probably be a lot easier in that case, almost comparable to outright stunning.

Area of effect spells (anything which explodes) are more dangerous because even a near miss will do a lot of damage (akin to a landmine), or even comparable to an artillery hit a foot from your foot whereas a stunner might scorch the pavement.

And you still haven't addressed the issue of people screaming in pain, which demoralises their side while someone needs to attend them for a lot longer than simply reversing a stunner.

And speaking of explosive spells, if you can reach the same casting speed, the equivalent of a mortar barrage will do a lot more than a comparable barrage of stunners due to secondary effects (shrapnel) and have a significantly suppressive effect, nevermind that it is probably more effective in a target-rich environment.
