I disagree considering Dumbledore employed these tactics against Voldemort (the two most capable at magic and combat). It seems that the main limitation of these tactics is skill and not how combat-feasible it is. Also I feel like interrogating someone is kind of difficult if they're stunned.

I think you also underestimate adrenaline and one's ability to fight through pain. Harry throws off the aftermath of /Voldemort's cruciatus/ to dodge Voldemort's spells and get away. I have seen people get shot in the head, chest, and limbs and manage to get away. I've seen people stabbed in the guts who manage to overpower their attackers and get away. People remain combat capable through terrible pain and eventually-lethal injuries. Why do you think assault rifles use higher calibers? Pistol calibers don't often have immediate stopping power, though they inflict wounds that /are/ lethal. These are muggles too, wizards are even more resilient.
