  People can be revived from stunning spells. It's interesting to note that it still takes a while for them to be combat capable once more. However, once stunned, one cannot wake themselves up, leaving one vulnerable to coup de grace

You are right in a 1v1. Or even if you want to interrogate someone.

However, one thing you are forgetting is that if you cleave through someone's chest or abdomen, they will be in a lot of pain, bleeding heavily and trying to hold that hand to their stump or keep their guts inside. They will, most likely, be unable to heal themselves due to pain and/or having their hands full with their own entrails/limbs. And that will have a psychological impact on their comrades.

  Your opponent hiding in a room behind a shield? Conjure, animate, and disillusion.

If you have the time, any of those is a great force multiplier. But if you are in the middle of a fight, you need to disengage first to get any of those done, and that can leave you quite vulnerable.
