Thanks you! And yep, latin. Do you perchance recognize animus from the animus bell?

Anyway, one examples of a grace is the cheering charm- it's specifically made to cheer people up! The warming charm and most healing spells also work, as do the mending charm and the patronus charm. Another idea I've had is the Steadying charm- incantation 'stabilus'- that can help a nauseated or tired person stay on their feet, (kind of the opposite of the tripping jinx.)
