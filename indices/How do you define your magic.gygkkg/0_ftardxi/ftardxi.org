I love the idea of graces, blessings and boons (very nice names as well). Now that you think about it, there seem to be a lot of hexes, jinxes and curses mentioned in the series compared to "good" spells like Episkey.

I'm just wondering - where did you get your name for the Boons (I only recognize Animus)? From Latin?
