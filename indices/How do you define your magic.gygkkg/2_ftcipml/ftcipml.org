I have a pretty bare bones magic system written up, defining the different branches of magic. Inspired by both canon and fanon (canon has some decent ideas but is quite disappointing when really looking into it).

-Aka "Life Magic"

-Spells that provide protection or healing

-Ex. Patronus, medical spells, shield charms

-Aka "Death magic"

-Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses

Neutral Magic:

-Magic that does not have a significant positive or negative effect on a subject

-All other magic

Transfiguration:

-Spells that cause a physical transformation to a subject

-Neutral

Charms:

-Spells cause a change in the properties of a subject

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Runes:

-Symbols used to channel magic through

-Used for Rituals, Enchantments, or Alchemy

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Rituals:

-Ceremonies used to cast a long-lasting or permanent effect on a living subject

-Light, Dark, or Neutral

Enchantments:
