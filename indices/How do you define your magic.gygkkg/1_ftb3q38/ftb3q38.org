There is no such thing as power, only control. You bend the magic into different forms, the more control you have the better it's going to turn out. Some people are born with greater control than others and thus have a easier time mastering spells. And some people naturally manipulate their magic in ways suited for different fields.

Another one is; magic is actually magic. There is nothing scientific about it and there is no logic attached. So technology will never be able to sense it or replicate it. Magic is mostly trial and error, there are no set patterns and things that are thought to be true are often disproven.
