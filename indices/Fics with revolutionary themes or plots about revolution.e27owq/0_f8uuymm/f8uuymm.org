The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina has a revolution in Hogwarts during 5th year that spirals out into the rest of Wizarding Britain. Basically young Purebloods read Marx, Sartre and other authors and their magical minds are blown. The winds of revolution blow soon after, all over Umbridge. The Ministry is a lot more sinister in tone than canon.
