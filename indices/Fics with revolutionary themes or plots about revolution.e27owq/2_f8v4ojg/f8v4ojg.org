Since you mentioned Divided and Entwined, a lot of the other fics by the same author have similar anti government revolutionary themes. Marriage Law Revolution is quite similar but post VW2, Returned Reformed and Really Trying is a bit more humorous revolution with DL Grindelwald, Democracy is about peacefully abolishing the old system through politics, Spygirl has a similar "let's blow them up with lots of explosives" theme, Lady Thief has more spying and breaking into places while also politicking, Patron is more about the Voldemort war than about anti government stuff, and Granger Principle is more muggle style battle and espionage.
