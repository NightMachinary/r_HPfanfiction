Yeah, canon Draco is just a little prat with no gravitas. He's a cowardly bully with no depth - he's not a good guy, he's not a good Death Eater, he's just a prat. Taking him seriously in a fic without him being OOC would take some /seriously/ good writing to shift me away from how Rowling wrote Draco.
