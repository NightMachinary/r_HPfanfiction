Draco recognises Harry at Malkin's. He's restrained around him rather than abrasive, as a properly ambitious politician should be. He gets his father to take over from Hagrid, who has had several drinks at this point and is a wee bit tipsy. They spend the day together, and by the end of it Harry's properly outfitted like a pureblood.

At Hogwarts, Harry's first ambition is to become strong enough that no one can hurt him. As a secondary ambition, he wants to show off his intelligence, since he never had been able to when Dudley was around.

The Dark Arts are a shortcut to strength. They come with high costs, but they work. The Malfoy library has plenty of information on them, and Lucius and Narcissa both have practical experience. And Draco's got years of experience in Magical Britain and can teach him a lot.

On Draco's side, the Boy Who Lived comes with a lot of fame and no ill will. (For most of the people who matter, anyway.) It's just common sense for him to attach himself to Harry. Part of their relationship is an exasperated "you /can't/ be that ignorant of politics / fashion / propriety / what have you in Magical Britain, can you?" -- but that eventually makes him realize that Muggleborns are in the same boat as Harry. Bit of an intellectual meltdown for him. He settles out into accepting Harry and giving Muggleborns half a chance, but they really ought to learn the culture.

Studying together eventually coalesces into something more, especially when Draco dredges up some of the milder Dark artefacts from his family's collection, ones that won't trigger the Trace but will intimidate the Dursleys into treating him humanely.

  "Did it work?"

  Harry grinned. "Like a charm. I could kiss you."

  Draco gave him an appraising look, one eyebrow raised. "Yes, I dare say you could."

And that's how they started dating.
