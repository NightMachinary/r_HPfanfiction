If Harry is gay and Sorted Slytherin, his awakening to man-lust would involve fantasizing about various men and boys of his acquaintance, the best of which is Draco. Eventually he might discover that his roommate Draco is also of his bent, and that much of Draco's bluster comes from feeling vulnerable to his father's criticism. As this Harry is a survivor of his relatives uncaring attitudes, he might empathise with the blond ponce in a private conversation, and the two would fall into a relationship based on forbidden attraction coupled with shared secrets. Think Jack and Rose in Titanic.
