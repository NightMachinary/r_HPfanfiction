[[/u/RealityWanderer]] wants to explore why this Harry chose Draco. "I'm attracted to dudes" is an unsatisfying answer; Draco's grating enough in canon that I'd prefer celibacy and loneliness over dating him.

Funnily enough, changing Harry into a girl does nothing to address this. You still have to specify that she's attracted to guys, and on top of that you have to say why she chose to date Draco of all people.
