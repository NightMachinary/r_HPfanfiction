No advice on Drarry details, but holy crap that story premise sounds like it could be absolutely hilarious.

If you can nail the characterization of canon Harry, and make the other three Harry Potters slightly exaggerated to emphasize the tropes they are parodying, it could be absolutely hysterical.

If you can add just the right amount of self-awareness to the story, it could be really amazing.
