I think it would be really funny if there was a prophecy that says how canon Harry will defeat the Dark Lord Harry and it mentions 'the power he knows not'. In the end, the final scene is like the scene in /Good Will Hunting/ where canon Harry explains how he understands how dark Harry feels, and how it isn't his fault. Dark Harry is angry and disbelieving at first, but due to the persistence of canon Harry, comes around and hugs all around. Boom, 'the power he knows not' is love.

As for Hufflepuff Harry, it could be a Harry that was raised in a loving home, specifically if he was raised by Sirius. Due to the loyalty and love that Sirius gave him growing up (and a healthy amount of time spent around the Tonks') he doesn't feel the need to prove himself so that leaves out Slytherin, he doesn't feel the need to be closer to his parents because he knows all about them from Sirius so that leaves out Gryffindor, and he never really fit much in Ravenclaw anyways.

Anyways, just ideas!
