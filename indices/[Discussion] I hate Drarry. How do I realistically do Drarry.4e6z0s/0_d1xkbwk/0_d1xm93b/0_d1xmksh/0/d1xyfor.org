  As for Hufflepuff Harry, it could be a Harry that was raised in a loving home, specifically if he was raised by Sirius. Due to the loyalty and love that Sirius gave him growing up (and a healthy amount of time spent around the Tonks') he doesn't feel the need to prove himself so that leaves out Slytherin, he doesn't feel the need to be closer to his parents because he knows all about them from Sirius so that leaves out Gryffindor, and he never really fit much in Ravenclaw anyways.

The AU!Harry in linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen) is a Hufflepuff for pretty much these reasons.
