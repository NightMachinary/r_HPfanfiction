I'm trying to make it somewhere halfway between crackfic and deadly serious. I know the Ravenclaw Harry will be a girl and most likely the wrong twin who lived, but I am having troubles with where to go on the Hufflepuff Harry. Just for good measure, their main opponent will, of course, be a Dark Lord Harry.
