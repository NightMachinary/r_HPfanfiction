I agree with [[/u/tkannelid]], but I can't reply to them so I'll just respond to you instead. Whatever you do, make sure the chages happen early and accumulate over a long period of time. There are fics where harry and Draco hate each other, and then, inexplicably, they fall in love and that's that. Don't do that. Instead, change what you need to change (probably lower draco's pompousness and muggle hating a few notches) and move forward from there.

If you wanted a slightly easier task, you could always make him haphne rather than drarry.

Also I love the idea of this fic. Really meta stories are something I love.
