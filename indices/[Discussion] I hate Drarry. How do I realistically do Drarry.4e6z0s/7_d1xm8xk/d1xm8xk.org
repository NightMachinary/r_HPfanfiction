I can't help with the romance, I'm not even good at writing het. But I don't think that's the major obstacle for you with writing Drarry. The problem is that canon Harry and Draco hate each other. So you need to come up with a believable backstory for SlytherinHarry and Draco to have a different relation to each other.

Now, let's say Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Even though his first impression of Draco wasn't good, Draco is still the only Slytherin who he knows. And Crabbe and Goyle definitely don't make better friends for Harry than Draco does. Also, Draco could find a friend in Harry, while Crabbe and Goyle could only ever be minions. Of course, this friendship probably would not last if Draco's character evolves the same way as in canon, so for a possible Draco/SlytherinHarry friendship (which later becomes romance) ,Harry would need to influence Draco's development just as much as Draco does with SlytherinHarry's.

I'm not a big fan of the hate turning into love trope, especially not with the kind of hate between canon Harry and canon Draco.
