hmm... it could be that the reason that Harry and Draco have so much antimosity towards each other is that they each have repressed sexual feelings toward the other. being forced to live with one another (possibly with just the two of them) leads to an eventual casual sexual relationship. That slowly leads into Draco asking Harry to the Yule ball in fourth year. Harry says "I dont know." Harry is afraid of how his family (Sirius and Remus) would feel about him dating Draco Malfoy of all people. They end up going to the ball seperately, Harry gets a date with tracey or something, and at the end of the night, Harry's female date kisses him. He realizes then that he doesnt care what his family thinks. All that matters is draco. as soon as he politely goes to his room, he waits for Draco. Draco comes back a bit drunk. They have an intense verbal spar because Draco was extremely hurt seeing Harry and the girl. And Harry... Harry was insulted by the things Draco said. It wouldnt be until Draco is taken for the second task that they end up together.

That should work. Its semi-realistic. and I dont think it has been over done.
