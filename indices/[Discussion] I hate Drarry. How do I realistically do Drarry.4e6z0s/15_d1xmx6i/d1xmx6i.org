Or you could just make it someone like... Pansy Parkinson? Someone who he does actively dislike in canon, but with whom he might strike up a relationship in an alternate universe.

The only motivation I can see for having Malfoy change enough for him not to be an utter scumbag is something really traumatic early in his life... Say, seeing a Death Eater torture and murder someone.

Or maybe having a younger sibling he feels the need to protect and who he suspects may be threatened by Voldemort's rise to power.
