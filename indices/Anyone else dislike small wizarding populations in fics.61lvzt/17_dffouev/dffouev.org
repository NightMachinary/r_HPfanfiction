I know canon, but I really dislike it. I'm more the type that likes ~1Mio. population with additional small schools taking the other children that aren't in the "1000 students" number Rowling once mentioned.

Anyway, what I'm saying is... I don't really care. I personally see the wizarding population of any somewhat big country around the million mark.
