The problem with small populations is that they make it realistically impossible to have rich and subtle culture.

Lockhart the famous author is clearly modeled after muggle world famous authors. The sort of popularity and money he enjoys is impossible for population sizes in low thousands.

Several newspapers able to earn enough money to be profitable? Nope, more people is needed.

Thousands upon thousands of books in the libraries? Who wrote all those books?

There are many examples like that, and this problem is rarely mentioned in the fics. I seem to remember one which postulated that wizarding politics is more akin to politics in a small town, but most fics tend to ignore the issue, or exacerbate it by making politics and cultural life actually richer and more nuances than in the canon.
