That is a fair point. In the Wizarding World, not only did they likely not experience the dark ages, but also their books wouldn't particularly become obsolete. Some would, but for the most part, wizards would have access to all the books written going a thousand years back, with a mostly literate society which is effectively post-scarcity. It makes a lot of sense that all they do as a society is research and mess with magic.
