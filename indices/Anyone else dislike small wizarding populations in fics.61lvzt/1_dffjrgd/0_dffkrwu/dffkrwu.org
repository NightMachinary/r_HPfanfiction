At least when it comes to the books, I feel like a lot of those books are very old. I mean, Harry is using a 50 year old textbook for Potions with no problem.

For the rest of it: I grew up on an island province with a population of around ~140,000 and use this as a model when I'm thinking about the wizarding world. There are definitely some famous names, but they're somewhat accessible (like Lockhart at Flourish and Blotts). Lots of family names that pop up a lot, lots of newspapers and publications flourish because a small population has a real vested interest in itself.
