I always thought that was kinda the point. It is a very small world, a very small 'country' so to speak, and even then is marred by infighting and can't unite just because of petty things.

It's a good commentary on countries, and even on the world in general, I think.

There's also the fact that JKR is British and is naturally used to playing with smaller numbers than, say, US readers might be used to. There are still villages and towns in the UK with similar adult populations, a couple thousand people, say, which in the US might be the size of the number of students of a high school.

For example, Hogwarts' approx. 400-500 students is not at all atypical of the number of students a British high school would have in reality.
