I generally go with a relatively small number of students at Hogwarts. The maths is something like this:

Average wizarding life expectancy (estimate): 150 years

Size of average Hogwarts year: ~60 students

(This is a compromise number. I completely ignore the interview number as my metacanon places book canon far far above interview canon, so I take the books as priority. From what we see, there appears to be around 40 students per year. But in PoA there's stated to be 200 Slytherins in the crowd at a Quidditch match, making an annual year group be around 114 students. I feel like ~60 is the closest you can get to the 114 figure without being too unreasonable in terms of compatibility with the tone of Hogwarts as seen in the books. Certainly it seems reasonable to me to posit that there were students with whom Harry never interacted or even noticed. Just think about how Cormac comes out of nowhere in HBP, but has apparently been there the whole time.)

On that basis:

Total Hogwarts student + alumni population: ~ 9000

That brings us pretty close to the figure of 10,000-15,000 I prefer. I feel like you can make up the difference with those who fall through the gaps of the wizarding world like non-Hogwarts British students, migrants, plus non-wizard magical "humans" like werewolves, vampires, hags, etc.
