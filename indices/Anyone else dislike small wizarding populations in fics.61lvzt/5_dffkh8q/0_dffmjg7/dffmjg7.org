I know JKR's math, interviews, and so on are inconsistent, but how does your number jive with the number of students at Hogwarts? In an interview, she said there are about a thousand students. But it sometimes reads as if there are only a few hundred. I guess I'm wondering how many students you think there are at Hogwarts and if that makes sense population-wise
