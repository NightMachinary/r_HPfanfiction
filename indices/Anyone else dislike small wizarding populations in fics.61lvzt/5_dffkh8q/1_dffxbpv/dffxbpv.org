The quiditch final had over a hundred thousand attendees though. And there are plenty of brand names and mass produced items everywhere.

I think you could easily go through the books and find details that point to either end of the spectrum In terms of population size. It just goes to show that population count wasn't really high on Rowlings priority list when creating her narrative.

Personally, my headcanon is wizarding population is about 1% of muggle population worldwide, but honestly its not something i care too much about as long as the story is coherent.
