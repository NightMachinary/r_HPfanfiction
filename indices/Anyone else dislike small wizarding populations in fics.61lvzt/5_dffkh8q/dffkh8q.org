I much prefer a small wizarding population (e.g. under 15,000 in Britain). This is ultimately about a) maintaining the importance of individual powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort and b) avoiding large scale magical battles. I think it is hard to maintain the fact that individual wizards are capable of turning the tide in a war, and the subterfuge/guerrilla/small skirmish style of wizarding combat, in the face of a large population. I also prefer the idea that wizarding society is less state-focused than the Muggle world, with international borders and nation-state governments meaning less. I prefer to think of the dynamic of the wizarding world as like a global conspiracy, Illuminati style, in which all wizards are complicit. The "other" are the Muggles, not wizards of different nationalities.

Accordingly I tend to think of Quidditch teams, for example, as far less commercial than Muggle professional sports teams. I picture many players having regular jobs in addition to being on Quidditch teams, and the general tone of the domestic Quidditch league as being similar to an amateur league in the Muggle world.

Similarly I prefer characterisations of the wizarding economy as much less sophisticated than the Muggle one. For example, no stock markets or developed financial services. Very little mass production, with most shops selling what Muggles would call "artisan" goods - each one slightly different, with one-of-a-kind items being commonplace.

Ultimately I don't feel like a small size belittles the wizarding world at all. I feel like it's a very Muggle way of thinking to equate scale with significance or power. But when a single wizard could probably take over the entire Muggle world (unless other wizards restrained them), the wizarding community does not need scale to be significant.
