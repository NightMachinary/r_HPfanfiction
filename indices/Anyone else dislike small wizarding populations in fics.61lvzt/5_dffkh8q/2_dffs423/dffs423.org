  Accordingly I tend to think of Quidditch teams, for example, as far less commercial than Muggle professional sports teams. I picture many players having regular jobs in addition to being on Quidditch teams, and the general tone of the domestic Quidditch league as being similar to an amateur league in the Muggle world.
