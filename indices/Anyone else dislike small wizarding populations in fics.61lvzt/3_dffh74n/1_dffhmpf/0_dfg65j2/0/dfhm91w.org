I think those numbers are good 500,000 seems like a larger number than most people give it.

This is an aside, but I would argue that the numbers lost in the first couple of wars isn't a sheer numbers issue, but a percentage issue. Because a lot of people compare Grindelwald and Voldemort to Hitler, they're probably thinking numbers in the millions that have now downsized to what Harry has. But if you think of it more like, there were 600,000 wizards in Britain, only like 500 family names, and even 10 whole families were wiped out, that would seem significant. I'm not sure if I'm articulating the thought very well.
