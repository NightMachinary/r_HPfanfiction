The population of the whole UK is 64 Million, I imagine the wizard population pre-wars was 1% of the muggle population. So 640,000

take 50% casualties and leave you with 320,000 of which most are over 60 years old and no longer having children. The younger were involved in the war or left the continent, especially the muggle born.

So maybe 500,000 left by the time Harry starts at Hogwarts, and the birth rate has only just begun recovering from the last war so very small classes at Hogwarts.

Really... Magic is pretty low chance for muggleborn students, probably less than half a percent and yet it seems that at least quarter of the new classes at Hogwarts are Muggleborn.

250k Magic users seems about right, anything less is just...disappointing. Easy to seem like such a small population though with only one fully magical village in the UK (Hogsmeade) and Harry being so swaddled and kept away from the magic world but it just HAS to be bigger than 1000 people...

Right?
