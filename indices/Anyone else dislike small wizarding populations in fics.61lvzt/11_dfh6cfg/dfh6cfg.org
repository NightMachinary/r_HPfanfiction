Working around a small population is a pain when trying to write about the wizarding world. Especially considering the fact that it encompasses its own ecosystem complete with entire species that have near-human and even human level intelligence.

It's really frustrating when you consider that you basically have nothing but the canon locations to go off as well. I mean, just how do you equate a population that barely breaches five figures (10,000 or so) with a Ministry of Magic that large? Or the fact that Hogwarts is fucking huge for a student population that small? We're talking around 300 students (~10 per house, per year = (10/7)/4= 280) located in a scottish castle purportedly large enough to garrison about five times that number as a low estimate (going off the movie sizes)?

I love writing about a much bigger and more flexible wizarding world existing outside of London (thriving little subcultures in Wales, Birmingham, etc) that stay outside of the MOM's reach through various means and do their own thing independent of the goings-on centered around London and Hogwarts.

The canon 'tiny population' thing is the first thing I throw out of a window when writing HP fics. It just doesn't really fit, especially with how easy it would be to cause a population explosion in the wizarding world by using the muggle one (science + magic = artificial reproduction. Not that other option you were thinking about...).

Hell, considering that magical creatures imply an entire biosphere of more intelligent creatures that go with it, the picture gets bigger anyway.

Population numbers are a pain when doing canon compliance. I just give up and ignore it in the end.
