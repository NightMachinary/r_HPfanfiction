One magical for every thousand muggles is canon, I believe. I up the population to 1/777.

Hogwarts's population fluctuates in my headcanon due to deaths and people leaving the uk. So while the year or two of harry's year and before and after (five years) are artifically depressed due to pure- and halfbloods fleeing a war zone and the deaths of whole families, leading to a larger glut of muggleborns compared to usual, as the celebration children begin to arrive---(people would likely stop worrying about bringing children into the world), many likely having late summer, early fall births making those be three years behind harry---we would see the hogwarts population rebound and as those who fled begin to come back---unless they're happier on the continent or the states or wherever they fled---we would see 'transfer' students, likely beginning harry's third year and on.
