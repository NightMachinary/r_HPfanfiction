Did you see Fantastic Beasts? One of the reasons I liked it was the depiction of the ICW not as some giant UN style organisation but rather a much more informal gathering of influential wizards which meets on an ad hoc basis. It doesn't even seem to have its own headquarters but rather meets wherever convenient e.g. in a member Ministry of Magic.
