i like to believe that the industrial revolution didnt affect the wizzard population the same as the mugglesworld. They stayed at the medieval population limit. the increased rate of muggleborns then started more racial movements like grindewald and voldemort. In addition there seemed to be more wars in the wizzardworld in the 19th century so i feel like the population is like the past WW2 population of germany, without the gender byas and with less wounded and more direkt deaths(avadakedavra),
