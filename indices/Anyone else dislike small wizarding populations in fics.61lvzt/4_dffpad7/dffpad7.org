If you can get past endlessly nitpicking the fact that the economy is extremely unrealistic, I tend to enjoy the small population idea. One of the fundamentally unique and interesting parts of the whole magical world is that this small group of people have their own separate society functioning within the muggle world. A small population means that important and influential people, groups, and events are much more accessible to the average person. The whole "seven degrees of separation" thing becomes more like two or three at most. Characters become less expendable and unlike the muggle world, you're not just a faceless number among millions, but have the chance to realistically contribute to society in a meaningful way.
