Since the economics never made much sense to me (aside from food, what do wizards really buy?). But 10-15k people means that the Ministry could sort of provide some universal basic income, the money for which comes from siphoning off money in the UK budget. Layer confundus charms or whatever, and sneak the gold in via MI5 black budget line items. Suddenly all the dumb Mininistry jobs are exactly what they seem to be: just make work stuff to provide subsidies. By the 1990s the magical population are just parasites on top of the vastly larger & more productive muggle population. They are but a flea on a tigers back.
