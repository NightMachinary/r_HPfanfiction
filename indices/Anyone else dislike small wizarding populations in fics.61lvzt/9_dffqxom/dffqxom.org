The population numbers is probably just one of those things that Rowling didn't plan for when she was writing a children's book. It just doesn't make any sense.

you can make a wild guess at the total population based on our numbers, if you accept a few assumptions:

-every kid (or most kids on the Uk) go to Hogwarts. -wizards have the same reproduction rate as muggles

now, assume that in average there are 10 students per house per year. or 70 students/house, or 280 total students. Hell, 300 for a nice round number.

The total population between the ages of 11 and 17 is, more or less, between 10 and 12% of the total population (in the uk, according to Wikipedia) so lets use 11%.

if 300 students represent 11% of the population, that menas there's less than 3000 total wizards in the Uk.

3000 build an entire system with banks, stores, sports team, etc etc etc.

And the thing is even worst.

Hogwarts is like 1000 years old right?

There are 2 options here:

1- they build a bigger castle than necessary for only a few students, so they would have spare room when more wanted to join.

2- they build a castle for what they believed they would need: around 300 students a year.

If the first thing is true, then the population of wizards in the uk was like 2 people. Because in the year 1086, the total population of the uk was 1,710,000. (and then they barely reproduce for the next millennia)

If the second case is true: then wtf happened to the population for the next 1000 years? how in the hell stayed the same? there's a super magical chickenpox killing entire generations of wizards?

you can go on and on with this. The point is: don't think about it and hope the person writing the fanfiction just add more people.

p.s.: English is not my first language, sorry if I wrote anything wrong.
