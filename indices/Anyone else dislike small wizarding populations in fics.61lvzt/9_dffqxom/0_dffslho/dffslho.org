  Hogwarts is like 1000 years old right? There are 2 options here: 1- they build a bigger castle than necessary for only a few students, so they would have spare room when more wanted to join. 2- they build a castle for what they believed they would need: around 300 students a year.

10th century castles looked like this: [[http://www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk/castles/images/april/ten.gif]]

The Hogwarts we see in the films displays MUCH later construction styles and fashions. Wizards may have been able to build beyond muggle technological limits back then but they would not do so by using designs derived directly from construction techniques invented later favoured by muggles when they became possible.

So I go with Option 3 - What we see of Hogwarts is not the original construction but a result of later expansion and re-development.

Why did they expand and build much larger than needed for the small number of students? Prestige! Showing off wealth and magical prowess.
