I am from a city with 100k inhabitants. Social infrastructure required to support my city where I'm from far exceeds what we witness in the books. Just schools alone - there is /at least/ 20 large schools. Several hospitals, huge number of shops, shopping centres, office buildings, 2 universities, industrial parks, etc.

No wizarding population is around 10k. Give or take few thousand.
