I'm so glad you brought up this discussion, as it's a topic that's been bothering me for ages. I believe JKR said that the wizarding population of the UK is around 3000 people, which makes these epic battles that everyone writes about very hard to imagine. From the books it seemed like Voldemort had at most 2 dozen named Death Eaters by DH, in addition to the various magical creatures he recruited. How could that few people cause so much chaos? When I read about battles in ff my brain is caught between the image of these grandiose visions of destruction vs. the "reality" that would be more like the throwdown in the Department of Mysteries, i.e., less then 10 people on each side. I always find the dissonance very distracting.

Intuitively I feel like 10,000-15,000 in UK feels right, but then I can't reconcile the small number of Death Eaters' outsize influence so that by Harry's time there was the feasibility of anything less than complete asymmetric war.
