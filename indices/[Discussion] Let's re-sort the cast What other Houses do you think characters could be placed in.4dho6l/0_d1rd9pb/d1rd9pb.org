I could see Dumbledore as a Slytherin. Not the Dumbledore of Harry's time, who has matured due to his sister's death and Grindelwald's betrayal. But before that? Sure, Grindelwald's influence might have prompted him to reason in ways he wouldn't have otherwise (the enslavement of muggles, etc), but the fact is that he was fairly receptive to ideas where he had power. He even became a teacher because he didn't think he could be trusted to have power, so strong was his thirst for it (and yes, he refused to be Minister, but that was only after he matured).

My knee jerk response was Ron as Hufflepuff. But while he was often loyal, I'm not sure it was that much of a defining characteristic. He didn't stick by Harry in GoF, nor in DH. Whereas he did show a lot of bravery from the start (taking on the troll, sacrificing himself in the chess match, following the spiders--the list goes on).
