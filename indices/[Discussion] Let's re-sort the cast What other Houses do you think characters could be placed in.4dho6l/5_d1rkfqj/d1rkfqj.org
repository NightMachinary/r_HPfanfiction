Although I love the /Alexandra Quick/ series as it is, I think if the main characters were in Hogwarts, this is how they'd be Sorted.

Alex - either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. She's a bit lazy when it comes to schoolwork, but extraordinarily persistent when it comes to things she's passionate about. /However/, she often betrays her friends in pursuit of her own goals. I believe Inverarity himself considers Alex a Slytherin.

Anna - Ravenclaw or Gryffindor. I don't know which - she's very clever and bookish, but she has the guts to stand up to Alex in books 3 and 4.

David - definitely Hufflepuff.

Constance & Forbearance - Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, respectively. In book 4 we see them start to individuate - Constance is the more "constant" one, whereas Forbearance is willing to delve more into esoteric things (Astrology).

Max - even though he's a morally ambiguous character, I'd say Gryffindor. [[/spoiler][The end of book 2]] all but confirms his sheer bravery.

Julia - probably Hufflepuff, maybe Gryffindor.

Sonja - Ravenclaw, I think, or Slytherin.

Innocence - Gryffindor.

Larry Albo - Gryffindor (according to Inverarity).

Lilith Grimm - Ravenclaw. It's evidenced by her monologue in book 4 ("I was the bookish one" and suchlike).

Diana Grimm - probably Hufflepuff. She's ruthless and brutal, but supremely dedicated to her job, and has a strong moral compass (in a way).

[[/spoiler][Hecate Grimm - Slytherin or Gryffindor (leaning towards the former).]]

Abraham Thorn - One would /think/ Slytherin, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up, but there's also some Gryffindor elements in there (the house-elf rights protections he passed, the determination to fight for his cause) despite his obvious evilness.

Livia - she's pretty cryptic, but I'd say either Hufflepuff or Gryffindor.
