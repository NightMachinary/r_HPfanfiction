The trio in Hufflepuff. Because you find the best sort there. Their loyalty to one another, and to Dumbledore, was extraordinary. It's actually one of Harry's strong points. On the camping trip. He's outside, his wand is broken, she tells him AD loved him and he denies it. But he continues on, he does it anyway, a leap of faith that I thought was pretty inspiring.
