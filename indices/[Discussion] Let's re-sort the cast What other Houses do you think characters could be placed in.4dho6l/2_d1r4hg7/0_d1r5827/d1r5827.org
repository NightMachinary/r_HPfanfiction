I think that is definitely a defining moment for Harry and I agree with your choice of Hufflepuff for him. The other two on the other hand, nah. I don't think loyalty is Hermione's overall defining trait. Maybe Ron's, though I think his bravery to fight for his friends despite his many fears is much more important.
