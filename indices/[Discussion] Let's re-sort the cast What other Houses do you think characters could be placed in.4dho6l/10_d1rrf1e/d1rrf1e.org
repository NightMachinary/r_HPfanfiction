I think Percy or Fred and George could have been successful in Slytherin. Percy values ambition and is a bureaucrat. Fred and George are cunning and brilliant inventors. While they'd definetly have some challeges being "blood traitors" in a more prejudicial house, I think they could've done quite well for themselves in Slytherin.
