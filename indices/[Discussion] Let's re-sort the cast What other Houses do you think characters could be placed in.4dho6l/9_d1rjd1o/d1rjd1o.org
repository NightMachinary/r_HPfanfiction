I think Hermione is a Hufflepuff to the core. Her knowledge and abilities come through hard work, she's loyal to her friends, she accepts the weak and unwanted (early books Neville for instance), she is "fair" and egalitarian - the rights and equality of others are very important for her as a principle. I don't think she belongs in Ravenclaw, because she isn't artistic and has quite a close mind - her need for knowledge isn't exactly an intellectual pursuit. And neither in Slytherin, since she is too egalitarian and fair for the house that basically embodies capitalism.

I think Gryffindor suits Bellatrix like a glove - and to many of the Blacks in general.
