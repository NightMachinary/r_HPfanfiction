Ron is a pure Gryffindor. He never gets sorted anywhere else.

Hermione could probably be sorted anywhere. She wanted Gryffindor, which is why she's there. If she wanted to go to another house, that is where she'd be.

Harry is probably always a Gryffindor too. He has the cunning to be a Slytherin and the loyalty to be a Hufflepuff, but doesn't really fit into either. He doesn't have the right sort of diligence for Hufflepuff, and his greatest ambition is to be normal, which is contrary to Slytherin.
