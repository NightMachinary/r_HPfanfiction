I don't feel like Harry* or Ron would fit other houses. Hermione on the other hand... she's loyal and works hard (Hufflepuff), intelligent (Ravenclaw), ambitious (Slytherin) and brave (Gryffindor) she can be in any house she wants.

Draco* is a bit of a head-scratcher it feels like he's in Slytherin because he doesn't fit in other houses.

*^{Unless they get paired off with Hermione, in that case both of these characters are intelligent enough for Ravenclaw}
