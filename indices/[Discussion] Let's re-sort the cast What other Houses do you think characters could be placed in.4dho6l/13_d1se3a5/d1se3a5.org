I think Harry is so self-sacrificing that Gryffindor is his home. I can see Ron in Hufflepuff because of his loyalty but let's not forget that bravery isn't lack of fear, but the willingness/ability to face your fears despite them, which I think Ron has shown throughout the series. Hermione could be in Slytherin, because of the cunning she has shown throughout the series. Neville could have been in Hufflepuff, as while he showed courage, it wasn't very evident until the end of the series. Draco was Slytherin through and through, but he might have been a Ravenclaw if his father hadn't been so...himself. Like you said, Crabbe and Goyle would be interesting Hufflepuffs because they stuck by Draco even though he insulted them all the time. Ginny never really showed courage until the end of the series either, so I can see her in Hufflepuff. Percy would have been an interesting Ravenclaw. Fred and George would be good Slytherins with all of the cunning they showed with their pranks/inventions. Lockhart was a Ravenclaw, right? I can seem him as a Slytherin.
