Ron: Hufflepuff. I don't think he's particularly brave, his bravery seems to be fuelled by his loyality to his friends. He is a hot-head and not particularly hard working though, so that's the other side of the coin. I do think though that he would do better in Hufflepuff, since it wouldn't nurture his less desirable qualities as much.

Dumbledore: Why the fuck is he a Gryffindor? Is it just because it's the "good guy hero" house? He seems like such a Ravenclaw.

Draco: Needs his own house for the pathetic. He doesn't belong in any. The hat should be able to refuse students.

Harry: Hufflepuff. I never really understood the Slytherin thing. Yes sure, he wants to prove himself to a certain degree (but I think anyone would considering his background), but in his core he is loyal and the what he desires most of all is family. Again, Gryffindor = Hero-house?

I actually agree with your thoughts on Hermione. She doesn't belong in Ravenclaw and it always irks me when AU fics attempt this.
