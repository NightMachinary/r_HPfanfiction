I can see why you would say Hufflepuff for Ron, but I think his fits of mostly irrational anger towards his friends and "screw it, I'm leaving" attitude make me less inclined to place him there. Ironically, I actually see Snape possibility being Hufflepuff due to his neverending loyalty to Lily, though Slytherin fits him just fine.

Dumbledore I agree with! Draco has ambition, at least haha. That's about the only thing going for him though.

I also agree with your thoughts on Harry. While I enjoy fics where he's sorted into Slytherin, I think canonically it doesn't fit despite the Sorting Hat's initial opinion. I don't even think he necessarily wants to prove himself either, moreso he just wants to fit in and do the right thing.
