Thirded on Hermione. I wrote a super-long blog post back in the day, laying out all of the evidence in the books that supports Hermione having Slytherin has her "House of other choice". Other HP fans have also noticed Hermione's Slytherin traits.

As the series progresses, and gets darker and maturer, Hermione also becomes even more Slytherin in nature, with one big point being her learning to lie so well, that she fools even Bellatrix when being tortured with the Cruciatus Curse. If she can outwit and out-con someone who was /Sorted/ originally into Slytherin, that speaks volumes about Hermione's true nature.

That being said, Pottermore implies that Tom Riddle, of all people, might have otherwise been Sorted into /Gryffindor/. His wand is Yew, with a core of Phoenix Feather. Pottermore says on Yew wood, "However, it is untrue to say (as those unlearned in wandlore often do) that those who use yew wands are more likely to be attracted to the Dark Arts than another. The witch or wizard best suited to a yew wand might equally prove a fierce protector of others. Wands hewn from these most long-lived trees have been found in the possession of heroes quite as often as of villains."

In my view, Pottermore is implying that Tom Riddle had a choice - to be a hero, or a villain - and he chose to be a villain. However, it is also quite telling that Rowling thinks that Riddle "might've equally proven [to be] a fierce protector of others".
