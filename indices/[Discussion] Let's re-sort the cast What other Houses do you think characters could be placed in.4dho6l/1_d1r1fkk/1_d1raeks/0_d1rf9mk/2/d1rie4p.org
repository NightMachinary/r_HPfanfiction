Thanks for the suggestion! After reading the story, however, I do have one criticism: Ravenclaw doesn't equal intelligence. It's not "the smart house". Otherwise, Hermione would be in Ravenclaw, as would Tom Riddle, and that simply doesn't happen in the books. Being a Ravenclaw is far more than just being smart or intelligent. "Knowledge is power", in my view, would be something a Slytherin would say, not a Ravenclaw.
