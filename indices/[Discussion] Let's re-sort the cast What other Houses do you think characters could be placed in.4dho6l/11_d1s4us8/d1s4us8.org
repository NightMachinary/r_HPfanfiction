Harry: What the Hat said.

Hermione: Hufflepuff. Friends to be loyal to and hard work. I'd even put her there before I'd put her into Ravenclaw. But in truth, Hermione could fit in all four houses very well (if Slytherin wouldn't be as univiting to her as it is).

Ron: Hufflepuff if I don't get to pick Gryffindor. He is neither cunning, nor thirsty for knowledge and not exactly a hard worker. Ron is more of a "pure" Gryffindor than Harry.

Malfoy: Just like Ron, there is none better for Slytherin than Malfoy. He is ambitious and becomes more and more cunning throughout the series (then again, what eleven year old, realistically speaking, is especially cunning?). However, if I have to put him somewhere else, it would probably be Ravenclaw. We hear once or twice that he isn't half bad in class, and he repairs a complicated magical artefact in HBP.
