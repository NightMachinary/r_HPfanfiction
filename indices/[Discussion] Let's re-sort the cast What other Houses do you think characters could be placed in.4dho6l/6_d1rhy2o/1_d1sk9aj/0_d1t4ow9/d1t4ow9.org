Its been a while, but from what I gathered when I read it Voldemort asked to use Kreacher (and did), but when Regulus found out that he had tried to hurt him he went ballistic.

Maybe I just like to see the good in people. Regulus is probably my favorite minor character so I think about him a lot too.
