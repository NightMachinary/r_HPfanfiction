See, I don't necessarily agree with this. We don't know a lot about Regulus, but based on what we do, I've always inferred he was sorted where he belonged. Sure, it's possible that he was upset at Voldemort on Kreacher's behalf, but it could equally have been just that he was annoyed that anyone else dared to touch his things (yes, even a Dark Lord.)

Like, we know that the Blacks were (or at least considered themselves to be) wizarding nobility. We also know that Regulus was an arrogant little fucker with a flair for the dramatics- I mean, his note to Voldemort was essentially "I want you to know that it was ME, REGULUS BLACK, who fucked you over! ME!" In a three sentence note, he says the word "I" seven times. Lol. (Also, DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT THE EXPRESS PERMISSION OF REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK!!!!)

Regulus kept his head down through most of his Hogwarts years and did what he had to to save his own skin, which doesn't seem very Gryffindor to me. Sure, he eventually went out with a 'bang' and stole the Horcrux, but part of me feels like he figured out the Horcrux thing and was then like "Well, I'm going to fucking destroy that motherfucker, you fucking half-blood upstart who fucked with my house elf!" more than "My dear Kreacher, I must avenge you!"

It could just as well have been the other way, I suppose, but with what limited information we have about Regulus I find it pretty impossible to say that he /should/ have been a Gryffindor. That's like saying Peter Pettigrew /should/ have been a Slytherin, or what have you.

I am not really sure what I'm trying to say with all that, but I think about Regulus a lot, lol. SO there's just some of my thoughts on him.
