Honestly I think the houses are totally arbitrary. Each character has what it takes to be great in any house. There was a topic on sorting too soon the other day and someone recommended the Switchverse and it has all of the characters in totally random houses and all of them do really well, while keeping their canon personalities. Check this out if you want a fun, heartwarming time. :-) It gets up through most of third year. [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html]]
