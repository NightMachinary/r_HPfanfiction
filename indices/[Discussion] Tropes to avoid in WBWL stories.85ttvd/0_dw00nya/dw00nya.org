The problem with so many of these stories is that the Potters neglect or abuse Harry while spoiling Harry's twin. This is extremely out of character.

They almost always make the twin incompetent while Harry is really powerful and no one notices and have this stupid part at the beginning where Dumbledore announces the twin as the Boy-who-lived due to some flimsy evidence. They never address the fact that Harry survived because Lily sacrificed herself. Basically nothing makes any sense!

Key thing to avoid: bashing. Don't bash the Potters, Dumbledore or the Weasleys or the Wizarding world in general. If that's possible.
