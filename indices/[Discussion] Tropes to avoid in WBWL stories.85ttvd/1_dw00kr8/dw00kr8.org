I think WBWL is a stupid trope to begin with. Regardless how you spin it, you can't avoid bashing Dumbledore and Potters. I believe it was first invented to give Harry's parents back, but still to have him growing up in Durzkaban.

And you still need to explain how Harry survived Voldemort's attack without his mother's sacrifice.
