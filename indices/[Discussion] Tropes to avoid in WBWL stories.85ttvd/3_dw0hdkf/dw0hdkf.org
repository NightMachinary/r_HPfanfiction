  Also he's still a DE since Lily is still alive.

He became a spy before Lily died so just because Lily is alive doesn't mean that he has to be a death eater. If the plot divergence happended after the prophecy was overheard and after Lily's life was endangered then there is a good chance he would continue to spy. I don't think Dumbledore would let him stop at that point, he would also owe him for protecting Lily and he would still likely want to spy to make sure Lily would continue to not be in danger. I do agree that he would still be a DE if the divergence was before that point though.
