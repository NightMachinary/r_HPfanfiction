Linkffn(Exile by bennybear) Draco spends some time living muggle. He slowly adjusts to it.

Linkffn(Coven by Naidhe) Only a short section in the fic, but Pansy's description of escalators is adorable:

  Pansy's gaze went up and up and up, following the people that stood still and yet moved. They approached, fast paced, and her confusion grew. What was that contraption? Stairs were materializing underneath people's feet, and then went upwards. It was the exact opposite of Hogwarts. The direction was fixed and the steps moved you up. It was... It was way fucking more practical!

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) Voldemort decides to gain power more politically by influencing the Ministry. Discrimination against muggleborns becomes worse with disturbing parallels to 1930s Germany. Hermione and a few other muggleborns decide to demonstrate what muggle chemistry can do, by casting a lot of duplication spells on plastic explosives and brute forcing through the wards on ancient pureblood owned manors.

Linkao3(Super Bowl Breach) Super long fic about a secrecy collapse. Wizards and muggles learn to live together. Voldemort gets his hands on nukes. Things go way out of hand.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle) Starts as a muggle AU where Harry and Ron are police officers, then turns into an epic dimension travel story, featuring technology and magic combined. Sirius really wants a flying invisible tank.
