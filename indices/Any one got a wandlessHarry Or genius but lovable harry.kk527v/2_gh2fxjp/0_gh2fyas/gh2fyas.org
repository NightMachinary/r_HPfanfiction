  Certain that he'd been about to die, Harry is mystified to find himself alive and healthy, and somehow in 1981. Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
