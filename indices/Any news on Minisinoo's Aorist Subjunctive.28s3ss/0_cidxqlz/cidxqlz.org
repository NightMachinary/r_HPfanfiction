She gave up writing fanfic many years ago, it was a very sad day for me. Dulce et Decorum Est was left uncompleted, as was the Aorist Subjunctive series.

I have a particular soft spot for Chronicles in her Aorist Subjunctive series, as it's the only fic I ever beta'd. She wanted a gay guy's perspective on the chapters about Cedric in gay London.

/Sigh/
