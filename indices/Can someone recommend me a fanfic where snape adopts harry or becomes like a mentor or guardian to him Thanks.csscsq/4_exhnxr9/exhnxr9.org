This was the first Sevitus (adoptive father) fic I read and liked: linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes)

This might also be of interest for you -- IMO the best source of Sev(er)itus fics around: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=7]]

The more common kind is the one where Severus is Harry's actual biological father. I generally dislike this, because it usually boils down to one of 2 things implied in the past: Lily being unfaithful and sleeping with a fully established Death Eater which is disturbing, or he left her in a loveless marriage to James "for her safety" which is disturbing as well as plain depressing for all 3 of them.
