Doesn't matter about smut. I've read Harry's Seraglio (pretty much pure smut, no real plot), The Accidental Bond (pure plot, no smut.), Price of Being Noble, and Defence for Two. What does OCC mean? I also would prefer if it wasn't too AU. As long as Hogwarts exists and there's magic, I don't care much.
