- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9015823/1/Harry-s-Loves][Harry's Loves]]: This is the second part of the story. I planned this story to just be about Harry's love to Hermione, but as things tend to happen, it turned out to be more.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6796442/1/Draco-s-Gift][Draco's Gift]]: Harry Potter finds himself shagging every woman in Great Britain, and it is all thanks to Draco Malfoy. Will Malfoy ever forgive himself? Loads of sex, multiple partners, rape, incest, and through it all, Harry is still a nice guy. ABANDONED DUE TO REENFORCED NON-ADULT POLICIES. Summary of where the story was going is final chapter. byKedavra Lumos

Well, what do you think? My favorite is the Last Second Savior, if you haven't read it I recommend.

If you look for Harem insted of Mult, you will find others fanfics, but is, basically, the same thing.
