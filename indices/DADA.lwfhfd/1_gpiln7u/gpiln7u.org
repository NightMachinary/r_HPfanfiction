Pretty certain that in canon they call it Defence, not DADA.

I think fic writers got confused somewhere along the lines with the DA, which is referenced by its acronym. But I can't think of any moment in canon where someone talks about going to "dada" or that someone is the "dada" teacher. It's always "defence," or the full subject title.
