I think the vast majority of students would possibly call it Defence? There might be a few referring to it as the acronym D.A.D.A... but that is weird. If I were a student at Hogwarts, I don't think I'd ever refer to it as its acronym, I'd just say Defence.

"It's time for Defence..."

That sort of thing.
