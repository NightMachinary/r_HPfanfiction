I know I've read several fics that fit that discription, but off the top of my head here are the ones I can remember! They are all Harry/Draco.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP01.html][Irresistible Poison]] is one of my very favorite fics. It's written well and I reread it often.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] is another favorite. I was glued to my computer screen until I finished it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2708248/1/Background-Secrets][Background Secrets]] also has the element of hiding the relationship. I liked it at the time I read it, but I remember that there are some elements to it I no longer enjoy reading, so YMMV.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8116594/chapters/18604528?view_adult=true][Liar]] is not set in Hogwarts, but Harry and Draco are sneaking around. I don't usually read cheating stories (not a fan of them) but I discovered that I couldn't stop reading this one.
