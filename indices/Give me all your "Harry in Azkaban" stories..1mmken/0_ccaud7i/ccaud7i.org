Azkaban stories were popular in the early days of the fandom. They tend to be a bit cookie-cutterish, along the lines of: Harry is imprisoned, is tortured, is released, is pissed off and angsty, is somehow in possession of mad magical skills, and is told by everyone how sorry they are that they betrayed him. I remember a few that were good (or guilty pleasures, at least):

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]] by BajaB is a good, if somewhat old one; 65k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

Another is Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/Cold/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] (registration required), 82k words, complete (also a complete sequel). One of the few decent Harry/Cho stories.

#+begin_quote
  When the world turns against him, leaving only one by his side, Harry finds out that life, love and truth are more complicated than they seem. Danger, suspense, heartbreak and treachery abound.

Apprentice/Journeyman/Master Potter by the same author have Harry imprisoned in Azkaban at some point as well.

nonjon's first major story, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2329599/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freedom-of-Apathy][Harry Potter and the Freedom of Apathy]] is another; 34k words, complete. Sequel is complete as well.

  PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.

A decent one with a bit of a twist is DobbyElfLord's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Mercenary]], 27k words, complete.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.
