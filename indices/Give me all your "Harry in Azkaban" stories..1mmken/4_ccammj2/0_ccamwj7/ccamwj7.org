Hello and thanks for contributing! I haven't read that story but it sounds good and exactly what I'm looking for.

However, I guess you're right and the correlation between good story and betrayed by all is poor. I'd probably end up with very maudling, angsty stories, especially with a character like "Angsty-pants" Harry.
