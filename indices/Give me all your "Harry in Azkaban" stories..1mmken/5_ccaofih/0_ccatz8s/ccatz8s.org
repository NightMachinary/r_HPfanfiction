Indeed, from my review of this story on another site, the story in a nutshell: [[/spoiler][Once upon a time, Harry was locked up. Then he was released. Harry was a god, but he was also very angry. Harry went to Hogwarts and took out his revenge on everyone. Then he lived unhappily ever after because he was an asshole. The end.]]
