"Control" by anonymou58: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control]] Summary: I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry WIP - hasn't been updated in a while.
