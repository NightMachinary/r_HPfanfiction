Yes, I'm asking this because I read and enjoyed "Redemption" by krtshadow on FFnet: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1480438/1/Redemption]] Summary: COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.

I also enjoyed "Betrayed" by Kateydidnt: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed]] Summary: In his fifth year Harry Potter was framed for murder and sentenced to Azkaban. Ten years later his innocence is proven. What will Harry do? Written PreOotP. COMPLETE!

I also read much of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban]] which is apparently quite well-know, but not really Harry being a prisonner, and that I found a bit over the top, so I stopped, although I liked some aspects of it.
