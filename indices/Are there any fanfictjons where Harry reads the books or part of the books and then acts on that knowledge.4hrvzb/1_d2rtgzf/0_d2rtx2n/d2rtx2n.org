Somewhat new. But all of the stories I've found that with reading the books are just about reading the books and the character's reactions are. What I'm looking for is Harry (preferably only a part of it) reading the books and then actually acting and using that knowledge and that is the main part of the story. Preferably, him reading the books would only be the first chapter or so.
