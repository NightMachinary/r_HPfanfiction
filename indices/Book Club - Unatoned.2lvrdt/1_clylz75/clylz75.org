One of my favorite stories of all time. Read it long before the book club announcement, but ending up re-reading it because it's that good.

The 'dark noir' theme is consistent throughout the story. The mystery is compelling and logical, and Daphne's portrayal is precisely the right combination of larger-than-life and astonishingly human. The pacing was excellent, and while I ordinarily wish stories, especially good ones, last longer than they do, the length on Unatoned was perfect.

My largest grievance would be how out of character Harry seems to be during and after the point he attends that ball with her. I think the author set the character development up to the point where it shouldn't be a problem, but I missed that transition, probably as a consequence of my poor reading skills. The explanation on the whole wand/portkey thing was questionable, but ultimately not a big enough deal to focus on.

The D/A humina humina certainly didn't hurt.

9/10 would recommend.
