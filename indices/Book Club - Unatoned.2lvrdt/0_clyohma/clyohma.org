Unatoned is beautifully written, that's for sure. The description is vivid, the atmosphere palpable. It's concise, and driven by an actual plot which has a proper beginning, middle and end. The characters are well-voiced and stand out immediately as identifiable human beings, not just a name and a characteristic or two attached. There are no noticeable errors. And, of course, it's complete.

Unfortunately, I can't actually say that I really enjoy the fic. I've never really been able to pin down why, because from the above assessment I feel like I /should/ like it. But here follows some disorganised, rambling speculation as to why I don't:

Firstly, there's the setting. This is a post-war world where Harry beat Voldemort, but you have status quo purebloods in control. Now, in theory this should be an interesting setting and thus gain my approval: a political HP world where winning the war against Voldemort isn't the same thing as changing the society that made Voldemort possible. It's reasonable. And yet... it isn't. I just can't shake off my complete disbelief that Harry, the defeater of Voldemort, would be so uninfluential in this world. That he works a low-level wage job and is treated largely like any other employee.

The original HP series does not pay enough attention to politics, this is true. Things are too simplistic, even with the way OotP introduced the idea of a somewhat corrupt Ministry. But I think this fic goes too far in the opposite direction in terms of making political power essentially the be-all and end-all of power in the magical world. It rather completely misses the whole point that this is a /magical/ world.

Magic /means/ something, not just because post-Voldemort Harry always has the option of simply using his significant magical force to achieve his goals, but also because each and every member of the population is basically armed and trained in combat. And a huge part of that population view Harry (or /should/ view Harry, post-Voldemort) as something akin to a Messiah. Harry's fame has huge political power of its own, power all the more dangerous because it exists outside of usual (legal) political channels. A single word from Harry Potter would be enough to raise thousands of wizards to arms in a violent revolution.

But this brings me onto the next reason why I think this fic disappoints me, which is Harry's rather bland, unimpressive nature. The fic not only presents Harry as rather average in magic (more average even than he was in canon), but it also significantly removes many of his positive traits from canon. This is done, no doubt, to pursue the noir tone where Harry is the cynical hard boiled detective, but the end result is that Harry is basically a concentration of all the bad things about his canon character with none of the good. There's nothing exciting or impressive or talented about him. He's weak and constantly dominated by other characters.
