Yeah, I'm looking for examples of non Romione where neither character is treated like shit. Personally I think Joanne really could have done a better job preserving the characters' previously established motivation and personalities while still ending up at the same end game relationship. It unintentionally made Hermione look like a terrible person and tried, failingly, to present Ron as the one in the wrong. JKR was not really hitting in the ballpark there, but hey! I know a fuck ton of fanfictions that are better than the source material.
