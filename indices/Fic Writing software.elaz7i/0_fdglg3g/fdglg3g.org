I think you'll find people using everything from Google Docs to code editors!

Personally, I've been a fan of "[[https://hubpages.com/literature/Best-Apps-for-Distraction-Free-Writing][distraction free]]" writers ever since I found out about them. Also [[https://app.grammarly.com/][Grammarly]] browser extension for that final check. You could even write directly in the editor on FanFiction.net, but I can't recommend that because there's no undo and you can accidentally lose a chunk of text (totally not happened to me or anything).
