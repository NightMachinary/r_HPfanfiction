I use Evernote myself, which is just a different version of MSWord, basically. I only use it because it's the only writing app that still works on my OG Ipad. I'm looking into things like Grammarly and Hemingway to help out in editing after I've written, but currently it's just Evernote.

If you want active help on writing a fanfic, I'd try sign up to DarkLordPotter for writing advice if you're confident enough to take slightly... forthrightly-phrased critiques or FFnet's beta function if you'd prefer someone likelier to be nicer about it. You could also try make a new post and ask for a beta here, too.

In terms of writing advice, as trite as it is, just go and write is the best advice anyone can give. You're not going to be as good as published authors with your first fic, but you can at least write as badly as them. So, don't go in thinking you absolutely have to be Shakespeare and just have fun with writing. You'll learn how to write better as you write more, generally speaking, but it's real important that you remember this is supposed to be fun. :)

There's not really any specific place I'd recommend as an ultimate guide to writing or anything, but I've found this ([[https://hobbylark.com/writing/How-To-Write-A-Good-Fanfic]]) and this ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteAFanfic]]) to be a good place to start. They give a lot of basic ideas and thought processes to run through while you're working out what you want to write. Do you have a character in mind, or a conflict you want to explore, or a particular plot bunny scenario to write about, etc, that kind of thing. Essentially, building the foundation of your story first. You don't have to plan out everything in minute detail if you don't want to, that's really down to whatever you feel comfortable with, but it's good to have an idea of where you want to go at the very least.

Once you know that - what story you want to write, I mean - then it's just a matter of sitting down and writing. This ([[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-advice-thread.37586/]]) is a pretty good guide for that. Some people advocate editing as you go ("Oh, I don't think 'said' works there, I'll use... 'demanded' instead" kind of things), though I prefer just writing until I run out of things to write and editing afterward. Lets me get a better idea of how everything works together and flows through the narrative.

I've tried to keep this as general as possible, but if you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask. I'm happy to help. I've not written for Harry Potter yet myself (though I am working on a couple ideas!), but I've been writing for another fandom for a few years now and running D&D games for over a decade, so I've picked up a few things here and there and I can try point you in the direction of other things that might help if I can't.
