I'm a big fan of Scrivener, but didn't make the upgrade until I'd been writing consistently for a while because it's a paid software. I used Google docs before that. Of course Google is free and I like that it synchs across platforms. But I found when I got north of 50k words, it lagged and became glitchy, and I worried about a crash. Splitting the work into separate chapters drove me nuts.

Scrivener's biggest downside is the price but then it offers easier compiling, writing insight, and can handle big texts. So I'm happy. And $75 on a hobby I enjoy is not the dumbest money I've ever spent...
