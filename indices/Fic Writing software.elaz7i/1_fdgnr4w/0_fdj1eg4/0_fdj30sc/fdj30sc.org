For me, definitely yes and it's not even close! It synchs across platforms so I write on my phone and computer. You can have WIPs in a folder like structure, so in one collection I have all my chapters then all my research and notes. If I want to compile, it's an easy button to do so. There are character name generators. And like the Hemingway editor, you can focus on a type of speech (adverb, say) and it'll highlight every place in the document. Also specific word search, so a potty mouth like me can see that I'm only using /that/ curse word /so/ many times and is it really all that bad...?

Plus I associate word with my daytime job and I spend enough time staring at that, hah.
