I use Google Docs and write on my phone.

If you've never written before, think a bit about about the technical aspects of your story first:

Do you want to write in present or past tense? Pick a tense and stick with it. (Most readers prefer past.)

What narration style are you using? Third person limited? Third person omniscient? (Both very popular.) First person? (Seems more popular among writers than readers.)

Once you've made those decisions, start writing.
