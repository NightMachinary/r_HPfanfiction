Harry Potter doesn't have a magic system - it just has magic. It can't possibly weaken the plot because Rowling built the world, and subsequently the magic, around the plot, to /enable/ the plot. If anything, the plot weakens the magic, as we see barely anything that could give the magic of HP and its many schools of thought more depth.
