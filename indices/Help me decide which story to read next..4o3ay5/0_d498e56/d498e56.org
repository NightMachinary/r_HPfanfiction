Well, I know one of them. I can tell you that HBS is rather convoluted and has serious plotting issues and imo, drags on way too long in places and places too much emphasis on action scenes that would benefit from being tightened up wordcount-wise.

That said, it is a unique take on Hogwarts and there's enough of it to sink your teeth into. It was also updated last month, but the author's projected update timeframe is already a few weeks gone, so who knows if it'll be completed.

In general, it's uneven. Some of the stuff I found really interesting, other parts bored the living daylights out of me. Give it a try, see if the hook works for you. It's not the worst fic, but there are plenty of better ones.
