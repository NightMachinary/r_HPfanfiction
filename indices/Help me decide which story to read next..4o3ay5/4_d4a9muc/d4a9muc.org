Magicks and Abraxas should be read first as they are both completed, and as a general rule, completed fics should always be recommended and read first.

Magicks is a more realized story, but it's hard for me to read through a lot of smut. Harry is appropriately strong, but there are certain parts of the ending that make me question whether or not the build up was generally worth it.

Abraxas is fine, but it spins a bit out of control towards the end. Echoing what others have said, it ends with a discordant note that might not be well received.
