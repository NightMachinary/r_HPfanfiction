  Magicks of the Arcane. I started to this fic only for me to stop after the first few chapters because i just feel like the development in terms of power will be slow.

I honestly don't know how you think that the power development is slow. Literally, in Chapter One he uses magic that sixth/seventh years wouldn't be capable of, and it is implied that most adult witches and wizards are not capable of it. In Chapter 6, the Minister of Magical Norway applauds Harry for, and I quote

  a display of magic long lost in legends and myths

so yeah, the power development is not slow, not slow at all.

I have nothing to say of HBS that others here haven't already said other than: the first 'book' is better than the second in having a much tighter plot, while book 2 is starting to sprawl with too many threads. This is the only one of the three with a slow power development.

As for Abraxas, this definitely has the fastest power development. Ron/Hermione is the secondary pairing, so nothing to worry about for you there. Yes, the story has a dark twist. No, the twist doesn't make the story fall apart. Rather, it has the standard Brennus failing of having an unsatisfactory conclusion (last chapter).

As for the order? Honestly, I would do them in the order you have listed, for two reasons. First, Magicks of the Arcane and Abraxas are complete, and Hogwarts Battle School is not. Second, Magicks of the Arcane is better than Abraxas.
