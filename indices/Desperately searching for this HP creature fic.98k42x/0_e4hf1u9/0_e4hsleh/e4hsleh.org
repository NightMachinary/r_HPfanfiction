It's no different than any other fanfiction of any other genre. Fanfiction is just an expansion of a universe that allows authors and readers to explore the “what ifs.” This doesn't mean that I or other readers/authors don't value or have appreciation for the original books and canon. In fact its because we love the Harry potter universe so much that we read beyond the pages of the original books. HP was a significant part of my child hood. I grew with Harry. Reading new fics, even if they're incredible AU brings new dimension to the HP world and introduces new excitement to an old favorite. It also creates (at least for me) and even greater appreciation for the original works when I go back and reread one of the books for a hundredth time.
