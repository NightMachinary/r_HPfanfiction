I mean it's not very useful besides escape and surprise. If you're a bird you can spy on people easily, but a predator would get annihilated by a wizard unless they were surprised. Like you're running at someone as a tiger and you get hit by a blasting curse you'll be tiger bits all over the ground cuz you have no defense besides agility.

Unless you want something like woah he's a dragon, basilisk, and Phoenix animagi but i generally avoid stories like that.
