Yes, being an aniagus is exciting, but most forms aren't very useful, especially in a fight. Even if you have an element of surprise, wouldn't it be better to just use your wand from a distance?

I have a fic where a character becomes an animagus in hopes that it would help her with spying, but then her form turns out to be a shark, which is cool and fearsome and all, but isn't of much use to her in her job. She gets to use her abilities in the story, though, but in a very specific circumstances.
