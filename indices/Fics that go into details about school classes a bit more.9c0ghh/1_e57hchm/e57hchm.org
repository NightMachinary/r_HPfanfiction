Linkffn(Forging the Sword): a classic, and probably the most cogent DADA outline I can remember reading ever.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): ever so slightly AU, but there is some seriously thought out detail here, especially in 3rd year where we are encountering the electives (the Muggle Studies 1st day was rather interesting at the very least).
