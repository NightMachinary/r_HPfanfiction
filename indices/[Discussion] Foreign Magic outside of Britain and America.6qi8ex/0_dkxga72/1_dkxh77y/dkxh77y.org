I'd be surprised if they didn't still practice in their native language, even if they were a colony. Anti-colonial sentement was probably as common in the magic world as it was in the muggle world. Id assume colonial or former colonial states would practice both Latin spells as well as their own, while others might stick strictly to their own due to no outside influence or a very strong sense of identity.
