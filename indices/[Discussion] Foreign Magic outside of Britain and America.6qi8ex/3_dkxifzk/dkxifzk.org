Voiced spells are basically an element of casting that assists the mind in focusing the ability within a person to manipulate magic. The words are used as a recall for what it does, which assists in picturing what one wants, and the wand assists in targeting the spell. It has been stated that spellwork can be done without both, though for non voiced it requires mental focus, and for non wand an impressive amount of willpower in addition to the mental focus.
