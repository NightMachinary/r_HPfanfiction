I'd imagine that all cultures would have at least a small selection of non-Latin spells in common use. I wouldn't be surprised if household spells in old germanic languages were passed down through families or something.

On a wider scale, I'd imagine every other continent would practice a combination of non-Latin and Latin spells in "modern" times.
