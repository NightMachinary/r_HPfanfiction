I much prefer an objective approach to magic, as opposed to a subjective "it's all in your mind" approach. The intent/imagination/visualisation approach rather undermines the idea of study as being essential to magic.

Hogwarts has a huge library in which multiple books can be written on a single spell (Harry once read three books on the Stunning Charm alone), reading and understanding those books enables you to cast the spell better/easier (see: Hermione's entire Hogwarts career), and the best wizards are noted specifically for their academic abilities. It seems clear to me that understanding what you're doing is the primary (but far from only) element in being able to cast spells well and being able to use more advanced magic.

Indeed, the whole idea of a school of magic in a world where all you need is imagination/intent/will is kinda pointless.

So this is what I mean when I said that you define the spell by its effects: the spell is defined according to its nature as described by magical theory, which is objectively ascertained and universal across cultures. The incantation, however, can vary depending on linguistic variety.
