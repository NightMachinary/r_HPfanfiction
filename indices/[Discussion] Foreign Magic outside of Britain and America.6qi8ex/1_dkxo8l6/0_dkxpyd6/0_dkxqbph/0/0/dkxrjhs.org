Well, that's two separate points:

1. Without a doubt certain spells have emotional requirements, or some other mental performance required at the time of casting, but this does not really impact the general point. It's just an additional element on top of all the other stuff.

2. Spell variation is a canon fact. The shield charm is the prime example: it can be used to block either magic or physical things, it can be cast with a greater variety of strengths, it can block or reflect, it can be used to cover different areas in different shapes. But I don't see how this makes it less the Shield Charm. Indeed, as Harry's expertise in the Charm grows, so too does his ability to do different and better things with it. If anything variation backs up the view that understanding of the spell underpins your casting of it.
