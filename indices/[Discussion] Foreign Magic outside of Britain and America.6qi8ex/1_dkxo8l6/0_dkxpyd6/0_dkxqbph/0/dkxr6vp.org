Now there is a problem with that. Take for example curses be supposedly ineffective when a person has no heart or malice behind it. Ref. to Bellatrix vs Harry, his crucio was a dud because he didn't have the malice or intention; he was a person who would not be able to bring himself to do something like that. Just because there are books on stunning charms doesn't mean that it's one charm. They may cover varying grades and degrees of stunning. From the basic knock out, to partial paralysis, merely causing someone to flinch, etc.
