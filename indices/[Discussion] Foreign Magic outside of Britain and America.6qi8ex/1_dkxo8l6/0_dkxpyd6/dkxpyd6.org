There was an anime I watched recently that talked about the ideas behind incantations, worded spells, etc, and how they were just there as a way to focus the mind. They talked about how altering the way you say the spell, pauses, what not, changes the way it works. You could have a shortened multi-word spell, inflection changed, and it could effect how the spell works. Basically you are limited to your imagination as to how you wanna play with spells, because in the end it just changes how you visualize the spell taking effect.
