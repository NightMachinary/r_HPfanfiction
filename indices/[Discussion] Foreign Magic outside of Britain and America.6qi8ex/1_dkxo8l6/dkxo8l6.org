If you define a spell by its effect, rather than its incantation, I think the problem of foreign magic solves itself quite neatly. The incantation becomes like a kind of label for a spell. Just as saying a person's name will bring to mind all sorts of associations that you have in your subconscious about that person, so too an incantation can act as a kind of connection to all the subconscious understanding you have of a spell's nature.

There's no reason why a given spell would be limited to a single such label. Indeed, we see within canon wizards making variations to incatnations in order to adjust the effect of the spell. So foreign magic would be the same magic - the same spells - just using different incantations to call forth those effects.
