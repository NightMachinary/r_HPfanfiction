I thought that the writing quality of [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] was solid, but I wasn't finding the story compelling. I didn't get very far, though; those who have finished it might have other feedback.
