Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo. Well written and the way the author develops the story regarding catching the killer was amazing. The relationship was secondary.

Second choice was Harry Potter:Dark Memories by Blueowl. The author creates this network of contacts and allies. There are no romantic interests in the story so the reader focuses on the action.
