[[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. No matter what you think of the story, the characters, or the main idea, you have to admit that it's superbly written and planned.

One of my favourites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/][Birds of a Feather]] by babylonsheep. The author has clearly put much effort to creating the right tone and atmosphere of the 1930s and 40s. Also, it's not just rushing the events to advance the plot, which gives much time for plausible character development. linkffn(13103526)
