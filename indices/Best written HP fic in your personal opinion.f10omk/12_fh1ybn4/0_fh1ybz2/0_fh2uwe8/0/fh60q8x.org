The OP made it clear that this isn't about whether you enjoyed it. You can feel free to dislike HJPEV; that's very understandable. It's still a long, complex story full of foreshadowing, shout-outs to other media, humor, thought-provoking discussions/arguments, and clever exploitation of rules. It has very few typographical errors, and no coarse language above PG level.

All of the above puts the writing quality well above the average on fanfiction.net, even if you detest the story. Just the fact that it's over 600k words and complete puts it above average. (And people are allowed to like different things.)

  The story deviates very early from its stated goal

Stated where? I don't recall any such statement.

  It goes on for ages with no structure.

The structure is "this is the events of Harry's school year." Granted that they don't all have equal relevance to the final climax, but not all stories have to be tightly focused like that. Some of the great classics take time to meander (and let's not forget Harry Potter and the Deathly Boring Camping Trip). It's also worth remembering that it was originally published serially, so it's normal for it to have relatively self-contained and independent sub-plots.

  The fact that you feel it necessary to say "no matter what you think of the characters" is proof enough - you can't have a well written story with poorly written characters.
#+end_quote

"I hate this character" is a very different thing from "This character is poorly written." Practically everyone hates Dolores Umbridge, yes? But she wasn't a failure on JKR's part; she achieved exactly what she was meant to. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is meant to be a clever but self-righteous, abrasive, and annoying little flawed prodigy who is so bent on saving the world that he's in grave danger of burning it down. If you hate him, then hate him; that doesn't mean he was written badly.
