HPMOR, superbly written and planned? You've got to be kidding. The characters are either super-intelligent clones or unimportant. The story deviates very early from its stated goal (brining "rationality" to Harry Potter). It goes on for ages with no structure.

No, it's not superbly written, or even well written. The fact that you feel it necessary to say "no matter what you think of the characters" is proof enough - you can't have a well written story with poorly written characters.
