Harry Potter and the Prince of SLytherin

linkffn(11191235)

The author is a monster at foreshadowing. Some plot twists had my mouth hanging open after I'd connected the dots and realised it had been hinted for like the last twenty/thirty chapters and I was too stupid to see it or didn't have all the clues. The kind of things that make you go "The fuck? That doesn't make any sense" and then you're like "Oh. OOOOOH. OOOOOOOOH. He's a fucking genius."

And then there's the excellent worldbuilding which gets rid of most of the canon story's plot holes or the character growth where you really see them change. Ron, Jim, The Twins, Hermione, Ginny, Harry, etc... from their first appearance are completely different from the ones now.

You just HAVE to read it. You can't miss on the Prince of Slytherin experience.
