I read a few chapters. This OC character Theia is clearly self-insertion by the author and is just crazy good at everything. She's had less than a year training and Harry, after being an auror for a while, sneaks up behind her and Stupefy's her, and she reacts in time to cast a Protego that makes him stumble back? There's a few more things that happen but they're spoilery.
