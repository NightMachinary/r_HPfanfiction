By far [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]] (no idea how to link properly).

Most fanfics are easy to read, fun while they last but easily forgotten and dont have any lasting impact. They are like the popcorn of literature.

This one was actually thrilling and exciting to read. It felt like a proper novel. The writing was great, there was a thought out plot (although its confusing at the start) and there was actually a proper ending.

So because of that i would say that in my opinion Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time is probably the best fanfic.

Second place is probably Prince of Slytherin, but because the start and the first 12 chapters or so are simply terrible it doesnt measure up (it gets properly good from the second year onwards thougj).
