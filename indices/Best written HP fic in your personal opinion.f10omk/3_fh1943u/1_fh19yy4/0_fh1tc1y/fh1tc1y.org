Ginny is in The Changeling but eventually Annerb alternates between Harry and Ginny in the Armistice series (The Changeling is like 200k words, Armistice is 400k so far), which only 3 have been released (finished last month) and I hope there's more because there's a bunch of threads she left open. Either way, her writing style is the most professional feeling to me - she writes a lot more patiently after the first few chapters of The Changeling and actually lets characters develop. I think that skill is sorely lacking in HP FF.
