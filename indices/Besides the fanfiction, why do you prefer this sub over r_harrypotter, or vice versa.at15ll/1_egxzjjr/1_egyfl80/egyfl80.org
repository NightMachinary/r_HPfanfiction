Ugh, not a fan of that. Harry Potter belongs to JKR. She can do whatever she wants with it.

I'm fine with a large group of Harry Potter fans deciding to reject the Cursed Child, but to then claim /ownership/ over Harry Potter? Not a fan of that attitude.

I'm eternally grateful that JKR gave us a great series that were set in a fantastic world. I disagree with her all the time, but the beauty of fanfiction is that if I write my own fanfiction, which has JKR's blessing, I can write it in my own version of /her/ world. My stuff is /inspired/ by her books.
