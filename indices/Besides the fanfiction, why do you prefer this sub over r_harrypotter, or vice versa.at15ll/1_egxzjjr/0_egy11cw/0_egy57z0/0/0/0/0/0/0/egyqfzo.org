It's a silly premise so it gives me a bit of leeway to have fun with it. Not being a Brit myself, I have borrowed liberally from the show and from friends that are British as to dishes that I would cook.

Making the foods magical has been fun. Canary Creams and similar might find their way into some dishes. The whole contest is Dumbledore's idea, so eccentricity is, pardon the pun, /baked/ in.

Add in liberal doses of house-elves, Professor Umbridge being a judge, Snape being a presenter/host, and Howlers from Molly Weasley, and the story will be nutty but delicious.
