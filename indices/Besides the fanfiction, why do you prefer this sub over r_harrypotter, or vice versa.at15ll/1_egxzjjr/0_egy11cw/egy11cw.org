You just reminded why I dislike the HP main sub: Tumblr.

Outside text-post only Discussion Week, half the sub is people posting their merchandise, the other half is needs_more_jpg screenshots from Tumblr that are cringey as fuck. [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a1/dc/c7/a1dcc7622a28ade362a087a33adaec33.jpg][*This is an example of one*]]. It's not funny AT ALL, but for some reason, people think it is, and is reposted over and over. So much of the main sub is karma grabbing reposts.
