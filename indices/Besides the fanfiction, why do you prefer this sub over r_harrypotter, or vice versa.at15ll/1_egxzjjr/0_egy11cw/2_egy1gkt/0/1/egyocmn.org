Not to get into depressing territory, but watching and imagining fictional people have happy fictional, functional relationships with their peers or just other people in general might be a way to counter teenage angst? Hell, reading these excerpts put a smile in my face and I'm like "I agree with these intepretations and adding them into my perspectives of the aforementioned characters deepen my understanding of these characters, deepen my emotional bonds with them and sustain my investment in the series"

And well, what harm does it do for them to imagine other traits and things that could be extrapolated from what is seen in canon? I mean what you show us is the authors imagining James being exuberent and attention-seeking, Lily being studious, James and Sirius being teenage brats in response, Lupin going along with the flow, Peter not doing it well, and then James covering for his buddy Lupin who just had to undergo another shitty night because of his "condition" None of these characterizations are too far removed from what the canon and people in canon would describe the Marauders and Lily as in school, and yet to the authors, it means the books awoke something in them and got them invested in the series and the characters in response.

And well, let's not go all gatekeeping on their interpretations and wonder if that is the right way to enjoy HP. They write a few hundred words of intepretations, we write thousands of words here so really who are the real weirdos here?
