People post all sorts of dumb Tumblr screenshots. The ones I especially hate are the Marauders headcanons.

The first type is weird and random, like [[https://i.imgur.com/aLrsC9s.jpg][*this*]] or [[https://i.imgur.com/OWzpDPm.jpg][*this one*]].

The second type is weird and pitiful, like [[https://i.imgur.com/CtsEukD.jpg][*this*]], and the reposter titles their thread "Literally made me cry :( ".

I can't comprehend why people like these. Or maybe I'm a dry and shriveled Dementor who has zero sense of humor or something.
