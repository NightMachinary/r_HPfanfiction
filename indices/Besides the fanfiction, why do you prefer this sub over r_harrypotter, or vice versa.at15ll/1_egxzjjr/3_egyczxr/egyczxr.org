  The point is, Harry Potter no longer belongs to JK Rowling. Sure, her name might be on the cover of those books, but the Harry Potter universe is ours. We filled in the gaps, and added on. These are our characters, our stories, our ideas. It is ours now. We took the skeleton that Rowling created, and we gave it life. <...> Because Harry Potter doesn't belong to JK fucking Rowling anymore. It belongs to us. And we can do whatever we want with it.

What fucking pretentious piece of absolute drivel. It's not enough for these fucks that JKR doesn't sue them into oblivion and doesn't ban fan works (like many authors do), they have to go all communist and straight up expropriate the franchise. Y'know, the franchise that /already permits fanfiction./

HP belongs to JKR. "You didn't build this", as it were. How about some respect, humility and gratitude? NO. We go in, we take what we want and fuck the rights of the creator.

If this is what [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is, I never want to even go there. (Edit: I went there and compiled a field report of sorts in this thread)
