  We made some of the main characters POC because there isn't enough in the books.

And they lost me at the second paragraph. And the representation of minorities is certainly in line with British demographics of the 90s. We have three/four black people, one Chinese and an Irish guy (excluding name only characters like Su(e) Li). We even have a French Immigrant to show some European Spirit. If anything, I'm annoyed that the German guy is literally magical Hitler, but such is life in Germany.
