I found people are more open to all discussions over here while main harry potter subreddit is full of censorship and the admins seem to delete anything they don't like as they fear it might cause a heated debate of some kind. just seems like they hide in their own little bubble where no disccusions that might cause debate are allowed they withdraw into their own gated community, afraid of a larger forum. They stay inside their safe space, surrounded by whatever "truth" suits them No one is invalidated, but nobody is right.
