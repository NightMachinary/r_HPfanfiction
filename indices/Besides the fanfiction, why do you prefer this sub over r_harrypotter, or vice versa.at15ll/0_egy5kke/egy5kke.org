I only like the main sub during discussion week because otherwise it's just low effort memes, pictures of generic tattoos, and people fishing for karma by posting pictures of their dogs.

But, I do like it during discussion week. As someone with little interest in AU stuff, I sometimes feel a little bit seperate from the main crowd here, so the other sub suits me a little more. But only on discussion weeks.
