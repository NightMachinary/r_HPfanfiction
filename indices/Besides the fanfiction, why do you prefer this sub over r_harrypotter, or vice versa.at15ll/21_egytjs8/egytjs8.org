Because I think the people in this sub are looking for something different than people in [[/r/HP][r/HP]]. Many of us are adults and have somewhat outgrown canon Harry Potter because they're well children's books. This sub can provide a hub for mature discussion and also can be a good starting point for a new person entry into the fandom.
