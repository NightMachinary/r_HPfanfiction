Well, I unsubbed from [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] mostly because of the memes. As I've gotten older, I've realized that I don't agree with some of what JKR says, and I hate how she just...comes out with plot information out of nowhere in order to kind of match up with the world today.

There's also the fact that as much as I want to get into Fantastic Beasts and experience the magic like I did as a kid, I just can't do it (even though I read FB as a kid as well). I care more about the characters I grew up with. I'm basically just a fan that cares about the books and films.
