Yeah, that one is all kinds of weird. The magical society seceded in the 17th/early 18th century. They are bound to be different, backwards in some areas yet more "advanced" in others. Sometimes they are even both at the same time, just look at the medical field. And there is no need to project current social issues on the HP universe, as hilarious as Harry suicide bombing Voldemort's camp would be.
