  Additionally, instead of simply singing praise of canon, this sub really delves into canon and breaks it down, usually to make it better

I think this is also the basis of fanfics. A fanfiction starts because of an idea or a concept that is not represented in canon. Sometimes it's a continuation of canon, sometimes a change, but it is always something that is beyond canon. Because people are interested in that they need to be critical or at least open-minded in regards to canon. A fanfic reader is also likely to be way more hardcore into the fandom than a non-fanfic reader.

On that other sub (which I personally don't use, but not for any particular reason) there are people coming from way more different backgrounds. Some only saw the movies, others only read the books. People on that sub will on average be less knowledgeable about the series and have spent way less time discovering the universe and pondering it.

The truth should never be downvoted
