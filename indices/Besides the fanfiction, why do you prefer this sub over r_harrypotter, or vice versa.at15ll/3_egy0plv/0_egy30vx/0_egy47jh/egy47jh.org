Fight! Fight! :)

In all seriousness, I never really bought Harry/Ginny in canon, until I read some really good fanfiction that made it believable for me. That's just one example of the power of fanfiction.

Now I'm much more open to it, though I'm fairly flexible with pairings anyway as long as it doesn't go totally counter to canon (like Dramione, or pretty much anything with Snape, ugh).
