On a more serious note, I think that's because [[/r/harrypotter]] is more composed of the target audience (aka young, cringy, teenagers, and heaven knows I was one of them), but more importantly it's about praising /canon itself/ (which isn't a bad thing, as it helps young people get through their life problems), while this sub is more about praising /the potential/ of canon (everything that could have been)
