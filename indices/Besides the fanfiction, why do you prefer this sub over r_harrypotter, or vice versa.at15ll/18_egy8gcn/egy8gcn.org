I don't really think I have a preference to one or te other. I occasionally look at topics which I find interesting but leave it at that. HP was my introduction to fanfic, but I've mostly moved on to other fandoms and only very rarely read HP ff.

Still, I have to say that I don't recognize what others are saying about discussion not being possible on harrypotter. I have loads of fun discussions there, even if we ended up disagreeing. Perhaps it's because I prefer staying rather close to canon, but I think that if you explain your reasoning and remind people that this is your opinion they are generally very reasonable.
