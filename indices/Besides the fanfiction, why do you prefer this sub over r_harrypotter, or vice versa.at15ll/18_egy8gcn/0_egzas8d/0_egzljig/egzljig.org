I get that, since it's fiction and if you follow canon exactly you might as well read the books. Don't really know how to explain it though, and having tought to much about it now I kinda have lost wat I originally meant to say... oops. I think I mean that I rather like the original couples (I rather hate the 'Hermione would fit Harry much better'. Whenever Harry is alone with Hermione in the books he complains it is much better when Ron's around. I blame the movies for giving people this idea)

The discussion rather starts when you begin talking about how you interpret canon, and what personal headcanons you hold dear. And as I said, I have had multiple discussions about canon over there (was Mrs Figg actually able to see the dementors, yes or no, for instance) that always were friendly and without excessive downvoting. I feel that as long as you support your opinion (or make clear that you are talking about fanfiction) there isn't really a problem.
