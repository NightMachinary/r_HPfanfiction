I follow both, but tend to spend more time over here because fanfiction innately imparts more freedom to examine any disparate possibilities one could imagine.

If I go over there and ask, "What if Petunia had gone to Hogwarts with Lily and ended up with Sirius" I get the feeling the response would be much different than asking the same question here. (Though, as I'm not in the habit of starting discussions often, I would probably not do so either way.)
