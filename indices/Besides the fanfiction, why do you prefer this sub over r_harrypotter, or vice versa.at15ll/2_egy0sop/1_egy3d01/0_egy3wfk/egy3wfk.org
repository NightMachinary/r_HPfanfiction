Yes, it's a literary technique called "unreliable narration".

But it's commonly used by members of the fanbase is to handwave plot inconsistencies, like why Harry never knew Luna or McLaggen existed before they were introduced in books 5 and 6, even though Luna was a friend and neighbor of Ginny, and McLaggen (a notorious attention seeker, braggart, and guy who ate a pound of doxy eggs) was in his house.

From a writing perspective, they weren't relevant to the plot, and that's why they weren't introduced. But readers will try to find an in-story explanation, and it's usually "Harry wasn't paying attention".
