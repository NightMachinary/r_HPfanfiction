It could also be using different media lenses to analyse the film. approaches are Watsonian or Doylist [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg13Kcw-w5Y][This video helps break down how you can use these two approaches to look at the books itself and in what contexts you might use them.]]

Fundamentally you are right in that the books could be written better, in which case you are using a Doylist approach to critique the book and look at its contents. But it is the wrong way to approach people making handcanons, who have accepted the book-as-is and are now then trying to build on the book by extrapolating and "filling in the blanks" Thus, "Harry didn't notice" is a reasonable answer to the question of why Luna didn't show up in the earlier books.

Like an easy headcanon that many other media would show and play for humor is to flashback to the past events. Give humorous reasons and coincidences to show two characters almost meeting, repeatedly before their first actual canon meeting.

Then ok, you broke down the plot inconsistencies of the books. You showed those ignorant fans that they've enjoyed the books wrong! You were right!

And now what? What next?

I mean by definition, [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is about a series where the last book came out 12 years ago, the last movie 7 years ago. Surely for a media series this popular and this influential, the readers you are trying to persuade might have already had a discussion about plot inconsistencies and other flaws in the writing. Anyone who still participates in that subreddit is still willing to show love for a series whose main canon was last expanded a generation ago Like if they know the book is not perfect and they still love the series enough to participate in that subreddit specifically, what can they do? They can't rewrite the series, they aren't going to drop the book series so ultimately headcanon is what they have left. In-canon explanations for inexplicable plot points, is so much more useful as a way to sustain discussion and love for the series. So of course they would handwave it away.
