I'm a big proponent of the idea that JKR made things up as she wrote the series. She introduces new ideas and twists characters and their personalities /to fit the plot/ she writes. Her work, by far, isn't perfect. That's not to say it's not enjoyable, but it's got tons of wacky worldbuilding and much, much more.

If you said this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], you would get downvoted to heck, because unlike fanfiction authors who re-interpret and write transformative takes on the series, the people there are way protective and defense of JKR and her works as some sort of sacred text. JKR's Twitter, Cursed Child, and the movies can be criticized at will, but the original books themselves are perfect, and they will think up elaborate headcanons to justify why no one ever checked up on Harry at the Dursleys during his childhood, why Dumbledore did nothing for 35 years after Tom Riddle left school and became Voldemort, why it took Dumbledore a year to share 30 minutes' worth of Pensieve memories, why the Deathly Hallows camping sequence even happened.

On the main sub, the people there will twist their minds into pretzels to retroactively justify character inconsistencies in the books. The handwave force is strong over there, with their reasoning. It's absolutely /bonkers./

- "Chill dude, it's a story for children."

- "It doesn't make sense, but that didn't stop you from loving the story at age 12."

- "The books were written from Harry's PoV, and he is not observant, and also limited in perspective and naturally biased".

- "The books didn't say it wasn't like this."

  - (In reference to Nagini being an Asian woman, and McGonagall a 120 old woman who took a 50 year sabbatical so she can appear in CoG and have taught for 39 years by OotP. The reaching after FB:CoG was crazy.)

As fanfic readers and writers, I think we can admit that JKR pulled author fiat. Not as many true plot holes as people think (and "Plot Hole" is used so often that it has lost all meaning these days) but inconsistencies of character, character motivation, and lack of characterization depth, all to serve the overarching plot.
