I post on both subs, and even as someone who is generally pro-canon, on average I probably prefer [[/r/HPfanfiction]], even if this sub is somewhat less supportive of Harry/Ginny, for example (still trying to do my part to convert you heathens here, though). As others have said in this thread, the discussion is simply more interesting, while on the main sub it's just stale meme after meme from Tumblr.
