*/A brief glimpse into [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], field report./*

^{Bruised} ^{and} ^{smelling} ^{of} ^{fat} ^{and} ^{hair} ^{dye,} ^{I} ^{offer} ^{you} ^{these} ^{fascinating} ^{tales} ^{of} ^{what} ^{that} ^{wretched} ^{place} ^{looks} ^{like} ^{so} ^{that} ^{you} ^{can} ^{spare} ^{yourself} ^{the} ^{trauma.}

The pinned post is titled "FebruROARy's RipROARing MegathROARd!" You know you're in for a ride when the /pinned post/ makes you cringe.

The second post on the "Hot" tab has 3700 upvotes. Its entirety is this:

  I'm listening to the audio book for Goblet of Fire and I just love when Mrs Weasley and Bill show up as Harry's family to watch him in the final tournament. That must have made him so happy.

Fascinating insight, but okay. Nothing wrong with an expression of being overcome with fluffy joy. Just, y'know.

The third post from the "Hot" tab, in its entirety, with its 460 upvotes (95% upvoted) and 80 comments:

  Why did nobody think to put wii remote wrist straps on wands. Expelliarmus would be useless and harry would of been dead by book 5.

Tremendous. Imaginative. Original. The best idea in the history of ideas, maybe ever. /Wii. Remote. Wrist. Straps./

That sub has over 20 times the number of subscribers than this one, and yet only 4 times the online. Makes you think.

Recent controversial posts include such wild and crazy questions as "Did Molly Weasley recognize Harry at the train station that first trip to Hogwarts?", "Why Narcissa is not Death Eater?" and "Was anyone else slightly uncomfortable with the Crimes of Grindelwald movie?". Don't forget to mentally lisp that last one.

And finally, the Top Post Of All Time on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. The /very best/ they have to offer. The pinnacle, as it were.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/6gfh0p/so_not_a_true_fan/]]

It is a picture making fun of a girl for /not/ wanting Harry Potter to be aborted by Lily. The top post ever. 48k upvotes, 83% upvotes. A low-effort meme celebrating abortion of the very reason for that sub's existence.

All in all, "disappointed, but not surprised" is my main takeaway from that place. I think I'll stay here.
