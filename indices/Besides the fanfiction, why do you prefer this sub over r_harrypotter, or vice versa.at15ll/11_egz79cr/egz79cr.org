I prefer this sub because besides recommending awesome stories which I grew quite fond of, its also a place to discuss fan theories, canon elements, characters and worldbuilding, in relation to the Harry Potter series itself but also to the fanfics.

Meanwhile, [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is a den of low quality memes, cringe and cheap tattoos. And God have mercy on your soul if you dare have some criticism to the canon, worldbuilding, thinking the movies arent the worst thing since Hitler, or, and this above all, if you say something bad of Rowling herself.

Im happy its not a toxic wasteland, like lots of other subreddits are, but it feels a bit... I dont know. A bit too much. This place is way better in my opinion.
