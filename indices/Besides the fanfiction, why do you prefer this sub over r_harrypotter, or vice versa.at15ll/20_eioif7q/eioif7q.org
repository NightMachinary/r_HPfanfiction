You convinced me. I'm posting here. I've been downvoted into oblivion on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] for talking about racism, sexism, questioning logical flaws in the universe, and of course, feeling certain characters were underwritten, ahem Ginny. There's also too much confusion between the books and films (lots of posts saying "Oh why did Cho Chang betray the DA?"). They also make crazy contortions to justify anything Jo says does or writes which I find dull.
