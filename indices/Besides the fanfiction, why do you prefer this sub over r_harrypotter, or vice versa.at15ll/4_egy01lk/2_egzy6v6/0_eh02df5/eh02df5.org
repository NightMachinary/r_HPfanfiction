As someone who thinks that Bellatrix is a more viable option than Malfoy or Snape (although it still is a crackship), let me tell you that it is down to three factors. The "coolness" of Bellatrix, her combat ability and the fact that she spent over a decade in prison.

Now to add some depth:

1 We see that Snape holds a petty grudge and takes it out on an 11 year old boy. That is simply too pathetic to see past that IMO. Add that everything he does is due to an obsession with a girl he drove away and then not only tore down the bridge but dropped several nukes onto the area by joining the Death Eaters.

We know that Malfoy is all bark but no bite. He spends years boasting about his family and calls for racial purges by twelve, yet he cannot put his money where his mouth is. And while we see Bellatrix attack the actual opposition, Malfoy tries some stupid scheme which attacks civilians but has no chance of achieving its objectives.

Meanwhile, Bellatrix is cool evil, much like Vader. She is absolutely ruthless and a complete psychopath, but from what we have seen she makes a top notch enforcer. She is also the only actual threat other than Voldemort and fucking Umbridge. Which brings us to

2 Bellatrix is a capable fighter. She takes down Tonks and Sirius with nonlethal spells. She is capable of defeating some of the more capable Order Members without even going all out. She duelled three Order members to a standstill, simultaneously. Snape is certainly a good spy, but we never see him against a capable fighter. But he was defeated pretty easily in his worst memory, and given what we know about Bellatrix, I doubt that she would have gone down that easily. You can make her one of the most capable fighters without contradicting canon. And Malfoy is nowhere near either of them. Something which makes Bellatrix cool evil again.

3 Call me old fashioned, but IMO criminals have to be punished for their misdeeds. Not just rehabilitated, but actually punished. There can be no redemption without punishment. Therefore, at least in my opinion, Bellatrix is more redeemable than Snape or Malfoy. She didn't enjoy life in a manor or castle, she was tortured in an inhumane prison. She has faced consequences for her actions. Which makes me more inclined to give her a fresh start.

Lastly, disregarding time travel there is exactly one scenario in which I would consider Bellatrix a viable partner. She has to defect BEFORE the DoM battle. Not to Dumbledore, but to either Harry and by extension Hermione, or to Andromeda and later Harry. Thirteen years in hell on earth are certainly enough to justify a change of heart.

That being said, there is a scenario in which I would consider Draco as viable option. If he begins to question pureblood supremacy before and without calling Hermione Mudblood. He shouldn't immediately declare his undying love for the Beatles, but question during the second year, investigate during the third and slowly come around during the fourth or fifth. Also, just because he considers blood purity bullshit that does not mean that his opinion of the Weasleys would rise.
