  open-minded to discussion -- for the most part, I am not hesitant to share my opinion on something in HP canon

The discussion generally is more open, not just about canon. We had quite a few "headcanon" threads were the most popular headcanons shit all over canon and yet are the most popular replies. Hell, you can joke about Albus Severus being the result of Ginny cheating, and you get upvotes because people get that you are not very serious and just throwing some shade at Rowling. Which is also something we are very open for.

I think that the only things which get you instantly downvoted here are requests for serious underage (as in, 8 year olds getting raped and not a bunch of 5th years fooling around), rape in general and Death Eater pairings because most people simply find them unbelievable. But other than that, we are usually down for discussions, no matter if the simple "who is best girl" or the nuances of magical theory.
