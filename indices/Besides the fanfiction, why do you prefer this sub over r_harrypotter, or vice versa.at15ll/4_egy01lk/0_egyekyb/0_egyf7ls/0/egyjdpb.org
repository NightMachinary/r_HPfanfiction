I think this revealed to me why I prefer this sub: I never watched most of the movies.

I own 1, have seen clips of 2, I think I saw 3 once, I've seen most of 4 but out of order, and have only seen gifs of 5-8. I have sense of who movie!Ron is - the only characterization I know is from the books.

So arguments about movie v. books bore me. I only know the books anyways.
