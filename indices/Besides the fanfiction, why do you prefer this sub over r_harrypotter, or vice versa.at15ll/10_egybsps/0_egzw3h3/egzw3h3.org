Yeah, I agree with this. Often people post "plot holes" and I'm like... that's you misunderstanding something, not a plot hole. Not saying that there aren't any.

I love people using fanfiction to expand on details from canon, I love people exploring what-ifs, I love people rewriting a bit of canon to make their favourite ship work, but people claiming to make canon BETTER often write absolute shit fics, IMO. It's all angsty teenage drama shit that I just find pathetic, usually.

Since starting to read the HP subreddits I've been amazed at the number of people who seem to have nothing but contempt for canon. It's like they're in the fandom to hate and ridicule as much as possible and I'm just like... go find something you actually LIKE?
