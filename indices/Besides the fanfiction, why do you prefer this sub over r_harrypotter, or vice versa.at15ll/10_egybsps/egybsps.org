There are a lot more in-depth discussions here + focus on the actual books (I don't care about movies, games and interview stuff at all)

  Additionally, instead of simply singing praise of canon, this sub really delves into canon and /breaks it down/, usually to make it better.

Sometimes yes, it's silly to put the books on pedestal like some people do, but often "breaking canon down" devolves into silly nitpicking, to be honest. Most of the "plotholes" aren't really plotholes, and even when they are... I don't see how having Flint repeat his year, for example, decreases the overall literary value of the books. And yes, sometimes the events are timed so that a dramatic reveal can happen when the plot demands it or some minor characters' personalities are exaggerated for satirical purposes, and there's nothing wrong with that. This is how fiction works. I don't expect 100% realism and pages upon pages of wordbuiding explaining every detail of the world from fantasy mystery coming-of-age stories, and they would be actively worse for having it. It's fun to speculate and fill in the blanks, but sometimes people here approach the books like CinemaSins youtube channel, only 100% serious.
