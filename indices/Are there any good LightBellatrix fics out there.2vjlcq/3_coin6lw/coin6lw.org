I read a REALLY good one a little while back, focusing on Andromeda Tonks point of view (from when she was a kid, raised in the black's house with Narcissa and Bellatrix as sisters). It was an extremely good read, but I seem to be unable to find it.

It featured Andromeda as the middle sister learning to heal and protect her younger siblings, with Bellatrix acting out, getting hooked on heroine, using dark magic, all to deal with the violence and abuse of the home life. Alternatively, the younger sister Narcissa becomes cold, withdrawn, not fully present. It's a very interesting read and actually something I fully accept as headcannon. Ill see if I can find it here... (still looking, I'd really like to re-read it)
