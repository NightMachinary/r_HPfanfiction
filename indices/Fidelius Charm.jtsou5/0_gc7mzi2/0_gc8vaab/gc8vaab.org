I think the reason why Voldemort did not cast a fidelius on the cave that holded his horcrux is because he can't cast a fidelius. It is cannon that dark wizards and witches cannot cast a Patronus because of their idea of happines is twisted and my hypothesis is that fidelius requires you to show complete trust to someone. The word fidelius comes from latin word "fidem" which means belief or trust. We can easily say that Voldemort did not trust anybody.
