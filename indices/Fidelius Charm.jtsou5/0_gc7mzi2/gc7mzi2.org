Canon fidelis is only seen protecting locations, is known to be complicated, and the secret keeper must /willingly/ give up the secret, so no mind magics such as leligemency or obliviate work. If the SK dies it passes on to all who have the secret. The wiki claims that if the SK dies without anyone else knowing, it's lost forever.

Personally I think the fidelis' uses need to be massively expanded, or limitations imposed. It's known that the SK can be under fidelis (Arthur-Burrow, Bill-Shell), however James & Lily choose someone else. Why doesn't Voldemort make finding his horcruxes impossible by making himself or a dead person SK. Play with it how you like in fanon.
