My takeaways are:

The secret keeper cannot be part of the secret. If they could, either Lily or James could have been the secret keeper in canon and they would have been untouchable.

The secret either cannot be Obliviated, or Obliviating it causes the Fidelius to collapse as the secret keeper no longer has the secret.

The Fidelius could potentially work with any kind of secret, but we don't see this happen in canon. If it was possible, I think it would be a much more common spell due to how versatile it would be.
