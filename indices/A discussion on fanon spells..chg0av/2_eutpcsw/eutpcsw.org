I sort of thought you were gonna be like 'the paint stripping charm is straight fanon and why would we expect it to work on human skin'. Different direction than I though you were going.

In the vein of your post though: I have two thoughts.

First: even if I can't cast the levitation charm on a human person (or, if you're familiar with Worm, if we assume the levitation charm is manton limited) then shouldn't I still be able to cast it on someone's clothes? Ditto for accio?

Second: I think the fundamental difference in perspectives here is that you seem to be thinking of spells as being task oriented. "The levitation charm is a spell designed for the task of lifting inanimate objects, therefore it cannot be used to lift /animate/ objects." I think most of us think of spells as being more function oriented. "The levitation charm is a spell which *lifts things*." For me, the severing charm is like hedge clippers. It's /designed/ to be used on dead things, or generally on non-human things. But if I want to, I /can/ use my hedge clippers to decapitate someone. If I have a hammer spell, while it might be designed for nails, I don't see an immediate reason it couldn't be used on skulls. That's not to say I think your point is without merit, it is totally possible that due to how magic works, a spell designed for task A cannot be used for task B. Maybe the severing charm has inbuilt limitations to prevent it being used on humans, or some sort of conceptual orientation so that it *is* purpose/task driven and can only do what it was built for. however, the fact Hermione accidentally cut Ron using the severing charm would seem to suggest against this. As an additional note, while the severing charm might be inferior to Sectumsempra for combat purposes, I would suggest that this has more to do with Sectumsempra being a *curse*; we saw how difficult it was to heal a wound caused by it, while presumably the severing charm would be very easy to heal, making it much less useful for combat.
