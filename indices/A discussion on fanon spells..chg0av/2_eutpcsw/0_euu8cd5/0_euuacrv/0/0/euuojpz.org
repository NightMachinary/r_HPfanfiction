That's quite possibly true - fanon has it that way, although canon is silent except in as much as we only ever see Dumbledore and Voldemort fighting with transfiguration, and only against each other.

That said, were I to reincarnate as a self-insert, I would be directing my studies as hard as possible toward this branch of magic, because if there /isn't/ a spell to deliver Bullet Ants to an enemy's crotch, I mean to become the wizard infamous for inventing it.
