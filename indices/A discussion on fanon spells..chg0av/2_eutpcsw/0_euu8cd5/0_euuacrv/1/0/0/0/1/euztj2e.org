Worth mentioning, another name for the bullet ant, a more informal one, is '24 hour ant'. You propably can infer what lasts 24 hours.

Also, while supremely painful, they are relatively non-lethal, even if there are a few bites. That's useful.\\
If you wanted someone to feel supreme pain and then keel over you might as well crucio and then AK him after you get your fill of screams. Definitely much easier solution than transifguring something to acid
