Someone who's suddenly coated in H2SO4 just lost all his pain receptors along with the top layer of skin, and really doesn't have any distractions during his dead man's thirty seconds. This is how Death Curses get cast.

A crotch full of stinging ants - named as they are because their stings feel like being shot - your opponent is doing /nothing/ for the rest of the fight except maybe screaming. And he's in good shape for interrogation after, since he /knows/ you're a pitilessly sadistic bastard.
