I'm a little confused if it worked or not, here's the quote:

#+begin_quote
  Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. “Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. “Hagrid --- Accio Hagrid!”

  The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!”

Hagrid had jumped off the bike to take out a Death Eater, so he was below. It says the bike sped up, but he had just hit the "speed up" button on the motorcycle, and I don't think Accio exerts any force on the caster. Hagrid is next seen on the ground, although he survives, so it might have slowed him down some?
