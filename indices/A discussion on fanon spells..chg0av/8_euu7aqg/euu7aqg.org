The problem with canon spells is that they used by JKR consistently as /deus ex machina/. Whenever she gets herself into some unresolvable problem she just pulls out of the thin air some new charm (or abuses some old one) and all is well. Yes, it doesn't make sense, because it didn't make sense in canon. Summoning charm is one obvious example, where it was obviously abused in horrible ways:

- No, I don't believe that summoning something which the caster cannot view, works (e.g., Harry summoning his broomstick in the Triwizard Tournament). She just struggled with the problem how to make fourth-year wizard compete in the really super-complicated tournament for the most qualified wizards. She cannot make tasks to easy, but she has to keep Harry's knowledge of spells quite limited. If the summoning charm was capable of doing what Harry her presents, there would so lees reason for wizards to ever move (which is generally problem: why are not all wizards and witches Vernon-like cylinders, when they can summon everything, they never have to move their feet, because of apparating, etc.?).
- Summoning something which you don't even know exists (Hermione actually didn't even know Dumbledore has the books in his office, not mentioning she didn't know the titles, she didn't know how they look, or even how many of them there are). If this really worked, the universe collapses, because most action could be done remotely, there is no need for most transportation, when unlimited transport for unlimited distances (see above) is available in one charm. What [[/u/Regular_Bus]] wrote above. It just breaks the universe.
- And yes summoning people (although, obviously that's what happened with Hagrid in DH) is a complete disaster. Why Hogwarts express, carriages from Hogsmeade, most walking, why to limit apparating in Hogwarts, when one wizard can just summon the other one (for unlimited distance, see above)? It just completely breaks the universe.

I think the only reasonable thing to do with some JKR's charms is to limit them to something reasonable in order to keep the universe functioning, and just shut your eyes when Mrs. Rowling uses them as /deus ex machina/. So the Summoning charm works on limited distance (only for visible objects?), with limited weight (no, one fourth-year witch cannot summon a carriage full of kids, nobody can summon Deathers' catapult in the Last Battle), and with a very specific intent.
