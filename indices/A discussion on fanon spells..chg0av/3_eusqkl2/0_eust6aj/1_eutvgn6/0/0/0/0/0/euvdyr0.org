That's exactly why it's an unforgivable I think. There's loads of spells that can kill people, but the Killing Curse breaks the rules. Well, that and it requires you to REALLY want to kill someone. It's never an accident.

I don't think the Killing Curse is an easy spell to cast, though. It gets thrown around like expelliarmus in the movies, but I think barely anyone uses it in the books. Only high tier Death Eaters, iirc.
