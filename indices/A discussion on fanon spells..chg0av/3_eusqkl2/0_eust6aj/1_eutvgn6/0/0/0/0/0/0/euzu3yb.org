Well then it must be a great anti-mosquito spell in the summers.\\
IIRC only Voldemort was throwing the AK around, other Death Eaters used it for executions or stuff like that but not in a duelling setting - even Bellatrix in DoM hit Sirius with a stunner, not an unforgivable. That's propably why Voldie is so feared, he is propably the first wizard to go around actually not caring whether he kills wizards by the dozens or not.
