  Hermione summoned Dumbledore's Horcrux Books, despite never having seen them.

Which is monumentally amazing, if you get into it...the amount of stuff you could get! I mean shit, didn't she only ASSUME Dumbledore took out some HYPOTHETICAL books on Horcruxes from the library? And yet she was able to summon said hypothetically removed books she didn't even KNOW EXISTED OR NOT, WHERE THEY EVEN WERE, or...GOD DAMN, and it WORKED! That's just insanely powerful and abusable.

I mean by that CANON manner of how the spell works, you could literally just go, "Accio lost Aztec Gold" and it'd come to you if it still existed, no matter where it was or anything! Or any other lost, historical, priceless stuff, like old paintings or whatever. You don't even need to know WHERE something is to summon it, or even that it exists! If it does, it'll just WORK. And it doesn't even matter how far away it is either!

And it works for vague shit too, like Mrs. Weasley on Fred and George's pockets of prank stuff or whatever.

Accio seriously has to be the most broken spell in the universe. And it's CANON broken.
