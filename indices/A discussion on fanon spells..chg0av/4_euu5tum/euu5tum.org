Magical stamina isn't a thing, but regular stamina is. Your arm can still get tired from waving around the wand constantly, your throat can get sore from screaming out too many inctantations, your brain can get tired from over-focusing on just spamming the spells. Just because there's no "magical exhaustion" doesn't mean doing magic for a long time can't be tiring.
