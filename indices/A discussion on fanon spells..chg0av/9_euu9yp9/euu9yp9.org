I always thought that if Reducto made peoples' body parts explode, it would be considered a Dark spell, certainly not something Harry would teach to Dumbledore's Army.

And if the Severing Charm could cut people, Harry wouldn't have used it on Cedric's bag to get his attention, because, you know... risk of accidental decapitation.
