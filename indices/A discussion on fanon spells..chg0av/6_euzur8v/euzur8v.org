You should consider that Harry is a Defense/Dark Arts prodigy. You're using his shield charm as the basis for this when we know he's exceptional. When he first starts learning the spell in GoF he can barely block weak jinxes. A couple years later he's casting advanced versions of protego without needing to used the varying different incantations, such is his mastery of the spell.
