It's always interesting to see longer form critique or reviews of fanfics - it's enjoyable to see what other people like, dislike, focus on, etc. So thanks for that!

This story in particular is one that I couldn't get into myself - the start didn't feel great (it felt too 'lazy' to me), and Harry's personality was not for me. The way overblown fight that he and Hermione/Ron have was terrible - and Fleur's personality was also not to my liking.

For the 'lazy' start above, it's something that I'm sure others would be fine with - but I don't like the starts that go 'canon happened up until now, but Harry has had a different personality throughout that only makes things change now.' I find it a lazy way to start a story and handwave away the different characterization of Harry - in this case, a more reserved Harry ought to have had further changes in the past of the story. I'd find it much more fitting to have the 'backstory' change along with it - even if the story itself starts in 4th year with the plot the author is interested in. Eg, instead of Harry managing to turn into a magical prodigy in a summer, having him be more studious from the start of his schooling would make that feel more natural, and less of a power-up on the spot - even if it functionally gets him to the same point at the start of the fic.

But it sounds like that stations of cannon problem extends further than I'd read in this fic, so perhaps it's a bit much of me to complain about it being there in the backstory :P
