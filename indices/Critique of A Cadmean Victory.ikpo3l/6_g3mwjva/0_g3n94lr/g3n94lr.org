Katie was the best written part of that story, but the author just temporarily replaced her with a pod person for some made up drama.

Like okay, Katie accepts some randoms invite, because she thinks Harry was into Fleur. That's perfectly in character for a teenager.

But then she sorted things out with Harry, figured out Harry was just affected by her allure.

And was like "I'ma still gonna go with that random dude, despite saying how much I regret accepting his invite, but I totes like you instead and you should just totally watch me go on a date with that other dude and be all into me afterwards?"

What?

The author could have just had the characters not talk things out and keep the misunderstanding going. I'd have gotten PTSD flashbacks into my own teenager years sure, but it'd have been a perfectly reasonable way to have their relationship fizzle out.

But he had Katie act as if she had taken an unbreakable vow or something. JUST TELL THE RANDOM GUY YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND!!!

I actually liked that fic overall, but when I think about Cadmean Victory, all the positives are completely drowned out by this scene. I am actually a little awed at how the author managed to plant such a long lasting emotional response within me, with only a few paragraphs.
