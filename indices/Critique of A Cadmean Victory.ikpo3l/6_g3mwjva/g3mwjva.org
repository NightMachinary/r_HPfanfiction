  Katie

I can't say that I've read beyond the 4th year, but the depiction of Katie is one of my biggest gripes with how far I've read.

She wants to be Harry's date and she does not like the guy who asked her... yet she still goes with him despite knowing that she does not want to, that it will be less fun and that she is hurting Harry. A "realistic" teenager would have told the random OC to fuck off and have gone with their preferred date. And more importantly, it served very little purpose. Harry was already on his angsty trip, which was very annoying to read if I am honest. It was such clich√© romantic drama for drama's sake.
