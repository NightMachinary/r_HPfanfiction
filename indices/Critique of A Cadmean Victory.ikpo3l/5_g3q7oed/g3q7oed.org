My understanding is that the story is an inversion of the old Indy!Harry trope. Generally in those kind of stories we see Harry discovering that he was being manipulated, all his old friends turn against him, he inherits tons of properties and money from random families (which creates more content about shopping trips, political ramifications and economics in general than most would like to read), go to war with a ‘no mercy' mentality ending with him killing both Voldemort and Dumbledore through skill/power and going on to live happily ever after.

In this one while Dumbledore was manipulative he actually had good reasons for keeping secrets (the magic he was trying had very specific conditions), was trying to keep as many on his side alive as possible and didn't go on a killing spree because Voldemort was an actual greater threat if cornered (he /did/ petty much destroy the country) and wasn't looking for personal benefits over the common good of all citizens (a great falling of GreaterGood!Dumbledore), this culminated in the fact that when Harry /did/ confront Dumbledore getting the whole truth and killed him he found out that he just let his own paranoia control him making him kill a likable person that was trying his best the whole time to protect him while acting as a deterrent for Voldemort, leading him to feel guilty over it instead of victorious and having negative consequences on the war.

Harry's friendships weren't ended just because of the other's actions, Harry at one point recognized that the others were actually acting their age and that he was the one to overreact burning permanently that bridge. The effects of such a thing are seen over the rest of the story by the fact that even when Harry is actively fighting for them no one sees him as a Hero until his death (and presumably the deaths of many of the other students), always seeing him as a dark wizard and keeping him isolated.

One thing Indy!Harry stories always have are alternatives to dealing with the Horcrux in his forehead without him needing to die and Dumbledore's irrational unwillingness to do so. Instead, here Harry's way of dealing with the Horcrux ends being even worse than Dumbledore's to the point we literally see his soul being torn and from there on we can see how he quickly changes for the worse (this is mostly the time period in which he passes from ‘edgy teen' to ‘outright monster ‘) subtly bringing the question /'was Dumbledore's way so bad compared to this?'/.

Then there is his role in the war in which he acts mercilessly bringing death and destruction to the Death Eaters, and so prompting Voldemort to new heights of murder in revenge. Tonks is the most obvious example in which he only took the time to kill her as revenge for Bellatrix, but overall his actions killing Voldemort's power-base and resources (like Snape) prompts him to act in worse ways to get more supporters and take over the government quickly (Azkaban for example) which overall results in a bigger bloodshed than otherwise. Then there are Harry's own more questionable actions like killing a teenager for being in the way, the story in no moment tries to make it seem heroic or justified, making this action more monstrous than anything else, thus Fleur's and his own guilty-free acceptance of it take the air of them being monsters instead of killing monsters or fighting in a war.

The story completely side-steps politics in its entirety (which is fair, he /is/ still a teenager/young adult) and excessive money issues by making it so his inheritance ends being only the one his parents left for him and not including political positions in it. This was an actually smart move as it let the story focus on the combat part of the war instead as getting sidetracked every three paragraphs as so many others tend to do, plus eliminating the issue of a group of adults in a governmental position taking a teen seriously. Plus the only times that the story outright shows him buying things are either through Fleur or that one time for unicorn blood, both being used as devices to move the plot along.

Then there is the confrontations. Up to the end we can clearly see that even with all the rituals Harry did Voldemort is still clearly the superior in power and skill, subverting the common trope as Voldemort has the same advantages as Harry plus much more time to develop them and learn how they can be better used. In the end even with all the effort Harry spent trying to step out of Dumbledore's influence and plans he is still outmatched and sees himself forced to go with Dumbledore's plans to save Fleur, with the only difference his actions have caused in comparison with how it happens in cannon being a much greater death-toil and that his sacrifice ends protecting only one person instead of everyone as it did originally.

My take is that the point of the story was show the other possible result of the Indy!Harry trope, in which the final result is much more suffering and death for everyone than they would suffer and a much bleaker life for Harry himself (as by the end he was reviled by many and had only Fleur -his romantic interest- at his side instead of all the friends, family and a healing nation that cannon!Harry had, plus cannon!Harry also had a much lighter conscience after the war and was much more human).
