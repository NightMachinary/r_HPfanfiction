So...the first thing I want to address is that stories don't necessarily need a moral, and not all authors are trying to convey one when they write anything, let alone a fanfiction. In fact, I would say that morals aren't even the point of stories in general. Stories are far more than that and aren't really something you can pin down to a /point./ Stories fill a variety of needs in our lives, we use them to convey thoughts, ideas, memories, and yes morals, but they also are used to entertain, to escape, to find oneself, or even sometimes to feel a little less lonely in the world. Our entire lives are made of stories large and small, some intended to be stories, some not. There's not a /point/ to stories, they are, and they fill a different need for everyone else. This story may not have a moral it's trying to convey, and that's fine. It serves a purpose nonetheless. When I write anything, I never think "What do I want to tell my audience?" Most of what I write isn't even intended for an audience. It's a release of something bumbling around in my head, some idea I can't let go until I put it down on paper.

​

To address some of your more specific points. Mainly the thoughts that occurred to me as I read your review.

Tone: While I'm not sure, because I never asked and the author never said, but I interpreted the tone of those first chapters as directly reflecting Harry's mindset. It's not that he's introverted, though he is, he's broken and damaged, and doesn't actually form a "normal" emotional response to things. It comes across as unemotional because he /is/. He was affected and impacted by his life among the Dursleys and by Pettigrews escape more than he was in canon and in different ways that changed how he responded to the world, and it wasn't until he started growing and forming attachments that he started to gain those more normal emotional responses. However, the important thing to remember is those kinds of mental wounds never leave us. They become scars in our psyche that will affect us for years after the trauma has been removed and by years, I mean the rest of our lives. It never goes away, merely softens over time. So while he learned to have more normal emotional responses, they will still be blunted and withdrawn, and he will often relapse into what is pretty plainly sociopathic behavior. This isn't a protagonist you are supposed to relate to, but it is a lens into a different style of thought, informed by a different lifestyle(another thing we use stories for, to help us think in different ways due to the different lenses characters have). While I could be wrong, I do believe that even the tone of the writing itself is a literary device the author used to set the emotional tone of the story.

Neville: In canon, Neville visits his parents at least every Christmas. In all likelihood probably far more often. He has to deal with seeing them mentally broken and physically decrepit. He has to receive the same candy wrappers from his mother every visit and deal with the fact that his parents will never recognize him in any meaningful way. Not only that but he also has to deal with his relatives having unreasonable expectations that he live up to his father's name and he has no one to defend him. More than that, no one replaces the parental figures in his life, so he definitely would feel that absence keenly. To top all of this off, his grandmother made sure he knew that his parents gave their sanity to save him. My point to all this? OF COURSE HE WANTS TO KILL THE LESTRANGES AND CROUCH JR.!!!! OF COURSE HE FEELS AN INDESCRIBABLE RAGE!! THAT'S A FAIRLY NORMAL RESPONSE TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION! Not really out of character I think, and even if it was, it's fanfiction. The whole point is things are different, otherwise, it'd be plagiarism.

Harry/Fleur: Eh, yeah, they can be pretty horrible people, I'll give you that. However, there are extenuating circumstances for a lot of that. Harry is a sociopath, plain and simple, he doesn't really have a well-developed sense of empathy, and also lacks a firm moral compass. Fleur is not fully human(depending on how your headcanon follows) I don't know if the veela as a species were fully dived into in this fic, as it's been a while since I've read it, but we have no idea how that affected her thought process(I guess you could say she's a bit of a birdbrain). Either way, yeah they're messed up, but that doesn't mean they're unlikable, they just fill a different niche in characters than your bog-standard hero protagonist.

​

Side note: Fleur never witnessed Harry putting his name in the goblet, she saw him in the same hall when she was dropping her name in. That's all.

Romance: I completely disagree that all-out war and romance are incompatible, in fact, all-out war and romance quite often go hand in hand, even in real life. There's something about the threat of death that causes people to want to validate the fact they are alive, and love is a massive affirmation in that regard. As for their relationship, conflicting desires and doubts are something people have to deal with all the time. You can be sure that you want something(family with Fleur) but at the same time be uneasy about it. Quite often this turns into self-sabotage, which causes a lot of relationships to fail and combust. Lack of relationship development, I can see how that might be a problem, but the majority of their relationship is stolen moments, and quite a bit of it happens off-screen, I think most of the point here was to give Harry something to live for, something to strive for. It didn't need to show the development that wasn't the point of it. Furthermore, romance can be as much a literary device as anything else and doesn't need to accurately reflect reality, it really depends on what the author wants the romance to accomplish. Finally, it's the height of hubris to say that just because an author might not have a ton of experience in romance means that they probably won't be able to write it well, and also the height of hubris to assume what a romance needs in order to be engaging and worthwhile. For the first part, human interaction is everywhere, in stories and in life(which is really a bunch of stories in and of itself), there is plenty of inspiration there to be able to write a good romance even if you've never been in a relationship yourself. Second, romance comes in all kinds of different flavors and types. Not every romance will have the same trials and tribulations, and not every couple has the same issues.

​

Filler: Yeah it can be annoying depending on how it's done, but I personally find it has its place if done well, it's a step away from the action and the drama, giving a reprieve from the heavy hits. In an extremely long fic it's absolutely necessary for me to have this or I become emotionally deadened due to hit after hit after hit. Those steps out are a way to reset and recover from everything going on, so that when the calm in the eye of the storm is over, you are able to feel the full weight once more. Same for the characters.

​

Explanations of magic: This is an entirely personal preference, I happen to love fics with a detailed system of magic and that explain it. I love diving deep into that especially if it's off the beaten path of canon. That probably comes from a love of knowing how things work and it's something you find everywhere in fantasy and science fiction. Just because you don't enjoy it doesn't make it a flaw, it means it's not your cup of tea.

​

About the rituals: Ehhh most of what you said is a matter of personal preference but there's one point I would like to address. Why it's not widespread: This is a matter of control largely and I believe in the fic it actually used to /be/ widespread, a rite of passage for every mage. But it's easier to control a herd of sheep than a pack of wolves and demonizing a branch of magic designed to make you stronger is an easy way to remove the fangs and claws from potential wolves. There's also a matter of potential. Harry became the third strongest wizard because he had the potential to and the rituals helped him reach that potential.

​

There are a lot more points I could address but this reply is long enough already, and I feel I've made my point. Most of what you call flaws are a matter of personal preference than a poor writing style, and that's fine. Hell, the fact you posted it here so that we could have a group discussion about it is also fine, it's nice to be able to do so. I just dislike the insinuations that the author wrote a poor fic, or even just an "Acceptable" like it's some kind of objective evaluation when it's not. It's entirely subjective and I think that needs to be stated.

(For the record: in response to the question at the end of Misc.: Yes people do actually speak to each other like this and not just teenagers. Fear and worry can all too easily transform into anger which is a normal emotional response, and people even adults will say things like this. It's nothing to do with avoiding softness or sentimentality, it's a release of pent up emotions in an explosive fashion)
