Solid critiques of the story, you wrote a lot of the negatives so I'm going to focus on the positives and try hit on your points. You wrote a lot so I'm going to try and hit as many points as I can. It isn't a perfect story, but it is a very good story when you consider the sheer volume of fanfictions out there. Love it or hate it, it is objectively a better than average story. Subjectively is an entirely different matter. The issues you tend to have with them though are subjective issues rather than objective.

Pace: Fair point about the beginning being rushed, but there isn't really any winning here. Some people want a longer rehash, others want it to just get into the actual plot/divergence.

I wouldn't say there isn't character development in some of the chapters you have issues with, but again not for every, it's subjective. In Chapter 68, it serves as a sort of reminder and showing the lighter side to Harry. The furniture shopping showing there's more to life than what Harry is doing, just acting normal.

You're saying "Remove the filler" but reading it after the fact. It was on a pretty steady schedule when updated live and so fillers suck, but it keeps consistency. Sometimes when writing, I imagine you need to get towards lighter topics at times and things just flow, and rather then tossing it, just keep it in and give the readers something during normal update time.

The magic lectures were okay I think, but again, subjective and not everyone wants it. Rituals all at once, I thought it was better to spread it out, it sort of showed that it takes preparation, cannot be done on a whim or by everyone.

Mental state, didn't Harry practice Occlumency and do some sort of ritual that made his mind clearer? The Occlumency in the story was meant to be really helpful in dealing with situations like that.

Harry: I don't think you are supposed to like and relate to Harry, it may be how you read the story, but it isn't always the case. In this situation it seemed more like could you understand what Harry is going through and why he acts the way he does. It seemed okay given a 14 year old who has a lot of issues and is acting out with a not the greatest example of mentors.

"Harry totally lacks character development" I don't think this part is fair at all. Harry goes from feeling isolated and alone towards having something to live for. Your example about the Horcrux, that was Harry choosing to reject the path followed by Tom still and not wanting to kill someone to split his soul. Him choosing to switch and want to live rather than die occurs after feeling like he was walked all over and in a bout of emotional turmoil for him. I would say the character development is solid for fanfiction. You shouldn't be comparing him to his canon counterpart because there isn't a lot of similarities after summer before 4th year. His mindset of not dying for nothing is subtly pushed towards with Salazars mentoring, making himself a great wizard and remembered and all that jazz. This Harry is definitely more ruthless and is willing to do whatever he has to in order to survive being hunted down by what he percieves to be both sides. It doesn't come out of the blue.

For the other characters, I can understand the issues with them, and like you said you wrote more of the bad than the good for the stories. Just want to point out, you are comparing them to their canon counterpart and that isn't fair tot hem. The characters have developed in different ways and so will be different. I don't think they are wildly far off where they become Characters In Name either. Like with Neville, we know he gets compared to his parents a lot and sees them in the hospital. It isn't really fair for you to determine that he could not feel so strongly about their fate.

Romance: Again subjective, I thought it was okay when taken into the context that they are in a war where it is perceived both sides are against them, it's been a roughly 2 years total or so, and there isn't anything wrong with falling in love fast. It can happen even if it is rare. I thought it was better this way rather than make it about romance. The romance was more of a side thing, rather than the main thing and stories tend to have multiple facets with one main thing being worked on. When romance was in the story, it was meant to develop Harry and show different sides. There might be inconsistencies, but for teenagers main characters that isn't exactly so bad.

Plot: Harry was 4th champion and was explained why in Chapter 35 (explained by Bertha), resurrection was because Bertha and it does get explained why it turns out the way it did. i think this part was fine.

5th year, I'm not too sure why you would believe this would change. Harry is not liked by his peers, no one vouches for him really, it really should play out similarly to the book for the main points. I would love to hear why you thought 4th year and 5th year doesn't make sense to follow Stations of Canon. The main plot isn't what is meant to be changed. The story is more to show a different route Harry could take and where it leads to the similar finale even when worse off for all.

Bagman being around London most of the time - no clue, it could have been at the school to make sure everything is going well. Peter being around the school is meant to subtly hint that they are affecting things. Harry not talking about it with Dumbledore is because he doesn't trust Dumbledore at all anymore to do the right thing, and catching Peter is slowly lingering more and more before Harry really gets the chance to catch him.

World Building: Harry never does really equal Voldemort in pure power. In fact, the story showed that even after everything Harry did, he still lost outright. Voldemort only died afterwards because of (my theory) a Harry possession type thing that went poorly for Voldemort. Also the rituals aren't exactly common. Written work doesn't always get kept, and if it is written work for family, nothing too out of the left field to believe it stayed in the family.

Misc: "It certainly is not that if Harry had been more independent, cunning, ambitious, and proactive, everything would have turned out for the better, because it didn't!" It was not meant to turn out better. The title sort of gave it away that if anything, it would turn out so much worse. At no point was it the moral of the story to break into people's home to murder them. I would say the moral of the story is the opposite, being more open and trusting and you won't end up in a cadmean victory.

"I'm probably over thinking it, but it's like a message to the reader: if you think Harry is evil, you're influenced by Voldemort!" This is unfair too because the title of the story was to show Harry would end up with a victory in ruin, which is meant to show that all the path that he takes to isolate himself and not open up leads to personal ruin. This isn't a typical divergence type story.

Overall, solid story and people saying it is average would be rating it much more subjectively than objectively I think. Again I think there are definitely issues with the story and I have subjective issues with it as well, just focusing on the positives and different spins on things you brought up.
