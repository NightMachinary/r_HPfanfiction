  he was also a child with a violent mass murderer holding his family hostage... what would you do? Let your parents die?

Stop acting like it was all big bag Voldemort forcing him. Draco had no problems with the ideology or muggleborns being murdered as long as he wasn't doing the deed himself(and even that isn't sure, since he didn't care who got caught up in his schemes to kill Dumbledore and we don't know how he got the Mark). In second year, he wished for muggleborn genocide and delighted at the idea of someone going after them:

  Then someone shouted through the quiet.

  "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"

  It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.

And said

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I knew who it is," said Malfoy petulantly. "I could help them."
#+end_quote

While talking about someone that he thought was out to kill muggleborns.

In Year 4, he was relaxed when Death Eaters were going around torturing the muggles:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
#+end_quote

And thought that it would be amusing if they got Hermione as well:

#+begin_quote
  “Granger, they're after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around... they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.”
#+end_quote

Even implied that his dad was among them and he had no problems with it:

#+begin_quote
  “Where're your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out there wearing masks, are they?” Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling. “Well... if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?”
#+end_quote

He was crowing about how the Dark lord would kill all the mudbloods and blood-traitors:

#+begin_quote
  “You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. “Too late now Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first!
#+end_quote

"But he was being forced"

No, he wasn't. Stop with that bullshit. He would have had no problems becoming a Death Eater if Voldy hadn't given him a suicide mission to punish Lucius. After Snape-apologists, Draco-apologists are definitely the worst.
