So first off. From Pottermore: [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/chapter-that-made-us-fall-in-love-with-draco-malfoy]]

Secondly, again. Child. Its really easy to parrot things parents say back when you aren't seeing the outcome. It all changed when he was actually expected to be involved in it.

As far as the relaxed comment. We are seeing that from the trios point of view.

Look. Draco Malfoy is a shit. Undeniably. As a human being I can also accept that people are nuanced and noone is born evil. He was literally written to show that everyone had the capacity to change in the end. Not be good. Not be innocent. But to change. I get that his character hits hard for a lot of people. Its supposed to. Also I ask again what you would have done? ( I swear noone answers this question the first time.)

I'm not asking you to like him. I'm just saying he was a child for most of all this. There is a reason we don't try children as adults when they commit crimes.
