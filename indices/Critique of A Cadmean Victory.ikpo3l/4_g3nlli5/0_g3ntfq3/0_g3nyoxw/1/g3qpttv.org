The issue is that Draco is a child through (essentially) the whole series - and not just a child, but one that had been indoctrinated from birth. Like, all your examples are from when he's 14 and under - that's pretty clearly him emulating his parents, IMO.

That does not downplay what he did - but it does explain how he's heavily a factor of his environments, and the narrative in canon is set up in a way such that it's clearly meant for us to feel at least somewhat sympathetic at the end.

Obviously he'd have had no problems becoming a Death Eater if there wasn't something to shock him out of it - he'd been raised from birth to be that. That sort of indoctrination is a tragedy, and I don't understand why it seems like people /want/ to have characters like that be irredeemably evil, or dismiss out of hand any possibility of a more complete redeeming than in canon.
