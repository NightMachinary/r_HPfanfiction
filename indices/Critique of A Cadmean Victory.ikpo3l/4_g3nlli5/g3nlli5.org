Mostly agree with that review but...

Draco dies and loses his chance to get redeemed

????

He didn't deserve redemption in the fic nor did he get it in canon.

Dude let a bunch of DE's in a school full of children, including Fenrir Greyback, who is known for having /dubious preferences/ when it comes to his victims. He didn't identify Harry in Malfoy Manor, but he DID identify Ron and Hermione. Draco not being killed / thrown into Azkaban for life in canon is complete bullshit. Ron was right when he complained about saving him, Harry should have left him behind in the Room of Requirements.
