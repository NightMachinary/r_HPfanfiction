That was a good review.

I've read lots of different fics. Whether I loved or hated them for any reason, these reasons are usually memorable.

Usually I read fics from my phone. I know I read this fic from start to finish, since my reader app throws me to the end of the story when I try to open it.

Yet somehow the only thing I remember of this fic was the WTF feeling.

I had to reread the final chapters to recollect whatever the hell happened. Then I saw that batshit insane ending, and the rest came back.

Now I remember I really struggled through the second half. I like longreads, but this one was WAY too long even for my tastes. Some characters acted in a really weird way across the entire story, and it only snowballed as the story progressed. Wanton murders are just icing for this bizarre cake.

I'll probably reread it at a later date, but only if I happen to hit a severe fic drought.

In binary terms of "recommend/not recommend" I'd choose the latter.
