For me, the Graveyard events being shoehorned in despite all the AU changes was the moment I closed the fic, never to return. Up to that point I had many gripes but the fic had enough points to keep me entertained. Some elements I really liked, such as the signature butterfly spell. But staying on canon rails in the face of massive changes is a deal-breaker.
