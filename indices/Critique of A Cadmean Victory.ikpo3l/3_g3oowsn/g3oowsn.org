  He murders Rita Skeeter just because she was being annoying

You've repeated this point multiple times and I'm pretty sure it's wrong.

My understanding was that he went there with the intention of blackmailing her into doing something he wanted. While he was there he realized that his blackmail was not going to be sufficient. He decided that killing her and trying to frame death eaters for it was going to serve his goals.

I'm not trying to argue the ethics of that, but that is not at all the same as murdering her because she's annoying.
