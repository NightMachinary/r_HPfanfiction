I feel like most characters could have ended up in multiple of the houses since no one is actually so 1 dimensional that they only have the trait that correlates with their house. I think the key is the values that they hold important compared to the ones they display the most themselves; which is why we have Hermione or Neville, for instance, end up where they do.
