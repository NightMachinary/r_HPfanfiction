My guess is that it's because the house traits are allegedly based on the views of the founders.

Three founders took students they thought fitted their house/could be developed to do so. One of them, Helga, says looks at the children and says all children ought to have the opportunity to learn, that hard work and loyalty means more than standing around picking only the children who you think are worth your while.

It makes sense to me as a sentiment. As though four founders are picking children off for a sports team - but one of them doesn't want some of the children to be last picked so she makes sure they feel valued too.
