A great strategic mind for sure, though I wouldn't say he defines the Ravenclaw traits very well otherwise. I mean, being smart isn't a Ravenclaw trait. A hunger for knowledge and a love of learning is, but not just being smart. I always liked something I heard about the traits not being what you are but how you act. As in if you're very smart but don't put any effort into learning new things then you're not a Ravenclaw.

If you're inherently brave but never act upon it then you're not a Gryffindor.

Incase you have high ambitions but no intention of trying to achieve them then you have no place in Slytherin.

Everyone has potential to define the traits of all the houses, but the differences lies in how you choose to act.
