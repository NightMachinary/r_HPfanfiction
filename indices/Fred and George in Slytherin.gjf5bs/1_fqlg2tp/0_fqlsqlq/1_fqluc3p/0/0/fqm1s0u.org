I always thought that the Hat sorted based on values and potential, as after all, no 11 year old really acts the way they will as they continue to mature. So Ron got Gryffindor because that house has traits that he both embodies and finds important. Same reason that Hermione was sorted Gryffindor, because while she is smart, hardworking, and ambitious, she values bravery over all of those things. Even Malfoy got sorted based mainly on values. While clever, he wasn't particularly cunning or sly, was happy to coast by on his father's name in terms of reputation, and in the end was driven mostly by loyalty towards his family. Slytherin's a decent place for him to be based on what he wants out of life, but Hufflepuff would have also worked.

However, if the Hat sorted without taking values into the equation, basing it on "true character" alone, then I maintain that Ravenclaw wouldn't be a bad fit for Ron. (Actually, neither would Slytherin; think of what Ron sees in the Mirror of Erised! That boy had ambition dripping out of him, he was just continually overshadowed by the people he surrounded himself with, both textually and in fan interpretation.)
