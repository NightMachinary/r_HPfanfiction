There's a great idea. I'm now interested in fics where sorting is based on true character rather than what the Hat thinks is best for them, or what they want:

Harry: Gryffindor if there ever was one. I never understood why he would be put in slytherin. He's not ambitious. Sure, he's cunning, but that's not what would first come to mind about him. " daring, nerve, and chivalry " indeed!

Neville is a Gryffindor by the end, but may be more suitable as Hufflepuff in the begenning?

Hermione-Ravenclaw

Ron-Hufflepuff

Draco- No redeeming qualities as per canon, but he's ambitious at least, so I guess Slytherin would be better than anything else.

Twins: Slytherin, as suggested.

Percy: Slytherin/Ravenclaw, based on ambition as well as book-smarts. Either one would be okay.

Crabbe and Goyle: Hufflepuff, only because Helga promised to take /all the rest/ and they're loyal to Draco.

Am I missing other changes?
