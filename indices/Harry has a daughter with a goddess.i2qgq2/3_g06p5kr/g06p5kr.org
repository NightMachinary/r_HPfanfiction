Maybe ron leaves during the hunt.

Hermione did stay but went home for christmas and didnt come back as she went to aus with her parents.

Harry goes to visit his parents graves and gets hurt maybe or get mortally injured killing nagini or he fights nagini but talks with her and they team up.

I could see the goddess seeking him out once hes abondoned by all. Either at the hollow or maybe he goes back to the forest of dean amd camps with the vow of hating the magic world or just giving up. The goddess appears to him and coaxes him back to life, he falls in love and has something to fight for when she gets preg and has a daughter.
