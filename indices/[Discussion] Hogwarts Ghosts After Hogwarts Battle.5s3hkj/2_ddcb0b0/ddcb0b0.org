I haven't thought too much about who, exactly, would stick around, I just sort of figured it was a given a few would stick around. Not all students either. A Death Eater ghost would certainly be a problem down the road. I imagine there's magic to force a ghost out of somewhere (how many real-world rituals are there that supposedly do the same thing), so it probably wouldn't be a real problem in the long run, but it could still happen.

Personally, if I were to make a known character a ghost, it'd probably just be in a passing mention, like including a ghost with a camera as part of a description of a crowd. Say more with less and all that. If you really want to establish a new ghost, it might as well be a new character. Like you said, Fred probably wouldn't become a ghost (though he could), nor would any of the other named characters. Not saying you couldn't, but I think they'd have to be the focus of the fic if you don't want your readers to start getting distracted. Obviously that'd run counter to any other fic.

Of course, you've got plenty of unnamed deaths on both sides, so you've got free rein to do basically whatever you want.

Also, I want to point out that while Voldemort probably couldn't become a /ghost/, he was killed at Hogwarts, and he didn't move on.
