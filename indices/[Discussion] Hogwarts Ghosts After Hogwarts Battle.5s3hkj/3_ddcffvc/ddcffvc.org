I think the most likely to be new ghosts would be the Death Eaters - some of which were probably drawn to Voldemort by his quest for immortal life. It makes sense those would be some of them to linger.

Hmm nasty Death Eater ghosties pouring poison into the ear of "ickle firsties" and continuing the spread of blood purist ideals as countered by others like the portraits of Dumbledore etc might be interesting.
