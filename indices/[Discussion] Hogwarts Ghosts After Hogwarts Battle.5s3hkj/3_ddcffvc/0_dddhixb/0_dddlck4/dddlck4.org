Well, you have the children you can use as the focus - the story could be about how the children learn to make better choices /because/ of their interactions with the ghosts of the Death Eaters, thus they linger as a cautionary tale. Or you could use it as the hitching pin of a quest story where the students undertake to learn more about the magic that creates a ghost, what binds them here, if whatever unfinished business that held them here is completed can they choose to "go on" - can they be forced to?

I think there is ample room to make create something workable.
