Considering many of the students died violently in a time where they could not be emotionally stable - before they had time to develop as a person or, you know, live - it's pretty easy to see there being at least one new ghost at Hogwarts. I don't think that any of the main cast would have stayed because they had each other. But everyone else? The people we don't know? The odd Slytherin that didn't really have a choice regarding where they where sorted? Or the Gryffindor that went down protecting those younger than them?
