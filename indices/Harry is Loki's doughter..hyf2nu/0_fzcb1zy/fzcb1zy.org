I don't have any with fem!Harry, but I have one called The Confectionary Chronicles where Hermione ends up a semi-daughter-like worshipper of Loki and it's a very Parental/Older Brother relationship. He's the Supernatural Loki, but you don't need to know anything about the show - I don't and I've followed and loved it all. Warning for rather vivid suicide talk in the beginning and throughout - which was actually why I thought this might be appropriate despite not being fem!Harry, this Hermione has similarly mouthy, stand-up-to-everything, family-desperate vibes to typical Fem!Harrys.
