Yes, I think he did.

But I don't think he did it happily. I think he did it because he saw Harry as the last hope for the Wizarding World (and all the world, really, because Voldemort would eventually attack and kill muggle), and did what he thought has to be done.

I don't think he slept well at night doing it. To me, deep down, Dumbledore is a good guy, who had to do some horrible things to stop a monster.

He sacrificied Harry, for the good of everyone else. The way it is written, and with the prophecy, I don't think there were other choices. Or at least, that he found other solutions.

However, I think he did tried to avoid it, at some point. The horcruxes, it seems that he tried to do it on his own, until the cursed one happened, and he'd know he would die within a year.
