I do not think Dumbledore either tried to mould Harry into a soldier. I will not say that he never manipulated him (hard to say so when the whole plot of DH is Dumbledore's pulling the strings from the afterlife), but I believe that his main objective was always to protect Harry.

Dumbledore never forced Harry to join the war, but he did his best to give him the means to survive it.
