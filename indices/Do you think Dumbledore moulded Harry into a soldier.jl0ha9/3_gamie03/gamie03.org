I think it's debatable honestly. On one hand the stuff that Harry goes through definitely feels like it but, on the other hand how much was dumbledore doing it intentionally. There are a lot of events that we just don't know enough about to really know for instance what would have happened if Harry wasn't placed at the Dursley's it's possible that the government would get involved and since they're portrayed at corrupt and incompetent rather often I doubt it would have gone well. That's just one possibility for you me event in the story and there are a lot of them. Personally I like to think of him as an old man trying his best in a lot of situations with no real right answers but we just don't know enough.

Note that if you say all the events in the story were planed by him I would say he did mold him that way. I just think that we cannot really tell if it was intentional or not.
