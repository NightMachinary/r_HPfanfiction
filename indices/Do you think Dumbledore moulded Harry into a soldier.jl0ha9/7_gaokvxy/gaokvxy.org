Dumbledore maliciously moulded Harry into a /sacrifice/ in the hopes that if he willingly martyred himself without knowing that he there's a chance he /might/ survive or if there's another way, everyone else might be protected. His asinine "plan" depended upon Harry being broken enough that he'd simply believe Dumbledore's word, through Snape of all people, but not broken enough that he'd simply give up.

After all that, the morons still say that he felt sorry about it and he doesn't believe in the "greater good". As if his feelings matter a whit. As if his actions can be /reasonably/ looked at in any other way.
