The thing with Sirius is pretty terrible. Supposedly, they arrested a Death Eater spy in the Order and Dumbledore never tried to find what he could have told Voldemort and co.? (I don't remember if is canon or fanon that Sirius didn't get a trial, but interrogations are still a thing hopefully, right?)

Especially after what happened to the Longbottoms.

I don't even know if this is incompetence or negligence.
