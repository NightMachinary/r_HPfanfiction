Dumbledore groomed child soldiers for decades. Harry is on another level, but he recruited many, many people right after they leave school. Is it a conflict of interest for someone to recruit soldiers from their own students? (Yes)

Harry in particular appears to be raised by some child soldier handbook. Harry was "raised" in a loveless, abusive environment, then immediately rescued by Albus Dumbledore (and co.). Dumbledore spends the first year dropping hints for Harry to follow (the challenges and all the school-year incidents were designed for Harry to follow the trail), culminating in Harry killing a man at age eleven. Have a candy, Harry. No need for therapy. His entire rest of schooling reinforced the "I must fight because the adults won't" mentality (third year wins an award for sending children into an extremely dangerous situation to prevent an unlawful execution WHILE HE'S THE HEAD OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM). Children don't normally instantly and without any second thoughts commit suicide on command. Something is very, very wrong with Harry, and the blame comes down to the person in charge of raising him to obey any order without question.

Furthermore, Dumbledore is responsible for Harry being placed at the Dursleys to begin with. (Beyond the literal LEFT HIM ON THE DOORSTEP WITH A LETTER TELLING SOMEONE HER SISTER DIED. IS THERE NO DECENCY?) Sirius Black handed Harry to Hagrid and loaned him his motorcycle. Not exactly something someone does when they're trying to kill said baby. Dumbledore left Harry on a doorstep in November two days before Sirius was arrested. You don't arrange long-term care for a child when there are already arrangements in place unless you want to bypass them. Beyond that, Dumbledore kept Snape, a man with evidence he was in a terrorist group, out of prison well enough that nobody had a problem with him teaching in a school containing his targeted minorities. Yet he did nothing to get Sirius a trial, or even an interrogation. The Statute of Secrecy was implemented centuries after the Magna Carta, habeas corpus likely (can't say for sure in canon, but I'd give fairly good odds on it) was part of their judicial system. Furthermore, Dumbledore provided evidence as to Sirius' obvious guilt. After learning about his innocence, Dumbledore took no action to get Sirius a trial (even going so far as to allow his pet Death Eater/spy Snape to make the situation worse for a person he claims is an ally).

There's quite a bit more, but those are a decent selection. Dumbledore is only shown as a good guy because Rowling doesn't think trauma is real. Otherwise, the books are about the grooming of a child soldier, and it is way too easy to read between the lines to get this story.
