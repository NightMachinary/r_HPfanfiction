As a soldier, no. Does Harry have to deal with dangerous situations yearly? Yes. Does he have to fight to defend himself and those he cares for? Yes he does. But that's not the same thing as being or becoming a soldier. Becoming a Soldier involves a sense of discipline and drill that Harry distinctly does not learn, as well as a capability of doing your job as a cog in a larger machine. We also learn how to kill. By that I mean we practice killing as that is our job. I fired hundreds of rounds at silhouettes down range when I went to training, and while you could say the death eater targets in the Room of Requirement were similar, never did the DA learn and practice killing, or how to operate as a unit. They learned how to survive and escape.

Harry learns how to think on his feet and how to survive which is important and likely has it's own mental health impacts. But it's a different beast from soldiering.
