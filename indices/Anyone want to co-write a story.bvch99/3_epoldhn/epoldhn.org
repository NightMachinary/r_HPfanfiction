Once I got bored and tried to come-up with some story outline I haven't seen before in ff. I came up with a story about a Harry who cannot die but can't use magic directly due to it being automatically used by DH to keep him alive. The workaround is to engrave runes onto a body with some fun twists like him keeping replacement hands with different runes in stasis for quick replacement. Oh, and story takes place about 200-300 years into the future, there is no SS, magic is scientifically researched and government prepares the first interstellar expedition.

Sadly, I can't write if my life depended on it, always hated those writing assignments in school. Anyway, hope you don't end up writing another ff with minor alteration to the canon, I'm quite sick of them, honestly. Gl.
