[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is the best one I've read. It seems to be abandoned though.

Your first point doesn't really apply here, as he is in another universe. Hopping between the universes might sound cliche and pointless, but it was further explained later in the story, which made my only real criticism go away.
