We all wrote the cringiest stories possible at 13. No shame! Enjoy the ridiculousness. My first fic was Star Wars, called "Padme's Diary" and it was beyond terrible. Even the next few after that were really bad, wanting to be deep but failing in that faux-deep young teen way. We all learn and grow as we keep going.
