My very first was only ever written on an old mechanical typewriter. It was a Star Wars/Annimorphs crossover, about a creature called an Astral. The Astral looked exactly like an andalite, appart from it had wings and a tailblade that could block a lightsaber.

My second was an HP fic, centering on Corra Black. She was stolen by Voldemort, raised as his adopted daughter. I still remember her entry into my head, being led out from her cell in Azkaban, to stand on the cliff at the the edge of the island, in the middle of a storm. Then of course she went back to her cell. Was released because she'd been sentenced for Unforgivable use, which was about the only thing she never did.

She was also a magical species called a halfblood, which could turn into any form of one specific animal at will. In Corra's case, she was a wolf halfblood. Gave Snape nightmares, on taking up the DADA post, because she used to terrorize him when younger.

Somehow, she was also Harry's ... err... Cousin I think. Second cousin, perhaps. Made Harry and Voldemort meet on neutral grounds, to get to know one another.
