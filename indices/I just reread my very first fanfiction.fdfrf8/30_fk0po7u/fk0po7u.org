When I was starting college, and transferring my files from my old computer (which I had used for half a decade) to my new laptop, I found two single-page documents of a... fanfic I had started.

It was so awful I deleted it, which I now kind of regret, as it was the first non-school-assigned work of writing I ever attempted.
