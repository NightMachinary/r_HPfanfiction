I reread my first about a year ago. It combined Percy Jackson, The 39 clues, and Harry Potter. I cringed so hard I still go back to delete it even though I deleted it that day. (I deleted it because at 13 I put personal info in it that could identify me so I just deleted the whole thing).

We grow. Personally, I think it's a good thing that we cringe, because it shows how much we've grown.
