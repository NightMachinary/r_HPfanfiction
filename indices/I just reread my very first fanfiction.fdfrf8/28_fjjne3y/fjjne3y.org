I was curious about what my first fic was. Ffnet tells me the first thing I published was a 700 word Buffy fic that I have no recollection of writing. I was 16. I just re-read it. It's a bit pedestrian and kind of boring but not terrible. I like to think my ideas and plots and character development skills have come along since then, but I'm not sure how to feel about the fact my writing style doesn't seem to have changed much in almost 20 years....

Back when I used to write single scenes and call that a story. Now I'm all about 100k word epics. No middle ground, apparently!
