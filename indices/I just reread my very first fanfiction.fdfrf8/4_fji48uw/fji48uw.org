Loool!

I was same age 13, but mine was that Sirius Black had a son Chad, who was a drug dealer...

Who went out with Daphne Greengrass, dimension travelled and smashed Hermione only to travel back to his original dimension and became a vigilante.

From here he killed Snape because of reasons, and Daphne cheated on him with Harry.

(Chad was also mixed race becuase my cousin who co-wrote it is mixed race also!)

Draco was a racist so Chad sold him drugs that paralyzed him. He got put on trial only to go free by giving everyone cocaine.

He was an assassin at age 10, and his best friend Jack died. Jack survived because Voldemort found him and resurrected him bc Jack is his son.

Jack becomes a Winter soldier character and kills Daphne.

And then our laptop broke and we deleted the story...

At least yours was better than mine.

(I think my cousins account Tydbox still has the 16 chapters we wrote)
