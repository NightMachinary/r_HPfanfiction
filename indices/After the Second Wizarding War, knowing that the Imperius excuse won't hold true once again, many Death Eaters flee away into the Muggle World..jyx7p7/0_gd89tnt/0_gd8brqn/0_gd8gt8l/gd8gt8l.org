If putting a taboo on a spell was feasible, it wouldn't make sense that they don't put one at least on the Unforgivables.

We're getting deep into the area of headcanons now, so feel free to disagree with me here, but I think there was something specific about Voldemort's name that allowed the creation of a taboo on it. Perhaps he was able to do so because it was a name he created for himself or something.
