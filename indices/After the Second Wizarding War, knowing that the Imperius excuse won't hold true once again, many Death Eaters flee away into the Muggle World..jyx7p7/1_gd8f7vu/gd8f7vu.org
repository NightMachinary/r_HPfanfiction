That would actually be quite interesting. I can see it happening, too. All the remaining Death Eaters meeting up and admitting that the 'Muggle lovers' have won this round, but they'll go into hiding and plot and prepare and come back when they least expect it - "If our Lord could wait ten years for his return, so will we." and all that.

Plenty of interesting ways to take it, too. I can half imagine a half PurebloodWank, half MuggleWank fic where the Death Eater Sleeper Cells use the MuggleWank style Muggle Governments as a front to hide behind and teach them some of the PurebloodWank 'Family Grimoire' type secret magic knowledge to help them fight the Wizarding World magicals - really put the 'Muggle Innovation' trope shoe on the other foot. That could be real fun to write. Definitely adding that to the ideas list. Good prompt. :)
