Thank you so much. DxD I haven't worked on in a while. I'm actually not very happy with it. I feel like I've changed a lot as a writer since I started it and there were a lot of things I'd change if I could. I sort of wanted to scrap it and rewrite it but shadowz101 has convinced me that it's fine. I am happy with our Percy Jackson fic though, just need to continue it. I haven't worked on the Harry/Luvia in a while, but I finished 2 chapters of it, just never posted them. The new RWBY idea I had has chapter 1 done, and half of chapter 2 done but I haven't had time to work on it in over a week.
