Yeah, that is one of the things I definitely don't like. Honestly, I don't even know why I decided to do that. I had the idea earlier but the way I wrote it, the closer I got I realized it didn't fit but stubbornly refused to change my originally idea. I'm not going to rewrite it, but I may try a new DxD story one day.
