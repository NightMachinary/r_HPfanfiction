" This was totally the best day of Harry's life. Might be the /last/, too, considering how bullshit the Holy Grail War was, but that did not even make it wobble in its position.

There was /no/ other day he'd see people trying to murder each other over who got to murder him while in the ruins of the place he'd lived for the worst days (and majority) of his life.

If nothing else, Number 4 Privet Drive couldn't be burned down /again/. A building by that name could, but it wouldn't be the one he had hated so much.

He could even enjoy the sight of Privet Drive burning to the bedrock - oh how sweet this was, if only he had a camera on hand like the Creeveys - without a single twinge of his conscience, because one or the other of the people who'd come after him had been nice enough to evacuate anyone that might get hurt first.

There was a bit of bad news - one of the Masters looked to be associated with Voldemort, going by the half-dozen Death Eaters that had promptly looked at each other and apparated far, far away the moment Harry and Berserker had stepped out of the cordon without either of the Servants keeping them tied up - but Harry had a lot of giddiness to offset it.

Really, if Voldemort burned down Privet Drive without injuring innocent bystanders while trying to murder Harry, Harry could get behind that. "

Yeah, it was the shit.
