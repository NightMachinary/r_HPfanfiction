[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNotFatalAtAllCulturalExchangeProgram][Harry Potter and the Not-Fatal-At-All Cultural Exchange Program]] crossover with fate Stay night, Harry on a battle Royal with his characterization fun and on point.

A Holy Grail War is brewing... but this is not your usual Holy Grail War. In this universe, the Masters and their Servants are converging on England to do battle. Nobody is quite sure where such a potent artefact came from - not the Church, not the Iranians, not the Japanese, not the mercenary, not the thrall of Voldemort, not the werewolves - but everyone has something they want out of it, and one Harry James Potter gets involved when he accepts the invitation in order to save Sirius Black during the events at the end of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix][/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/]]. Now part of this fracas, it's up to him and his Servant to step up to the bat and win... or die trying.
