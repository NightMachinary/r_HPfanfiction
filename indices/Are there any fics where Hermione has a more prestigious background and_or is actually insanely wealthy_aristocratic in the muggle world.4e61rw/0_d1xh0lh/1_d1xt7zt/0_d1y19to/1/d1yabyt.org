If it were a few years ago I would have agreed with you but it has grown into a bit of a too repetitive, self- congratulatory hivemind. Outside a core cadre of old- timers those 15k members don't post much. And what is posted falls roughly in five categories, five updates by the old- timers, which are generally quite good but sometimes a bit samey; fics by newcomers, which usually are forgettably generic rehashes with a generous amount of bashing of the usual unliked characters there; praise for posted fics with sometimes a bit of spelling correction for variety; repeats of old arguments regarding some facet of canon reaching foregone conclusion in accordance with the well-known position of all involved; and off-topic tangents, which can go anywhere and turn quite interesting.
