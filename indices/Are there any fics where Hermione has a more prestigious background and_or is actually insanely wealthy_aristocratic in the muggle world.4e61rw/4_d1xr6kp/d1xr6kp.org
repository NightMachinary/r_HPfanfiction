Care of Magical Creatures! It's revealed in the first couple of chapters that Hermione's father is a Baron. I will note this is a Marriage Law fic with a union between Snape and Hermione. I will note this is one of the best Snape/Hermione stories out there, and has been recommended several times on this sub.

"Voted Best New Author (Lumos), Best SS/HG Romance (Amortentia) and Best SS/HG Angst (Diffindo) in The New Library Awards. Seventh-year student Hermione Granger decides to marry the one eligible wizard who did not ask for her--the horrid but powerful Severus Snape. All is not sweetness and light. Be careful what you ask for. Or, as has been said by many a wise witch, "Marry in haste; repent in leisure." MLC"
