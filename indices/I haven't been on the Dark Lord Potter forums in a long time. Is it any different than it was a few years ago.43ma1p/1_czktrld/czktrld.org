I've been on DLP for 8 or so years now and I'd like to tell you a little story of my experience of the place.

When I arrived I was 17 or so. I hadn't been allowed to post on Portkey and probably sought a place to post and to get feedback. And goodness did I get feedback. My fem!Harry fic got torn to shreds.

I did what I see a lot of here. I complained, threw blame where it should not have gone and acted much like a 17-year-old who had always gotten good grades in English despite never really bothering studying might.

I huddled comfortably in denial for quite some time, dismissing the criticism as cruelty. Maybe it was, on some level, but when I checked the thread some time later, I came to realize that my story had indeed been shit. It wasn't that my grasp of English was bad, it was that I didn't know how to tell a story properly.

I have since improved but I'd like to think I've also kept that lesson with me. DLP isn't about coddling people. Those who post here choose to do so knowing full well that if their work has flaws, they'll get pointed out mercilessly.

This is how things work here. You might get pushed down once or twice in the process, but you'll hopefully learn. If you act like a moron - like 17-year-old me did - you will probably have a bad time.

This should be read with the giant glowing disclaimer that this was nearly a frickin' decade ago. The community has since gotten far more patient, as people tend to get with age.

So if you want to improve the quality of your HP fanfic, or of your writing in general, I can think of no better place than DLP. But if what you want is confirmation that you're special and brilliant, I suggest you talk to your mother.
