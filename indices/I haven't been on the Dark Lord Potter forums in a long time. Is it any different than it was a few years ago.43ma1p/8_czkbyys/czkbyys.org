OP, if you're actually serious (and I can't think why you wouldn't just ... open the site and have a look), the answer is, and always has been, "it depends on you".

In your case, I'm inclined to say you wouldn't like it -- not then, not today, and not in ten years, because the core values aren't changing (for which I'm glad).

And yes, do have a look a this thread. It's probably a decent enough mirror; if this is off-putting for you, you know where you stand.
