Very early on DLP we established a societal rule that gender shouldn't be brought up - you're either an interesting/likable person or you're not.

If your profile was made to show off the fact that you were a woman and you ever referenced it, you were obviously trying to get kid gloves/favor and those people got shit on/banned because that kind of thing is cancer (see: GamersGate, Kaceytron).

If you were lowkey about it and everyone decided they liked you as a person then being female was an incidental detail and you were as welcome as anyone.

It's not misogyny so much as it's understanding the mentality of someone that goes "Hey boys, I'm new here, I'm a girl" and shutting it the fuck down early.
