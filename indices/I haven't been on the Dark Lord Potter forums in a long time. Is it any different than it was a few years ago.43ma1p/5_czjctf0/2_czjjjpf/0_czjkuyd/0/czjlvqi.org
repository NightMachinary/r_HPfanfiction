"The misogyny has been tamped down. There are women mods now."

When a sentence follows another in a paragraph, usually they're linked. It's not a very hard stretch to see that it could imply "Look at DLP, they're not women haters, they even promoted some women to staff!"

When even the women being discussed feel insulted...

At this point I think you're just attacking me for the sole purpose of being contrary.
