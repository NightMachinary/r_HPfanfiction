  The discussions have become more political and the misogyny has been tamped down. There are a few women mods now.

...yeesh.

How exactly do you respond to your presence on staff being whittled down to "women mod"? No, the reason why Ched and I are staff is not down to what genitalia we have, thanks.

I must admit I'm a little pissed off that you've apparently decided that the forums are misogynous, seemingly out of your arse. I've personally never found my gender to matter one way or another - apparently until /now/. Tell me, wordhammer, why should my gender have *anything* to do with being on staff?
