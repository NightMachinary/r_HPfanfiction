Ah, that's not quite my main issue with what you've said.

The first is that you call DLP misogynistic, even if you call it 'tampered down' now. I've never found that to be the case at all in all the time I've been on the forums. I don't understand where you're getting this impression about a women-hating attitude: this isn't something I've encountered myself. Like I said: you seem to be pulling that one out of your arse.

If you're talking about the proportion of women to men on DLP, on the other hand, then yes it's definitely still a sausage-fest. :P According to the last survey we took, 90% of the active membership are male. That's pretty staggering! I don't believe this proportion has changed much over the years, either. But, so what? The proportion of men being high does not in any way mean a hatred of women.

I take some issue with your notion that there's any particular value in women being 'represented' on staff. Firstly, there have been female moderators for a very long time - in 2008 [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=10426][Tinn and Kate]] were chosen on the moderation team. Secondly, why should it matter what genders the staff are? There is no misogynistic attitude /to/ 'improve' as far as I am aware; no one has ever been in a worse position due to their gender - there is no glass ceiling. This is why I ask "why should my gender have anything to do with being staff?"

So... I hope that adequately explains why this topic frustrates me.
