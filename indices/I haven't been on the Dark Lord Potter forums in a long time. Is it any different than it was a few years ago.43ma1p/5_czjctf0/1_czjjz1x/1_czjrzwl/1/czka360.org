And yet again, you're dead wrong. DLP started out with female staff members, and constantly has had female staff members since inception. In 2008 itself, right around the time the thread everyone referencing was made, we promoted Tinn and Kate to moderator.

So your base assumption was wrong, your base point is wrong, and your implication is therefore wrong. If the way to show DLP is somehow not misogynistic is to appoint female staff members, then that milestone was passed in 2005 and 2008 and 2015.
