What.... just happened?

Never suggested that you were a mod because you were female. I was answering the OP about the nature of DLP compared to eight years ago when (by evidence presented) the tone of the place was very frat-house-like.

I would compare this to 'Has race relations in America actually improved in the last fifty years' being answered by 'Well, we've elected and re-elected a black President, so I'd say representation in government has improved.' That doesn't mean the problems aren't there, nor that I may even be a contributing factor for them, but I'm proud that the country has improved.

Obama wasn't elected purely because he was black or because he would champion black issues. You have been a very involved and responsive mod and that speaks well to you as a 'citizen' of DLP.
