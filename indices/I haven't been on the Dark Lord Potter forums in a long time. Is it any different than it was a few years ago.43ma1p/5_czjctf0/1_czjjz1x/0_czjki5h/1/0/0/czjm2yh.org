DLP isn't for everyone, but those who like it's atmosphere stick around because of a variety of reasons; they like the members, the conversation or simply the fact that they can 'be themselves' and as long as they don't break the few rules that we have (or be insufferable)

I find DLP's culture to be very liberating, honestly. Everyone is allowed their own opinion as long as they can defend it. Personal attacks are frowned upon, but you aren't required to sugarcoat your words so you aren't hurting someone's feelings.

Like I said, it isn't for everyone, but those who are comfortable in a sort of... 'adult' atmosphere where you're responsible for yourself.

Probably didn't explain that very well, but that should give you a general idea of why people 'willingly join'.
