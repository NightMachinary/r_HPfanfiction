It really depends on you and your personal preferences in discussing things. I mean, everyone who's there joined at one point, obviously. Jon had the right of it when he said it's not for everyone.

Take just the most obvious example: There are a lot of boards with an in-built profanity filter and corresponding rules. We don't have that. It's free speech, pushed as far as possible -- and that's exactly why I like it. Feel free to "personally attack" me -- either you have a point or you don't, if you do, I'll consider it, if you don't, I'll roll my eyes and move on.

That kind of atmosphere is very liberating, because it allows for open discussions of nearly every issue. But I get that others prefer different kinds of environments, and it maybe it does take a specific kind of person not to drown in that kind of situations.

I wouldn't know. The funny thing is that although I wouldn't care either way, I don't have any negative memories. So perhaps the bottom line is that those who would be able to deal don't have to in the first place. Which explains why I can claim we /don't/ usually debate issues with personal attacks -- it's only people who don't fit in to begin with who have that problem.
