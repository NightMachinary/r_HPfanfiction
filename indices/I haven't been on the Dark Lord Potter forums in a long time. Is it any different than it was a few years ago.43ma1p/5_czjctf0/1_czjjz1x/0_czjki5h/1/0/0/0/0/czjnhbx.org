  It's the "Personal attacks are frowned upon" which I am generally unsure about. From what I've heard (and of course, no one on the internet lies) personal attacks may be frowned upon, but attacks aren't.
#+end_quote

I suppose it comes down to what you define as an attack. A recent member who.. was banned. Considered that she was 'being attacked' because she was asked to clarify or elaborate on her statements/opinions, and then got angry that she was being asked to and claimed that we were trying to 'make her cynical' and 'try to 'convert her'. Weird situation all together.

Unless people have personal issues with each other there aren't really any 'attacks' that happen. If a new member joins and acts like they have the run of the place, and that everyone should do things their way... that's when things can get messy. An apt comparison would be if you walked into someones house with muddy shoes and when you asked them to clean up they started jumping on your sofa.

  That DLP posts are mean simply to be mean.
#+end_quote

DLP isn't a nest of vipers hissing at each other and sinking their fangs into vulnerable flesh, no matter how much people try and force that image. I'm not gonna pretend that people can't become acerbic toward one another, but it's never a simple case of 'I feel like being mean today'. Most instances of 'DLP is mean!' that's been brought up that I've seen has been a case of the person having done/said something that was either downright offensive or ignorant, and then when they were called out on it they acted like the victims and exacerbated the situation.

Obviously there are exceptions, but for the majority of cases (as staff) that's what I've witnessed.

  It doesn't help that the perception of the community is somewhat insular
#+end_quote

Could you clarify?

  it has a history of basically the common worst issues of any internet board/forum, and even if it has changed (which is what this thread asked originally), the people who made it that place in the beginning are still around.
#+end_quote

I'd be lying right through my teeth if I said that DLP had a perfect and spotless past, since it's far from it. But with that said, a lot of the members who contributed to that... colourful past have pretty much moved on. Some of the 'old guard' is still around certainly, but with the time that has passed has come a tiny bit of maturity. Most if not all of those 'incidents' sit in the Hall of Shame, which is a subforum that basically showcases stuff that isn't tolerated on DLP, or is, as the name implies, considered 'shameful'.

  So in other words, would NarfSree post be acceptable on DLP? Because if that is the kind of comments and post DLP has it really hasn't changed enough to be worth it for anyone not already invested in the community.
#+end_quote

To be fair to Sree, he was heavily downvoted whenever he posted, even if the posts now show a surplus of upvotes. He genuinely wanted to put his best foot forward in regards to this subreddit but, there ah.. have been some users who have soured him significantly.

With that said, he would have been allowed to post that on DLP and if users took offence to it they have the option to report him and specify what was unacceptable about the post, at which point the report is sent to every staff member. I personally think he was a bit blunt, but I also understand his perspective on the situation having been around as past threads have unfolded.

I would say that he wasn't entirely justified in everything he said, but that I understand why he said it and felt that way.
