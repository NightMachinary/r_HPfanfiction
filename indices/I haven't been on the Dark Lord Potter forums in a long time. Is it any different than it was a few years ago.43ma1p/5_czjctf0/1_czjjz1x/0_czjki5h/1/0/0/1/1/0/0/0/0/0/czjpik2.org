What I am arguing for is that personal attacks are a sign of immaturity, and the claim that the DLP forum has evolved past the quoted thread in the OP would look more convincing if that kind of behaviour wouldn't appear in this very thread, with nary a soul from DLP arguing that the "DLP defenders" should stop that. I also disagree with the idea that personal attacks result of a break-down in dialogue and understanding. In my opinion they are the results of immature attitudes.
