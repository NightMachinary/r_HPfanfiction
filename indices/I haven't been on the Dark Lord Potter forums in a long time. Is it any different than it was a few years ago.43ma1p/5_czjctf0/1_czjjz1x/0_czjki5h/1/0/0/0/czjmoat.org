It's the "Personal attacks are frowned upon" which I am generally unsure about. From what I've heard (and of course, no one on the internet lies) /personal/ attacks may be frowned upon, but attacks aren't. That DLP posts are mean simply to be mean. It doesn't help that the perception of the community is somewhat insular, and it has a history of basically the common worst issues of any internet board/forum, and even if it has changed (which is what this thread asked originally), the people who made it that place in the beginning are still around.

So in other words, would NarfSree post be acceptable on DLP? Because if that is the kind of comments and post DLP has it really hasn't changed enough to be worth it for anyone not already invested in the community.
