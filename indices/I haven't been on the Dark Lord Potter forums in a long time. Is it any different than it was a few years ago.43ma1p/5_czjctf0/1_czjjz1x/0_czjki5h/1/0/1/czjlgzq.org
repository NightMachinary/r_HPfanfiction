How dare we act snarky and rude when people insist on attacking us on this subreddit. The utter gall, right? How dare we feel the need to defend ourselves against blatant lies and bitter people that didn't like that we held different opinions than them.

What a bunch of feckless thugs. Coming into a public forum where they are decried as miscreants, assholes, children, and /mean/ and having any sort of reaction at all, since anything other than agreeing with the current groupthink would be seen as an overreaction.

You realize initially, I was all for trying to be understanding and nice on this subreddit? That got me nowhere. That got me people downvoting me on principle alone, ignoring what I said, and plainly refusing to care about anything which dared to force them outside of their narrowminded view of DLP. Palindrome, up above, currently sits at -1, and why? Because she dared voice her opinion that she didn't appreciate being whittled down to "female staff member" and having her gender used to insult a place she likes.

It's not like there's a DLP hate thread every couple of weeks on this subreddit. It's not like this subreddit is full of people trying to steal our author's works which they want kept private, so much so that your head moderator had to make a sticky post in order to curb that sort of behavior. It's not like this subreddit is hypocrisy personified.

Do you know how many threads on our site there are about how you guys are so mean and rude to us? None. Yet there are multiple on this site. And you ask why we're 'mean'? Lol.

In any case, love how you just responded to one line, which wasn't even part of the main paragraph of response to you.
