The tone which you start a comment influence how the rest of it is read. So I'm going to start with this adorable puppy in a gryffindor scarf. Hopefully, this will mean the rest of my comment comes across in the spirit it is meant (i.e., not angry)!

With that in mind, starting a post with an insult to me is going to mean I will not be in a frame of mind to be objective to anything else you say. If you had simply posted the rest, I have no doubt the conversation wouldn't have gone down hill so quickly, if at all. It did not help that the rest of this thread was filled with vitriol, even if not all of it was even pro DLP. For example, that still only make 4 out of 11 of your posts which were neutral or nice (at the time) for this thread. I'm not going to bother counting up all your posts, I think in fact that would be counterproductive. Instead, I think I need to point out that the way people use this subreddit is very different to a regular forum. The people in a forum like DLP form a community. Posts influence other posts, building on to form a greater whole. Forums carry their history whether they want to or not. Reddit is not like that. There may be some meta, but for the most part, each thread is a self contained unit.

Reddit is a train station, people come, people go, there is transient links between threads, but such things are short lived. Trains often repeat themselves, to allow new people to travel. People on one platform (subreddit) may never visit other platforms. You can carry your baggage from one train to another, but all the stickers and boarding passes aren't the same, and the others on the train may not understand them, and are not going to appreciate it at all. If there is someone yelling and being angry in a carriage it will attract others with the same opinion (who will all pat each on the backs) but you yelling will only make it worse. Instead, go to a new carriage, and in a calm, logical, friendly manner state your points. You were never going to convince the yelling group anyway. It is also no reason to be angry at everyone else on the train. And there is especially no reason to be angry at any other train, no matter how much they look alike or if the same yelling people are on it.

Forums are a community centre. People visit for the specific purpose of contributing to that community and that community alone. Everyone generally knows each other, and both in the community centre, and often outside it. If someone is having a conversation in one corner, basically everyone is listening in, even if they don't participate. You store your baggage there, and everyone can access it if they want. Someone yelling something the majority disagrees with will be kicked out, often after being shouted down by everyone else.

What I am trying to say, if you were to repost exactly what you said before, in a forum you can expect the same response, on reddit you can't. So I encourage you to try being nice again. I know it is hard to set aside your anger at earlier responses. I suffered from exactly that in this very thread until I took a breather. But letting go of your anger is the mark of maturity, and the internet in general needs more of it.

Despite your invitation, I am probably never going to join DLP unless I or it changes dramatically, which is why I visited this thread in the first place. There are a few reasons for this:

1. I read FF for fun. I have no wish to analyse what I read, to pick over the dissected remains of a story and pull out the plot tumours or the particularly shinny innards. I write FF solely for my own enjoyment, I don't care if is a cliche filled spelling error infested mess. Pointing those things out to me just lessens my enjoyment of a story. These parts of DLP therefore would not interest me.

2. I like slash. And I don't mind mpreg. And non-Harry centric stories. And I love fluff heavy romance. Sometimes I even like trashy overpowered, fix everything easily Harry. I do not like Harry/OC (of any gender, and including named but non-developed characters such as Daphne, Gabrielle or Blaise). I don't like Harem. I hate stories which are little more then male driven sex fantasies. But I am also not a big fan of complex, plot heavy, philosophical novels. For FF I generally want fun quick reads with characters I know well. If I want original characters and ideas, I go read original fiction. The idea of the DLP library /does/ tempt me, but honestly, would there be anything to my tastes that I can't find currently available elsewhere?

3. For the most part, I only have the energy for a single community at a time. If I was to join DLP, I would be a lurker, and would contribute little to nothing. If I'm not visiting regularly to read, then I won't visit to participate either. I will not use IRC, mostly because I like having time to edit my posts.

If I'm not there for the criticism, the library or IRC, what would I go to DLP for? DLP may no longer be as it once was, but that is still a long way to being somewhere I would go, and I don't expect it to change just to suit me. So thank you for the offer, and I hope others here will take it up, but it probably won't be me. In closing, have a picture of this ravenclaw puppy. [[http://imgur.com/J1uk3DH]]
