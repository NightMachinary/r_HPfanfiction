  I've only started to get sick of trying to be nice when all it's done is earn me nothing but hatred and blind certainty that DLP is the root of all evil.

Could you move the goalpost any further? This isn't an Olympics for Victimhood. The original post was asking about the current climate of DLP and did not make any reference to anyone's belief that 'DLP is the root of all evil.' Indeed, the only two users present in this thread who might attempt to make such an assertion are now-former members who have already displayed their own biases. It's completely unfair to assign their motivations to [[/u/mangaguy]] or [[/u/TheBlueMenace]]. It also makes you appear to be unable to bear /any/ amount of criticism towards your own community, no matter how valid.

  When someone is nothing but vitriolic towards me, there's only so much I can take before vitriol starts flowing from me as well.
#+end_quote

You could ignore them or kill them with kindness. Another person's choice to be unpleasant shouldn't immediately make you feel as though you need to match their vitriol with your own. That's immature.

  When people on here were circumventing rules and taking intellectual property to freely distribute here, in spite of the author's wishes.
#+end_quote

You keep bringing this up. Do you understand that this was only a handful of users who have been threatened with bans? It led to the members of this community drafting Rule #6 quite recently. In no way does their bad behaviour represent the entire subreddit. Find a new line of argument.

  You keep talking about how "you hear such horrible things about DLP" but you've never actually taken the time to see for yourself, have you?
#+end_quote

The threads that have been posted here are not encouraging for non-members. While some of your members /have/ shared threads that contain intelligent discussions on lacklustre fics or meta critiques of the fandom as a whole, the bad threads are *really* bad. It's up to the individual to decide if they'd like to swallow a pound of shit for a taste of ambrosia. If they decide not to, it's not your prerogative to berate them for it.

  DLP is one of the biggest HP fanfic sites still active.

Just because you're popular doesn't make you good. See: Robst, entire history of.

  No, we're not vulgar-free, child friendly, mugglenet nice -- but neither are we 4chan.
#+end_quote

Being an alternative to the vapidity of muggle.net doesn't make you brilliant by default.
