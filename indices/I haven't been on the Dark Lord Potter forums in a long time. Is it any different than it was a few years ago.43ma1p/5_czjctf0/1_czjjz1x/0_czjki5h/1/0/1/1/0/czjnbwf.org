Every DLP post regarding archiving fics is for fics which have disappeared from either being deleted by ffnet or for some other reason. And yes, we've had a few times in which authors have asked us to stop, and we've done so immediately.

The difference is that we did stop, and that we didn't start to do it in order to skirt author's wishes initially. A fic like Jono's /Stranger/ is only available fully within his yahoo group -- the only problem is that he suddenly disappeared without a trace and never came back. His yahoo group was closed and requires him, and only him, to approve of new members because of bot spam. So, obviously, no new members were coming in and they couldn't read the latest chapters of his fic because he wasn't around any more to let them in.

This is different from Santi and BWL, because Santi is still around, even if it's sporadic, and it's still available to view in the way he wants it to be viewed, as long as you take some time to make a few posts.

DLP is not a platform for criticizing bad fanfiction. It is a platform to review fanfiction, good or bad. It's obvious just how biased you are just from saying that, and it's clear that I'm not going to change your mind, so why don't we just leave it at this, hmm?
