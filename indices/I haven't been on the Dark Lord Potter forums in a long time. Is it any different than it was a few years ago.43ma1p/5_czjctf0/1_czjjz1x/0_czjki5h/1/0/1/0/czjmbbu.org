  How dare we act snarky and rude when people insist on attacking us on this subreddit. The utter gall, right? How dare we feel the need to defend ourselves against blatant lies and bitter people that didn't like that we held different opinions than them.
#+end_quote

In my original post, I simply pointed out that the aim of the post which Dromeo responded was probably not to single out female mods. That it was in fact a positive post about DPL. I also expressed that even if that /was/ the case, even I felt put out with how it was said. In response, you attacked me, and then proceeded to rant for a paragraph about what Dromeo felt was a legitimate complaint (which at no point did I argue against) in the meanest possible way. When I pointed this out to you, and the fact that many of the other pro-DLP posters here were being just as rude you decided to post a condescending, sarcastic rant which targeted not only me, but the entire subreddit proving exactly what I said.

  initially, I was all for trying to be understanding and nice on this subreddit

Looking back at your posts in this thread, the first is a very public dressing down of Karinta, then 2 posts which could be thought of as 'nice' or at least neutral, then a post in which you defend an attacking Karinta, then a post calling Karinta a narcissist, a post calling Almavet bit stupid, the next post then admits you /didn't actually read the post you were calling Almavet stupid for/, then a post which is snarky to Aristause, a post calling out Wordhammer, then two posts attacking me. So out of the 11 posts, only 3 don't call someone a name or attack someone. /The first post was already quiet mean./ I really don't understand how you can claim you tried to be nice.

  It's not like there's a DLP hate thread every couple of weeks on this subreddit. Do you know how many threads on our site there are about how you guys are so mean and rude to us? None.
#+end_quote

Maybe your attitude is exactly the reason why there are threads posted here against DLP. And maybe, the reverse isn't true because DLP isn't welcoming to that sort of post, being more focused on story critic then the wider focus here. If you're a mod, which I believe you are, then are you saying you would allow such posts? Because from everything I've heard about DLP, that isn't the case. That is /not/ evidence that the people who frequent DLP are any nicer then here, simply that HPFF allows posts from a wider range of topics and has different ideas about acceptable content.

#+begin_quote
  so much so that your head moderator had to make a sticky post in order to curb that sort of behavior
#+end_quote

Exactly! The subreddit respects that and addressed the issue. I have no idea why you think this makes us 'hypocrisy personified'. Are you saying that the mod should have let the posts for private material to continue?

#+begin_quote
  In any case, love how you just responded to one line, which wasn't even part of the main paragraph of response to you.
#+end_quote

Happy now?
