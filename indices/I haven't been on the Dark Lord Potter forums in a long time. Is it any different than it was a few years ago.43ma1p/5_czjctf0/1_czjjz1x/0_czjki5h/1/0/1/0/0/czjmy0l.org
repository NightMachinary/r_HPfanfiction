There was literally one part of my original reply to you that could be considered 'mean' and that was the part you originally replied to. The rest was me trying to explain Palindrome's point of view, in no way did I attack you in it, or was rude.

I'm not talking about my initial posts in this thread when I said I tried to be nice, I'm talking about my initial posts on this subreddit. I made this account specifically for this subreddit. Go to my very first post made, I don't have very many to get through, this account is only a few months old. I've only started to get sick of trying to be nice when all it's done is earn me nothing but hatred and blind certainty that DLP is the root of all evil. When someone is nothing but vitriolic towards me, there's only so much I can take before vitriol starts flowing from me as well. Want to know when I got pissed off? When people on here were circumventing rules and taking intellectual property to freely distribute here, in spite of the author's wishes.

You keep talking about my attitude. What about yours? I, at least, have conceded that DLP was indeed immature and stupid back in the day. You? You called this:

  Drome's point was that she was annoyed that he thought she was ever excluded from DLP on the basis of her genitalia, when she always felt included. Can you not understand her being vexed when someone says that a place she is fond of used to think of her as less, because she's a woman? Not only that, but then using her promotion and gender as a way to show that they've somehow matured and grown to like her instead of hate her?

Mean. How is that mean. Jesus. How did this attack you? How is this a rant? This message and the one preceding it? Yes, rants. That? Not so much, buddy, not so much.

I said I skimmed Almavet's post, found a few keywords which stood out to me, and decided not to read it fully. I don't waste my time with people who argue with terms like "buttbabies", sorry, especially when they're trying to speak for a community that I'm part of. What's funny is that that post was part of a good conversation I've had on this subreddit, the only one so far. It was clean, it was free of insults, and it was resolved in a happy manner with a member of this subreddit who doesn't frequent DLP.

Might I point out that our 'attitude' is only in response to yours? We have no desire to argue with you, and we have never come on here to start one. Take a good, hard look at your own attitude before blasting others. You keep talking about how "you hear such horrible things about DLP" but you've never actually taken the time to see for yourself, have you? You're arguing from a biased perspective and have no wish for that perspective to change. Even arguing against someone when they said that something someone said on here personally offended them, like that's something you have any right to argue against -- purely because you don't want DLP to have any sense of credibility.

I challenge you to look past your prejudices. I challenge you to join DLP, join some conversations, and let's see what happens. I can guarantee you that as long as you keep an open mind and don't intentionally provoke arguments, you'll find that it's not as bad as people say. What do you have to lose? If you do accept, and somehow find that you were right and that you find DLP disgusting, why not PM me (Narf, one of the Admins) on the boards and link me to whatever poster or post you found abhorrent, and I swear that I will work with you to fix whatever issue you're having. Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong and biased myself, and this might just end up making DLP better for everyone.

DLP is one of the biggest HP fanfic sites still active. There is no way we would be so active if we really were such hate-filled, vitriolic bastards like everyone on this subreddit claims we are. No, we're not vulgar-free, child friendly, mugglenet nice -- but neither are we 4chan.
