i'm not sure, are you trying to claim that dlp, (members of dlp, threads on dlp, etc.) never, at some point, displayed misogynistic attitudes? there were things like 'the ginny kill-off' and referring to her as 'ginslut'. if you google 'ginslut dlp' you find a thread about her tagged as that, from 2013. that's...pretty clearly misogynistic. i don't follow the progression of the site, so maybe that's all gone now, like wordhammer said, but their statement still stands
