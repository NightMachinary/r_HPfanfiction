  Of course it could be construed as misogynistic

There's nothing to construe! It's plain as day. Or are we not reading the same fourteen pages in which the human worth (handily equated to sex appeal) of a woman (who, I might add, was still a minor at the time---unlike a not-insignificant number of contributors to that thread) is attacked in such vile terms that I'm not going to pollute this corner of the internet by repeating them? You asked above if I had ever been a "hormonal teenager trying to be edgy"---if I were to learn that the friends I've made in my twenties ever talked like that, and remained so unrepentant, I would very quickly reevaluate those relationships. "Stupid" and "immature" doesn't cut it---this is not normal (or rather, acceptable) behavior, and it far exceeds the bounds of youthful indiscretion.

That said, DLP has definitely improved /a lot/ in the intervening years. It is home to a lot of interesting writing and discussion. But---and as I think the lack of proper contrition in the above post illustrates (not least because you speak with the voice of the administration)---there's still a long way to go.
