What it was was a rather extreme way for teenagers to let off steam against a fandom which was rife with Harry/Ginny fics, at the expense of every other pairing, in which Ginny was always portrayed the same way: a fiery redhead who takes no shit from no man. A stalker who was in love with Harry because he was famous who was still above reproach because she was a fiery redhead who takes no shit from no man.

It was boring, it was cliche, it was everywhere. It wasn't there because we hated Ginny as a female, it was because we hated the fanon interpretation of Ginny's character. It was one of the main reasons DLP was formed, so we could get away from all the Harry/Ginny fics running rampant on ffnet.

Was the terminology we used stupid and immature? Yup, for sure. But then again, we were stupid and immature. Did we do it because we think women are lesser than men? Nah. Of course it could be construed as misogynistic -- but so can most public forums in the world.
