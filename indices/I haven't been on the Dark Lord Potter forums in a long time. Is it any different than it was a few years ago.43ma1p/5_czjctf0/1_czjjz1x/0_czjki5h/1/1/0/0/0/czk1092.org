You and I obviously have different methods of measuring what's reprehensible and what's not. And that's fine.

Likewise, if I knew any person as willing to blindly judge as you are someone's actions 8 years ago without even caring to understand the underlying motives, I'd would reevaluate those relationships. Or if they were in any way as smug and holier-than-thou as you seem in your post.

You're trying to say I'm wrong for not having your specific moral barometer -- just like SJW's and tumblrina's are prone to do. Now, obviously, it's not quite that bad as I do admit that the thread was crass and stupid, but it's really rather normal behavior for teenagers. "Hot or Not" is a real game that teenagers play in America, at least. It's really not that different from everyone insulting Jesse Eisenberg for being ugly, nerdy, weak, having a funny voice, etc etc for being cast as Lex Luthor, on reddit or most social media sites.

I might be an administrator, yes, but I'm acting in my own capacity here and speaking for no one. I'm not going to apologize for anyone else's posts which were made 8 years ago, nor am I going to act contrite in the face of personal attacks made against DLP. I'm merely saying what I think needs to be said, what I think is the honest truth.
