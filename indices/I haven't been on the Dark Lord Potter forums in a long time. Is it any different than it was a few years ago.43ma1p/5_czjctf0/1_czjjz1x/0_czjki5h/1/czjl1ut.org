I'm sure we at DLP all mourn the loss of not having you light up all our lives.

Drome's point was that she was annoyed that he thought she was ever /excluded/ from DLP on the basis of her genitalia, when she always felt /included/. Can you not understand her being vexed when someone says that a place she is fond of used to think of her as less, because she's a woman? Not only that, but then using her promotion and gender as a way to show that they've somehow matured and grown to like her instead of hate her?
