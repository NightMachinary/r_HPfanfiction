Fair enough. I guess they feel personally offended since they were the ones who were trying to help Karinta get accustomed to IRC, only for.. well yeah I've seen what other people have posted, pretty succinct regarding the situation.

The people on DLP aren't generally the type to let people go around bad mouthing it without giving context. That can come across as 'ganging' up, definitely.

They could just post 'you're a liar' at which point people would further prompt them, but then it becomes the same issue doesn't it?

Honestly, I just wish people would realize that if they're going to say something bad about a website/people then they're going to have to expect a response. @_@
