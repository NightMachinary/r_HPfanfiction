The membership has shifted though there are a number of holdouts. Even those very-veteran members have matured quite a bit. The discussions have become more political and the misogyny has been tamped down. There are a few women mods now.

An earlier (4 months ago) discussion here offers more opinions: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m6wyo/a_little_clarification_on_what_dlp_is_for_please/]]

The IRC discussions still follow the old themes, so if you're not partial to original-flavor DLP, I'd stay away from that. Of course, you can lurk most parts of it even without a login, so read what's active and see if it suits you.
