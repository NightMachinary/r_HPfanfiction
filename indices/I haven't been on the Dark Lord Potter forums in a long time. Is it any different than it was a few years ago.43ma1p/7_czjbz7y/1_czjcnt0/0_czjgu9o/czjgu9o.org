Hi, Karinta. Why exactly are you mad? Are you mad that we didn't ban you for purposefully derailing conversations in IRC because you were bored and didn't like the discussion at hand? For calling Palindrome a cunt? For spamming the chat with Asian characters, again, because you were bored? For constantly coming into chat when no one was talking, saying "This chat sucks", and then leaving right after?

Or how about when you start up heated discussions and then get angry at people when they don't agree with your political views, then throw tantrums and call everyone cunts before you leave the room in a huff? Even in private messages, you would get riled up when people were being nothing but cordial and proceed to insult them and again, quit, all because they didn't agree with your extreme point of view on matters.

How about when we didn't ban you for saying male rape was funny and gave you another chance not to be an asshole?

How about when you [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=31446][posted a thread]] on DLP saying you wanted to kill yourself, and even though no one knew you, everyone was sympathetic and tried to cheer you up/help you? Were we a shitfest then? Were we being toxic towards you?

We didn't ban you for all those things or when you posted an attention seeking message saying good riddance to DLP (after being kicked out of IRC for, again, annoying everyone when you were bored), but I'm sure as hell going to ban you now.

Karinta, you obviously have problems that you need to deal with. I'd suggest leaving the internet and not using it as a forum to communicate with others, because it probably exacerbates your generally terrible mood more than anything. Please, for the sake of your sanity, get some help. Talk to people about things other than politics and extreme feminism.
