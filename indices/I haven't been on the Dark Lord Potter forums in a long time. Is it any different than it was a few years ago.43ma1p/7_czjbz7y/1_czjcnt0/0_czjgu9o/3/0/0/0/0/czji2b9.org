I'm sorry for whatever I did to ruin DLP - for whatever it was that set you off. Of course, it's too late now, and to be honest, I never really understood DLP in the first place. I tried to make it fit my conception of what I thought a fanfiction discussion forum should be like, and it was stupid to think that I could. You lot are so ingrown and incestuous that whatever I did, you would reject with ten times more force. And that's what happened.

I really am sorry, if it makes you feel any better. I sure don't.
