You're literally responding in one of many threads on this subreddit which senselessly disparages DLP, and you're telling me that I'm the one being childish and unbecoming when I laid out reasons as to why a certain member is throwing out insults?

Please don't take this post in a hostile tone, I'm honestly a little confused and vexed at people not seeing the obvious (at least, to me) hypocrisy, and wouldn't mind a civil discussion about it.
