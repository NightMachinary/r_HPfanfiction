Honestly? Saying DLP can be toxic hardly required the personal response you gave. As a mod you should be one of the role models of the forum, not chasing people down. There will always be hate in the world, especially on the internet, so getting worked up enough to give out such a personal response is very unbecoming. I'm not saying what he/she did on DLP is right or wrong. All I'm saying is that you can refute the claim of toxic without a personal attack. Maybe I'm totally missing the point, but it really made [[/u/karinta][u/karinta]] seem like the victim, which really wasn't the point of your post. I'm sure that both sides have a point of view and a story, but aggression begets a negative connotation even if you are in the right.
