I think this is drawing something of an artificial line between the personal and the impersonal. Karinta's "argument" was that she had a bad personal experience at DLP and that therefore DLP is a terrible place. Commenting on the circumstances of that personal experience seems to be entirely fair. Karinta was the one who brought the situation up. If she didn't want it mentioned and talked about, she shouldn't have posted making reference to it.

To say that Karinta is permitted to use personal information in attacking DLPers but that DLPers are not permitted to reference that very same personal information in their defence seems like an absurd double standard. You're basically saying that you can make attacks at people but they aren't allowed to defend themselves.

And that is why, incidentally, it's not a witch-hunt: Karinta was the one who started it. It's not a witch hunt if the "witch" is the aggressor. She could have kept her DLP drama on DLP, but instead she decided to come to Reddit and bring it up here. Sree was merely responding.
