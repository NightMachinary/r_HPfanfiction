The problem here is that Narf's reply is violating Rules 2 and 3. You can be perfectly cordial but still engage in a witch-hunt; you can have a civil reply that reveals personal information.

Some of what Narf wrote was revealing far more than acceptable. Not only was Narf's reply /completely over the top/ for what Karinta wrote, but it was personal and directed against Karinta, rather than Karinta's argument.

I consider attacking an individual more serious than attacking an aspect of some community. Threads quickly become more volatile, people start to engage in witch-hunting, etc - the harm that can be done by an attack on an individual is more serious than the harm that can be done by an attack on an aspect the community. One is targeted against a person; the other is spread out amongst many individuals and targets the nature of the community instead.

Narf's comment was targeted because it was reported. Mods do not and can not read every comment of every thread. If you report a comment, we will take a look at it. With regards to the comment you mention, they contain /nowhere near/ the amount of targeted personal information that Narf's comment did.

The third comment has been removed. Thanks for mentioning that.
