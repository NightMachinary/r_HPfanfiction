Hey, Narf,

While I can understand why Karinta's actions might be making you frustrated, +we'll have to remove your comment until you+ I suggest you get rid of some of the identifying information about Karinta. Take a look at Rule 2, and Rule 3, take a deep breath, and write out a response to Karinta that doesn't involve them as a user on DLP, but the content of their comment.

I feel that you are capable of making a strong argument against Karinta's comment without referencing their actions over at DLP.
