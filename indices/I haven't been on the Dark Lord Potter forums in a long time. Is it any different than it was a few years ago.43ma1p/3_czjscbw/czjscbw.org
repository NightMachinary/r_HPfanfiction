As a sometimes user (mostly lurker) on the site, I don't think I've encountered any venomous attitude. Comments by some of the newish people could be seen as immature (i.e. dark!Harry worship, character bashing), but I don't think that necessarily reflects on attitude of the site as a whole. From what I've seen the older members are much more level headed and mature.

Also, their WbA is hella good if you're wanting feedback outside the usual 'OMG UPDATE PLZZ' fare of ffn.net. It's definitely made me more concientious as a writer. Don't expect them to sugar coat anything though.

I guess my one issue would be that it has that 'boy's club' feel to it as far as fic preferences go. But then again, so does this subreddit, so I really can't criticize. /shrug/

Edit: oh one more thing, it's a very Harry-centric fic community, as the name implies, so the fics recced tend be largely of that variety. This probably excludes a good deal of fics in the fandom. Sooo, probably not everyone's cup of tea.
