  The user base has matured, but it can still be pretty ugly.

I don't think there's anywhere that's safe from ugliness or pettiness.

To be honest, this topic looks like it was created to just stir the pot. We've had plenty of DLP discussion topics here and they all go the same way every time. If OP was truly interested in seeing what the community was like now, they'd just, you know, go look and see what's going on. It's not like it costs money to do so.
