  It'd probably work better as a sidebar item or something here, if for the purpose of telling people about DLP from the outside.

In that case It would be better if DLP staff has nothing to do with writing it. If it's hosted here it should definitely be an outside opinion because any participation could be looked on as bias.

DLP's history is particularly colourful, and while most of the 'colour' is behind us there are still instances where the worst is brought out in people, though as time has passed those have become fewer.

  Might be helpful for DLP itself to have a better primer for new users.

Unless I'm mistaken, new users receive a PM from Lord Ravenclaw giving a list of important threads to read regarding expected etiquette, but I don't think users pay attention to it, sadly.

  But as noted before, DLP has recently received influxes of users from this sub that abused the rules/were total shitters.

We've also gained some good members as well, so it hasn't been a total loss!
