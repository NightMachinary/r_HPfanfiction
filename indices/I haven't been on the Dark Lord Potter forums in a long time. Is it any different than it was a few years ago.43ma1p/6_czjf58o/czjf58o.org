Been on DLP for going on ten years now, the user base has matured quite a bit, I really doubt there are many teenagers anymore.

I've always said that DLP is the best place to go in the fandom for intelligent discussion and high standards, and I stand by that. While there are some threads that become shit shows, they aren't the majority, especially now.

What's even the point of this thread? Do you just want to shit on a community that you don't like? Are you trying to insult members of DLP that hang out on this subreddit? Honestly, posting something like this shows just as much about you as the thread you used as an example.

If you want to know what DLP is like now, make an account and find out. As long as you aren't an idiot (of at least are a funny idiot) you'll most likely be welcomed cheerfully.
