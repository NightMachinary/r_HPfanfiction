While I do agree with you that Harry and Fleur aren't compatible, and don't like stories with the pairing, I'd say they are certainly more compatible than H/Hr, simply because of their more lax attitude and propensity to engaging in dangerous situations. And Harry thinks of her as a /natural/ beauty, unlike Hermione.
