It's been years since I've lurked on DLP with any regularity, so you're probably right, but it's still entirely beside the point I was making: DLP prefers "absurd" ships over the canon ones, contrary to what was implied in the post above mine. Harry/Luna aren't compatible because she's insane, Daphne is an OC in all but name, and I'd imagine an H/G fic would have to be very well-written to overcome the bias DLP has against Ginny. Furthermore, you've said a DLP admin reads a whole bunch of H/Hr, so all that bluster the OP made about DLP revering canon because they aren't sheep who think Harry and Hermione are compatible, comes off as a bit ridiculous.

Whether my original blanket statement was wrong or not, the point still stands: don't knob off a forum for something they don't do.
