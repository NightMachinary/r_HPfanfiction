Well, I'll happily admit to being wrong about H/F, then.

I don't think any of these pairings are absurd; with the right amount of character development, no ship is really too unbelievable, except, as you said, slash-fics, which directly conflict with Harry's sexuality as we see in canon, and people like Bellatrix, who Harry would probably kill before fuck.

When I used absurd, I meant in the sense of OP's definition, because if H/Hr is retarded and doesn't "revere" canon, then what is Harry/Luna, or Harry/Fleur, or Harry/Daphne, but infinitely more "absurd"? But, as you said, neither of us agree with his statement, so all's well that ends well.
