I, uh, have nothing to do with who you replied to. I don't know who he is nor do I agree with his statements. I find him a bit stupid, in fact. I was simply replying to your statement about Harry/Fleur.

I'm confused, is every ship 'absurd' if it's not canon? What makes them absurd? Realistically, the only absurd pairings for Harry would be male ones, given that we see no sign of Harry being even remotely gay throughout any of the seven novels. Likewise, any hetero pairing involving Albus would also be absurd, given JKRs assertion that he is gay, and also given the canon evidence that he never married nor showed any leaning, hetero or otherwise.
