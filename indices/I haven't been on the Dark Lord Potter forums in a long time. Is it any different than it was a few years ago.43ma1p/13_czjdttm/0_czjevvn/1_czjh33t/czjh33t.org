The DLP ship is clearly Harry/Fleur? I'm sorry, I've been on DLP since it's inception, and I have never seen this mentality. People on DLP love Harry/Fleur, don't get me wrong, but people on DLP also love Harry/Hermione (DarkSyaoran, one of our administrators, regularly browses ffnet with a H/Hr filter on and has read almost every H/Hr fic published). They also love Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne, and even Harry/Ginny if it's well written.

The biggest ongoing Harry/Fleur fic out right now, Cadmean Victory, is regularly hated on in DLP for the sole reason of the ship, because of how lackluster it is. If we were truly as obsessed with Harry/Fleur as you say, we would read the fic because of the pairing, not despite it.
