They have mellowed out, but what I still like about the forum is that it's /not/ your personal hugbox. Morons are banned, yeah. That is why discussion there is so higher in quality than it is in here.

  cared far more about their own fantasies than anything actually going on HP.

And what do you call every second thread here that asks for Harry having buttbabies with Draco/Lucius/Snape/Voldemort? or Hermione having a romance with pretty much every male and female character in the series? or Snape adopting Harry? those things aren't tolerated there, and in that respect, they care so much more about the original series than most of the fandom. They actually revere canon, where here half the posters think that "magical cores" are canon or that Harry and Hermione are compatible.

The amount of stupidity in this fandom is exactly the reason why DLP is so filled with venom.
