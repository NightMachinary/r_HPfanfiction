You hit the nail on the head regarding Esama's writing - I find they write some of the most unique premises in HP fandom, but often leave works unfinished or only barely delve into the topics. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603]]) is my dream concept for a fanfiction, essentially The Martian with Harry Potter magic instead of technology, but it ends very quickly and leaves a lot of the plot up in the air.

Sometimes it's better when they do a less detailed story, however - linkao3(1113588) is an interesting premise, especially since it forgoes actually involving characters from the Sherlock/SH universe, but really couldn't have been more than a one-shot and I think the author did a good job not artificially weakening Harry to come to a conclusion of the canon issues. Likewise, linkao3(1149623) is better served by glossing over the details, as it could very easily get bogged down otherwise.

All three do feature retrospective story-telling, as you noted, so it's safe to assume that's just the author's style. I'd avoided this series in the past because I'm not familiar with Stargate, but I should have realized that the author does a good job of handling crossovers without needing excessive knowledge - I'm no more familiar with the world of Temeraire and still thoroughly enjoyed Island of Fire.

Very excited to see your thoughts on Valbone, reread it a few months back and thought it had some high highs and low lows.

Edit: Bot had some weird returns when searching by name, let's try story IDs.
