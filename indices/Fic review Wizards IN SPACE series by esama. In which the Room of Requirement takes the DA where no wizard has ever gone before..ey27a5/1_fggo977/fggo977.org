  Harry alone seems to feel quite removed from the fervour and thrill that the rest of the DA are feeling when they discover the ship. He is the steadying influence, the voice of reason and the hand on the reins, which is very out of the ordinary for Harry.

Indeed. That is - apart from the story being unfinished, and the lack of a decent core cast - my biggest gripe with the story. Harry's the only character that consistently appears; the story cycles through the DA's roster, which means every character only appears as barely more than a cameo. If it had been the trio, and perhaps Luna, Ginny or the twins, we would have had a cast to care about and relatioinships to develop. With the entire DA all taking almsot equal spotlight time, well... it's all interchangeable. Only Harry seems to matter past "solving this problem".

And Harry feels "off". He has no passion, no drive, he doesn't appear as the charismatic leader people follow, which would have been somewhat plausible - he's the wise guy. The "team parental figure", so to speak. He has no real close friends either, as far as I remember; Ron and Hermione are barely more than acquaintances based on his actions and priorities.

I don't think that fits him at all - the voice of reason and planner would have much better fit Hermione, with Harry being the Kirk type leader who charges in and takes risk.
