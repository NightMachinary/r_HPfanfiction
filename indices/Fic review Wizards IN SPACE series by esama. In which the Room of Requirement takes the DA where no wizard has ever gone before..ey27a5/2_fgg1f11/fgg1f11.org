Like most stories Esama writes - it starts out great, but goes nowhere. It has makings of a great story, there are some good ideas and general build-up, but there is nothing that really brings the story together at the end. No conclusion or culmination. Few ideas (like gold) were tad silly.

I loved the beginning and would have loved to see it evolve into proper story, but yeah. Most of Esama's work is just essays for story ideas. Rarely anything is finished.
