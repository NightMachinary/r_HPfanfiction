- linkffn(Emperor): the ultimate stragegist Harry, trained in the muggle world. Might as well have him quoting Hannibal and Sun Tzu.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Fury: Book 3 of the Firebird Trilogy): Harry becomes part of the armed forces working against both Voldemort and the Dark Coven lead Ministry. Involves multi-country battles and interspecies war.
- linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died): some great maneuvering by Dumbledore, Voldemort and even Lucius Malfoy of all people.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): You see the Order being shown off more as an actual fighting force against the Death Eaters once the war kicks off, with small unit tactics and deployment across Britain.
- linkffn(Unspeakable Things): the DoM were the ultimate masters of magical warfare, and they utilized every resource available to take down their opponents (at one point they hit a giant with rocket launchers).
