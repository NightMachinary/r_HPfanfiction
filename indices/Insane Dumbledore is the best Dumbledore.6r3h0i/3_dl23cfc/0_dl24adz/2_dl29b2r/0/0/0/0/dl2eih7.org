A story needs a conclusion in my opinion. There are tons of inspirational prompts, snippets and half-fleshed out ideas. If I have to make up the ending of a story myself because the author abandoned it, then I might as well save me the trouble and write the whole story myself instead.

I personally don't start a story (as opposed to a snippet) without having the ending in mind.
