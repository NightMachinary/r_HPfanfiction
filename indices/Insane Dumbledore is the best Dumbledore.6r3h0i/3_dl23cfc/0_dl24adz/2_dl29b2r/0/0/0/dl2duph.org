Fanfic writers aren't professional, nor do they make any money from this, so that 'basic requirement' really doesn't apply here.

I'd take an inspiring, but unfinished story (The Life and Times for example) over a finished predictable, boring one any second. I tried robst's stories when I first started reading fanfiction, and wasn't able to go past chapter 5 so why do I care if it's finished or not?
