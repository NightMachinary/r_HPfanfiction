Eh, who knows how much notes he actually has. He seems more of the "make shit up while he goes along" variety... probably why he has so much trouble finishing the series and why he hasn't actually written a good ASOIAF book since 2001.

And even though I have such controversial opinions about the guy I still don't think he's a bad author. That's why I'm being so direct about the guy as an example to better explain my position. He's a fantastic story teller with incredible ideas... For me it's the journey that matters, not the finish line.
