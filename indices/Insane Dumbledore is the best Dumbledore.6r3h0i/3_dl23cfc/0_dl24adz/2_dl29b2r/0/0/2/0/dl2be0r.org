There's a George R.R. Martin who hasn't finished several books and stories and is currently writing the next book in a successful series?

I don't expect authors to finish their stories in a few days or weeks, or even months, depending on the length of their stories. I don't even expect them to finish all their stories - sometimes, a story simply has to be dropped. But if that happens more often than not, and the updates slow down, or the author keeps starting new stories without ever finishing them... well, they're not a good author in that case. Sometimes you simply have to keep working, and push through.

And yes, I know that real life takes precedence, especially for hobby authors - but if you're not writing any more, you're not exactly doing what authors do.
