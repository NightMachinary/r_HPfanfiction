"... and on the next day Voldemort fell dead because of a Brain Aneurysm and all of his Horcruxes went poof!"

If you now complain "Hey, that's not good enough" then I think we both agree that you don't really care about having an end for the sake of having an end.

I think there's often a good reason why stories are unfinished and if the author has no good ideas for a satisfying ending I vastly prefer nothing over a half-arsed ending that tries to wrap everything up in 1 chapter (seen a few of those, didn't appreciate them at all and would have rather left stuff up for my own imagination... even 10 years later I'm still trying hard to forget that stupid epilogue with little success)
