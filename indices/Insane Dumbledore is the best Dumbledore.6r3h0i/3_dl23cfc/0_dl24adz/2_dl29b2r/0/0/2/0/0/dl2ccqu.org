  There's a George R.R. Martin who hasn't finished several books and stories and is currently writing the next book in a successful series?

Well, he *is* an acclaimed author and his main work is - as of yet - unfinished. So reality seems to disagree with your notion that you can't be a good author if your stories are unfinished. I think GRRM was already a good author after the first book, I really didn't need to read the rest to know that.

Him - probably - being unable to finish his epic story is completely irrelevant in that regard for me. He's just a bad planner and a little delusional.
