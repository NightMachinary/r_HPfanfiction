  I also don't think an author can be considered good if they don't finish their stories

The quality of a story - how "good" it is, should /never/ be dependent on whether it is finished or not. Is it fulfilling to have an ending - to have that sense of closure? Absolutely. I believe the moniker of "good" is solely dependent on the author's grammar, plot, and writing ability. Not on their ability or willingness to finish it.

  that's pretty much the basic requirement for a professional author.

Professional authors write because it's their /job/, not because it is their hobby, as in the case of fanfiction writers. FF writers stop posting because they lose inspiration, encounter writer's block, or personal issues. Does your father having a heart attack and becoming disabled make one author whose stories I enjoy a bad writer? In this case, it's implying that it is /their fault/ for having that happen to them. And even in less traumatic cases, as in loss of inspiration, they aren't obligated to finish their stories if they are unable to, or no longer desire to do so. Some authors just cease enjoying it.

  A captivating stoy that leaves you hanging without a resolution is worse. Dozens of Fanfics have taught me that.

But I can wholeheartedly agree with this. An unfinished story lacks a sense of closure - the knowledge of what exactly happened at the ending. Unfinished stories left abandoned on cliffhangers are so much worse.
