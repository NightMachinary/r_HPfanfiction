I always felt like Ginny offered nothing for Harry in terms of a real relationship. It felt more like Rowling decided that the main character should end up happily ever after with a girl, but Hermione is too much of a bookworm/friend relation. She picked Ginny just because the other options weren't good enough either. Tbh I don't know why Harry would end up with someone who's fangirling over him most of the time when he has a hard enough time with people not believing him and vilifying him and just treating him one-dimensionally. And she seems awfully bland for the rest of Harry's life considering that he's lived so long having a rival (i.e. Voldemort). It would've been better if he ended up with someone who was a strong challenging character, while being supportive of him.
