She dated other guys on Hermione's advice to help get Harry's attention. She still is the fangirl getting her saviour, but learned how to hide it. They dated, broke up, should have been over. The whole big happy Weasley family was a contrived element to the story. I would have preferred a more realistic dating experience for all of them. Maybe it was because I was older than the target audience during the whole craze or what, but the romance in the story was just unimaginative.
