Lol Draco seems more like childhood rival rather than someone who's going to be there for Harry though thick and thin, plus he's quite cowardly and acts as Harry's foil throughout the series. Just wish Rowling had written a better character from earlier on... I did hear that she planned out how the series was going to end quite early on, but can't remember where I read that from. I mean, if she had the final scene all plotted out she should've really developed Harry's love interest from the second or third book
