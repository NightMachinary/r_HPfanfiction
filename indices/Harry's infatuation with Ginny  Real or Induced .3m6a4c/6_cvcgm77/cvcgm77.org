It was one of those times when I would've told JKR to just go with the flow and write the whole thing into a Harry/Hermione. As someone already mentioned, she rather forcefully steered clear of H/Hr in Goblet of Fire just because she didn't want those two to be together.

True, Harry/Hermione could've ended worse than Harry and Ginny. By that I mean, it could've been much more of an artificially held together relationship /in the end/.

However, the substitute we got was mediocre at best, for it was a artificially /started/ relationship. Ginny was bland and barely fleshed out when she entered the limelight (or at least she seemed to be). I can't hold it against someone that the way it was in canon seemed to be forced somehow, because, frankly it was.

But I think that JKR just fell into the same trap a lot of writers fall in. They run out of characters. The only other girls in Harry's age-frame besides Ginny and Hermione, who had deeper character by book 5 were Luna and Pansy. Out of those two I could only see Luna conquering Harry's heart by just being who she is. Thats something I could've seen happening in OotP.

But anyway, could've, should've, would've doesn't matter. We got what we got and the rest is fanfiction.
