Is this the new Harmony creed now? For years it was 'Don't listen to JKR, she's an idiot!', and now that she's a bit more sympathetic to them it's 'Listen to JKR. She knows best!' That few people notice the irony amuses me.

The original comment was made that JKR should have gone with the H/Hr flow in GoF, which, of course, never existed. JKR considered the idea laughable back then. And had she actually 'gone with the flow' in DH, it would have led to an insipid twilight-y love triangle that would have absolutely taken over the plot, not to mention gone against the theme of the books, so the point there is invalid.

Harry's relationship with Ginny is built mainly on their moment about the possession, the Easter egg, quite a bit of shared time (she was around during all the best times in his life, being summers at the Burrow or parties in the common room, and there are casual interactions throughout), the Quidditch victory and no small amount of physical attraction. They share interests in Quidditch, and they share a sense of humor. There is also a story to it: A young girl with a crush growing out of her hero worship and having to prove herself as a strong character before the boy is attracted to her.

Would it have been better had there been more of it? Probably, and definitely as far as the romance was concerned. But then the books were never about romance, and there were limited time and space JKR spent on it before it felt out of place. Given how the romance was built up (more as a teenage romance than your typical 'true love' romance), I feel it was fine. And no, 'BAM HARRY'S CHEST MONSTER' isn't a valid criticism because it is mostly based on people willing themselves to forget all their interactions in OoTP, and the fact that the attraction actually had a build up from the Hogwarts Express to the Dean kissing Ginny scene, which is when Harry first realized his feelings for Ginny.

The OP question is obviously retarded and doesn't deserve an answer, so I'm just going to ignore it.
