The quote you posted there is only talking in reference to Ron/Hermione, which was the topic of discussion in that interview. Even if they were a better fit in more than "some ways", they would still have to be better paired than H/G, which they clearly aren't.

The romance wasn't that well written, sure, but let's face it, it wasn't a disaster. It simply isn't one of JKR's strongest points (her world building is). That doesn't diminish H/G as a couple.

And BTW, only OotP was humongous, which is why she had to tone it down for HBP/DH. I'm pretty sure she had more H/G scenes planned for HBP/DH, but that the editors told her to cut on that because it was getting to big. Also, what tells you that she hasn't had other scenes cut too?
