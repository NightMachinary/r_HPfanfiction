I remember that Rowling admitted to having Harry and Hermione too close in book five, so she needed to wedge them apart to get the canon pairings. It's just badly handled and they don't really make much sense. Sure have them date, but end up marrying? That was boring, it something I can't see working out.

Tell me, would you date a friend that has pissed on you and that you've wanted to beat the sense into? Also, dating a fangirl? Harry seemed more inclined for someone who would get to know him and see him for just Harry, Ginny was still the fangirl doing anything to remain as Harry's girl as per Hermione's instruction/advice. It's weird.
