It was in her interviews, where she stated she had Harry and Hermione too close at the end of OtoP for her plan of the pairings. Just because I can't find the interview doesn't mean it didn't happen. Its not like I stating it as concrete proof that Rowling was doing H/Hr pairing.

It's not Ron bashing, it's that those would fight with each other. She harped on him as well. Ron and Hermione are better off friends not lovers, it just seemed like they both settled.

Ginny was never really in Harry's purview much of the time, just when it was a big gathering. The damsel got her prince. They talked on the possession, but thing was, Harry completely forgot about her being so. Ginny asked Hermione for advice on how to Harry's attention which didn't really happen till the sixth book. She was just Ron's sister till then. She didn't get to know him as Harry through Harry. Face it, the damsel in distress got her knight in shining armor. It was contrived and better off having Harry not end up with someone in Hogwarts. If I wanted the damsel, Gabrielle was a better option.
