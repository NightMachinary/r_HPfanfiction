  I remember that Rowling admitted to having Harry and Hermione too close in book five, so she needed to wedge them apart to get the canon pairings.

Link please or didn't happen.

  Tell me, would you date a friend that has pissed on you and that you've wanted to beat the sense into?

As usual, more Ron denigration from the anti R/Hr.

  Also, dating a fangirl? Harry seemed more inclined for someone who would get to know him and see him for just Harry, Ginny was still the fangirl doing anything to remain as Harry's girl as per Hermione's instruction/advice. It's weird.

Ginny only was a fangirl of Harry's during the first book, when everyone else was, even Hermione. If anyone's a hero-worshipper, it's Colin.

No, Ginny got to know and see Harry as just Harry, she got over her worshipping and became his friend. It's all in the books.
