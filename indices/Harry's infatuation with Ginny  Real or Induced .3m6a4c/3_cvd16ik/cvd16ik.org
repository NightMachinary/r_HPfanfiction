My main problem is that the relationship development was so poorly handled.

The problems with their (Harry/Ginny) relationship is that the majority of feelings happened offscreen. And when they finally came to light, it felt like you were being hammered over the head with it.

"Over the course of one summer Harry falls for Ginny..." if that wasn't cliche enough, it just feels short handed because we (the readers) never witness much of their interaction. It feels pushed upon us and shoved into the books. All this time their development together/scenes together have been very limited and scarce - we know Harry but we barely know ginny. She is hardly a side character. Only in the previous book (5) do we see more of Ginny and it is shown that she's grown out of her fangirl phase. But that's still not enough to support their romantic relationship together especially since Harry's hardly with her and his feelings for her didn't get shown to the reader.

Ginny too I have a big problem with - she goes from being this painfully shy, Harry-obsessed fangirl (which, I admit, I found pretty adorable and funny when she was a little girl) to this outrageously popular, beautiful, talented, smart, brave, funny, compassionate, kind, loving well liked, never-without-a-boyfriend dreamboat of a girl.

But...when did that all happen?

My problem is that we never SEE that actually happening. We never see Ginny being truly fleshed out - and in contrast to the pages and pages of characterization and growth we get for the other characters her personality falls dreadfully flat and she feels very one-dimensional. JK Rowling tries hard to make Ginny likable but she comes across as being too..."perfect" because so little time is spent developing her = we only get told (repeatedly) of how wonderful she is. We never really see it.

People say that Harry/Hermione would have been "the Hero gets the Girl" but in all honesty I find that much more applicable to Harry/Ginny...after all: the Hero (Harry) ends up with the very desirable, popular, gorgeous, smart, brave, loving and funny girl! That strikes me as far more cliche than Harry being with the bookish, annoying, bossy, flawed and physically plain Hermione any day.

In all honesty, I dislike the pair of Harry/Ginny- but I feel I would have been more open to it had it got proper on-screen development instead of Harry suddenly realizing he's in love with her. Ginny too needed far, far more fleshing out as an individual before she was pushed up with Harry. And "the chest lion" was utterly stupid.
