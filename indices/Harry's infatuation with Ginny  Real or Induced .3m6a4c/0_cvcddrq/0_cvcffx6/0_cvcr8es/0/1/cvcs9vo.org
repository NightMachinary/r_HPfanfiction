Her quotes were taken out of context. She never actually said that Hermione should have married Harry, she only said that in some ways they were a better fit compared to Ron/Hermione. And she goes on to say a few days later that Harry's love for Ginny is true (thereby denying anything between H/Hr). You should read the full interview.

Also, she never even mentioned GoF, nor did she mention Harry/Ginny in the original interview.
