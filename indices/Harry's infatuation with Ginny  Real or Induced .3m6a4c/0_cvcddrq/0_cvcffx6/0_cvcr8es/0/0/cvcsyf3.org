  What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron.

  In *some ways* Hermione and Harry are a better fit and I'll tell you something very strange. (emphasis mine)

  Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counseling, you know. I wonder what happens at wizard marriage counseling? They'll probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues and she needs to work on being a little less critical.

  Ron's used to playing second fiddle. I think that's a comfortable role for him, but at a certain point he has to be his own man, doesn't he?

She did not say Hermione should have ended up with Harry. She just questioned her motives for writing Ron/Hermione, and whether it would've actually worked. So many news articles took things out of context and put words in her mouth.
