Poorly? - Forced is more like it (come on, how can you be attracted to your number on fangirl who probably just likes the same things you do because you liked them first, particularly if said fangirl couldn't even talk to you normally and stuck her elbow in the butter!)...Romances without any build-up are crappy! It's like Harry just goes "Oh - shiny" and we are supposed to believe she's the love of his live (hell, the whole premises is faulty, he's only had ONE prior relationship -.- come on that's unlikely...he should have dated some more (after dealing with Voldy, I can understand him not wanting to drag a girlfriend into all of that!))

ps: If it's pretty you are after: Then Fleur would work way better (in addition to other qualities, like having similar problems (scar and veela heritage/beauty!))
