I thought it was decent, and it does have a good bit of interesting AU stuff in it. But it doesn't exactly conform to OP's question, Harry doesn't stop giving a shit about Voldemort, he just realizes that Dumbledore is as much his enemy as Voldemort is. It starts at the end of OotP I believe, and most everything is the same as canon, with two large exceptions which either kickstart the story and make some problems down the line.
