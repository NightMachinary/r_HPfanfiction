In essence, it's a series of beautifully described fights strung lightly together with plot.

It's the only second person fic I'd ever consider recommending. It's not my usual sort of story, at all, but I still like it a lot. I'm not so sure on the sequel. If you know you want to read /something/, go for this and eventually the second person perspective stops mattering at all.

It is a fun read. But a well-written fun read.
