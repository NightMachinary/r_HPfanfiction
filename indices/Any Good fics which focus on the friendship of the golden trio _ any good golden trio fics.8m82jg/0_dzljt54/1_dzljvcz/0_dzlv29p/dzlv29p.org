[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/][Forging the Sword]], linkffn(3557725), is really good, but unfortunately abandoned.

I like the Trio friendship a lot in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), but the first third is more about Hermione striking out on her own.

Despite the grammar and spelling in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516), I find the plot and Trio characterization compelling enough to recommend it.

When it comes to Trio friendship, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4778694/1/][To End in Serenity]], linkffn(4778694), is great, but its Dumbledore bashing goes way too far.
