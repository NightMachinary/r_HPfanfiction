Depends on if your apparation is like in the books, where it seems to be instantaneous, or in the movies, where you turn to smoke and fly around really fast. Nobody gets hit while apparating in the books, but it happens a few times in both the HP movies (I believe during Order of the Phoenix at least once) and in the Fantastic Beasts series.
