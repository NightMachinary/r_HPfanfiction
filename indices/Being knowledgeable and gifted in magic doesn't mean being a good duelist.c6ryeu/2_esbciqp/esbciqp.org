This is the biggest skill a duelist can possess, at least in my headcanon. In the books, obviously we only get one "real" duel between two genius wizards, that being Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.

Both of them are continuously adapting based on the magic that the other is casting, and the magic they cast is less of the "jets of lights" variety and more elemental forces of nature. They're not moving around a lot or dodging, instead opting to redirect the other's spells. So it seems that when you reach that level of magical proficiency, then all the time you spent jogging around the lake as a teenager won't do you any good ;).

A lot of the duels I read that involve wizards who are not on DD or TMR's level have a lot of bolts of light flying, and usually involve the combatants dodging and rolling out of the way. Sometimes martial arts are involved. I don't really like it that much, but I understand why it's done--with this technique you can actually write longer battle or duel sequences with characters who are not as magically skilled as the cream of the crop.

I think realistically (as realistically as we can be) duels between unskilled wizards and witches would be really short. Each duelist would get maybe two or three spells off in total before one of them dies or becomes incapacitated. In an unskilled duel, neither participant would be skilled enough, fast enough, or knowledgeable enough to block or redirect every spell, so who ever got in the first lucky hit would win, assuming it was a spell that is able to kill or incapacitate. I think of it like old west gun fights. One or two shots and it's over.

As far as a battle, I think if a magical battle actually were fought with a large amount of wizards it would be chaos. In canon, the battle of Hogwarts seems to involve groups pairing off and fighting individually, but I envision larger scale battles as more chaotic. Spells, and the effects of spells (like smoke, splinters from exploding rocks or walls, great gusts of wind, rampaging animals...) would turn the battleground into a mess. People would be Apparating all over. Spells would be flying every which way. I think survival would be almost a coin toss for any wizard who enters a battle like that unless they are on DD or Voldemort's level of skill (possibly also Snape's or the Marauder's levels).

I think writing battles is probably best avoided, both because it seems /really/ hard to do well and I think wizards tactically wouldn't choose to do large scale battles either. Their skills are a lot better suited for espionage and one-on-one fighting.
