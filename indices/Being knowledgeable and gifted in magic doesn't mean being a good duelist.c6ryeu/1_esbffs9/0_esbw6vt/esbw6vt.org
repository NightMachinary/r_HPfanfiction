I adore this scene and the underlying message. But I think it still highlights that even at the highest levels of dueling, dueling skills, reflexes and knowledge are a separate, distinct category from general spell knowledge.

  They were quick, very quick. Sirius's silver spell was aimed high and left, at Dumbledore's shoulder, and Snape's violet jet of light was aimed low and right...As the spells converged on him, Dumbledore flicked his wand almost casually, and the sand sprung up in front of him...The sand-creature leaped forward, its paws absorbing the spells as it threw itself, bodily, at the two duelists

This is the very start of the fight and Sirius/Snape come out swinging with fast spells. Dumbledore doesn't dive out of the way OR use an obscure defensive spell, he 1. identifies the spells, 2. determines their speed and trajectory, 3. creates an animated transfiguration that targets the spells, all in what sounds like the blink of an eye. That isn't just theoretical knowledge of the spells, that's years of experience dealing with spells rushing at you (or some incredible natural talent) combined with the knowledge of those specific spells and how they behave.

Dumbledore's casual spell deflection and casting can't just be magical knowledge, his spells have wand movements and focusing that require time - no matter how fast he can think of new spells, he still needs to fit their casting and movement into the tempo of the battle and throughout the fight, HE's the one controlling that tempo.
