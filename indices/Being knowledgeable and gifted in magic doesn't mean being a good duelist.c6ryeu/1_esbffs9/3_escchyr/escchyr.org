I guess we're going to have to disagree on this. Magical dueling is a mental task. But this mental activity is affected by external and internal issues.

Take this hypothetical situation. There's an extremely talented wizard who grows up, goes to Hogwarts and learns everything he can about magic. Later on, he decides to make a career researching and writing about magic. Over the years his theoretical knowledge of magic approaches Dumbledore's. His skills in casting magic is also close to Dumbledore's level.

Now this wizard has never been in a duel before. He doesn't have any experience in using magic for offensive purposes against another person. Doesn't know about dueling strategies or anything like that. Even worse, he's bad in stressful or tense situation. In these situations he has problem casting magic quickly and correctly.

Now, do you really believe this individual can fight on the same level as Dumbledore?

The point of this post was to detangle the idea that magical mastery automatically leads to dueling mastery.

Being able to cast a difficult spell while alone in your room is one thing. Doing it in the middle of a noisy and chaotic battlefield, when you are stressful and panicking, and distracted by the fate of your friends is another thing.

A person who has Dumbledore's level of magical mastery does not necessarily have Dumbledore's experience nor his ability to function in high stress, chaotic environments.
