I don't see how anyone could disagree. No way Hermione, Percy, or any of their classmates can out duel Harry. We also see Hermione struggle somewhat and make terrible decisions in combat. She got frazzled the moment she laid eyes on the Death Eaters in OOTP.

I'd like to add, though, that, regardless of the Harry you write, I'm not reading a story where he's losing duels to people he shouldn't be after like 4th year. And, depending on the way he loses/who he loses to in 2nd and 3rd, that might be a stretch. It's especially absurd when you have a prodigy/studier Harry lose to these people for the sake of drama.

And please stop having him regularly drop/lose his wand. He did that like 3 times in all of canon: CoS, when BCJ stole it, and when Dudley threw him against a wall.
