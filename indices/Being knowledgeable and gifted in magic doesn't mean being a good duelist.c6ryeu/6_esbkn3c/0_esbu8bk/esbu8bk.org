The wizard would casually block the bullets with a shield charm, or some conjured cover, or perhaps just an unbreakable charm on his robes for instant bullet proof armour.\\
He would then win the fight with any spell he chooses.

There are quite a selection of spells which will take someone out if they land even once (from the humble full body bind to the killing curse), all of them merely need to touch the target, or the target's clothing and can be fired off rapidly.

I suppose the gun might win if it's used from afar and the wizard isn't expecting it and he's not the sort of person to routinely wear enchanted clothing or keep a defensive spell active.\\
But that's not guns beating magic, it's just the advantage of a surprise attack.
