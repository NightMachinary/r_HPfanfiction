I'm not really a fan of that logic because my headcanon was that there are more shields than protego and they are meant for different things. Wizards are more durable/heal faster than muggles. Would a stunning charm on a muggle have the same effect as on a wizard? I kinda doubt it. Also take expeliamous for instance. How wide can it be cast? Can it hit multiple targets and leave muggles with no choice but jump away. Wizards have the ability to cast arrests momentum. Could that be made into an enchantment to stop the kinetic energy of the bullets? Obviously it wouldn't be as effective against a wizard.
