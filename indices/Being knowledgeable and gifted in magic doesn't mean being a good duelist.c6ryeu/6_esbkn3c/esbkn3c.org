TBH i've always seen HP magic as an awesome thing from utility and everyday use standpoint, not so much as a good weapon. Sure, you have plethora of curses, hexes, an instakill spell and the power to manipulate environment, but how would wizard fare against a gun? Or many 'magic' or fighting systems from other fiction? In many cases the anwser is 'not well'.

I can completely buy the explanation that most wizards don't even bother with duelling skills - just look at our world and ask yourself how many people outside of the army or law enforcment know how to fight or use weapons in a combat situation.
