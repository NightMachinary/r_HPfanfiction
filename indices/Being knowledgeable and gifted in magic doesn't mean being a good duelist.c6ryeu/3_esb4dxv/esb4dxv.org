Yeh this is one area where I kinda love how vague jkr was with her world building, it doesnt take much to allow hundreds to thousands of new possibilities to exist without being too non canon to be unfamiliar. Olive always headcanoned that there are also a bunch of magic users who are equal to Dumbledore and volds in almost every way but they dont fight in the war just due to how personal and tightly kept it is, like they just dont care that a few Brits are in a cold war as long as they don't bring it outside and risk the statute.
