It would be valid IF this Fleur was canon, which she absolutely isn't. Her character will be very different. I just noticed that my plot summary didn't mention that. So no, Harry and Fleur will get closer directly during fourth year. But for their interactions to be believable after the 4th, I need show how they interact during the year. It's a pain, but it's needed.
