Unfortunately, I don't do evil. I just don't. Among all the antagonists I've written about, I don't think any of them could be considered straight up evil. I think it comes from the fact that I must have the soul of a reincarnated care bear. I don't see evil people, I just see other ideologies and structures that enforce behaviours. So, my deepest apologies, but if you came to read about people being and becoming evil, I'm afraid that you came to the wrong place. My characters aren't good or evil, they're just human. And that's already a lot to deal with. Besides, placing Fleur's actions on a moral compass will be pretty hard. I'm not God. But I'll do my best nonetheless.
