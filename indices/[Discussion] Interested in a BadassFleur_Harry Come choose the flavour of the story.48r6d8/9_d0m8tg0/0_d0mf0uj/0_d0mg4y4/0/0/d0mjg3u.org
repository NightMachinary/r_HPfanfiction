just something to think about but she could easily be evil in plot A, and AFAIK no one's written an evil cursebreaker story (using indegnious peoples as guinea pigs to see if any undetected traps, torturing local holymen/village elders for rumors of locations of forgotten temples, betraying comrades at end of an expedtion to avoid splitting the loot etc)

and if you go plot R please consider turning her into a fallen hero, someone who starts of idealistic but the realities of war/political situation eventually forces her to comprise her ideals and by the end shes as big a tyrant as she once fought against (or not its your story, I just love evil characters!)
