Really? I've never once encountered a REVOLUTION fic. Usually, it's just Harry having fun pranking and fucking up with the Wizengamot, and trying to push forward slightly less biased laws. That's just not a revolution. Then again, I might just as well write Plot A, and in this case, I fervently hope that my adventuring fic lives up to your expectations. Thanks for your opinion!
