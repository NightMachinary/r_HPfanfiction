I remember reading one in which after voldie was defeated in gordocs hallow everyone went really tight on laws. All people who were the children of death esters were terribly oppressed. They Removed slytherin. Any person who the hat proclaimed to be slytherin had their magic taken away i something similar to an electric chair. The entire thing was messed up.

I also remember seeing a dystopia where after Harry took off the invisibility cloak and started fighting v in the last book, v won, and Harry escaped with a few freinds but ginny died.

V was rapidly aging even though he had control of the entire world in just 3 years. He was terrible desperate, and the scene described horrified me I ll try to describe it as best as I can . I won't be able to capture the feeling of horror I got though

In the depths of the department of mysteries, Lord voldemort sat in a room with runes and ritual circles written around in blood and pus.

A queau of h in hundreds and hundreds people stood out the room, and each minute he ordered a new one in. No none knew what was going on there, but they knew no one ever came back out.

Voldemort sacrificed each person to tie himself to life more. He tore his soul again and again and again and again, tying it to ordinary object.s.

He looked even worse than he did in the graveyard.
