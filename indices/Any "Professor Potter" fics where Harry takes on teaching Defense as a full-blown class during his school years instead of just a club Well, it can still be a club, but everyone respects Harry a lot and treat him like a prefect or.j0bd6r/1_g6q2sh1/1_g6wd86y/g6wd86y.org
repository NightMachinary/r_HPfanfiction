I enjoyed it for a while, but I got tired of the several chapter span of "it's not your fault" over and over again. The impression I got was that the story wasn't much about Harry teaching other than providing a backdrop to the salient plotpoints. If you like the more touchy-feely stuff this fic has it. Dumbledore in particular basically becomes a teddy bear of affirming notions and gentle kindness. If you were looking for a more in depth take on the trials and tribulations of /teaching/ though, perhaps look elsewhere. There was a baseline assumption that Harry is good at teaching, which is acceptable, but it then goes to Harry is just given a job as a teacher at the premier wizarding boarding school, Hogwarts.
