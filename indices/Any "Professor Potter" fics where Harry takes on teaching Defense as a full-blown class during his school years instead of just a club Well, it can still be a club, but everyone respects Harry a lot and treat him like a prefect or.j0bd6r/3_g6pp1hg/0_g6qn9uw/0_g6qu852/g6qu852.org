I got to the introduction of the OC, it's not an awful fic, but It wants me to invest into a plot and an insert I'm not ready to invest into. Why have Harry in a relationship with an OC? Why introduce it after setting up the plot as if it was an always thing when the reader had no time at all to expect or accept it?
