I was able to survive two paragraphs.

EDIT: I want to edit this to mention something... this obviously means that I think the story was too poorly written and/or not good enough to spend time reading.

But that doesn't mean that I think no one should read it or enjoy it. Obviously other people are going to have different tastes, and sometimes even a different mood makes something that seems sloppy or poorly done instead feel light-hearted and fun.

Basically, I don't like it. That doesn't mean I think other people are bad, stupid, or wrong if they do, and I think that's something that is often not said around here.
