That Which Holds the Immage is a great crossover with Doctor Who, featuring the Weeping Angels and the Mirror of Erised. I regularly come back to it for a good chill down my spine. It also has a sequel that is abandoned but it can be read standalone.

​

Evil Be Thou My Good is, similarly to the one above, good for a few chills if you feel like it. It's a crossover in which Harry unintentionally unlocks a gate to Hell. You can read it without knowing Hellraiser, I certainly didn't need it.
