The Denarian series probably embodies this best; Harry is a self-described psychopath (although Dumbledore keeps pointing out he's not) who genuinely doesn't care about anyone but himself, and is eventually hired by the Order for the missions that the rest of them simply don't have the balls to do, i.e. assassinations. Harry is rude, cruel and tends to answer violence with fiendfyre.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is the first fic in the series. No knowledge of Dresden Files needed to understand what's going on.
