  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

  Harry and Hermione grew closer after Ron left. And then...that day at Malfoy Manor, Hermione was tortured into a coma. When she wakes, she cannot remember beyond the Horcrux Hunt. Now it's her thirtieth birthday, and Harry visits. Harry, who is married with three children and who cannot forget the seventeen-year-old girl he loved. Dark AU. Tragic Harmony.
