My headcanon has always been the following:

...

*Unspeakables:* Robes contain many hidden compartments with extendable pockets and are lined with armor and enchantments. Each robe comes with a built-in emergency mini one-time use time turner that can go back up to 5 minutes and an emergency port-key. Each robe comes lined with extremely comfortable material like Acromantula silk.

- Regular everyday Unspeakables who go out into the world wear Grey robes (No Trim). This color is low key and they blend in to the world around them.

- High level and secret research Unspeakables wear Black robes (silver trim).

- The Head Unspeakable wears a Silver robe (Black Trim).

--------------

*Healer:* Robes are charmed to clean themselves constantly, and project an aura of calmness about the area. Each contains a hidden strip of pockets where the belt is that contains emergency potions and things like Bezoars

- All healer robes are pure White, but each type of healer has a different color trim on it. So for example, healers dealing with spell damage would have blue trim, while healers dealing with poisoning have green trim.

--------------

*Auror:* Robes are set up very similar to unspeakables but without some of the fancier enchantments and "luxury" aspects like the lining. Auror robes would also contain a variety of hidden holster types for weaponry beyond just a simple wand. They are also cut to allow much easier movement of the wearer and come with things like retractable sleeves.

- Everday Aurors on everyday duties wear lighter Red robes (No trim), like a Crimson or Ruby, or Scarlet.

- HOWEVER, if an Auror (of any level) needs to remain low key or is on some sort of more secretive mission, Red robes can be substituted for pure Black robes (but with red trim marking their station).

- Higher rank Aurors such as ones in command of a unit wear very dark Red robes, like a Burgundy or Maroon, or Rosewood color, with the head Auror's having gold trim.

--------------

*Curse-Breaker:* Robes setup more like a tactical vest system with tons of functionality and pockets. Robes can also retract like an Aurors but to a much greater extent, becoming almost formfitting if need be. Heavily layered with enchantments and each Curse-Breaker is allowed to customize their Robe fairly heavily as needed for their current assignment.

- All base-line Curse-Breaker robes are Moss Green, but charmed with the ability to change color as needed, along with other elements such as thickness and more. As stated, Curse-breakers can customize to a great degree.
