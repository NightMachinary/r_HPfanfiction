I think unspeakables is white. White because it would stand out, which may not be what they go for but shows status? Then curse breakers would be green or purple because the colors remind me of curses, author is plain black and very normal. Authors shouldn't stand out especially in crowded places with potential suspects. Healers would be white I guess I don't know about healers
