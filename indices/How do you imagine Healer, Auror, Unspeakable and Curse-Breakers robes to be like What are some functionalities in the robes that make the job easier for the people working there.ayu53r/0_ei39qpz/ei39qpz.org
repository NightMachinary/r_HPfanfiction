Unspeakables' robes, I expect to look quite a bit like clich√©d mad scientist lab-coats, except black instead of white. They also wear dragonhide gloves made of Hebridean Black hide, identical to the usual black rubber gloves. In terms of practicality, they would, of course, have space-extended pockets and all sorts of protectice spells on them, but any more details than that is strictly classified. As is everything else about the Unspeakables and what they do.

Healers would have clean, white robes; I don't think there's any more to it than that in terms of cut. But they might have some charms on them to protect from contagion and repell bloodstains, perhaps.

Curse-Breaker robes wouldn't be a general category, I feel; going by Bill's example, curse-breakers are pretty eccentric, individualistic fellows. Definitely a lot of protective enchantments, a lot of pockets, a lot of medals and pendants and knicknacks, some of which are cursed, some of which may just be keepsakes from a previous adventure.

Auror robes I have always imagined to be plum-colored --- though a different shade than the ones used on the Wizengamot. My thinking is that at one point the Minister for Magic was /really/ into that color, and made an edict that any and all official Ministry uniforms have to include it somehow, and considering how wizards are with traditions, no one ever seriously tried to have it repealed later. (The Unspeakables don't follow that rule, but they don't follow /any/ rules anyway, and everyone's too creeped off by everything about them to object.) The Aurors just got used to it, and obtained the right to wear a pretty /dark/ shade of plum if nothing else. In terms of functionality, they, too, would be magically toughened, and may even reflect some weaker curses like a weak Shield Charm. A lot of pockets, of course.
