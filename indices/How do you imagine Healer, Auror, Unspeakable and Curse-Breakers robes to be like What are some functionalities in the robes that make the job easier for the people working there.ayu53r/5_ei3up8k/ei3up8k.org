I imagine robes as something which evolved out of something resembling monk's robes, or the kind of clothing that medieval university students were expected to wear.

Something like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Philo_mediev.jpg][this]] or [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Meeting_of_doctors_at_the_university_of_Paris.jpg][this]].

I imagine that healers wear white or blue robes in a modern cut, but that neither unspeakables nor curse-breakers have a standard uniform.

I imagine that the hood has disappeared entirely in modern robes and that they've gone from wool to silk or cotton, with the robes of witches having become something in between a dress and a poncho, with the robes of wizards being distinguished by being slightly longer.
