I imagine healer robes are white and are designed to repel bacteria, blood, etc.

Auror robes I imagine to be a deep red and are absolutely covered in protective charms. I also imagine they have dragon hide as armor as an additional level of protection as well as some kind of wand holster. I also imagine they have extended pockets with different potions they may need.

I imagine cursebreakers to be more individualized and basically just be layered with protective spells as well as extended pockets filled with different magical items they may need.
