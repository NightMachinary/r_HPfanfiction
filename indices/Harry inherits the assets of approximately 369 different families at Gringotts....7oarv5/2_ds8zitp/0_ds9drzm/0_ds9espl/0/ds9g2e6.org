So I'm actually reading through the lists to look for any ideas... I have to ask how Dumbledore magically blocked his knowledge of his heritage (Literally it says Knowledge of Heritage: 95% blocked) and how he is learning all this stuff if he is magically blocked from learning it

edit: oh god reading the will:

To Peter Patrick Pettigrew aka Wormtail we leave 3000000 galleons if he is the one to betray us as he is our secret keeper the following part is void and he is to be locked in an antianimagus cell in azkaban and the key thrown into the deepest sea

Wouldn't that mean that if he betrays them he /doesn't/ get locked up? Actually that could work as an idea; miswriting(or reading) of will causes massive screw up of some sort

Update: somehow he has the locket of slytherin in the slytherin vault. hmm.

oh man he also has "Round Table"

Update again: Theres some magical schools you could use for some background worldbuilding

Another Update: So theres some magical companies I suppose you could use... anyway apparently Harry fired Vernon. And by that I mean he straight up said "Hey, go fire Dursley for embezzlement" with no proof. lmao. I'm not sure if thats legal, but whatever.

Another Update: So apparently families can sell off their children(as slaves, to clarify) and thats OK. Seems legit.

That seems to be all the lists in chapter 1... dare I go forward? nahhh
