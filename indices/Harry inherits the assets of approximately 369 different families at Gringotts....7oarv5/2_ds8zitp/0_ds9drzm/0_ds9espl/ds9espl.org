  ...how on earth did that author sit down and write ~18,000 words of lists.

Look at her profile page; she does it there too. She has pretty much every book she's ever read and every TV show she's ever watched neatly listed and sorted.

Heh, and she has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4zqtX6SH40][Twilight]] in her name.

...Actually...wow. It's amazing that she can write that much, even if it's just lists. It's like, every idea she has, she's neatly jotting down and sorting into its rightful place.

Maybe that's just how she works. She writes an idea, then she writes more, and writes more, without caring how amazing it is literature-wise. Every time she puts down an idea, she includes everything her mind extrapolates from it, without caring for how 'high quality' it is.

Shakespeare it ain't, but who knows, with all the...oh, who am I kidding, there's no world-building in her stuff that isn't Mary Sue World, so, I dunno, see if you can fish an original idea out of those lists and lists of lists.
