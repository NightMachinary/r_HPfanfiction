oh god I remember that... I just skimmed it (and by that I mean i scrolled through it and read about 2 words every few lines. first chapter only) and i have to ask... what even is lord of diagon alley? diagon alley is a shopping district.

edit:also does anyone know how it got so many favs and follows?

Edit again: I went through the reddit thread and I commented about Lord of Diagon Alley back then too... although it was a reply to someone else, and I apparently didn't see that on my first skim through lol (edit: I also commented on the favs and follows. I am a broken record and I don't even know it)
