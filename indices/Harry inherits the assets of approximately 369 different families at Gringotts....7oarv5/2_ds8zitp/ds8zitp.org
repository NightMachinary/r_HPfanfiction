By the way, people, if you're wondering, I was re-reading some of my old posts; I was looking for my musings on how a 'forgive everyone' Dumbledore could make sense ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6de0gy/lf_bad_tropes_done_well/][this thread]]), but I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/77sjo2/recommendation_in_a_sobaditsgood_way_look_at_this/][this terror]] instead, and remembering what the first chapter was /solely/ about inspired me to write this snippet.
