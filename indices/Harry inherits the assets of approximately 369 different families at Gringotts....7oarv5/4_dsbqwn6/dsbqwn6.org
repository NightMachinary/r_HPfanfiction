I'm sure you'll agree this rewrite I just decided to write is much better than the original.

*At Gringotts*

Harry looked down at the list, "I've inherited the entire estates of...all of these?"

Breaknut the goblin nodded, his thick fingers twitching ever so slightly.

The Boy-Who-Lived's emerald orbs slowly widened as he went down the list a second time, mentally counting up the net assets, "That...this...this is more money than exists in...the whole of Europe, I think! Am I like the richest wizard in the world now?"

Breaknut reached for a thick folder and opened it up, leafing through it before looking up at the raven haired boy and shaking his head.

The Boy-Who-Lived tilted his head, "No? But this is several billions of galleons, added all up..."

"I'm afraid that list only lists the gross assets of each estate you have acquired, Lord-times-52-and-two-thirds Potter. Taken individually." Breaknut said with a slight smile, "Adjusting entries for consolidation and gross liabilities still need to be taken into account."

The raven haired lord suddenly shivered-

"None of that," Breaknut said sharply, "This isn't the fic where Gringotts is horribly corrupt and impoverishing all the muggle-raised with inheritance scams! A pox on those!"

Harry's Avada Kedavra colored orbs still looked nervous.

"I assure you that all of the fees you needed to pay have already been handled without complication, and all of the accounts you have inherited are entirely solvent." Breaknut continued.

The Raven started to relax a little.

"Now let's see..." Breaknut shuffled his papers again...

*Several hours later...*

"And if we offset this contractually owed compensation from the LeStranges to the Blacks against the debt owed to the LeStranges by the Blacks, with an adjustment for the profit-sharing arrangement...we are done!"

The young lord woke up with a start and refocused his emerald orbs on the goblin in front of him.

Looking at the young wizard with a wide grin, Crushjewel (who had swapped places with Breaknut once the former goblin started getting exhausted) pushed a balance statement over the table, "I am glad to report, Lord-52-and-two-thirds Potter, that all of your outstanding debts have been consolidated and offset against assets, all of your property has been revalued correctly, and all goodwill has been accounted for."

The raven haired wizard looked enthusiastic, "Great!...How much do I have now?"

Crushjewel leaned forward slightly, looking at the balance sheet again, before he reached into the desk and counted out one, two, three...half a dozen silver sickles, before pushing them towards The Boy-Who-Lived.
