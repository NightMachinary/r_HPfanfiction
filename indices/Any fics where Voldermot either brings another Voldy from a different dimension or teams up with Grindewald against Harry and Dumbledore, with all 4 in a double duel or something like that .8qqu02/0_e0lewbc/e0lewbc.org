Something sort of like this happens in linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane), though its not Grindelwald and it happens at the very end. Yes, there is a four-way throwdown.

In linkffn(Realignment), as a minor spoiler Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and MoD!Harry duel in the Ministry of Magic (after Dumbledore and Harry solo-dueled for a while), before Tom gets in on the action. If you think it sounds awesome, you're setting your standards too low.

Also, linkffn(Para Bellum), sequel to Delenda Est, sort of has the Voldemort from one dimension travelling to the dimension of another (its complicated).
