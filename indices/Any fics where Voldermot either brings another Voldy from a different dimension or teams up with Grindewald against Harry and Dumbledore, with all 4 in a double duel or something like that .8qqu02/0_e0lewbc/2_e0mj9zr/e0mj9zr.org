Realignment sounds extremely interesting, I've seen it mentioned a couple of times before, but the summary doesn't explain all that much.

Sadly, I could'nt read more than a few of Magicks of the Arcane before I got annoyed and bored, dunno why, but I just didn't like Harry. It tries to be funny at times when the whole premise screams for a somber tone. I'm probably just not a fan of the humor of the author.

Para Bellum wasn't all that interesting when I started reading right after I read DE, so I stopped like 2 chapters in. Thanks for the suggestions.
