Here is a short summary for Realignment:

Imagine if the T-700 got sent back in time to kill John Connor, but John had the T-1000 to protect him. Now replace Harry, Tom Riddle, and Dumbledore with those respectively, and that is the main premise of this fic. The disruption and mentorship of Dumbledore begins to change Tom, and in a fairly believable way: he still wants power, but he sees that the power Dumbledore wields is so far above anything he had dreamt of. Bonus: the T-X in that metaphor is Grindelwald.

Magicks of the Arcane...I think I said my piece in the library post, so I will just offer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/27/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this chapter]] for you to decide whether reading is worth it.

Para Bellum, honestly, seems to have building to something more interesting than its predecessor, before it died a quiet death.
