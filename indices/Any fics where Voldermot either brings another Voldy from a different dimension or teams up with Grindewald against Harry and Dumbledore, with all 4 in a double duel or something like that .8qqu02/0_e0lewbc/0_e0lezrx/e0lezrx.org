Yeah, Para Bellum looked like it was gearing up for that, but it didn't get all that far, and looks abandoned now.

You might be interested in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel) and its sequel; also incomplete, but with a reasonable chance of being continued down the track. Voldemort teams up with several Dark Lords/Ladies from around the world.
