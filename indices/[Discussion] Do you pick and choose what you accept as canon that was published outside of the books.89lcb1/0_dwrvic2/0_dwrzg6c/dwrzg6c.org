Yeah, I really don't see Hermione as the Minister. In my stories, she works in the Department of Law. Then she retires from the Ministry sometime around 2010 to become either the Muggle Studies or Charms teacher (I still haven't decided, so it's ambiguous), and after that she becomes the Headmistress, because true change starts with the children. (Oh and Neville is the Deputy.)
