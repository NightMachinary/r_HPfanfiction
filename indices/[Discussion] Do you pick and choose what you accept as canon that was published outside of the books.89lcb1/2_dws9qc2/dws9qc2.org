Generally I accept that anything Rowling says is canon, assuming it doesn't contradict itself and then adopt whatever headcanons necessary to make it fit in my mind. Fanfics need not stick to canon though. I don't mind if fanfics get details wrong, especially if they're working outside book canon. It's not like I know all those minor details either. I still don't know how old Bill and Charlie Weasley are and there isn't consensus in the fics I've read either.
