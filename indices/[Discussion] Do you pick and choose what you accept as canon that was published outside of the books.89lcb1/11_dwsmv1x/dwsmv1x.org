Well, just in general I consider the books, word of God and Pottermore to be canon. But as for what I do when writing, I simply take what I want or need because slavish adherence to all things canon isn't really my thing. Like I never knew (nor even thought) about things like the identity of Harry's grandparents until I got into fanfiction. So it was never going to be a hindrance to me that I wanted to make Dorea Harry's grandmother - unlike canon - given I wanted to tie him to the Blacks in my story.
