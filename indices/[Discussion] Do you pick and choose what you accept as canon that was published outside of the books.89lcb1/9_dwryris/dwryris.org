Canon goes: primary media (books for Harry Potter, comics for Marvel, TV shows for Star Trek, movies for Star Wars), adaptations, official promotional material (Pottermore for example), and lastly word of God (tweets, interviews, and so forth). If it isn't in the books, it can safely be ignored, if it contridicts the books it isn't canon. The movies have a special movie!canon and fics/fanart using that should be labeled as such. If a writer wants to change their work they need to do so in the primary media or its just a fancy head canon.
