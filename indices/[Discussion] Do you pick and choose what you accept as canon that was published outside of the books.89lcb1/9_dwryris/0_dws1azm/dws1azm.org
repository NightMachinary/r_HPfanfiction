I Don't think your example works for Marvel, they specifically tell you that the Movie!cannon is different from Comic!cannon (Thus Marvel Cinematic Universe). And as to the Comics, they have multiple "universe" themselves, specifically spelled out.

As for Potterverse, for me, I ignore books 6 and 7 for the most part, and insert parts of different fan fics to suit my needs, even though that sometimes contradicts my cannon.
