It really doesn't matter much because most of what I write is AU. Sometimes it is a small change, like Andromeda being the oldest sister, sometimes it is a bigger change, like disregarding the entirety of the canon plot past the beginning of the story. Deciding which bits of canon to use depends on what I'm writing. "No longer alone" is a GoF story, and none of the changes I made will stop the Tournament, hence there's the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But "Dawn of Darkness" is a complete canon divergence, so the HBP plot is useless for me.

I see fanfiction as playing in a sandbox. Most of the time, you are building a castle, but once in a while, building a submerged Harbour in a tunnel network is what you want.
