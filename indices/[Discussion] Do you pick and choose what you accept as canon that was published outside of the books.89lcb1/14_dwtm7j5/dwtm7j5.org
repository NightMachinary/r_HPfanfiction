Like in Visual Novels, I like to thing that the story can diverge into multiple parallel worlds, thus everything can be considered canon at the same time. For example, the movies are canon just like the books are, only that you have to consider the books are placed in a higher stand by some people since they were written first and everything comes from them, still, you can takes things from the movie and add them to your story as long as they don't contradict any information that your story already has.
