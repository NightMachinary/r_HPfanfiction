I accept Pottermore, JKR interviews/Tweets, and other extended content as canon-optional. As in, if I'm trying to figure out a thing from the books, be it family tree or the history of the Goblin Rebellions, I consider all potential sources of information, including stuff that could be considered apocrypha, like text on the game cards. Then, I use what's useful and ignore the rest, though I absolutely weigh what's in Books 1-7 far more heavily than the extended content.

I see no reason to amend your headcanon for Harry's family tree, since nothing in books 1-7 directly contradicts it. If you end up writing your headcanon, all it takes is a disclaimer that you're disregarding Cursed Child & Pottermore to forestall any complaints.

My headcanon is that Snape faked his death, and nothing, not even JKR can convince me otherwise :D
