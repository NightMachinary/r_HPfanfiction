If Charlus had a son, wouldn't you think we'd know about it unless the 2 lost contact? I'd just imagining a slightly older (about 1-2 years) American cousin who "deals" with Dudley (read: knocks him out cold) after both father and son make the discovery that James and Lily are dead and go to England to investigate where Harry is.

After reading the stuff for Pottermore, it soer of makes sense with the naming.
