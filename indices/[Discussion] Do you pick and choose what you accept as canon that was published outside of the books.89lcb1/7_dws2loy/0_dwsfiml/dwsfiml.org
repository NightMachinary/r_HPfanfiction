  In any case, there is not a lot of worldbuilding in Cursed Child so its canon status is not really so important.

Not much in the way of quantity, perhaps, but what facts we do learn are pretty major. The Greengrass Blood Curse, the existence of Delphini, the New Time-Turners, Nott as a magical genius, Lucius dying relatively young, Hermione as Minister, and, heck, the personalities of the Next-Gen, all that seems pretty important.
