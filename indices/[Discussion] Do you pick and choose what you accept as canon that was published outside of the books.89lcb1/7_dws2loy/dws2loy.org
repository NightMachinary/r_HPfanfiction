FYI Charlus and Dorea were never James' parents. JKR had said years before that James parents were "old by wizarding standards" when James was born, so Charlus and Dorea never fit the bill. Thone who believed that they were simply were wrong, even before the publication of Fleamont and Euphemia.

Anyway, my rules of canon are as follows:

Firstly, that JK Rowling is the only source of canon. Secondly, that officially released materials have greater authority than informal comments. Thirdly, that the written word has priority over other media such as movies. Fourthly, that materials embedded within a story have greater authority than commentary. This produces a hierarchy of canon as follows:

1. The original 7 Harry Potter books.

2. The side books (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Quidditch through the Ages, and Tales of Beedle the Bard).

3. Pottermore and JK Rowling's old website (accessible via the Way Back Machine).

4. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (movie script).

5. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (play script).

6. Merchandise materials created by JK Rowling herself, such as the Chocolate Frog cards.

7. JK Rowling interviews, tweets, and other informal statements.

The original Harry Potter movies are not considered canon here, as they frequently directly contradict the prime source of canon (the original 7 books) and they are also not written by JK Rowling. Also not considered canon are video games and merchandise not created by JK Rowling.

A word must be said about The Cursed Child. JK Rowling has stated that she considers this canon, but we must account for its nature as a play. There are certain aspects of the format which make it problematic. Over time the cast will change, as will staging decisions. These therefore cannot be considered canonical. Furthermore, we must consider theatrical licence. For example, during Harry and Draco's duel in Cursed Child, each one pauses to allow the other to cast their next spell. This is obviously not how duels happen in the books, nor how two people fighting would realistically act. It is a writing decision driven by the desire to show off the clever special effects on stage: the audience has time to appreciate the effect of each spell before the duelists move on to the next. This is fine for the stage, but it makes The Cursed Child's status as canon difficult. The position I adopt, therefore, is that we can take the broad strokes of Cursed Child as canon (such as the fact that a new type of Time Turner was invented with different effects from those in Prisoner of Azkaban), but that we cannot rely on the fine detail. In any case, there is not a lot of worldbuilding in Cursed Child so its canon status is not really so important.
