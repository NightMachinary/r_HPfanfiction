Eh, I don't even stop at the books for what I dismiss as canon (sounds like you're talking about Headcanon there). For example Ron speaking Parseltongue is just ridiculous, so I just imaging him bringing a magical Walkman or something.

Objectively of course everything from the Books and Pottermore is canon. Not sure if I'd draw the line at interviews as someone else mentioned, since to me it's all about Word of God.
