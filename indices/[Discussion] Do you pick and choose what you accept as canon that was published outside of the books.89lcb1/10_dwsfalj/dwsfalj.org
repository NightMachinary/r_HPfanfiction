As plenty of people said, people will do what they want, but overall I'm in precisely the same line as the Wiki: the books and companions (so the textbooks and /Fantastic Beasts/), followed by Rowling-based info (interviews, tweets, website, /Pottermore/), constitute the primary canon, and everything else is canon as long as it doesn't contradict that, be it films, video games, non-Rowling /Pottermore/, etc. I consider it a fun challenge to work all the minor film or game info into a story, for instance, like when I featured Alizors in my story.
