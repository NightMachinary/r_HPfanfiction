It's a fic title. I read it a few months ago, but basically a few years into the future following Voldemort's canon defeat (but ignoring the epilogue/any Pottermore-provided nonsense) there are a series of violent tragedies. A small child (named Aurelian) is sent back in time by his desperate mother to give him a chance at a normal life and give her past self and her friends time to save the day. It was interesting.
