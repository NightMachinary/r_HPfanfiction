Im pretty sure this one fits. Its denuleos and the lone traveler series, one of his earlier works.

Instead of going around and fixing everything in this particular universe, he only fixes most of it. Voldemort is removed and serius is freed as well as /all/ of the horcruxes.

After that, he leaves a letter for younger Harry and calls it a day. I never finished reading it because denuelos' stuff can be pretty over the top, and i didnt rwally find a story with all the major conflicts removed to be interesting.

However, it does go into detail the results of the letter and therefore fits your criteria.
