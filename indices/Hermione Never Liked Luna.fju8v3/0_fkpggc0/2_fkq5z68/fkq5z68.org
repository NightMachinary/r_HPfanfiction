  I never understood why Hermione was generally seen as open minded

I think that visual stimulus like movies sticks out more in a person's memory than say lines from a book. So some people over time begin to merge book characters and the actors who played them. And I think Emma Watson is some kind of an activist and feminist and people still associate her with Hermione.

As to your original point- some women are just jealous of prettier/ better dressed women. Nothing you can do about it. It's pretty realistic that teenage girls would dislike an older, prettier and foreign woman. As for Molly- no one is ever going to be good enough for her boys. And she did come to accept Fleur after Bill was wounded.
