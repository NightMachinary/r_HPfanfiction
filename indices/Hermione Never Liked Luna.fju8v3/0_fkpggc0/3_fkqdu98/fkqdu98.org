My absolute pet peeves about Fleur's portrayal are that:

a) She, like Lavender, disappears from the narrative after accepting Bill in HBP. Of course, it's fantastic that she does accept Bill and I actually like that they showed her unconditional love for him. However, Lupin has a prominent role in books 5-7 and is an Ascended Extra. Not only does he get away with not taking his Wolfsbane, he's actually included in important missions.

Granted, this might be due to length constraints because Bill himself barely appears in DH.

b) Snape's near-obsessive love for Lily is fundamentally unrealistic, but the narrative paints it as not only ‘noble' but fairytale. It would have us believe Snape's redemption springs from his love for a childhood friend, rather than, say, from any internal conviction that the DEs and their methods are heinous. A more realistic Snape might still be a bully (and this too is something I've seen contested in some corners of the fandom). But he wouldn't be the antisocial, ‘mad scientist' stereotype, pining over Lily.

My point is, male characters are /allowed/ to show negative emotions (anger, fear, sadness), and they are often seen as ‘broken birds'. If Bill had died and Fleur had pulled a Snape or if Snape and Lily's genders had been reversed - I can guarantee you we would have heard about how so-and-so ‘has gone mad, and now she's a recluse'. For a female Snape, there would have been no redemptive arc.

I really like how Tamora Pierce portrays Alan of Trebond (Alanna and Thom's father) as grieving his wife. Even in the few pages we glimpse of him, he's shown as being utterly indifferent to his children, to the point of not realising that one of them is masquerading as the opposite gender.

Although a bit exaggerated, that's a much more realistic portrayal of what that sort of grief does to you.

Sorry, tangent, but it ties in to the discussion below.
