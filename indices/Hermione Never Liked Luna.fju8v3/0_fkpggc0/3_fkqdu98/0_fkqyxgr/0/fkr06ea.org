Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent about Snape there.

But I meant that if a female character had an extreme reaction like pining for fifteen years, the narrative would be more likely to portray her as negative rather than a hero or a ‘broken bird' character. Whereas JKR clearly wants us to see Snape as this redeemed figure, purely because of his love for Lily. In some sense, I can understand fandom's reaction to Snape as a ‘stalker', because his degree of obsession is not a healthy one. In real life, only serial killers and stalkers obsess over people as long and as hard as he has over an ex. I am not saying he /is/ a stalker, but that his obsessing over L. is at odds both with his tenacity as a double agent and with the idea that such a love is ‘pure and redemptive' (as opposed to creepy).

/Either/ Snape should be a well-adjusted man (sure, maybe with some tendencies towards favouritism, if you like) and the redemptive hero and double agent. /Or/ JKR should have gone the whole hog and made him absolutely, creepily, memento-collectingly obsessed over Lily. Instead she's trying to have her cake and eat it too. She's trying to say obsession = redemption = true pure love.

Another tangent about Snape, sorry. But my point is, a female equivalent of Snape would never have this push-pull. She would simply not be in the narrative at all due to her gender.

I'm just using Snape as an example. To quote myself from another comment elsewhere:

  It's true in most pop culture. Men's anger, sadness and suffering (in fiction!) can be imposing, intimidating and atmospheric in a way women's is not necessarily allowed to be. This is why I love Alan Rickman's Snape - he pulls off a dark, brooding, even melancholy sort of character that is very compelling. And... there is a romantic, gothic quality about these male characters that is consistently absent in female characters. I feel that particularly because of the female readership of some of these books, there is a strong desire to love, fix or comfort a man who acts in such a way; the character is admired, held up as an Iron Woobie or Broken Bird character. There may be an element of identification with the character in their loneliness/pain/misery.

  I can think of several male characters the fandom perceives like this. There's Snape, for one, and Lupin for another (from the first introduction, he's quiet, soft-spoken, obviously poor, obviously suffering). Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is another example, and John Watson from the same series is probably a third. Tobias from the Animorphs also qualifies (yes, let's ignore the fact that he's thirteen in the books: he still has Woobie elements for me, at least).

  Male characters are allowed the space for vulnerability (anger counts). For me, at least, there is a sense that these male characters are justified in their suffering, that it ennobles them. In contrast, the female characters are rarely allowed to indulge emotions that tend towards the romantic-tragic/Keatsian. Lupin's outward softness masks a horrific monster, and yet readers feel sympathy for him.

  Snape is all crunchy shell and gooey interior (Aww, look, he and Lily really did love each other), as is Sirius. In PoA the latter is almost skeletal and more than a little mentally unstable; by OotP he is the lovable prankster and quasi-father figure whom Harry grieves so much. He's not father of the year, but he's at least functional. Both James and Neville develop offscreen (in James' case, it isn't known whether he matured at all - as Terri & others have pointed out, for all Lily knew, he could've been a complete pillock behind Lily's back).

  By contrast Millicent, Fleur, Luna and Pansy don't undergo development, not even “pastede on yay” development.

  Imagine if Fleur Delacour had broken down and become a recluse after Bill had been attacked at the end of HBP (or perhaps if Bill had died) --- if she had harboured a quiet, simmering, brooding rage and sought revenge by retreating to France and planning for thirteen years. (Imagine, in other words, if she'd come over all Snape-ish.) I'm quite sure it would've been treated by other characters as irrational: either part of her innate Veela magic, or as a woman refusing to listen to reason. She wouldn't have been a DE spy, she would've vanished from the story.

  Instead JKR has her protest - to Molly! - that she doesn't care about Bill's disability and wants to stay with him. Which is a great testament to her loyalty considering how catty the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione have all been towards her. I actually like that JKR included this scene and it's a fine example of how she really does love Bill, but she isn't, as you say, allowed to show us any aspect of her emotions other than tears and loyalty/acceptance. Perhaps because of Harry's POV, we don't get a full sense of her grieving process. And we don't see her and Bill again until Harry does.

  We aren't even told whether Lavender is alive or dead after being bitten. Yet Lupin is front & centre in PoA, and prominent in HBP and DH.
