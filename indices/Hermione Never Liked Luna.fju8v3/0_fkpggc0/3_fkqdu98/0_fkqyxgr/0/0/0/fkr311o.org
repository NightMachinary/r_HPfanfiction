Byronic is the word I was after (I kept thinking of â€˜gothic', for some reason).

And yes, absolutely. I've read some Charity Burba- okay, one Charity Burbage fic that sort of portrays her like this, but you're right that Byronic heroines are quite scarce.

I mean, look at Trelawney. Her alcoholism is almost played for laughs. Not saying she's a gothic character, but like you said... everyone would feel sorrier if it was someone like Lupin.
