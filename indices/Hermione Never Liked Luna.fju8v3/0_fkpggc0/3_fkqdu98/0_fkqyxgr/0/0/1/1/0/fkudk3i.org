Salander is a complicated character for sure. She is definitely very dark, but it's rare to see female characters who are alienated from society and aren't kind/friendly/nurturing, so I thought she was pretty intriguing.

Jessica Jones is a show produced by Netflix about the Marvel character. In a nutshell, it's about a private investigator with superhuman strength who's being stalked by an abusive ex with mind-control powers. She doesn't go as dark as Salander, but she has a lot of issues typical of male detective characters (alcoholism, unhappy romantic life, family issues, etc). It's a great show and definitely worth checking out! It does cover a number of potentially upsetting topics and I don't remember them all, so it may be worth looking up a summary beforehand.
