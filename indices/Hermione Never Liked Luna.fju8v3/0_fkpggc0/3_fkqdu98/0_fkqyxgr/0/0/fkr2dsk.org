Now that is very interesting. I remember someone asking somewhere if there's such a thing as a byronic heroin. Everyone then tried to look for one. I think this was what I sort of wanted in HP as well. Rowling's men are complex and damaged in the way women aren't, at least in my view. But now that you brought up their emotions, I think my desire would have ended up mascarading as an irrational lady that doesn't listen to reason. I saw readers of one novel complaining that a lady who was shown as rather depressed and turning to alcohol was very weak and they had no patience with her. So if this happened to be a man, wouldn't everyone be like oh my, poor guy.
