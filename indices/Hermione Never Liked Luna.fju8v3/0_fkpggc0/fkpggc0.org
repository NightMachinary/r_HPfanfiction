Yes, and did you notice how much hate there was for Fleur? When I was reading the books I was shocked by the nasty comments being made by Hermione, Ginny and Molly! And they were just included in the narrative like they were no big deal.

I never understood why Hermione was generally seen as open minded when there have been several instances that showed her disdain for those different from her, like her dorm mates, Firenze, Luna and Fleur.

Hermione is a great character, but she has her flaws, and I wouldn't label her as open minded considering her tendency for intellectual elitism.
