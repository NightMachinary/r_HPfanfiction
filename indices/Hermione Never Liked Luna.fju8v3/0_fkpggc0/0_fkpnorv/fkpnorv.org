Possibly unpopular opinion but JK Rowling doesn't know how to write well rounded women/girl characters there is very little nuance and such disdain for anyone who likes something that Hermione considers beneath herself (makeup/divination/magical creatures). I mean you've got a whole magical world and you can't accept that maybe there are magical creatures that you don't know about?
