That... makes a well-rounded character. Characters have to have flaws. So many people try to write feminist works but make the mistake of having their characters be flawless goddesses who are only held back by the actions of others. Hermione is more relatable for being a bit intolerant and petty. Even the way she tries to help the House Elves doesn't really take into account what they want. She'd have been better served talking to them, understanding their culture and trying to convince them that universal, inalienable rights ought to apply to them as well, but that would be a boring route to take for a children's mystery series, so instead she knits and fucks up.
