Looking back Lavender /did/ come on a bit strong but for years now I've thought that (at the end of the day) she and Ron would have been happier together - she so clearly loved the dude he was and praised him for being Ron while meanwhile all /he/ ever wanted was someone who saw him /first/.

I mean in the epilogue he's bragging about using magic to confound the driving instructor - if /my/ wife had to take away her (muggle) parents memories to survive a war I don't know that I would /ever/ be that caviler about confounding a muggle and especially not for something so stupid.
