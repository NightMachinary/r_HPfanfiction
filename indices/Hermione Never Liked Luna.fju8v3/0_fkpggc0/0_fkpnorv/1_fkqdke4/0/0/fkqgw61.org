what annoys me about Lavander's portrayal is that all of this was done just to show Hermione was the one right for Ron and the one he liked. But after reading scenes with her, it's difficult to imagine that someone could actually like her. The whole thing was so over the top. I was a teenager when I read it and still foundit embarrassing. Was it really necessary to write her like that just to prove a point? Had this been in a fanfic, I don't think people would say it was well-done.
