I think I just can't get into this pairing. I don't consider arguing a good basis for a relationship and opposites attract was never my thing. I also dislike the feeling I get in canon that it's Ron who has to become worthy of Hermione. Hermione doesn't seem to change somehow. I think I almost dislike the paring on principle as it has all the things I dislike. I might read a short fic one day, though.
