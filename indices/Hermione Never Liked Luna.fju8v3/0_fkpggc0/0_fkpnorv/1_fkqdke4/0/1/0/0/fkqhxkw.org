I'd love to know this, too. Everyone is oh opposites attract, but it's not like this means you have to be from two completely different planets. For some reason with Harry and Ginny it's all about shared things and they are soulmates according to Rowling. But when she pairs up two completely different characters, I'm left wondering just how they even get along and what they talk about.
