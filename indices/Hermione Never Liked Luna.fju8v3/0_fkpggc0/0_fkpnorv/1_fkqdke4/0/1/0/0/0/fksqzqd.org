They're stubborn people who like arguing. I'm not sure that's a basis for a healthy relationship, but it strikes me that the major downside people offer to their relationship is, for them, a good thing. I mean, Ron supports a team that is laughably bad, I'm not sure he has too much issue with someone not liking the sport since even amongst people who love it his stance is going to lead to arguments.

And it's not like Ron disagrees with Hermione politically... he's just not as intense or thinks she's going too far (SPEW vs Can't Ask them to fight for us or whatever it is he says).

Maybe check out a Romione fuff fic? I've read a few myself... they're not my thing. Not because I don't like Romione but because they're not Hinny. I'm sure someone will have had a vision of Romione that makes more sense for you. Starfox5's versions of Ron and Hermione (in very non canon fics) are one of the big reasons I drifted from Harmony, for example.
