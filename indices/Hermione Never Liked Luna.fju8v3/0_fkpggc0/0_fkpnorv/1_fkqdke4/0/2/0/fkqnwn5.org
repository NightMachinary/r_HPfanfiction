Ha, whatever do you mean lol. Really though I made the distinction because even “blood traitors” like the Weasleys seem to think of non magical people as being a bit less? Like the fact that they've got a squib cousin that's an accountant but they never speak to him - I mean, sure, maybe he's a jerk but its weird that he's just dismissed like that (forever sad that JK didn't follow through with having that cousins daughter show up in book 4)
