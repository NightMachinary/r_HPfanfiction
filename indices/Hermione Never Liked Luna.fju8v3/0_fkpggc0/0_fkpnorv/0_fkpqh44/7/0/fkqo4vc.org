This is actually the worst one for me. I noticed it because at the beginning of OotP when the Dursley want to kick out Harry, and Petunia received Dumbledore's howler to remind her he /needs/ to stay, she makes the decision and Vernon is shocked and they fight for a while after they send the kids (Harry and Dudley) upstairs. The argument between Vernon and Petunia shows us how rare it was for her to make this.sort of decisions.
