If you recall your Greek mythology, Alecto is one of the Erinyes (Furies), which you would then recognise right away as feminine. Amycus is apparently another Greek name (Amykos), though Latinised. He was a king that according to Wikipedia was brave and challenged men to box against him so he could kill him. Not sure how that's brave and not rather bloodthirsty, but so it's written. There's not much about him though.
