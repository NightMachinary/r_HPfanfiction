Definetely. Rowling doesn't seem to know how to write a good relationship between two female characters. Lily is done /so/ wrong, her parents are never mentioned and the only friend is Snape, and apparently her future husband's friends. Awful. She pprtrays the male-female friendship very well and gives several of them an important role, but she seems to think women can't be good friends to each other. The treatment of Fleur (by her classmates during the Tri Wizard Tournament and Molly, Ginny and Hermione later) is appalling and unnecessary.
