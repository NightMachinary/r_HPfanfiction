Yeah. I am re reading (listening actually) all of the books for the first time in years, and most if not all female characters are lacking. I hate how all the mothers in the story (Molly, Aunt Petunia, Narcissa Malfoy, Alice Longbottom, and even Lily Evans) are mainly /only/ mothers. Molly doesn't go to the Quidditch world cup, and is always in charge of anything to do with the kids before than the Order of the Phoenix; Aunt Petunia always defers to Vernon to decide things that involve Harry even though he is actually /her/ nephew and not his; Narcissa isn't a Death Eater, only Lucius is (the only female Death Eater is Bellatrix); it is never stated that Alice Longbottom is an Auror, Frank most certainly is and is called that during Barty Crouch Jr.'s trial, but Alice is only refered to as his wife; and when Lily and James' spirits come out of Voldemort's wand, it is James that tells Harry what to do and how to escape, Lily is just a comfort for Harry (typical motherly presence) but it doesn't say or so much really.

Jk Rowling's view of women and their part and role in society is very narrow indeed.
