IIRC, Arthur says that Ludo Bagman got him the tickets for helping Ludo out of a jam (which, hahaha, seems a little quid pro quoish) but because it's Bagman I have to think he mentioned “young Harry Potter” when he gave them the tickets and that's why they got so many - if anything it seems like Hermione was the “extra” It's also entirely possible that Molly doesn't care about quidditch /that/ much but she's hardly the type to let the family fend for themselves without her for an undetermined time...
