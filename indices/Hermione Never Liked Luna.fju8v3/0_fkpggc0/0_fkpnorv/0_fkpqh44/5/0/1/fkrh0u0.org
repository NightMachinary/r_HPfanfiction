If she was really good enough to beat Bellatrix then why was she not in any of the fights before this. I would have loved seeing her in DOM taking DE down. Remember that the Order got curb stomped in that fight. Bellatrix took Tonks and Kingsley like it was no problem and killed Sirius. Moody got taken down by Dolohov. It would have helped having a Bellatrix level witch in the fight.
