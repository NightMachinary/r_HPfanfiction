I loved that scene when Molly kills Bella, and I was super happy about. But from a literary stand point it seems forced, there is no build up to it. There is no indication what so ever that Molly is a good enough dueler (ok, thia might not be an actual word) to fight someone like Bellatrix. Either Molly was able to fight her so well because she was defending her daughter (once again being a mother more than anything else), or she is actually a really good witch, with special talent, that she chooses to completely ignore for years and years to take care of her family. The last option is valid as long as that sacrifice is explored in the story, but the character is never shown to have any conflicting thoughts or feelings about it, which reinforces that whole stereotype of a woman giving up everything to be a wife and mother and loving it too!
