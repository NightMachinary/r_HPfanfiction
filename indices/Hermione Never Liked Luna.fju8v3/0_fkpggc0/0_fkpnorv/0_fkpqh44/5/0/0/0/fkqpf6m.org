It is obvious she wrote the Molly-Bella duel to prove something, and that is always the wrong choice as a writer. I don't mind Molly being a stay at home mom (I am one), but she shows no interests or activities or indeed friendships outside of it. That's just awful. For me it was the Quidditch World Cup the thing that stood out the most. Why doesn't Molly attend as well? She doesn't like Quidditch even? Her whole family plays it, and is a fan and she has no interest in going to the World Cup?! Come on! Hermione goes and is invited and she is always remarked to be uninterested in Quidditch. Arthur got the tickets as a favor from Bagman and he didn't count his wife? Instead Molly goes to Diagon Alley to buy everyone's books for Hogwarts. Was that really necessary? She stays home even in a case like this? Rubbish, as Ron would say.
