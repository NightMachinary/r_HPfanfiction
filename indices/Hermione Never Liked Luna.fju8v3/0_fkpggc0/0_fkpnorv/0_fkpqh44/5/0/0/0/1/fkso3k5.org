When I look at fanfic Mollys I notice, I guess, three things (not necessarily/usually in the same fic):

1. she's presented as having wanted a girly daughter... which Ginny isn't
2. she's an ex-chaser herself... I want to say she got badly injured, but I don't think that's in there
3. she's either a complete prude who hates closed doors or is best described as "moar grandchildren"

I'm not sure where the first part of 3 comes from but it's so common (even in highly canon compliant fics) that I must have forgotten something important. But either way, we're given an interpretation for Molly's actions. On one hand, she spends the time trying to ensure no hanky-panky happens and, on the other, she convinces Ron to have Hermione come along as some sort of grandplan. Not very compelling arguments, I think you'll agree.

With the second point... I guess watching Quidditch is too emotionally painful if we go with the injury thing.

With the first point... under this interpretation, Molly actively disagrees that Quidditch is for girls (whereas Hermione merely is not into Quidditch) and encourages the boys to /not/ let Ginny play with them. She lets Ginny go because while she has this incredibly sexist opinion, she also doesn't want to stifle her children (given their limited opportunities due to the family's financial means).

The only other argument I can propose is that money was especially tight that year due to the whole dress robes problem and finding the money/stretching it out was an even bigger issue than buying all the Lockhart books.

I'm not saying I agree with these ideas... although I'm pretty sure Rowling was tired of Diagon Alley scenes and just used Molly's not attending to avoid writing one/create Ron's surprise at the Dress Robes... but, yeah. I guess the last explanation is pretty much exactly [[/u/Amata69][u/Amata69]]'s point about the barbecue.
