And it actually amused me that Rowling thought she had to prove Molly was cool as I had no problem wiht her being a mother as I assumed this was what she wanted to do. It would have been nice if this had been explored but I feel like Molly would have to justify her choice somehow while Amelia Bones wouldn't be asked why she has no kids or is unmarried. I disliked Rowling's choice, actually, as it was out of the blue and as it felt like she was desperately trying to prove something to someone.
