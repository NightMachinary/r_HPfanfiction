I completely agree, but I wanted to mention that Neville's grandmother says Alice was an auror. When the kids visited Arthur in the hospital and they ran into Lockhart.

But yeah.

With Molly, we only see her in action against Bellatrix. In the final battle. I think it would've been cooler though if Molly stayed behind with Teddy and Andromeda Tonks was the one to kill Bellatrix! Like the Molly, stay at home mother, couldn't even cover Tonks' night shift of prophecy watching? Arthur went and did it after his full day of work.

The only real time Narcissa did much was lie to Voldemort about Harry. So that's gotta take some serious oclumency skills, but still. We do see in Half-Blood Prince that Bellatrix doesn't want to mess with her too much.

Aunt Petunia does leave things to Vernon, but I think that's more to show a different between Lily and Petunia. Lily stood up to James as a teen, and we can assume she would do it as an adult too. And while we know that Vernon didn't want to upset Petunia by mentioning Harry in the beginning of book 1, it seems that Petunia becomes very submissive to Vernon as the years went by. She even seemed frightened when she mentioned know what Dementors are.

Alice, we know nothing about, except that she was an auror, in the Order, defied Voldemort three times, didn't tell Bellatrix and co. anything while being tortured (it's not like they even had much information to give, but still), and that she's now incapable of doing much. And yet, she's a comfort to Neville when she gives him a gum wrapper.

And again, Lily. Shown standing up to James in 5th year, but then she fell in love with him. She was an Order member, and also defied Voldemort three times. We know that she was okay being left with Harry alone (she said that the only reason James couldn't go out was that Dumbledore had the cloak. So she's not exactly against it.) And she refuses to let Voldemort kill Harry before her. But in her mind, she must've known that once she was dead, Harry would be too.
