She was written as the smart, but very impulsive and judgemental character. Most people attack her intelligence, which is disingenuous - or they say that she's a mary sue, which doesn't even make sense. No, she is the archetype of "factual intelligence, but no emotional or social intelligence". The only reason she became friends with R and H was because they battled a troll together, which most likely shocked her out of the carefully controlled cocoon she was constructing around herself to keep away from others.

If you ignore JKRs plot-slavery, her character is very well rounded with a few strengths and a few weaknesses.

If written well, she requires a lot of development or an event like the troll to become friends with anyone.

How Fleur was treated, though, is really sickening. Especially because we learn that the whole "bitchiness" was a front to protect herself from weird propositions.
