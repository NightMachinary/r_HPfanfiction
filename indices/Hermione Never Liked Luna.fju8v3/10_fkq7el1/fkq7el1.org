The Seventh Horcrux's version of Hermione is, when reflected through Harrymort anyway, an amoral rules stickler. I think the explanation is something like "she follows the rules so closely because she has no moral compass, so when she breaks the rules she sees no difference between little lapses of moral judgement and huge ones".

I'm not saying canon Hermione is like this, and I might be confusing the books and movies here (ugh), but the whole Loony versus Luna Lovegood thing does seem to echo this. Which is to say "Loony" is and remains Hermione's perspective on Luna but she also knows that she shouldn't call her that.

That being said, I'm not necessarily convinced Hermione would disagree with Luna's lifestyle. I'm pretty sure Hermione's experience at her muggle primary school was very similar to Luna's at Hogwarts. Whatever else there is to be said about Ron and (especially) Harry, they are both, in quite (very) different ways, just as obsessive as Hermione. Luna's like that too, just without either a Ron or a Harry.

I just don't think that parallel makes them friends. But, then, I don't think Hermione and Harry are good at making friends in general. Harry, who does become friends with Luna, does so mostly because of shared experiences. Luna fits into his ideas about the world much more easily than she does Hermione... Harry's world has moral parameters, Hermione's intellectual ones.

Counter-Argument... Hermione gets more open minded through the books between SPEW and the Hallows.
