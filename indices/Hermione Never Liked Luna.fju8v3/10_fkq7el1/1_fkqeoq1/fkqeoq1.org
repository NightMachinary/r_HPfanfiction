It somehow never felt to me like she became more open-minded. She accepted, very reluctantly, that hallows are a thing. But to me it seemed like she was sort of 'OK, so they do exist.' But when there would come something else she wouldn't believe was true, you'd again have to convince her that it's possible. I think she sticks to her views, gets annoyed when they are challenged, and then relents if she absolutely has to. Harry even told her that she didn't believe hallows were a thing even after she learnt there were true prophecies. I can't remember Hermione shifting her view on this matter in general.
