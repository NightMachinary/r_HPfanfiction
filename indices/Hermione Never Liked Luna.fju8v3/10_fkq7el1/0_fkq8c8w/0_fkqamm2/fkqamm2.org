Attacking Ron and the McLaggen stuff aren't in the same domain as "gets more open minded".

For example, a toddler will believe almost anything. You tell them that not only is there more than one Dracula but that a whole bunch of Draculas live on your roof, they will believe you. Toddlers are very open minded. Are they intelligent, mature, sensible and rational people? Not at all.

Firenze and Divination? Well, look at SPEW. On one hand Hermione should learn to pay attention to the "truth" of who she's trying to help. Everyone tells her SPEW's a bad idea and she sees the net effect. On the other hand, SPEW also causes her to start questioning what she learns from books... kind of. Her problems with Divination don't come from books... they come from her third year experiences with it. I'm not saying she was primed to believe it because I think she wasn't (despite, you know, being a time traveller that year but whatever), but I am saying it's not exactly an issue of open mindedness. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Hermione had solid practical and some theoretical reasons to rubbish Divination. That puts her in the same place as Darwin (lacking knowledge of genetics but having good practical data) or Newton (lacking modern physics).

Thus... we're left with calling Firenze a horse. Which, again, is not really an open minded sort of problem. It's kind of judgy and it's definitely a "ignoring their truth" sort of thing, but mostly I would put it in the "suspect grasp of morality" basket. We can disagree about this one, though.

(And note... even though we know there are /real/ prophecies in Harry Potter we don't actually know how "real" they are. Dumbledore has a lot of stuff to say about choices and the ones we encounter appear to have nothing to do whatsoever with Divination as a taught subject.)
