To address your counter argument... no?

The Firenze thing is HBP, and she does some other pretty shady stuff in that book: attacks Ron completely unprovoked and the incident with McClaggen (then going on to admonish Harry for a similar thing) jump out at me as well.

I don't think there is anything that demonstrates any shift in her personality in that regard.
