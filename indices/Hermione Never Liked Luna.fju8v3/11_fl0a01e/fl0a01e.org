Hermione was a surprisingly judgy person to be honest. I find it slightly funny that fics always show Ron being the one who doesn't accept others and Hermione not caring and still being okay, when really it was the other way round. I still like Hermione, but it's definitely a flaw. I still think she was close but a bit distant with Luna.
