  Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, *Hermione*, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: *friends... friends ... friends ...*

  She beamed, but became solemn at once.

  “What about Luna?”

  “Well, if they're telling the truth and she's still alive ---” began Ron.

  *“Don't say that, don't say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be alive, she must!”*

Luna definitely considered Hermione a friend. And while it is certainly true that Hermione never respects Luna's beliefs, she definitely /cares/ for Luna. Just wanted to put this out there.
