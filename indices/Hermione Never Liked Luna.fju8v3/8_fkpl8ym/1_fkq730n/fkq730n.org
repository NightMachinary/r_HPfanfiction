Well Hermione doesn't believe in those things because she has never seen or read about them and of course Luna is eccentric and having the ties to The Quibbler like she does only sets Hermione's dislike in stone even more. I think I'd she could look past those things, she would like Luna but it's too difficult because she's so stubborn and close minded. As much as Ron and Hermione are opposites, Kuna and Hermione definitely are despite them both being intellectuals because of their different views and approached to stuff. Luna takes everything as a possibility while Hermione takes only written fact and logic as a possibility. It is very possible this comes from being raised by muggles as well as having been a know it all so she buried herself in books etc. Luna grew up with magic, has seen some stuff and has been influenced by her father as well. Hermione has to see it to believe it. Some of Luna's creatures could be real but only viewable by some people like Thestrals are.
