That and she's had a couple of years of Rune and Arithmancy classes with majority-Ravenclaw attendance and she's heard them bitching about the weirdo in their house, and lacking the emotional intelligence to recognise bullies in action when they're not aimed at her assumes that the Looney they're bitching about really /is/ how she's described.
