I think the argument there is that because Hr has already had her mind changed about one thing (the magical world), she ought to be more open to the possibility that Wrackspurts, Blubbering Humdingers etc. /might/ exist.

Coming from the Muggle world, where bacteria are usually invisible to the naked eye, Hr should be a little more open-minded about the fact that maybe there's super rare creatures out there that haven't been researched. After all, if you had told someone pre-germ theory that there were tiny invisible â€˜insects' all over everything and they could make you sick, you'd have been in the insane asylum.
