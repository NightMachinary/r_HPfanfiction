my point is that Hermione most likely knew something was off (the way Harry had incidents he couldn't explain) and the magical world was an explanation that fit. There's nothing that clicks into place with Luna's creatures in that way. Like for example, thestrals fill a void that exists in the book -- carriages drawn by something you can't see. Luna's creatures are based completely on faith.
