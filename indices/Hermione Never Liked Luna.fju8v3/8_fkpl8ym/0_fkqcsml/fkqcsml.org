I've never understood this argument. Hermione didn't know about magic pre-Hogwarts because there's an entire branch of government dedicated to keeping it a secret (the Obliviators). Unless there's also a clandestine organization dedicated to keeping Blubbering Humdingers secret, it's much more likely that they just don't exist.
