Unpopular opinion here: I ship Hermione and Luna. It's weird, I know. Also if I'm not mistaken they only had two scenes in the books together and both were about them arguing about the existence of some made up stuff in the wizarding world.

Those moments were the ones when I felt that Hermione is pretty much the only person who doesn't just adore her for being weird and childish or ignores her completely, but she actually challenges her beliefs and starts arguing even when everyone else thinks it's impossible to change Luna's mind about anything. It's like if she was the only one who counted Luna as a person.

I think if Luna saw Hermione as a friend, she would never get mad at her for being rude at times, since she knows it's part of her nature. I always saw Luna as the queen of emotional inteligence. I think you're right about Hermione not liking her but I always see them as two people who could get along pretty well as they grow older and find the value in each other.
