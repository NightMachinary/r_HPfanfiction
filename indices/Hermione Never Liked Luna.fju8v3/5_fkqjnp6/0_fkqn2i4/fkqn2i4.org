Right? I like Luna as much as the next person but the amount of people who turn Luna from a strange girl who likes weird things to a fae type of seer who's perfect just rubs me the wrong way.

Everyone says the would love Luna but I'm sure a lot of people would be finding excuses to not talk to her.
