Hermione is her own can of worms, with pros and cons I won't go into here. But I think a lot of people in this fandom forget that Luna's real life equivalent is a flat-earther, anti-vaxxer who thinks the world is run by Illuminatis and that Bush did 9/11.

No matter how popular Luna is among us, the reality is that the vast majority of us would not stand her and be happy to ignore her existence all together.
