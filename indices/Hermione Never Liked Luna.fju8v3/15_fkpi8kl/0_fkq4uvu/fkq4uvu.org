I'm pretty sure Ron didn't come up with it. If I remember correctly, when the gang first met Luna in book 5, Ginny referred to her as Loony (not to her face) because she was the only one who knew Luna due to being in the same year as her, which implies that the nickname was already well-established. And Ron wasn't even there because he went to the prefects' carriage with Hermione.
