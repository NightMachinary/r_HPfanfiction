Well if Hermione could open up a little bit or Luna could tone done her eccentric tendencies and actions then they would probably get along fairly well since they both like knowledge and are intellectuals as well as both having a limited amount of friends because they're different or book worms. Get them talking about something they have in common and it will probably help out a lot to the point Hermione must even consider attempting to find Luna's creatures.
