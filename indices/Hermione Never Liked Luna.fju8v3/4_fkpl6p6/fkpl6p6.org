Agreed. I don't think Hermione is a bad person at all, but she's very stubborn and set in her ways and anyone who challenges her world view is /clearly/ in the wrong. Not just with Luna, either.

Wanting to liberate the house elves was noble and good, but hiding knitted clothes under piles of trash so that the elves would find them and be freed was disrespectful. She's very dismissive of the more traditionally "girly girls" she meets (Lavender, Parvati, Fleur) as though being feminine is an inherently bad trait. In one of her worst moments imo, after everything that went down in HBP she felt the need to have an "I told you so" moment regarding the identity of titular Prince (she thought 'he' might've been a woman, she was partially right because Prince was the maiden name of Snape's mom). Not the time or place, hun.
