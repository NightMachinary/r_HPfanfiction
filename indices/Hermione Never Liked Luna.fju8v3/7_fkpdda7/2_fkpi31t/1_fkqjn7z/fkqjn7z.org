Never to her face, but Harry is rather callous towards her throughout the fifth book.

During the incident with the Stinksap, and Cho walks in on the compartment, Harry reflects that he wishes Cho could have seen him with cool people, rather than Loony or Neville.

This makes a nice contrast in the sixth book, when Harry explicitly calls Neville and Luna his friends, and when Luna brings up their unpopularity, Harry retorts that she and Neville are cool, having fought at the Ministry with him.

He calls her Loony one other time, mentioning her reference to Nargles.

And Harry is short with her when debating how to get to London, but everyone was angry in that scene, so I think we can give him a pass.
