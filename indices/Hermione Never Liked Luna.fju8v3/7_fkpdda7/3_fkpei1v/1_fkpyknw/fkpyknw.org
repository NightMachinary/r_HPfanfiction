  Also she was a speciesest against FIRENZE!!! :( CALLING A CENTAUR A HORSE IS LIKE CALLING A PERSON A MONKEY! And people do that and it's very bad! :( You cannot advocate for house elves and then also turn around and start calling centaurs horses! She is a stupid bigoted hypocrite!

I'm not the biggest Hermione fan, but you have to look at the context. Hermione is talking to Lavender and Parvati, who are saying she is jealous of them for taking divination because Firenze is hot. They have crushes on him and are insinuating Hermione also has a crush.

A centaur is literally half horse, half man. That's the description. Hermione is reminding them that to get with him, they've have to take a centaur dick. Which is identical to a horse dick, sooo....
