Yeah, it's very much the nature of fanfiction. Disguised author-inserts is a common phenomenon. Not as apparent when the main demographic and the main character's gender match, but when they don't it's obvious, because they choose someone else and boost their relevance and power to absurdity. Hermione for Harry Potter. Sakura for Naruto. Jaune for RWBY. Greg Veder for Worm. I'm sure there's more, but the smaller fandoms I read don't have the critical mass generally. It's actually why I almost always avoid stories tagged, BAMF!Hermione or BAMF!Sakura. So many of them have super geniuses beyond belief, easily dwarfing even the greatest known characters in their canon at a similar age. Hermione consistently is at or better than Merlin. Sakura becomes the First and Second Hokage combined.
