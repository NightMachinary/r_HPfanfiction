Fanfics are unfair to everyone. Every trait that gets seen as 'bad' gets dialed up to eleven. Suddenly Dumbledore is a manipulative pedo, the Dursley's raped Harry, Hermione is a narrowminded bitch who abuses Ron, who is secretly dosing Harry with potions so he stays loyal to the Weasley's bc Dumbledore pays him to do that, and also hits Hermione when the food isn't on the table when he gets home, Snape provides the potions and is secretly evil all along, and also has a crush on Hermione. This is only a slight exaggeration of tropes surprisingly common in fanfics.
