I definitely don't think the book is trying to say Hermione is abusive or even just takes a wrong course of action here. In fact, it's the same as almost everything in the books where bad things are unforgivable only if the motivations are bad. This is obviously explicitly articulated with the difference between /crucio/ and /tarantellegra/ or /imperio/ and /confundus/ (two sets of spells that are less different than they first appear) or the killing curse and anything else lethal, but I hold it applies across /everything/: that at the very least it's Harry's main moral lens (and also Ginny's).

Hermione is given a sympathetic motive, usually, and Ron's actions are presented as coming from a wrong place. Consequently, Hermione is hurt and Ron is hurting... not the other way around.

Most people, IRL, are much more consequentialist than this. Bad things are justifiable if they have good outcomes, not if they have good intentions (which, after all, pave the road to hell). And, similarly, since the books were written, these kinds of issues (domestic abuse) are much more politically charged.

The point is... whatever moral interpretation is meant to be attached to Ron and and Hermione's actions in HBP, the contemporary reader (or, in our case, surely re-reader) is quite likely to come to a different and totally justifiable conclusion.
