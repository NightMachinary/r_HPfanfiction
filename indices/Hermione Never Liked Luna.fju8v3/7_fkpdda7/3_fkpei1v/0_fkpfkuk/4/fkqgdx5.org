I had a discussion with someone about her in HBP. The person said it was of course wrong of her to attack him, but that Ron definitely knew she was asking him out not as a friend. So essentially it's not bad,but understandable. He is also awful to her before that Lavander business even starts. So she comes across as someone who was terribly mistreated. And as she cries in that bird scene, she is bound to get a lot of sympahthy. The person I discussed this with said that as Ron's jealousy was unfounded and Hermione's reaction had a valid reason, her actions are more understandable. In the end I think reactions are related to how these two were written.
