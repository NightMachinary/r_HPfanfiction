Contrary to popular belief, I don't think she's a terrible person. It's just that a lot of fic authors paint her as this downtrodden goddess or can-do-no-wrong symbol of perfection when she's not either of these things, while conversely making Ron out to be this piece of shit user and abuser. No one can say anything even remotely controversial about Hermione without getting downvoted (see link [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ed14qo/rant_enough_with_the_ronbashing/][here]]) while Ron and other characters get hit excessively harshly. It's fucking irritating.
