I've honestly thought you were just mindlessly hating on the character. We've had a few run-ins, you and I, but I think I actually agree with you on some points:

  She was written as the smart, but very impulsive and judgemental character. Most people attack her intelligence, which is disingenuous - or they say that she's a mary sue, which doesn't even make sense. No, she is the archetype of "factual intelligence, but no emotional or social intelligence". The only reason she became friends with R and H was because they battled a troll together, which most likely shocked her out of the carefully controlled cocoon she was constructing around herself to keep away from others.

  If you ignore JKRs plot-slavery, her character is very well rounded with a few strengths and a few weaknesses.

  If written well, she requires a lot of development or an event like the troll to become friends with anyone.

^Copypasted from my own comment above. Bashing is generally shitty, but the reason you're downvoted isn't because of your opinion (note the upvotes on this post and your original comment), but because you come across as needlessly aggressive. It's what always bugs me a little when I see your comments, they read like the character beat you up and left you in the streets a few years ago, not like you just dislike her portrayal in some fics.
