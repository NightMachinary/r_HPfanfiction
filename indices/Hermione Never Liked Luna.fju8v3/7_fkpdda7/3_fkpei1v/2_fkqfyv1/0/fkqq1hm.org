The thing with Hagrid chastising them over Scabbers annoyed me.

First of all, Hagrid you absolute hypocrite, you had to be convinced to give your dragon away because as it turns out raising an illegal dragon in a wooden hut next to a school full of children isn't the best idea. NTM Aragog and the skrewts.

Second of all, for all Ron knows his pet that he's had since is DEAD because Hermione refused to control her own pet and she wasn't showing the slightest bit of remorse. If I'd let my pet kill one of my friends' pets I sure as shit wouldn't expect them to forgive me and I'd be on my knees groveling. God forbid Ron actually loves his pet and is sad about its apparent passing, what a horrible friend and person üôÑ

I mean, Harry and Ron stupidly overreacted to the broomstick thing (for fuck's sake Harry, if it's safe you'll get it back no harm done and if it's not she just saved your life, I know you're a sports obsessed 13 year old boy but this is extreme even for that) so they weren't blameless either, but no Ron shouldn't have been forced to ‚Äúbe the bigger person‚Äù here when his pet is ‚Äúdead‚Äù without even a body to bury and Hermione doesn't give a shit and insists her little angel is blameless.
