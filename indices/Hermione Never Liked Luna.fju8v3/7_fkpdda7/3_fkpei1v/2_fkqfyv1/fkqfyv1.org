and look at the stuff with Marietta and Rita, for instance. No one said anything to her about it. And,yes, they are both nasty characters, but Hermione is always justified no matter what she does.Harry is reckless and this gets Sirius killed. Ron abandons those two in dH and has to find his way back and save Harry's life. Hermione didn't pay any attention to Ron's concerns about his rat. They didn't talk to her after the rat incident, but even Hagrid told them this was just a minor thing and later it turnd out the rat wasn't actually dead and was an evil wizard animagus. Had Hedwig injured someone, I don't think it would have turned out the pet was evil all along. Hermion can stay in the same stage because she always has to right. She could rob a bank and it would become the right thing to do. Well, she did rob a bank in DH lol. But I wonder if she couldn't get away with murder.
