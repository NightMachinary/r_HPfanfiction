Also she was a speciesest against FIRENZE!!! :( CALLING A CENTAUR A HORSE IS LIKE CALLING A PERSON A MONKEY! And people do that and it's very bad! :( You cannot advocate for house elves and then also turn around and start calling centaurs horses! She is a stupid bigoted hypocrite! :( Hermione is a very bad person. I think she just wanted to be stubbornly right rather than actually caring about the house elves themselves. She's a very self righteous person in general. Like excusing herself with mclaggen sabotage but hating harry for the princes book and felix felicis ron.

Hermione is just the total EPITOME of "do as i say not as i do!" because she's right and justified when she does stuff but everyone else isn't when they do the same things.
