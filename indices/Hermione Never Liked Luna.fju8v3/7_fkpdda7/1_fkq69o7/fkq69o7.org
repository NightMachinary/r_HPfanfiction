  I think he (subconsciously?) noticed that she liked him (laughing super hard at a joke he made on the train).

I don't know why but now I'm imagining a humorous fic about a rivalry between Hermione and Luna for the affections of a totally oblivious Ron. It starts out innocent enough with bringing him little snacks and hugging and escalates to outright flirting and maybe even a catfight Ginny has to break up because Ron and Harry are simply staring. Has there ever been a Ron/ Hermione/ Luna fic? Harry seems to get all the girls most of the time, but it would be fun to see Ron in one of those arrangements without him even realising how it happened.
