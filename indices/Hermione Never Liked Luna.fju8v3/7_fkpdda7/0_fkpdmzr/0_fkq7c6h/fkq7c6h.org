If she was lonely she might've defended Luna, but if she fit in right away (possible, as we don't know if Ravenclaws dislike know-it-all's as much as Gryffindors; I think there'd be at least a few who understood and might've accepted her and stuff), she'd... well, not /join./ I do not see Hermione as a outright shoe-hiding bully. But she wouldn't stand up too much either. Best case scenario she'd be like Remus Lupin.
