Honestly, Canon!Harry is a natural introvert. He has a small social circle and shuns overt socialization.

Lomonaaeren has some good fics in this direction: Linkao3(Forget-Me-Not by Lomonaaeren; The Art Of Self-Fashioning)

Hmm, what else..? It would be easier to list fics where he /isnt/ an introvert than not. Linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy) is another good rec.
