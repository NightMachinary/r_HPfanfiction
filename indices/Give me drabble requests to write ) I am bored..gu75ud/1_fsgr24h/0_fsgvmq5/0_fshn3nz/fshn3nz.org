How about Harry noticing his accidental magic, but instead of jumping to the common â€˜I'm a wizard and must learn magic' he instead concludes that he is a god and thus, to get more powerful he must make the population of Little Whining start to worship him (maybe he had read American Gods?), the blood wards hide this from the ministry, and so by the time his letter arrives he has been continually breaking the laws of secrecy and underage wizardry.

Or maybe a Drabble in which Harry is summoned to another dimension a la 0800-rent-a-hero, but instead of the summoners getting a hero who had killed Voldemort they get Harry Potter, also called Death destroyer of worlds, the pale rider, horseman of the apocalypse who killed Voldemort along with every other human when he and the other horseman's brought the end of all things, and now the order is unwittingly asking him to end their world. Could be a standard HP story, or could be a crossover with either Supernatural or Good Omens, if with GO, maybe have him bring Adam (the Antichrist) with him. Alternatively maybe the whole prophecy of the apocalypse was the muggle interpretation of a prophecysed war between muggles and magicals that the magicals won.
