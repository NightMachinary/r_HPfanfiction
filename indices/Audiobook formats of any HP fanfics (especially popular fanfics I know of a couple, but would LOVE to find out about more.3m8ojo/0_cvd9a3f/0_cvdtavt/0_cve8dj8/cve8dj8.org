The voices aren't created by the person who wrote the app. They come from... three or four different companies, I believe. They make voices that are used for lots of different purposes. That's why I singled out Ivona - I've purchased from a couple of the other available companies, but they aren't as good. That "computer-y" quality is much more pronounced with them.

And there are literally /hundreds/ of different voices in all different languages and accents. The app doesn't provide them for free, it simply provides access to them.

You can listen to a samples before buying, too.

The app itself comes with... I think one default voice. It's OK and might be what's native on the iPhone. The app itself is designed for people who have trouble reading and seeing (dyslexia, ADHD, visual impairments). It has a bunch of features that are aimed at that market which I don't pay attention to - automatic scrolling, highlighted lines, variable speaking speed (with certain voices), that sort of thing. You can load web pages, Word documents, epub files, and more.

It's not designed for simple fanfic enjoyment, it just happens to do that very well.

I think it's worth it. Given how much time I've spent using it just on proofing my own work, never mind listing to others' fics, I could have spent four or five times what I already have and it would still be a bargain.
