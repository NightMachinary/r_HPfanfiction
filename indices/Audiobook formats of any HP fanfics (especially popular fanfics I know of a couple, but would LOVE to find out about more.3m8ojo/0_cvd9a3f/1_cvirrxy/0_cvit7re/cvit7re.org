Amy was originally my favorite - Emma sounded /too/ high pitched to me. Like a girl's voice.

But that was when I was using Sennheiser headphones. When I started using headphones with more base, Emma sounded much better.

So, the headphones you use (or speaker settings, though I'm not sure these voices will sound as good that way) will have a strong influence on which voices sound better.

And I've created quite a large custom dictionary, too. Some, like McGonagall, were actually quite challenging to get right! But it's indispensible.
