Simple solution, if you have a smart phone: Voice Dream Reader. Started on iPhone, but available for Android now, too.

It's a computerize text-to-speech reader which, /IF/ you get Ivona voices, sounds almost as good as a real person.

You can purchase dozens and dozens of voices in addition to the default voice, but Ivona has them all beat. If you can get them for some other text-to-speech app or computer program, do that instead. I use the British English voices Emma (slightly higher pitched voice) and Amy (deeper voice) for HP fanfiction (the type of headphones you use will change which sounds better). Salli is a good American English voice, Marlene is good for German, and Celine is good for French.

It's not perfect. Unusual names and words won't be pronounced right, but you can create a custom pronunciation dictionary. You can create playlists. You can load in epub files of fanfics. You can read along as the text scrolls with the voice.

By this point, I use VDR more than any other app on my iPhone. I cannot recommend it enough, not in a dozen more posts like this, though once again it's the high quality of the Ivona voices that make it work. You can hear the "computer-y" quality of the voice, but usually I have to pay close attention to notice it. Most of the time, it's more like a real person.

It is also completely indispensible for me as a writer. You would not believe how many errors I catch by listening to my chapters. So many things stand out that way - things that I just pass over when reading. My main beta and I listen to each chapter several times each before anything is published, and it helps a lot.

Listening also forces me to think about what I'm hearing, which helps me notice plot holes, conflicts with things happening in other chapters, foreshadowing I need to do, etc. I could not imagine writing without having this tool to help me.
