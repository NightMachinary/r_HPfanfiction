  As someone with great difficulty, due to physical limitations cannot spend too much time physically reading, the audiobook formats have been a god-send.

While not well done or British, I often will turn my iPhone's "voiceover" screen reader on and listen to my phone read me fanfics while I'm working or something. It's definitely not good quality, but I figured I'd mention the option since it enables me to listen to literally any fanfic regardless of whether it's been transcribed into a real audiobook. I'm sure Android/Windows phones have a similar feature!
