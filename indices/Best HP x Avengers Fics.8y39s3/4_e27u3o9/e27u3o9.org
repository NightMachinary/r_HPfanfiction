Only one I can think of is Heroes Assemble by Stargon1 and its still updating.

Takes place about 10ish years after the Fall of Voldemort and loosely follows the MCU/Netflix shows and is not epilogue compliant from HP.

I don't know where exactly the story is going but its currently between Winter Solider and Age of Ultron and may be (slowly) leading to Infinity War assuming the author want to go in the direction.
