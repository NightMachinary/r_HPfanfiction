I don't know if you're still looking but I had to rec my absolute favorite crossover (and possibly fic) ever, Mischief's Heir. Best part about it? It's 443,529 words spread out over a five fic series. One fic for each year it follows.

edit: And it's completed. That's important too.

​

Basic low spoiler sales pitch:

Summer after 1st year Harry has been locked in his room by the Dursleys and prays to Loki to come save him. Loki decides to answer the call.

​

High spoiler sales pitch:

End game is Loki adopting Harry and being genuine family to him, family that expects the best of him and encourages him to embrace being smart and clever and ambitious. When second year comes Diary Tom is restored and it turns out he wasn't all that bad of a guy. The crazy came from the Hocruxes, so Dairy Tom gets adopted too. Harry and his friends make a club and that club after some time becomes focused on making the first wizarding world space program. Things spiral from there. Loki is a nice mix of MCU and legend. Things verge on crack at several points but there is usually enough realism and "they live in a magical world" to make it okay. Lots of characters get rolls to play. The MCU (beyond Loki) plays a smaller role until later in the story when their part grows but Harry and his side of things remain the bigger focus through it all as we follow him through his school years and holidays.
