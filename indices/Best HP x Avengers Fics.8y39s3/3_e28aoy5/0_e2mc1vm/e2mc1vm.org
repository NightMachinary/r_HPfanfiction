I so wish for this to be good, more than a million words, it would have been brilliant but sadly couldn't read past chapter 4 in which following happens

Tony Stark goes to Dursley's home in iron man suit and start looking around in the house to presumably gather evidance of Dursley's crimes against Harry

There were many similarly ridiculous moments/actions in the previous chapters as well but this was the last drop for me.
