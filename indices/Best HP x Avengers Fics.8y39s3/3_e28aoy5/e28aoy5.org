My favorite HPxAvengers fic is linkffn(Child Of The Storm) and it's sequel linkffn(Ghosts of The Past).

They're really long individually, but together they're a little absurd length-wise.

Some people are turned off by how much of a multixover it is, too. It might be more accurate to just outright call it an HPxMarvel xover, but it does prominently feature the Avengers so.. /shrug/. Off the top of my head, it also has X-Men and a decent amount of Dresden Files that's mostly in a subplot. You don't at all need to understand/know Dresden Files. It's appearances are either sideplots that are well explained or minor characters. A little X-Men knowledge will be helpful, but probably not required. I usually don't like crossovers when their scope is too wide, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

It's definitely a complex story, though, and can be a bit hard to follow.
