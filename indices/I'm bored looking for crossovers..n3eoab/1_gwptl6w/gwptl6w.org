First and foremost is nonjon's Browncoat, Green Eyes. Harry appears several hundred years in the future (the Firefly universe) and he tries to figure out where all the wizards have gone. I can't recommend this fic highly enough. linkffn(2857962)

Secondly, mjimeyg's Harry Potter: Geth. Harry ends up in the Mass Effect universe right at the beginning of the trilogy & gets 'recruited' to be the emissary of the Geth as they want to integrate with the rest of the galaxy. Really fun story & I particularly love it because he nails the characterizations of all the Mass Effect people. linkffn(10784770)
