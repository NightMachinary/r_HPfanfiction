I'm a crossover junkie, and I've been clean for two whole days.

+1 for Browncoat, Green Eyes and Whispers in Corners, listed elsewhere in this thread - I've read both multiple times and always enjoy them. And... all of these are higher quality fics, and all complete. A whole bunch of different fandoms - the one that isn't listed as a crossover by FFN is crossed with Men in Black.

... I'm sure you can find something interesting in this mess, and I'm crossing my fingers that I don't break the bot.
