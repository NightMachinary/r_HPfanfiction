Well, if you're really bored, Nimbus Llewellyn's "Child of the Storm" and its sequels/side stories can keep you busy for awhile. Kinda surprised they havent been mentioned. It's Harry Potter crossed with more Marvel and DC stuff than I knew existed (with a mix of source material being drawn from, apparently it mixes elements from different runs of the comics and various movies and some of the Superman source material was clearly the show Smallville) plus The Dresden Files and some iteration of Dracula. And probably some other source material?

Altogether it's a couple of million words of extreme crossover on FFN and AO3. We're talking "Harry Potter rescues Clark Kent and fights Dracula" and "Albus Dumbledore and Captain America fought HYDRA and Grindelwald, who was one of Kemmler's Apprentices, together" level of crossover.

Speakong of Dresden Files crossovers, I think linkao3(Born in Fiendfyre by Samhaine) is the most ambitious at trying to meld the original materials while linkao3(That Subtle Science and Exact Art by Jedi Buttercup) is the most satisfying one-shot of plopping a character from the one universe into the other.

Other crossovers... "Make A Wish" is not officially a crossover, but the whole time I was reading it I thought The Professor and Henchgirl were clearly an homage to Girl Genius. As far as I know, there is only one true Girl Genius/Harry Potter crossover, linkffn(Girl Genius' Animagus by Quartermass) and honestly I don't think it does either source material justice or mixes them very well. I wish somebody'd written a crossover where Hogwarts is in Castle Heterodyne or something.

There are no Harry Potter x Dune crossovers, I've looked. Which means I guess I'll have to write the scene I want to read of Hagrid with a Sandworm (or perhaps Luna talking about the wormsign?) myself... Ugh.
