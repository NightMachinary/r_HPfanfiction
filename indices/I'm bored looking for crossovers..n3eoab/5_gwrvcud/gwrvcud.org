[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-2585][A Brane of Extraordinary Women]] is epically long, and not all of it is HP-related, but it's a very interesting read.

Book 1 is a multi-crossover response to a writing challenge a while back, a bit meh, but passable, and introduces the characters. The Potter-verse is the staging point for it.

Book 2 follows up on each of the characters as they return to their own universes and put to use what they learned from each other (eg Buffy recruiting Jack O'Neill and Hermione Granger, Batman teaching Xander how to be a serious un-powered vigilante).

Book 3 is very long, and focuses specifically on Alex Mack becoming a serious superhero. Hermione is on her list of recruits, although in a relatively minor role. It also kind of cornered the market on Alex Mack fanfiction; there's hardly anything not based on it.

Book 4 is a stand-alone prequel about the Hermione, Ron and Harry in the Alex Mack world, where they have no magic but went to "Harworts" to be trained for MI6. It re-tells all of canon in terms of advanced technology and spycraft, doing quite an interesting job of it. (Naturally, the Harworts students are rather sneakier than canon Hogwarts students.)

Book 5 is another multi-crossover, this time with all different versions of Alex Mack.

Book 6 is another follow-up, by all the different Alexes, still in progress.

Book 7 is another story about the Hermione from the Alex-verse, still in progress.
