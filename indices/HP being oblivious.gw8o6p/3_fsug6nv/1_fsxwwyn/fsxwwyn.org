Despite being incredibly popular, this fic is an awful mess that just gets worse and worse as it goes on. It has promise, there are a few jokes that make it seem like this might be a fun story, but nothing pays off. Do not go into this expecting a good story, or even an okay one, but if you want the literary equivalent of burned popcorn, this is for you.
