He's not unintelligent - the opposite, really - but chirpy and cheerful and a bit naive (because dragons mature more slowly than humans) in [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]].

Like the time when the centaurs, in terror of the (eight-year-old) "Great Wyrm", tie up one of their daughters and leave her near his lair as a sacrifice to appease him.

  Suddenly, it clicked. A lady tied up outside a dragon's lair --- this was just like that story with the damsel and that dragon that lived in the sea! Well, she wasn't naked like the one in the story, but he guessed it was kind of cold out, so that made sense. He'd never really understood that part of the story anyway. Harry nodded decisively. The lady with horse instead of legs was a damsel, and that made the question of what to do obvious.

  “Grr, grr, GRR. I'm a big fearsome dragon, and you're a damsel, so I'm going to carry you off to my lair, grr!” He declared, stepping out of the undergrowth. He wished he had gotten those stomping lessons from Hagrid already. Harry wanted to do this right, and it just didn't seem proper that the ground wasn't shaking from his every step. He hoped the horsey-lady wasn't disappointed.

  As Harry approached his new damsel, the thought ran through his head. Maybe damsels were some sort of treasure? If they were, then they were obviously a very important sort of treasure. The stories had always taken care to specifically name the damsels, and they never did that for the not-damsel treasures.

  Surely, the Great Wyrm would eat her soon?

  Again, she didn't resist as its mighty forepaws closed around her and lifted; to quaver would be to shame her family. This was her fate, and she would face it with dignity.

  Oddly, it seemed to be holding her exceedingly gently.

  Having picked her up carefully, it then proceeded to whisper out of the side of it's terrifying mouth, “Am I doing it right?”

  “...what?” It was the first word she had spoken since the previous night. She hadn't quite been able to work up the nerve before.

  “Well, this is the first time I've done this carrying-off thing, and I want to make sure I'm doing it right,” it explained. “I'm a dragon, and I'm supposed to know about this stuff.”

  For a moment, Suze considered saying he was doing it wrong, she had been expecting to be eaten by now, after all, but she reconsidered. It was probably an exceedingly bad idea to say no to a dragon, she reasoned.

  “I think you're doing it right,” Suze said uncertainly. “I've never been carried off before either, so I'm not sure how it goes, but, well, you've done a very convincing job so far. You may need to work on your growl, though.”

  The dragon didn't seem at all displeased by her commentary. “Okay! I guess GRR! isn't really fierce enough. I've heard dragons should be very fierce when carrying off damsels.”

  “Umm, I suppose so, but well... um...” Why was the Great Wyrm asking for advice rather than eating her? This was not what she expected at all!

  “Well,” the dragon sounded resigned but determined, “I guess I'll just have to make it up as I go along.” With that, he took off. The ground spun dizzyingly away beneath her as Suze was carried along for the ride, and then her captor landed with a bone-jarring thud in the entrance to his lair, where, to her continuing surprise, he set her down gently.

  “...um, sorry, I haven't quite got landings down just yet.”
