I was really enjoying this story, right up until Harry was giving a perfectly accurate and reasonable argument against Hermione's insistence they memorize a bunch of potions... only to completely change his mind /because Ron agreed with him/. This scene also had Hermione actually poking Harry in the nose with her finger in her +nagging+ insistence, and he just goes along with it because he automatically disagrees with Ron anytime Ron and Hermione argue. End result: Harry helps Hermione bully everybody into studying details they don't need to know.

I limped along through a few more chapters after that, but it had really lost its shine and I got more and more annoyed until I gave up on it altogether.
