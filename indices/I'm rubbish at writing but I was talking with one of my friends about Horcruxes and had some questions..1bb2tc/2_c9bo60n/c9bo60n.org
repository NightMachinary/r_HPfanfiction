I think that it is interesting to think about. In regards to how everything works Rowling is very good at just glossing over it and moving on, leaving readers to ponder on things such as what the wiki points out.

I would think, that if horcruxes were the only thing keeping him immortal he would have died of old age, but we never know if he did more than that. We know the idea behind horcruxes is very old, and some fanfics have argued that the curse breakers occasionally stumble upon such items in ancient pyramids and temples. It would make sense. However there is no mention of an ancient Pharaoh still lurking about. Does this mean there is none? No.

We know Flamel is ancient but he was never described as being the eldest known wizard, and since we know practically nothing besides the english advancements we can assume some people live longer.

However back to horcruxes. If we are to believe that horcruxes stop you from aging then Voldemort should appear to be around 20 where he made his first horcrux. We know not his age in the books because he is so horribly disfigured, with part of him being serpentlike, but the movies portray him as older. However, we all know the movies lie/tweak repeatedly.

I won't comment on the morality debate apart from this: Harry might not agree to kill an innocent in the beginning but if his friends or family or a large degree of other innocents die, then he would probably act. Also, who says killing the person is the only way to get rid of a horcrux?

That may be true for an object, but remember that living beings are very different. A living being in the potterverse has a soul, and so latching a horcrux onto it would mean that it has 2 souls, meaning a spare one is present.

Also, the enchantments on objects can not be used on a living thing. How can a cell replicate if it is affected by an unbreakable charm? It can't. So logically you can't cast it on a human being. Etc.
