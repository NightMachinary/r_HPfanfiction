Ok so this one is actually beautiful - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/51538][Harveste Addams]] series. It's a crossover between Harry Potter and The Addams family and if you know anything about them, they are gleefully dark. It still manages to be heartwarming too, much like The Addams Family itself.

The setting is HP with Harry adopted by TAF, going to Hogwarts as usual.
