I recommend the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. While Harry is substituted for the main character of Jen Black, it ticks all the other boxes. Especially Necromancy and mind control. She worships the literal incarnation of Death, Baron Samedi and uses a mind control curse later on in the series.
