Antithesis is AMAZING! I think it is one of the best fanfictions around. It is still updating, but only has like 4 more chapters to go and the author is very consistent. In the story abuse affects a person, Harry also isn't just an angsty ball of attempted badassery. It does have a lot of angst, but it is well written.
