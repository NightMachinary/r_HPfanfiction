linkffn(Harry Potter and the End of War) Its part of a 6-piece series from year 1, that shows the descent from abused, but "good" to as bad as Voldemort. Its really, really reallyyyy fucking good, and its the only mentor!Voldy with a darkHarry that I've enjoyed. Don't think this has a good Harry underneath, he's really fucked up and does soooo much fucked up things, the worst for me was the Diggle family scene.
