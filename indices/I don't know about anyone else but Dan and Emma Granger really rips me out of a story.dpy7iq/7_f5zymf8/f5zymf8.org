This really doesn't make sense to me: yes, there are plenty of Harmony trashy stories (actually, it is hard to find non-trashy Harmony story, because whole concept of Harmony seems to be flawed), but what does it have to do with names? I don't care whether they are Dan & Emma or Helen & Richard (or whether fem!Harry is Harriet), I do care about the story. In linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) they are Dan & Emma (and it is NOT a Harmony story, because ewww ...), but what matters to me is that the story is good (even though [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][not perfect]]), the same goes for linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), yes it has some severe flaws but overall it is a good story with a good plot, and I don't care that it has Harriet even in its title. And I care even less that in linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) they are Helen & John and even though the Harmony element is the weakest part of the whole story, it is rather good read overall.
