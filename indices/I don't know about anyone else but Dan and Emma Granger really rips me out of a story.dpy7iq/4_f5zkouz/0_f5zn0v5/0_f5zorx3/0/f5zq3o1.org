It's not a hard requirement, but that just ticks fanservice for me, because I love literature and historical references.

What I can't read is former SAS member Daniel Granger, who threatens Harry, but gets cowed by his wife Emma Granger when their barely pubescent daughter does the nasty with Harry.

Another fic idea, her parents are exactly like that, but it's canon Hermione.
