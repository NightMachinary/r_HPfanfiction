Hmmm. Well. When I was just starting my fic and realized that Hermione's parents were going to make an appearance, I searched and couldn't find their first names. So I asked my readers... and they said that a lot of fics use Dan and Emma... and it never occurred to me that it was Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson... and I went along my merry way, blissfully ignorant until another reader commented on it much later on. Yeah. I know. I'm that daft. I was tempted to go back and change it because, well, it felt cringy, but I was already that far in... so I left it. Now I'm wondering if it turns people off that much should I change it? It's not a Harmony; no shipping at all, actually. And people seem to like it.
