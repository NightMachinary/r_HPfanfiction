It's just two normal names. I've read well written stories using those names that weren't even Harmony. I think it started out as an inside joke but then everyone started using it.

Another common name pair is Helen and Richard. Sometimes her dad is named John.

The real travesty is that Hermione is one of the main characters and we don't know her parents' names. And I don't want to find out what their names are from a tweet or Pottermore.
