This is true. I think my main issue with Dan and Emma though is just how oversaturated they are in bad indy Harry fics. You have a high chance of reading an indy harry fic where Hermione is the intended love interest with her parents being named dan and emma. I kinda want to write a fic where her parents are Daniel "Dan" Fenton and Samantha Emma Fenton just for memes
