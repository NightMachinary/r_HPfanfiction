To be honest, I cannot relate with this kind of reasoning.

To me it would be like being turned off fanfiction with Harry named Harry because of the sheer number of bad fics in which, unsurprisingly, Harry's name is Harry XD

I can understand being vary of certain tropes, but in this case it's only a name. Or two, as it happens.
