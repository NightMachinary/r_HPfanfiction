I'm with you OP. The first time I saw Dan and Emma used the only thing that stuck out was that it felt oddly specific. Later I picked up on its use in other fics and figured out why, and then I realized what has bugged me ever since...

In every case (that /I/ read) their names were forced in unnaturally, like a square peg in a round hole. If i ever run into it, it never fails to kick me out of the story for a second or two.

"You found Trevor! How can I ever thank you? I'm Hermione, what's your name?"

"Harry."

"My parents would love to meet you, Harry. I'm sure you'd be welcome to stay at our home if you ever needed to. Their names are Dan and Emma. They always belonged together. They fell in love in the first time they ever met. Do you believe in love at first sight, Harry?" she asked looking deeply into his blue eyes.
