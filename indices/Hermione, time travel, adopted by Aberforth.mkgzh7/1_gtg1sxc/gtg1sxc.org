I don't know the Name of the Fic, but additional details: she had a volatile relationship with Dolohov specifically. The overarching plot point is her relationship with Kingsley. When she „vanished“ back into her timeline, Kingsley was heartbroken. He got a shock when he met her in Grimauld on an order meeting in her timeline for the first time.
