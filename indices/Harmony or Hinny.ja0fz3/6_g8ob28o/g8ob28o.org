Absolutely. There is no romantic chemistry between Harry and Hermione. Just because they're friends, and we see them interact a lot more than Harry and Ginny doesn't mean they're more suitable as a couple or that they fall in love for that reason. That's usually not how falling in love works anyway.

Harry and Ginny all the way!
