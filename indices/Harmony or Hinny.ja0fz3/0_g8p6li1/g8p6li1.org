Harmony, all the way. I just don't see how Hermione would ever go with Ron, given how he treated her, for the longest time.

And while I agree, that the way Harry's relationship with Hermione was quite clearly fully platonic, in canon, there were plenty of opportunities where it could have morphed into something more.

And I honestly think, that if Rowling hadn't done such a weird u-turn with Harry's personality, in the summer, between second and third year, a relationship between her and Harry, would have been the only logical way to go.
