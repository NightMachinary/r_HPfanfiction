The same Ron that uses a pick-up-artist handbook to try and seduce her? Hm.

I'm not sure those little acts of kindness would, to an inexperienced 17-year old with no foundation in romance to fall back on, make up for Ron ruining the Yule Ball, or almost getting her killed by a troll, or making out with her roommate in front of her (that one applies with Ginny too ðŸ˜‚), or abandoning her in the middle of the most stressful and dangerous period of her life

I'm not saying I wouldn't have acted how Ron did - teenagers are stupid, after all. But the idea that /immediately/ after it was all over he essentially turns to her and says "fancy a shag?", that Hermione would spread her legs rather than kick his teeth in makes me disgusted with all parties involved (JKR included!).
