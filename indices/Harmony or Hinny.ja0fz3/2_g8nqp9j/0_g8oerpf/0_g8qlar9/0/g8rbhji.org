Regardless of stupid reactions of crushing teenagers, he is still kinder than most to her and is always ready to defend her when other people are mean to her. Also saying that he almost got her killed by a troll is seriously stretching it to fit your narrative because Ron didn't forcefully put her in a bathroom that happened to later be attacked by a troll. If we were worried that every annoyed remark we make about someone annoying could kill the other person by circumstances we could not predict then we'd have to shut up for half the time. What if your comment disagreeing with me makes me go crying in a bathroom that at a later time will be attacked by a troll? You won't even be able to come save me.
