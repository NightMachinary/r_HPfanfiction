While I tend to agree with you, I think you tend to forget how far a little kindness can go for an insecure lost teenage girl... and I am writing this even though I recently wrote some posts defending Ron. Hermione might be brilliant from a theoretical stand point but she is socially awkward and is seen as a second class citizen in her world. Ron, despite being a dick at times, is the only one who shows genuine kindness and acceptance towards her and, even though he treats her badly at times, stands up for her even against Harry, something that the latter never does. And these little acts of kindness have a more powerful impact especially for those that are not really comfortable in their world... just think that most girls that end up trafficked are girls from backgrounds that warrant them second-class citizen status and most times the way traffickers seduce them is by showing them some kindness at first (good thing Ron is not that type of garbage).

Edit: hate all you want but if you read the books carefully, you'd see that Harry is most of the times shitty towards Hermione but in more subtle ways that Ron. Ron, on the other hand, can be extremely shitty or extremely kind. And while he is shitty towards her, he doesn't allow anyone else to be, even going as far as cursing himself into vomiting slugs to defend her honor.
