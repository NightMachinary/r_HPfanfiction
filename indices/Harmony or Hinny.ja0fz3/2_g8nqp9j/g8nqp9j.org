I feel like Harmony is the only canon pairing that is actually fleshed out, while in fanon it is often just /terrible/. Bashing, trope-y, immature. A lot of Harmony fics are... well, bad.

In canon, though, it works - that's mostly because of how bad of a job JKR did with Ron/Hr and H/G. No self-respecting teenage girl would go for a guy who treated them so poorly for years on end; meanwhile, all of Ginny's character development happened off screen, so the stuff we saw felt very forced and obviously like the author was trying to shoe-horn her preferred pairings.
