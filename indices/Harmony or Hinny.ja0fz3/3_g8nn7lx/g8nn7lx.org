I think it depends with Harmony. Like it really doesn't work with fics that follow canon events. The way their friendship develops in the books feels purely platonic, and trying to turn that into a romance just feels forced.

That being said, most of the AU Harmony fics I've read are actually fine. Hermione's and Harry's personalities mesh really well in my opinion. Especially with fics where the two of them meet in the Muggle world before Hogwarts, or fics where they aren't friends with Ron.
