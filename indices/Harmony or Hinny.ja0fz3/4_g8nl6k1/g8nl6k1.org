I hated Harmony. I don't think they're well matched at all. Without Ron to balance them out, Harry and Hermione get on each other's nerves. See book 4 and 7. I mean they love each other, but they couldn't be in love. Besides I always loved the idea of having a platonic love, the idea that a man and woman could love each other as siblings and best friends is so beautiful that adding romance cheapens their relationship.
