I like Harry and ginny together it's my favorite pairing.

*I posted my thouhts on Harry and Hermione on another post about Harry and Hermione so I'll copy it below*

I personally don't ship Harry and Hermione because they're just too different. Hermione is way too bossy, she always has to be right and if you think she's not she'll argue with you until you tell her she is. I can't see Harry putting up with that especially since she seems like she'd want to argue about even the smallest thing.

What would they even talk about on dates they don't really have much in common.

Ron and Hermione don't seem like they'd work long term. They seem like they'd be hyped up and passionate just after the war but when things settle down they would quickly find it just didn't work. You can't have a relationship on just arguing after all and the only other thing they have in common is being friends with Harry.

But I can at least see Ron and Hermione getting together for a bit. I don't see Harry and Hermione together at all.

Honestly Hermione annoys me. But if you like the ship that's cool everybody's allowed to like whatever they want.
