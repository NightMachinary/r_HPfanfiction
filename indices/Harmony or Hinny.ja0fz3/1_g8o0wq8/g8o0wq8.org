Maybe it's because I love the whole best friends fall in love dynamic, but I've always liked harmony.

That being said I feel like people in this sub hate harmony mainly because of the people who ship harmony. They(not all obviously) are kinda full of themselves. They have such a high regard for their ship and they look down on every other one. They hold harry and hermione on such a high pedestal and bash other favorites into the ground like the weasleys and Dumbledore.

And most of the fics aren't that good. I've only found a few gems and I basically only read harmony fics.
