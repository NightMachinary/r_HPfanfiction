This.

Some of my favorite stories deal with Hermione. But at the same time, a lot of their writers tend to overplay it a lot. Not just write only Hemione romances, that's fine. Write what you enjoy.

But I've seen a lot of ones that go wayyy too far, basically bashing other females in the story for no reason and/or when writing a multi story, still having Hermione be the 'best'. You don't tell another woman you're supposed to be marrying that you will always love Hermione more, she's the bestest ever. That is not a good way to start a relationship or polyamorous relationship. And I've seen that /multiple/ times.

Also, I've seen them downplay Hermione's flaws in weird ways so even when she does wrong, she doesn't do wrong.
