I'm reading a good post-Hogwarts, canon compliant(!) fic at the moment, though the focus is on Draco. I'm only in chapter 5 (of 42 so far), but the writing is good and the characterisation interesting. So far Draco does not have the hots for Harry, didn't turn out to be a hero in disguise or simply misunderstood, he's just Draco Malfoy, whose world was turned up-side down when the war ended. linkffn(6432055)
