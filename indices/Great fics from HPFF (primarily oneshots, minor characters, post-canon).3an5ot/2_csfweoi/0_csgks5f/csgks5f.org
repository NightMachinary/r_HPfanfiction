You should also read /Run/ if you haven't! It's an ensemble piece, but James and Lily feature quite a bit and have great scenes with the Marauders and Snape in the afterlife. I wish I had more to rec, but I don't usually read James/Lily because I hate the general fanon take on them (and the Marauders).
