Reading it right now (ch.15), thanks for this recommendation as well! I like it very much so far, especially the way that all the characters really have their own voice in dialogues. I totally believe [[/spoiler][that it would be really awkward for Lily to meet Snape in the afterlife, him being still in love with her]]. The only thing I find a bit odd about the story is the role of the Founders, they just seem out of place to me, with so little other people that live in Cliodna's Clock for centuries.
