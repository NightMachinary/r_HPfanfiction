The author's wonderful! She's gotten published, too. Her fics cover a lot of genres; most have a blend of drama and humor. Another favorite of mine by her is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All the Abstract Nouns]], which is a Molly II coming of age.

If you like next gen silliness, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] by RonsGirlFriday is another good one, with the Weasleys and OCs running a radio show. It's not complete, but it's also not super plotty, so it's still a lot of fun.
