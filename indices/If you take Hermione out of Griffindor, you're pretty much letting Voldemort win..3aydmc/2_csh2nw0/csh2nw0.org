Keywords of this post: in cannon. Ron and Harry could arguably step it up when they see their grades completely slipping. Arguably, they got by without her the first two months.

As far as the stone goes, Ron and Harry wouldn't have noticed the trapdoor, nor cared enough about it to research it. Whether they get involved in it depends on your view of Dumbledore (manipulative Dumbledore gets them involved regardless, canon Dumbledore doesn't). Dumbledore's protections would most likely have held, as Voldemort shows no real way to get the stone without Harry, and Dumbledore was only 5 to 10 minutes behind the trio it seems.

Second year the school might have closed. This would be an interesting fic actually, one that I haven't read yet. The school closing opens up soooooo many options (alternative schooling, new building, etc).

As far as letting Voldie win, I don't think so. There are so many logical, in universe ways for him to be dealt with in a realistic manner that I don't think he is guaranteed a win just because Hermione is in a different house. Her being in a different house could just mean she is more involved or less involved. At some point, she will be involved regardless, as most of the kids in the school are. Just because she isn't in Gryf, doesn't mean that voldie will win. I think she can be just as determined and resourceful coming from a different house in the later parts of the war as she is in the early parts of it.
