Slytherin!Hermione is unlikely, but possible given associations with Merlin and the fact that canon!Hermione is ambitious. They'd come across her in first year for sure as Slytherin and Gryffindor share classes, and they'd remember her from the train.

Hufflepuff!Hermione would pop up in second year when there's the subplot with the Puffs accusing Harry of being the Heir of Slytherin, if not before.

Ravenclaw!Hermione would be unlikely to befriend Luna or Cho independently, but if canon!Padma was different enough from her sister, they might become friends. It would be interesting to see if Ravenclaw!Hermione had a bond with Flitwick similar to her bond with McGonagall in canon.

If Harry/Ron hadn't pushed them together and let them appreciate each other's different sides and get closer, though, I doubt Hermione would have befriended Ginny or Luna, although a Ravenclaw!Hermione would probably have intervened to stop Luna being bullied, given that she was intuitively protective of Neville on the Hogwarts Express.
