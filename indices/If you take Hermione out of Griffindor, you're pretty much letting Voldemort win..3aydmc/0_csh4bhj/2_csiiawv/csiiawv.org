One could argue that, except that, if it were to happen in a fic, it would be an authorial contrivance that either shows a lack of courage and creativity by rehashing canon (combined with grimderpness) or shows malice towards Hermione's character. If Hermione is in a different House, what uncontrived sequence of events could get her to that batroom at that time?
