Just because she's made OP in the films doesn't mean taking her out of gryffindor will let voldemort win. In PS she doesn't really help all that much. In chamber of secrets, yes she found out it was a basilisk but how much would it have changed Harry's plans if she didnt? In POA her only contribution was the timeturner which wasn't her it was an object. In GOF Harry manages it all without her. OotP yes she helps organise the DA and fight at the department of mysteries but it's not like they couldn't have made do if she wasn't there. HBP she does precisely jack all.They guys totally could have done the horcrux hunt without her. Finally Harry killed Voldemort because of a wand switch not because of Hermione.
