I don't think its laziness so much as having free time and friends for the first time in his life. Even if not abused as much as in fanon, canon!Harry as a child goes to school and is bullied, does what seems to be the lion's share of the housework and gardening, and literally lived in a dark cupboard under the stairs sleeping on a ratty blanket, never mind having toys or kindness shown him.

In that sense, Ron has always had companions and relative freedom, which is why his laziness is more of a vice, I think, while Hermione, although probably a lonely child, has likely had comfort and treats, as well as all the books she could want, from her middle-class dentist parents.
