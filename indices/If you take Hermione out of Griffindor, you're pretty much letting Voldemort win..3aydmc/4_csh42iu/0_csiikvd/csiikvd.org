I have mixed feelings on the subject. On the one hand, yeah, Harry is too much of an everyman. On the other hand, laziness is a perfectly rational behaviour for Harry in the face of Voldemort, because it's obvious that he isn't going to beat him through hard work and skill, and luck factors like sacrifical protection and brother wands aren't anything he can do anything to affect, so why not enjoy life, play Quiddich, hang out with Ron, etc.?
