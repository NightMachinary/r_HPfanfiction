Another thing occurred to me... Suppose that Hermione is Sorted Gryffindor, /but/ she runs to a different washroom, and misses the troll. So, not only is she not friends with Harry and Ron, she is actually angry at them over what she feels is a betrayal (because she thought that they were friends, and then Ron called her "nightmare"), not to mention annoyed at them for getting themselves (and, sometimes, her) into trouble. She refocuses on her own studies, much more reluctant to help others; she mostly hangs out with Ravenclaws.

Eight months later, Harry and Ron (and Neville and/or Seamus and/or Dean), having somehow solved the Philosopher Stone mystery without Hermione, prepare to go after the Philosopher's Stone, and proceed to run into her, and she is sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it. She knows the Petrificus Totalus jinx, and she's not afraid to use it...

And so, Hermione doomed the world through an excess of competence and common sense.
