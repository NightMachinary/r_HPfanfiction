Personally, I think Harry is actually incredibly capable, he's just had years of neglect and abuse at the hands of the dursley telling him he's not capable, and bc the story is told from his pov, we get these slight feelings of inadequacy that show through the book. Like, Harry is naturally gifted (he can make a patronus at age 13!!) and a leader.

I think the point of the golden trio is that they have certain roles to fulfill. the world wouldn't be saved if it wasn't for all three of them each performing an essential role that the other two perhaps couldn't or couldn't do as well). Hermione is gifted intellectually and knows how to look up information and make connections, Ron is REALLY good at putting together plans and seeing things in the long run and I would argue that as much as we joke that Ron isn't emotionally mature as Hermione, he understands Harry sometimes better than Hermione. Not to mention that Ron is the conduit to the Magical World. We take it for granted, but without Ron there are things that Harry and Hermione would never understand bc they didn't grow up in the wizarding world.

Just food for thought.
