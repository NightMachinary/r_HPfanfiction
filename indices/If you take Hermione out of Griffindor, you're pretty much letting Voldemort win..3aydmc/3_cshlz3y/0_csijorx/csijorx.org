  Personally, I think Harry is actually incredibly capable, he's just had years of neglect and abuse at the hands of the dursley telling him he's not capable, and bc the story is told from his pov, we get these slight feelings of inadequacy that show through the book.

We do? Yes, Dursleys suck, but Harry doesn't show any signs of what you describe. He regularly talks back to them and isn't shy about telling Hagrid that he does quite well in school. If this is about him wanting to be "just Harry", I'd say that people who thrive on being tabloid celebrities --- which Harry is, in the Wizarding world --- are a tiny minority, and Harry likes being known for things he feels are his and that he enjoys --- like Quiddich. (Would you really rather read 7 books with Gilderoy Lockhart as a protagonist? OK, well, maybe...)

  Like, Harry is naturally gifted (he can make a patronus at age 13!!) and a leader.

I think that's overstating the case a bit. Judging from canon evidence, the only reason why most adults can't cast it is that it's only taught at the DADA NEWT level, and only a small fraction of the populace takes that, especially in peacetime. 14-year-olds were able to make progress on it in a few weeks, investing much less time and effort into it than Harry. Harry was practicing before a Boggart, yes, but that speaks to his emotional disposition more than skill: the very same disposition --- wearing his heart on his sleeve --- that lets him push through Dementors and cast a Patronus also cripples his Occlumency, so it's a trade-off.

Harry's biggest gifts are not magical --- it's his ridiculous dexterity and reflexes and his stubbornness under fire. Had he been a Squib, he could have been a champion race car driver, a stunt pilot, or a special forces commando.

As for leadership, I don't see it. The main reason people other than his close friends listen to him is that he is the Boy-Who-Lived (and, later, TWT winner). He is not organised, does not plan, does not manage resources. His biggest leadership experience --- Dumbledore's Army --- was organised by Hermione with Harry as an instructor and a figurehead. His major acts of "leadership" end in disaster as often as not, with the Department of Mysteries visit being the most prominent.

  I think the point of the golden trio is that they have certain roles to fulfill. the world wouldn't be saved if it wasn't for all three of them each performing an essential role that the other two perhaps couldn't or couldn't do as well). Hermione is gifted intellectually and knows how to look up information and make connections, Ron is REALLY good at putting together plans and seeing things in the long run and I would argue that as much as we joke that Ron isn't emotionally mature as Hermione, he understands Harry sometimes better than Hermione. Not to mention that Ron is the conduit to the Magical World. We take it for granted, but without Ron there are things that Harry and Hermione would never understand bc they didn't grow up in the wizarding world.

I like this vision, but I think that this is more like what Ron /could have been/. Unfortunately, Hermione gets to be Sailor Exposition in canon, and Ron's potential is underused, and Ron's planning skills are limited to chess. :(

Also, Hermione isn't just good at looking up information, she's also very, very good at magic. People often forget that.
