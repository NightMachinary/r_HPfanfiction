First, I would pay my weight in gold to read books about Gilderoy Lockhart because that would be HYSTERICAL. I will retract my opinions on Harry having slight feelings of inadequacy though.

Re: harry being gifted and the patronus: I'm using my skills as a teacher to make this judgement: usually you only introduce certain skill sets earlier or later because students cannot handle them earlier. I introduce MLA in 9th grade, but it won't really stick until 11th grade (it's just a maturity thing). I think Harry is naturally bright, though, and his magical skills can't be forgotten. He learned accio in a night (it feels--in thanks to Hermione who practiced with him). I also agree that Harry's non-magical skills are what push him to be as excellent as he is. Do I think he's Hermione level amazing @ school? No. Ahhh, our boy.

Harry is also thrust into a leadership position BECAUSE he is the boy who lived, is what I'm getting at. There are a lot of people who flounder in leadership positions and while Harry repeatedly says that he would rather he WASN'T in this type of position, he does take up the mantle quite well. The DoM is definitely something that backfires on him, but I think that is in part thanks to the emotional pull he felt because he thought Sirius was in trouble. You don't go on to be the youngest head of Aurors by being poor at leadership.

As for Ron's planning being limited to chess, he's actually super instrumental in DH when it came to breaking into the ministry to steal the locket, not to mention after that he has the idea to get the basilisk fangs, etc. His brilliance is sprinkled all throughout the books but they are often overshadowed by Hermione. I still stand by the fact that it is Ron that provides the magical background that Hermione and Harry do not have. I'm 99% sure there is a scene in the books where Ron is like "why are you researching this? This is the answer--" bc it's basic wizarding knowledge.

I love Hermione a LOT but I feel like the fandom as a whole has this tendency to shove themselves squarely up her butthole and forget that she has her shortcomings as much as the other two. (AND YES. HERMIONE IS SO EXCELLENT AT MAGIC AND I LOVE THAT. MUGGLEBORN AND KICKING ASS).
