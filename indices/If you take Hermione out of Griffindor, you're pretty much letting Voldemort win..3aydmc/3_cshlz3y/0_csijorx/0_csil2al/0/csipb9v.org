  First, I would pay my weight in gold to read books about Gilderoy Lockhart because that would be HYSTERICAL.

Yeah, I know. I realised that as soon as I typed that line.

  Re: harry being gifted and the patronus: I'm using my skills as a teacher to make this judgement: usually you only introduce certain skill sets earlier or later because students cannot handle them earlier.
#+end_quote

That may be true for the sorts of skills everyone has to learn or skills that have other skills as hard prerequisites --- and even there, it's a matter of prioritising: mathematics may be an integrated body of knowledge, but one can teach fractions and negative numbers in either order. Patronus, however, is an elective. From what we see about people learning it, it's taught in the NEWTs because it's completely useless to anyone who doesn't deal with Dementors (and doesn't know Dumbledore's trick of using them to send messages), so there's no point wasting most students' time during the pre-OWL years.

Now that I think about it, I am not sure whether there exists a Muggle discipline that's anything like Charms. Unlike Potions and Transfiguration, which appear to build up coherent bodies of knowledge and skill, each Charm is a discrete spell, and while some are more difficult than others, they can be learned in nearly any order. Maybe it's like learning a new dance or a new piece on a musical instrument?

Anyway, notice that Remus was the one who suggested the Patronus Charm, and he didn't portray it as a very long shot, and it wasn't a surprise that he pulled it off. My headcanon is that most wizards and witches think that the Patronus Charm is harder than it is due to Ministry propaganda: it reduces the effectiveness of their preferred terror weapon.

Ultimately, I think that Harry is plenty bright, but the word "gifted" is a bit stronger than that; and fanon often treats him as this untapped genius...

  I introduce MLA in 9th grade, but it won't really stick until 11th grade (it's just a maturity thing). I think Harry is naturally bright, though, and his magical skills can't be forgotten. He learned accio in a night (it feels--in thanks to Hermione who practiced with him).
#+end_quote

I don't think that's accurate. After the Summoning Charm was introduced in the Charms class, he spent a long time trying to learn it and failing miserably: from GoF, "Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework -- the only person to get any, apart from Neville." He did, eventually, get it, at the last minute, but it took a long time to work up to that.

  Harry is also thrust into a leadership position BECAUSE he is the boy who lived, is what I'm getting at. There are a lot of people who flounder in leadership positions and while Harry repeatedly says that he would rather he WASN'T in this type of position, he does take up the mantle quite well.
#+end_quote

The way you wrote it, it sounded like a character trait or talent, rather than a position. Overall, I think that a lot of people do a lot of things on Harry's behalf or in Harry's name (e.g., Potterwatch), but him actually leading people in any meaningful way? We don't see much of it either way. Neville gets to do more "leading" off-screen in DH than Harry does through all the books.

#+begin_quote
  The DoM is definitely something that backfires on him, but I think that is in part thanks to the emotional pull he felt because he thought Sirius was in trouble. You don't go on to be the youngest head of Aurors by being poor at leadership.
#+end_quote

I'm sure he's perfectly competent as an adult, but he's had a decade to learn. (Also, he defeated Voldemort with a Disarming Charm. How could they /not/ offer him the job? :P)

#+begin_quote
  As for Ron's planning being limited to chess, he's actually super instrumental in DH when it came to breaking into the ministry to steal the locket, not to mention after that he has the idea to get the basilisk fangs, etc.
#+end_quote

OK, you may be right. I admit I kinda skimmed DH.

#+begin_quote
  His brilliance is sprinkled all throughout the books but they are often overshadowed by Hermione. I still stand by the fact that it is Ron that provides the magical background that Hermione and Harry do not have. I'm 99% sure there is a scene in the books where Ron is like "why are you researching this? This is the answer--" bc it's basic wizarding knowledge.
#+end_quote

I can't think of an instance, though I'll take your word for it... There ought ought to be many, though.

#+begin_quote
  I love Hermione a LOT but I feel like the fandom as a whole has this tendency to shove themselves squarely up her butthole and forget that she has her shortcomings as much as the other two.
#+end_quote

Indeed. The weird thing is that people feel compelled to invent flaws for her (like Authority Worship), when her canon flaws like her belief that she knows better for everyone and her casual ruthlessness when she feels justified are much more interesting. (Briefly, take Harry and make him a Dumbledore-grade genius; you'll get a guy who spends even less time on coursework to spend more on Quiddich and hanging out with friends, and breezes through what challenges do arise, coasting on raw talent. Now, take Hermione and make her a Dumbledore-grade genius; she'll be figuring out what sort of Greater Good she wants to impose on the world a week into her first year at Hogwarts.)
