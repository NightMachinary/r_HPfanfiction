I can admit it's been a while since I've read GoF so I'll actually take your word for it when it comes to the summoning charm. And I agree that gifted is too strong a word. He's just bright, which fits his character. Tbh, my fav. part about Harry are those scenes where Ron's like "wanna go play Quidditch?" and Harry throws down his quill and is like FUCK YEAH. I like him 'normal', if that makes sense.

And I COMPLETELY agree with everything you've said about Hermione. She's such a dynamic character that there doesn't need to be 'invented' flaws.
