  Someone's a bit biased and should probably stop confusing fannon with cannon when he's lecturing someone about cannon.

  Also false facts. Ignoring the fact that teenagers are teenagers.
#+end_quote

These are my points...

You are using things that aren't canon, you sound incredibly biased in your views (Dumbledore good, harry bad), teenagers have actual reasons for being stupid and hard headed (they are teenagers and have hormones) especially considering that no one was there to help Harry grow other than other teenagers.

You realize that trauma is a serious thing, right? This sentence is so infuriating to me.

  Dumbledore had a damn good reason why he avoided Harry during his fifth year.
#+end_quote

What reason?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had to sacrifice himself to do it
#+end_quote

What? No! Dumbledore died because he put on the cursed ring. He didn't prepare enough/wasn't able to resist the pull of the resurrection stone (since he wants to talk to his dead sister).

Dumbledore didn't have to die for Harry to kill Voldemort.

  Besides, his plan worked, no?
#+end_quote

Just because a stupid and extremely dangerous plan worked, didn't mean it wasn't stupid and extremely dangerous.

  antagonizes Snape
#+end_quote

Snape, /a teacher/, started antagonizing him from the very first time Harry entered his classroom.

  Also, canon Harry is an idiot. He had to have his hand held from the start by Hermoine.
#+end_quote

Maybe in the movies.
