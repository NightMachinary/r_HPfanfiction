.... the books are for children, mate. Most of those titles could be nothing more than just that, titles. Not actual job description. Besides, his plan worked, no? Harry won against a wizard with decades of experience, and Dumbledore had to sacrifice himself to do it. He is NOT incompetent.

Also, canon Harry is an idiot. He had to have his hand held from the start by Hermoine. Seriously. Wtf? He barely studied, antagonizes Snape, can't concentrate for shit in Occulamancy, etc etc. Easily baited by freaking nightmares, and Dumbledore had a damn good reason why he avoided Harry during his fifth year.

Harry thinks too highly of himself when Dumbledore refuses to meet him during that year. I mean, wtf?
