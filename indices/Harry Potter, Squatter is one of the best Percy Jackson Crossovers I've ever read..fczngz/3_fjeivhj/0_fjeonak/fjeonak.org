It's practically canon Dumbledore, but looked at from the a different perspective.

- Stuck his nose into something he had no business doing.
- Messed with something he had no knowledge about.
- Too many jobs.
- Did nothing when he could have done something.
- Thinks too highly of himself.

Then you add the fact that it's from the POV of the Gods. They have infinite hindsight and extra knowledge. Add in the fact that some of them are curse-happy. It's not bashing, it's all accurate reactions and representations.
