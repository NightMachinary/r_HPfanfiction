Sure, but it's all about what an author decides to do with it and what aspects they wanna explore. Gods are entitled, it comes with what they are, but there are sides to them too and I am more forgiving of that since they're old and stuck in their ways. Even with HP raised in that kind of enviroment he is exposed to Hestia the most and I want that to balance it out /personally/ since his past is what it is. I can understand a direction an author takes with a story, still wish differently and even so enjoy it.
