I really liked it. Read it last night. I would have liked some sort of thought and backlash to Harry's actions in some moments (mostly in relation to Artemis and her Hunters) but I get it so I ignore it.

... well maybe not backlash but I dunno, he's very pushy and it's painted as cute, and I know where it's leading up to so it just nags at me a bit. Especially when he's painted as so /special/ in relation to it while they just sorta support him along. I like that Artemis and ZoÃ« does draw lines with him but would have liked to see more of it and some introspection surrounding it but he's also nine so... /shrug/.

His relationship with Hestia is so sweet though. 10/10.
