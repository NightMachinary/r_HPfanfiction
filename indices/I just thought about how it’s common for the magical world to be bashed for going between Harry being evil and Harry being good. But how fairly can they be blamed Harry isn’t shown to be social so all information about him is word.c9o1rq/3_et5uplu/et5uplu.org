I think the main problem of Harry is how fast people opinions change : 1st year he and his friends loose 150 points, so he is treated like a pariah until the leaving Feast where he wins the House Cup and he becomes a Hero for 3/4 of the school. 2nd year he is accused of being the Heir of Slytherin and treated like a pariah until he solves the mystery and win the House Cup. 4th year, most of the school treat him like shit when he becomes he champion (until the Gryffindors seem happy ), and after he does well in the 1st Task he is treated well again. Finally the whole 5th year where he jumped from "attention seeking liar " to "chosen one " in one evening.

Some changes in opinion are understandable, mainly the return of Voldemort. Not a lot of people know about Horcruxe, most didn't want to believe it and he did stay low. And most of these change in opinion can be explained by Rowling desire "to reset " the school (Harry is not sociable mainly to keep the character count low, and I dont want to start a book by reading 3 pages of text who list precisely who Harry is friend with and who he is not ). But from the character point of view, it can be annoying.

Some older guy who did'nt talk to you in month will come to say well done and act all friendly.\\
The Hupplepuff who refused to be near you will come just to make small talk. This girl who sneered at you and potentially wore a "Potter stinks " badge will ask to be your date for the ball. These girls who laughed at you will suddenly be all filtry, sneering at the friends who actually stood by you.

So yeah the change in opinion can be understandable. And I do hope some scene happened outside of the books (like Smith saying he was sorry for how he acted in CoS). But all these events can explain why Harry is generally pissed at people. Though bashing them might be a little too strong, and Harry is rarely likeable in these kind of fics (if ever).
