People tend to look at famous people differently than they do normal people though. While I disagree with it, kids are raised â€˜knowing' that Harry Potter is a larger than life figure. Also I think the marks don't prove anything. Unless I missed something, there's nothing saying that the dark mark had to be willingly taken. How many death eaters other than snape would show their dark mark had darkened? The average people don't see it and considering snape is one of dumbledores people, there's no way that he would be considered good evidence. BCJ was under the imperious for years after being in Azkaban as a fanatically loyal follower. Who's to say he didn't fake it as an homage to his lord? Not to mention he was kissed right away so there's no official questioning.

Remember I'm talking about the average person. Not the higher ups. How often did dumbledore or Harry speak out with anything than what Harry said happened? It to me seems like a he said she said moment. Does veritiserum exist? Yes but I'm pretty sure it's canon that it's not infallible plus he is a minor. Pensieve? Assuming it's rare and thus not exceedingly common, memories can be faked and who's to say someone else didn't fake the memory for Harry to support his story.

Your government tells you Harry is insane. Just about every news source agrees. Harry has no proof that it happened other than as said above.
