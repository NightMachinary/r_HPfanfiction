Bellatrix. Bellatrix would happily tell them her mark had darkened. Not to mention the amount of "imperiused" former Death Eaters walking around. One was even a Ministry employee. BCJ /was/ evidence, which was why McGonagall and Dumbledore were upset.

Harry has no reason to speak out. He's 11-17. Dumbledore, I'm sure spoke out on many things.

As for the average person if my government let a mass murderer slip through their fingers /and/ if their had been a dark mark in the sky 9 months before, I'd hesitate to trust their word.
