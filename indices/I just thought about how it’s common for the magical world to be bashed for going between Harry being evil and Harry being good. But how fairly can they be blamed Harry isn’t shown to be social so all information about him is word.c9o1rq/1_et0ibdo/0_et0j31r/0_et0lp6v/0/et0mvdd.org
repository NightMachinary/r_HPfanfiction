Which is more believable Voldemort taught black tricks on how to escape as his right hand man or Voldemort helping him. Wasn't Alcatraz seen as impossible to break out of but someone supposedly did? There's a major difference between mass murderer escaping and deadly magical terrorist coming back from the dead.

Everyone knows Voldemort died that night and it's supposed to be impossible to come back from the dead. Nobody WANTS to believe he could be back. Bellatrix says he's back. She's been in Azkaban for years and how many people are going to brave Azkaban and how many would be allowed to see bellatrix Lestrange and other death eaters to ask to see their mark as proof. I doubt the average person would understand anything about the dark mark. All they know is it's on people's arms and match's the symbol thrown into the air by death eaters. The World Cup incident wasn't related to Voldemort at all. Crouch legitimately threw the dark mark without actually knowing Voldemort was as back.

Which seems more plausible? Major fear monger deadly wizard Voldemort comes back from the dead or a few insane/disgruntled death eaters wanting for the good ole days when Voldemort was around relieving their finest moments. Keep in mind you shouldn't look at it from Harry Potter or his friends or dumbledores point of view. Look at it from the POV of the average joe.
