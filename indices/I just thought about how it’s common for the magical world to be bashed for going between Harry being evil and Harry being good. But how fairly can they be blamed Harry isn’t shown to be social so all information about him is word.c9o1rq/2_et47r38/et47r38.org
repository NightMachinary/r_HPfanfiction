Yes, this is a good point and it ties into Rowlings' faults as a writer. Because her envisioned story involves a paragon of goodness winning via love and morality and that isn't compatible with Harry or Dumbledore being clever and sneaky and fighting, so he doesn't do what anyone with a brain would do and put the tiniest bit of effort into his public perception, do an interview or two, and make use of his Boy-Who-Lived status.

Ultimately, I think JK felt like it would "taint" Harry to have him leverage his fame or put work into PR, and so instead he just sits by and gets slandered constantly. However, she also wanted us to feel sorry for him and to see the WW as fickle and easily manipulated, which as you point out doesn't really scan too well when you consider how useless Harry is at getting his side across.

It's kinda like how JK wanted the "chosen one abandoned to abusive relatives" trope, but also wanted Harry to be a happy, well-adjusted, friendly person with no lasting trauma. So we get Harry being locked in a cupboard for 11 years and emerging from it as if it was normal and fine.
