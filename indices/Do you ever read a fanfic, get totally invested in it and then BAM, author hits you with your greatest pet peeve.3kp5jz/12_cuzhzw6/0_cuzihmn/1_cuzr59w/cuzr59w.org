Y'know what I think is funny about mpreg? I doubt that any mpreg story is written by gay men. From my understanding, them having babies from sleeping around would 'take all the fun out of it'.

It's the girls who are goo-ing over their concept of men who act like girls but still have to be men, and thinking 'aren't men just adorable when they have to do women things like hold babies?'.

Aside from my many other deranged ideas, I feel a compulsion to scribe a bear-like gay friendly version of this involving Hagrid and Firenze.

"It's a natural thing, Firenzey! Now just 'old still while I pull out the ol' umbrella."

"My dear gamekeeper, by you wielding your pink parasol you are defying nature. Such is the truth of wizardkinnn-- DON'T OPEN THAT THERE!"
