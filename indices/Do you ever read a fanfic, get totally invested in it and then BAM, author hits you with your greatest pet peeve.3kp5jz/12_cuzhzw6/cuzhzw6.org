Any fic that solves every single issue Harry has with; training for a year, rereading old textbooks, cutting out his entire support network so he has no one and finally using knowledge freely available to /anyone/ who goes to Hogwarts.

You want Harry to have a unique ability? Fine. Fawkes gives him phoenix powers, lets see what you can do.

Harry's inexplicably powerful? Fine, go for it.

Time travelling spirit of future Harry tells him everything he needs to know and sends him to a time compressed Japanese school (linkffn(30 minutes that changed everything)). Awesome.

But Harry takes Ancient Runes and destroys the world? Fuck that, anyone can do that, Voldemort probably did if it's really that powerful.

On an unrelated note. Mpreg.

Oh or America being this utopia with 'technomancy' or some shit.
