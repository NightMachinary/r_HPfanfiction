I'm not a massive fan of first year fics that have romance in them. I just find it jarring, and vaguely disquieting. I remember one time travel fanfic that I can't recall the name of that had the future!Harry wryly observe that Ron seemed to like Hermione /on the train ride there/.

Adding, of course, that I'm not a Ron/Hermione fan...
