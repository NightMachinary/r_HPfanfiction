I've read some of this, got pretty far in and then just couldn't take it anymore. I think it was at the point before Hogwarts that I stopped. It was good, but with all that Harry had access to he still only saw one side and thought the wizarding world the enemy. It made me want to bang my head, Harry was so blind!!!!
