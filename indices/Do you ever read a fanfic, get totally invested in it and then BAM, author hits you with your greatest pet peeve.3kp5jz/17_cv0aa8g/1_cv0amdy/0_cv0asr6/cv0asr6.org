Actually, portraying the conflict between the muggle/magical worlds was one of the story's strong points. It's actually snowballing into what looks to be a cold war between the two worlds as of the latest chapter.

Yes, Harry has an incredibly biased viewpoint at first, but remember that he is being spoonfed information by one side only, and the Order's actions don't exactly help things in that regard. What else is he supposed to believe? His viewpoint becomes much more nuanced once he has access to the wizarding side of things.

The story gets much, much better around the part where you ditched it, so I'd recommend picking it up again if you're interested.
