This is currently happening to me. I am happily into the 13th chapter of The Snape Chronicles (A Difference in Family), and the author keeps jumping conversations without telling the readers if one character can still hear them or not. It's not so much my biggest pet peeve rather than it's super confusing and I sometimes have to read passages 4-5 times just to figure out it Snape can hear the conversations.

Just ugh, making things difficult.
