Wow, what a list!

(On the Katniss thing, she didn't get pregnant till after everything was said and done. Plus the main reason she didn't want kids is gone. She didn't want to put any child through that, a sentiment probably not very uncommon in her world. As for marrying Peeta, it wasn't a wrong choice, those two were bonded on a level far deeper than what she had with Gale, who she couldn't even be near at the end of the series because of what happened to Prim)
