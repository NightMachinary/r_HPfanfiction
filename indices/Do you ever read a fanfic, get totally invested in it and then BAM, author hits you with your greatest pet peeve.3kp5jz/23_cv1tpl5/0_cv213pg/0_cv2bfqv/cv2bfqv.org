I don't agree - Peeta was just the safe choice (come on, the guy is plain boring and unremarkable, while she is damned exciting and capable and - IMHO - special (as in: I'd love to go on a date with her!)), it could/should have been anyone else if she couldn't stand Gale anymore :( (Peeta is like a fallback point, a safe position...sure he loves her, but IMHO he doesn't deserve her (because compared to her he's just an average jock IMHO)...and it's bad enough she's using him (at least that's what I think) like that, just because she knows he will make for an obedient hubby -.- (come on, she needs someone who can stand up to her - which IMHO he can't, no I am not saying he is totally whipped, but he isn't a very dominant person either))

Yeah, Prim...I never understood why she thinks her sister is that special (but maybe I am just a coldhearted asshole, as I don't know any people I would be willing to put my life on the line for - not even my last GF who I was (IMHO) very much in love with (I'd have done a lot for her, but not sacrifice myself!))

Oh and independent women (she's a great example IMHO) with children are just another peeve of mine (I don't think she only didn't want kids because of the circumstances - to me it sounded like she didn't like kids, so it's kind of a 180 for me that she has kids now!)
