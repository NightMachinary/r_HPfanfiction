Yeah, I've had this happen...there's several peeves (some only concern Harry Potter - others though concern other fanfiction and works of original fiction, too) I have and a lot of authors don't warn you - probably because they don't think that writing about certain things is just a no-go for certain people (that's why I love sites that use tags for that sort of thing, so that you can avoid your peeves, though such a system is not a guarantee, as writers can change their stories or continue them differently (sometimes they haven't even completed the plot when they start writing))

For me, some of those peeves involve (not a complete list, I'd be here for a rather long time if I wanted to list all my peeves about Harry Potter alone!):

- Slash (with characters that have a stated sexual preference or just - IMHO - don't fit together, like Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy or - even worse IMHO - Tom Riddle aka Voldemort...come on the guy killed his parents, Harry wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole!)

- pregnancy (particularly in school - damned, teenage-pregnancy should be avoided at all costs, not encouraged with stupid stories -.- not to mention that as someone who identifies as "childfree" (meaning I just don't want to have children, at all!) normally doesn't like reading about babies (I know, I am strange, I read fiction intended for teenagers but I don't like children...), not to mention that a pregnancy changes everything...hell, it can totally ruin a character (like Katniss from "The Hunger Games" who never wanted children and even hooked up with the "wrong guy" (my opinion!) in the end or Sonea from "The black magicians guild" -.-)

- male-pregnancy (ties in with Slash)...not only is that IMPOSSIBLE (unless the "male" in question has had an incomplete sex-change or something like that, as normal males (at least of the human species) don't get preggers!)

- mary-sues (Oh, I like reading about god-like characters, but even those should make at least some mistakes (someone who doesn't is no joy to read about!))

- total change of universe (I like alternate universes, changes to characters (as long as it's not the sexual orientation) etc. but I don't like it if people change the premises, like putting the Harry Potter characters in our world and magic not existing or say writing a Twilight fanfiction without any vampires in it -.- ("all human")...)

- using an interesting ability/plot-device and then later totally forgetting about it (writers of original fiction do this, too...plotholes anyone? -.-), even if it would be a damned good solution for a problem (yes, it can happen...but explaining why it does or why it wouldn't work is always better (like say: Harry remembers the mirror to speak with Sirius in HP, but the mirror is broken...the other thing, that he doesn't seem to remember, is just plain bad writing!)

- total stupidity of a character (or several), just because it serves the plot -.-
