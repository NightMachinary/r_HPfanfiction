I like it when they make it reasonable. Though I like adoption too. What Makes A Family by Stump Pan had Harry as James and Lily' child, but only James died. Snape and Lily mend their relationship and Remus, Sirius, and Severus grow up in a reasonable fashion. I like it. Sure it might be ooc but I like the mature versions.

I liked this one until Snape wasn't in love with Lily romantically (if I remember correctly) and he's gay, having a thing for Remus.......ugh, the concept was great till that tripe came barfing up.
