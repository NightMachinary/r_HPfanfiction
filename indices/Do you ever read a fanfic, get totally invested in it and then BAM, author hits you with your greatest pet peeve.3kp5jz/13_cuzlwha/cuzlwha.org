Digging for Bones. Why, oh why, did I not read that last line. The only way I can see making Snape a likable character is via the abused!Harry route. It is reasonable given his own past for this to be a catalyst for him to see past the appearance to the person. And since Snape is, when not busy being an embittered childish asshole, a very interesting character with a lot of depth.

Given the way the story was going: not too hard on the tropes, a reasonably intriguing premise, characters that are at least moderately as they are in canon...it broke my heart that they pulled that bullshit. There is no such thing as a valid reason for making Snape Harry's biological father, in my mind. Harry is Lily and James' son, and honestly anything else will make me immediately close the tab.
