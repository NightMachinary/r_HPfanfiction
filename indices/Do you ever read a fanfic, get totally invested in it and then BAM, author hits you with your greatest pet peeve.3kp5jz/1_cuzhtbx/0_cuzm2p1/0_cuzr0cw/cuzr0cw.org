"Hiatus" is code for "I feel really bad about abandoning a fic, so I'll just say it's a hiatus and never update again."

An author's note at the beginning of a fic saying "I hate abandoned stories, so I'm going to finish this no matter how slow the updates get, don't worry!" means "guess what year the last update was in, 'cause it sure wasn't 2015"
