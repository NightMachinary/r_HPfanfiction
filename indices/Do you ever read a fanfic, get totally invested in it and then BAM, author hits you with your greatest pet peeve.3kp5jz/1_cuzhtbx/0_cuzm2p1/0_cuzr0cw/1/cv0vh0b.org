  "Hiatus" is code for "I feel really bad about abandoning a fic, so I'll just say it's a hiatus and never update again."

I hate that authors do this. If you had the balls to admit you quit writing it, I'd respect you. Marking an incomplete story as complete without leaving an "abandoned" warning is just utter bullshit...it's like they want people to hate them.
