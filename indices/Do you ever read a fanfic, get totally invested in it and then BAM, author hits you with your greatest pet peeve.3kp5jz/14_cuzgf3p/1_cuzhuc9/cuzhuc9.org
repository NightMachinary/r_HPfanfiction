I think for things like that you just need to separate the fic from canon mentally. Think of it like this, Hedwig is a character in Harry Potter. So logically she will appear in a Harry Potter fanfiction and how that happens is just up to the author.

In the same way linkffn(reign of the serpent) has a complete AU where Slytherin is still alive and rules Britain the headmaster is Tom Riddle, leader of the feared Death Eater Squad who helped fight in the ongoing war against the terrorist Order of the Phoenix and great European threat Grindlewald. There's absolutely no reason for any of those characters to appear, but they do because it's fanfiction.
