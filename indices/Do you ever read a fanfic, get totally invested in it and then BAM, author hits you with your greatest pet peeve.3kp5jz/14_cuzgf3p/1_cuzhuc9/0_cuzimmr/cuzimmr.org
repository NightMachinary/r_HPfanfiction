Separating canon from a derivative story is one thing; I've read and enjoyed many a story where canon was treated as nothing more than a loose guideline and the whole thing quickly went massively AU.

What irks me is not a story being AU, but blatant and unnecessary rail-roading that stinks of laziness and makes me expect the quality of anything from that point onwards to crash through the floor and continue falling.

And names ... honestly, I might be weird as far as that is concerned, but for me names are ... not really that important. Maybe it would have been different had people used just one name to call me, but since they don't (and I'm not talking just about variants) and I got used to names not being “sacred” or “unchanging”, they're just not an exception from the whole “when things are changed, there are changes” thing and leaving them the same without any explanation for it when there clearly is a reason to change them is still something I perceive as rail-roading.
