Hmm ... I don't remember the story right now, but it was one of the many “whatever character from other series adopts Harry for this-or-that reason, and then things change in whatever way because of it” stories, and what it did to me was having Hedwig named ... Hedwig.

Thing is, Hedwig was named the way she was because Harry had no idea how to name her and then decided to use a name he'd found in one of the books. For another character entirely, one who grew up in another culture (not on Earth, even) and had no reason to give this particular name to anything, let alone get this one specific owl and name this bird that, that's just terrible rail-roading. And yes, it's not even really a bad example of it, but after seeing so many stories where terrible stupidity and stupid terribleness were paired with rail-roading, it just left a distaste that wouldn't disappear and /that/ was /it/.
