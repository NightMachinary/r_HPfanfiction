Heh, I do like it when he's bashed, but I do think it's not the best form for writing, so I'm trying to treat him as fairly as I can in my own story. It's very hard to not let my dislike of his character shine through, but I'm making most of the bad stuff into the opinion of the main character, instead of a fact of the story. And I'll have Harry defend Ron against her on some occasions to make up for it.

The main character also dislikes Unicorns (vicious beasts), doesn't mean unicorns are evil in the story. This seemed like the best way to work around my own dislike for him.

I don't get why people get so upset by bashing though, Hermione is generally my favourite character yet I've read and enjoyed stories where she was bashed a lot. It's like inserting too many puns into your writing for me, it's not good writing but it can be amusing at times.
