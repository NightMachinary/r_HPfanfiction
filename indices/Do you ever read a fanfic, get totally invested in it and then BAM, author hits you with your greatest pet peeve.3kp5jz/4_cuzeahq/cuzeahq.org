I tried reading Hope by Jeconais, and I wouldn't say I was totally invested in it, but I did at least try to get past the rampant cheesiness. Once Harry and Gabrielle started quoting poetry to each other in some fancy French restaurant though, I just couldn't take it anymore. There are so many cringe-worthy moments in just those first couple of chapters alone (in my opinion) that I honestly don't know how people could actually enjoy and recommend it till this day.
