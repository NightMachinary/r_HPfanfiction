I mean, there's no distinction in the books and there's no sense of any political agenda motivating the Death Eaters other than genocide.

I think there's a lack of a believably complex political agenda that Voldemort presumably used to persuade people to join him (back when he had a human face and was handsome and charming). I don't think the political agenda was necessarily preserving wizarding culture though.

I get what you're saying though. Even if we fans fill in the gaps Rowling left by making part of the D.E. agenda preserving wizarding culture from muggle influences, the Malfoy's are racist bigots in cannon, and that addition to Voldemort's agenda shouldn't be used to redeem them because they're "cunts".
