I'm not saying he's innocent of all crimes, but /irredeemable/ is something different altogether. Irredeemable says there's no chance of him ever becoming the kind of person that wouldn't do those things again if it were possible to change it. I don't think he'd ever become a shining paragon of virtue, but I think it's clear from DH and what Rowling's said that he's at least changed /somewhat/.
