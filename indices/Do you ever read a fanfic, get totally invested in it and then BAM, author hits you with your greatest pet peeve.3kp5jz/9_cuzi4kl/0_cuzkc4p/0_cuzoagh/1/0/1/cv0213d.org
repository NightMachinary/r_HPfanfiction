  I wouldn't call being unable to go through with it but still being present when Snape killed Dumbledore "assisted murder".

No, but coming up with the plan and assisting in its execution was. Any (Muggle) court of law would find Draco guilty in an instant if they had all the facts we do: he attempted to kill Dumbledore several times, leading to the severe injury and almost-death of two people in the attempt, before finally succeeding. The fact that he wasn't the one to pull the trigger means he gets assisted murder and not murder, but it doesn't absolve him of all guilt.

Being brought up in a certain way doesn't excuse him. The law assumes the existence of free will, as do most moral systems. Further, duress cannot excuse murder, neither legally or morally. Being under duress might make his actions understandable, but they do not excuse them. Both the law and morality expects a person in that situation to die rather than kill another.

So, list of crimes:

Two counts of attempted murder on Albus Dumbledore (necklace, poison)

Attempted murder on Katie Bell (necklace, by transferred malice)

Attempted murder on Ron Weasley (posion, by transferred malice)

Conspiracy to commit murder on Albus Dumbledore (helping Snape kill him)

Grievous bodily harm on Katie Bell (necklace)

Assisted grievous bodily harm on Bill Weasley (Fenrir Greyback attack)

Treason

Terrorism

Crimes Against Humanity/War crimes

A good majority of these were committed after reaching adulthood. Further, the earlier ones he was still old enough to be tried as an adult under English law anyway.

This isn't even really a narrow thing. If Draco Malfoy stood trial in an English criminal court, he would receive multiple life sentences. He's not a misled boy, he's cruel and evil.
