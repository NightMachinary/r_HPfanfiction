Eh. I agree with [[/u/Taure]] here more for most part. You say that he's capable of change, but you should remember that Draco's a coward, and will ultimately do what's best for him, even if he hates himself for it. Even at the end of DH, he was willing to capture Harry to redeem himself and his family in the eyes of Voldemort, and he was supporting the Death Eaters even after Harry saved his life.

Do I think that Draco would remain the same petty bully and rascist shit he was before the war for the rest of his life, even after all that he's witnessed and experienced? I don't think so, so in that way he's capable of change. On the other hand I do think he would once again commit those sort of crimes if his life was at stake again, because he's a coward at heart, and he would once again take the cowardly way out, even if he hates himself for it.

He reminds me a lot of Peter Pettigrew, really. More loyal to his friends/family perhaps, but no loyalty to principles.
