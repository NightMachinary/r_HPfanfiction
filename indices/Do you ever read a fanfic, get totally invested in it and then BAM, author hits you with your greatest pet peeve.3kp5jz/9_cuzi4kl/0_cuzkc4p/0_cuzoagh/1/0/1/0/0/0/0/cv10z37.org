You don't get to draw a line around a certain part of your life and pretend it never happened though. You can't help kill someone and then say "hey guys, I've changed now, so you have to treat me like that never happened". Draco will be a murderer for all of his life, and murderers are not good people. There is no amount of change that can make Draco not a murderer.

I mean, just think about how you would react to someone in real life who, when they were 17 and 18 years old, attempted to kill one of their teachers and severely injured two of their classmates, before going on to participate in a genocide. Would you ever be comfortable around them, no matter how rehabilitated they seemed? Surely you would at best nervously tolerate their presence, always wondering when they might snap and kill someone else.
