  I wouldn't call being unable to go through with it but still being present when Snape killed Dumbledore "assisted murder".

It is the definition of assisted murder. He is responsible for everything but the final blow. Without him that event would never have taken place.

As for the Pottermore stuff it essentially boils down to 'cool motive, still murder'.

Draco is racist and at best his redeemable qualities are that he feels guilty about not doing the bare minimum required to be a decent human being. Heck, his last words in canon are begging Death Eaters not to harm him because he's on there side, his last non-epilogue actions are trying to capture Harry for the Dark Lord.

I also think it's pretty telling that it's Astoria, not Draco, teaching their kids that muggleborns aren't scum.
