Yeah I get that. I have a problem with how quickly people try to make it happen though. Draco is irredeemable in the context of Hogwarts stories. You want to make a Good!Draco post DH story, go right ahead. I can't stand Drarry or Dramione for this reason, one or both characters have to be complete OOC for the story to have any sort of basis in reality.
