Depends what you mean by "superior".

Wizards are superior in abilities, sure, but in human worth? Whatever it is that makes human life and liberty valuable, Muggles surely have it in equal amounts, which means racism against them is /not/ justified. You can exclude them from your private club on the basis that they lack the qualification to enter it, but you can't justify treating them as of lower moral worth.

To hold otherwise is to say that a person's worth depends on their abilities. That's a difficult moral position to maintain, and dangerous besides. For a start, it applies between individuals, not just between groups. Further, it also applies to the group attempting to look down on another group - if wizards can treat Muggles as having less worth than wizards, then any species superior to wizards in abilities can justifiably treat wizards as inferior in worth to them.
