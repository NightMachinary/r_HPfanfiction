  That is the natural order of things without human ethics applicated to it, is it not?

Not really. The only way to determine the order of abilities is with human subjective biases. Why does ability with magic mean a person has greater moral worth than someone with musical ability? The idea that magic > music can only be arrived at through (bad) human ethical reasoning.

If you're referring to evolution and Darwinism, then the position works even less, because evolution is at work in the world and Muggles are the result. Evolution doesn't select for the strongest organism, it selects for the most adapted one. By definition, if you attribute moral value to the results of evolution, then Muggles have moral worth. (As do all other species, also the result of evolution).
