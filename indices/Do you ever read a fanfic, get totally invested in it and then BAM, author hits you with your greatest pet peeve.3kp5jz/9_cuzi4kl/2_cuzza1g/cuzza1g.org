You're definitely right--that's why I hate Hermione/Lucius.

However, in the later books we get such real-world political allegory (the arrest of Stan Shunpike, for example) that Voldemort seems too repugnant to gain traction.

When I think about what allowed him to come to power and have so many sympathizers, I assume his movement must have had better veneer at least initially. He clearly shares traits with some famous fascists, who appealed to a nationalist sense of culture.

To me, at a certain point: the blood purity agenda isn't explained well enough. Why do Snape and Voldemort commit to it? Did Voldemort have anything else on his political agenda.

I really like a fic that goes into what else might be motivating people (normal people) and Snape to sympathize with the Death Eaters--without excusing their actions or beliefs. One like it is Spellcaster by SGCbearcub.
