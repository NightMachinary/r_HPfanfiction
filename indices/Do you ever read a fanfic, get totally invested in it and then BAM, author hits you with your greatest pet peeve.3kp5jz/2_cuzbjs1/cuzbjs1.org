I don't remember the name of the fic and I don't want to. The idea was basically a Dramione set during HBP and DH, it was the usual Draco and Hermione learn to understand each other and fall in love. It was one of the best of this style, with realistic pacing going from "I hate you" to "I like you" with all the stages clearly explained. I really, really liked the story as for once it wasn't the "Draco was always in love" or "Hermione knew he was a victim all along" but rather started pretty much with hatred and contempt.

Then the story went into DH territory and one thing pointed its ugly head: Hermione was pregnant (she and Draco only made love once but of course it was enough). If the story had treated this subject realistically (as the difficult situation that it is) I would not have liked it but I would have kept reading... but no. I was the usual being pregnant at 16 is sooooo romantic... that was my cue, I lost two days of my life reading this.

For the last time, no it's not. Unless you're already settled a surprise pregancy is NEVER a good news. It may bring joy later, but it's not the "ray of light that you needed in a difficult life". Also Hermione discovered that in Grimmauld Pplace just before the start of the "camping trip" phase... and beside how "cuuuute" her situation was it had no consequences.

other things I hate: marriage law, I'll just left the word "implications" here.
