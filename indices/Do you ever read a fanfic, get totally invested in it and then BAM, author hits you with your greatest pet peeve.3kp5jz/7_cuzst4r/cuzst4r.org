My main pet peeve which consistently has this effect is when the main character, who is female, is constantly portrayed as having a 'vicious temper' or such and being dangerous with a wand. yet whenever something actually happens, she's knocked out and has to be saved in a dangerous situation and whenever someone really pisses her off she just takes it, often not even yelling.

Somehow the authors want their character to be strong, yet whenever there's a chance to display that, she becomes a damsel, it's rather frustrating. I'm not asking for a mary sue here, just a character that lives up to the expectations set forth by the author themselves!
