I can't remember who mentioned it (I /think/ it was [[/u/NedryOS]]), but someone once said that just seeing the word "wards" in a fic throws a small handful of people into hysterics.

I'm one of those people.

Just as a previous traumatic experience might develop into a phobia, everything that often comes with the word "ward(s)" is the reason why I catch feelings when I see it. That usually includes:

- Arithmancy and the runic alphabet (almost always Norse/Egyptian) being used primarily (sometimes even solely) for enchanting objects/making these "wards", with either no explanation as to how it works or nine-thousand-and-one paragraphs of oddly placed exposition

- vice versa, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes classes at Hogwarts essentially becoming Enchanting 101

- Magical cores, and how having one that's large/full enough can overload the "wards"

- said "wards" are usually just a huge Shield Charm which are occasionally powered by "blood" and stuff, and therefore not very interesting.

EDIT: It's easy enough to go through fics that have this, but it's definitely an amber flag.
