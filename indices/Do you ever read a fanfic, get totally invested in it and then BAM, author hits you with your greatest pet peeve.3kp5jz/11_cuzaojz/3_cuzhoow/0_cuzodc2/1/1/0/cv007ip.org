It's necessary when you're making Harry use it for /everything/. If it's the reason Wizards have running water, heated houses, protected houses, makes you an animagus, shoot lazers from your eyes, time-tavel etc. it is something that has everyday usefulness. Or is so powerful that /someone/ other than Harry would be using it.

I agree if you make it something that is used in broom-making then yeah it's probably not a big deal, but it still seems more important than Astronomy to me. And yeah power is overrated...but not in the middle of a war, especially not to Voldemort. It just doesn't make logical sense, particularly in canon where /noone/ uses them for magic. Hermione even shows that Runes is just a language.
