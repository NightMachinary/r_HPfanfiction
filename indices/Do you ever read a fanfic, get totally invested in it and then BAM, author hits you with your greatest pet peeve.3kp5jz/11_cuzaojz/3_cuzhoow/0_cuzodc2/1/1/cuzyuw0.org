Power is overrated. When it comes to the core curriculum I think usefulness in the everyday life of the average witch or wizard is a better measure. Charms, Potions, Herbology, even Transfiguration.. yeah, Enchanting? Eh. Especially if it's a complicated skill it seems like something people would specialize in and make a career out of.
