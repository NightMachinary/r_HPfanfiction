Oddly enough, I just remembered another reason - one that's really niggling but I always forget to mention.

Quite often, if wards are just the term for protective enchantments in-universe and encompass a wide array of techniques and methods, then I'm cool with that (even more than cool). It's when wards become Wards, i.e. "Warding" is a distinct branch of magic from Charms, Transfiguration etc. but still uses "Runes and Arithmancy" (which then become bread-and-butter disciplines even if it isn't an AU) to function.

This might be someone else's cup of tea, but it isn't everyone's. Maybe it's me being pedantic (it almost certainly is) but it just doesn't rub me the right way at all.
