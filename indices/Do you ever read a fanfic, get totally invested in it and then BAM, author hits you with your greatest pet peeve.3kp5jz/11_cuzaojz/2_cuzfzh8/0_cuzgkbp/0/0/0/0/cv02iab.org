I'm with you, but I also see the parallel of Hermione taking courses that most students consider 'harder than would be useful in my life after school'. Such was advanced mathematics and computer programming back in the day. Of course, plenty of students felt the same way about the 'shop' classes like woodworking, auto repair and Home Economics (a.k.a. how to cook, sew and keep a budget).

For my headcanon, Runes are used to sustain charms which would otherwise fade. This aspect is taught in NEWT level Charms class. /Ancient/ Runes is the study of the evolution of rune-use in enchantment. Kinda like learning FORTRAN and Pascal to understand how these things were used to build up to Python, Ruby or whatever. Not necessary but instructive, and in the case of tomb-raiding a key skill- you can't ask a modern programmer to do anything in an AS400 system or with the truly ancient punch-card systems, but if the systems were still out there and protecting valuable data, people would still study them.

Arithmancy is a little more obscure- it relates to Qabbalist numerology which has much less to do with mathematics than with Astrology- much of it is about predicting the character and destiny of a person based upon the significant numbers in their life and how they add and subtract. For headcanon purposes, I see it as a way to understand complex spell interactions- like when a bunch of the DA folk shot spells at Draco and his goons, the effects were not simply cumulative but interactive. Somehow, this could be understood with Arithmancy. It still depends more on the symbolic meaning of the numbers rather than their mathematical meaning.
