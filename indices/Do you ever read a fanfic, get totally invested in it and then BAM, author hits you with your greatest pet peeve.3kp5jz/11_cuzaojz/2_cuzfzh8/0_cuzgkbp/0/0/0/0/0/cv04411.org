Pretty much all of what you wrote, but especially this.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), I've written enchanting items through sigils as a widespread practice due to the difficulty and expense of learning wand magic. Runes themselves aren't crucial, but supplementary to the universally understood symbols which recur in wand magic, potions, astronomy etc. depending on one's general school of thought.

Arithmancy can and would be often employed in conjunction with bog-standard magical theory, but it would be used to conclude that adding a second porcupine quill to the brew would ensure flexibility of property x when adding element B (because pragmatism is a magical property of the number 2), rather than just making it twice as strong. But it's an AU, so it's headfanon if anything.
