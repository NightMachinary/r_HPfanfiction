Who said I am being upset about it?

I'm just saying what I remember, and I don't particularly care that some authors had decided to call it this way. Not necessarily canon-compliant, maybe, but for the most part it doesn't really matter because the way it works is the same and it's just a name change.

I really don't know why so many people think I am upset. Do I really appear that way?
