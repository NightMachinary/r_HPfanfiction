They aren't an absolute dealbreaker for me, but it's the concept of magic as an exhaustible fuel.

Wizards ostensibly don't have the types of resource problems that Muggles do in canon, so adding magical cores etc. just cheapens the magic by making it more like: 1) a shonen anime, 2) "magic is just another science", or 3) both.
