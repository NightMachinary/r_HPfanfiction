Really? As in, are you really saying that even though the original reply (which is not edited, by the way) says something different and I took time to explain that I did not mean what you think I meant?

  “but with the weird fixation some people have with pairings and romance as something ... sacred”
#+end_quote

The above quote clearly says that the fixation is about “pairings and romance”. Not about OTPs or any such things, but rather about romance, and pairings as something that is present because there is romance. Once again, it's not about OTPs; it's about people writing stories in which whatever character is infinitely unhappy because he or she has no boyfriend/girlfriend/harem/whatever, rinse and repeat for so many authors; it's about people putting romance as a part of life so far above everything else that it becomes hilarious in how pitiful it is and after some time ends up being just sad.

That's what I said (well, wrote actually). Nothing, and I repeat, *nothing*, about OTPs. Because I honestly couldn't care about OTPs and I don't even really have those; that people think that this-or-that pairing is better is their business, and it is no fixation in the context of my message; what is fixation is when people decide that pairings must exist no matter what, not that OTPs have to exist but rather that people have to form couples, whatever those couples happen to be.
