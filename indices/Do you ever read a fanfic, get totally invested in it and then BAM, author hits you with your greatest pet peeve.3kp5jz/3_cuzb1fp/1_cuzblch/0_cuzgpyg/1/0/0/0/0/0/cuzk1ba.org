I am not getting worked up. I apologise if I came across this way, my style of writing can be a bit weird that way but I was in no way getting emotional when writing the previous reply. Also, rather than being shouted, the bold parts are supposed to be read more slowly for emphasis; you know, the way it was before it became synonymous with shouting (why, I cannot fathom, but I'm not the expert on evolution of speech so I can just shrug there).

And from the very beginning I did not mean anything about OTPs or anything like that. That I became a bit more ... insistent in my reply, was because after explaining once and making it clear that I did not mean what you took it for, your reply was one in which you ... well, pretty much discarded what I wrote and decided that whatever I say I clearly meant what you think I meant, as far as my perspective of it goes, which can make one more insistent (or even more violent and vulgar, though now I am speaking in general as some people do tend to become crass if you do that).

As for the “pairings and romance” bit, it might imply it to you, but not to everyone. And I did already explain that no, this is not what I meant, after which you proceeded to say that yes, this is what I meant. To be honest, I'd say that it's a bit insulting but I really don't care because I'm used to people misunderstanding what I write due to the behind-the-time writing; it still makes it look like you don't really care what I write for as long as you have anything to say, which ... well, I'd say that it doesn't make you look good, but it's not my business to judge people whom I really don't know because a few messages convey pretty much nothing about a person without spending time on it.

Also, I will note that I am not getting worked up now either. Nor have I in any of the other messages. And I do note that ... well, pretty much because it appears that my style of writing makes me look that way to you when it is not the case and I really don't wish to waste time on being told to calm down when there's so much to write (mind you, I am not trying to be insulting here, it's just that my other attempts to write this particular sentence ended up being even more of a mess, so I went with the least stupid version; point is, I prefer not to have to repeat the same thing a few times when I can instead write it once and spend time reading something else or replying to something else). And yes, I do like writing long messages; this is not to torment you.
