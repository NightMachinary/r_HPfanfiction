Okay firstly, chill. This is a nice sub. You're getting worked up.

Secondly, that's not how it came across and yelling doesn't help you. Saying "pairings and romance" pretty clearly implies that you think there's an issue with pairings. 99% of the time that refers to OTPs and the like. Sorry if that's not what you meant but there's no need to be so shirty about it.
