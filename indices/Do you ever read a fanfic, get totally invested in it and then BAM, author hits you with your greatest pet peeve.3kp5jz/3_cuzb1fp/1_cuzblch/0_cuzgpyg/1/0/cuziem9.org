Erm ... you do know that I am not saying that people wouldn't hate those with their OTP in it, right?

What I am saying is that the most disastrous fictions with this particular element are those when it's nothing more than an element to introduce a pairing with no real relationship build-up because someone has a fixation on romance and no idea how to actually write it. Because OTP or not, a fail is a fail.
