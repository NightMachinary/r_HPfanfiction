I think the problem in this particular case is not with “soul bonds” as they are, but with the weird fixation some people have with pairings and romance as something ... sacred maybe, I don't really know what they even think about it because it's making me go all “what the heck”.

Had people not had that deranged fixation, I'm sure a higher percentage of fiction with “soul bonds” would have been at least decent ... though most stories with that element would not have existed then.
