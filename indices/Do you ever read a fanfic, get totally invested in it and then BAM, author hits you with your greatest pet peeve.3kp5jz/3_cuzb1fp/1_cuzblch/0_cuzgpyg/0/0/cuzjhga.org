Hmm ... well, I guess that is true, for some people it can be more than just a bit creepy. And it's not like most couples below 15 actually stay together (or even really get together), if you factor realism into it.

Though there's the question of whether a “soul bond” has to mean love of whatever sort or any facsimile of it, or if it can actually be something else. Because I do remember having once read a story in which two characters did become soul-bound, which didn't really make them a couple but was instead a “both will die if one will” kind of thing and it was built around that thing. I don't remember if it was a Harry Potter fan fiction, but I do remember that it was quite enjoyable.
