Of course teenagers have sex before year 6. And Hermione is already worrying about girls hitting on Harry. But year 6 is like Spring Break - there's at least the impression of social pressure to "live it up". "Everyone's doing it, let's do it too", and so on. And as a muggle raised/born trying to fit in, the pressure's stronger.

And while I am not about to write a graphic sex scene, sex is a thing teenagers worry about a lot - should I sleep with my boyfriend? What if he leaves me if I don't do it? Should I wait until marriage? Does he cheat on me? What if he asks me to do something weird? Will I be able to satisfy her? What if I can't? What if I make a mistake? What if I am too little? Does she cheat on me? What if she finds someone else, who pleases her more? And so on.

In a story where the relationship between a teenage couple is a major plot point, sex, or at least thinking and talking about sex, will be common. Especially if they talk about their relationship, or think about it. It's like complaining about Harry thinking and talking about his broom "way too much" in a story where Quidditch plays a major role - some stuff simply goes together.

I am sorry if it offends some people, but I am not about to write teenagers as if they don't have hormones influencing them without the life experience to handle it.
