The narrative viewpoints (and associated unreliability) is fairly obvious, especially since you like to have scenes by characters who view the same events differently back to back to highlight that point.

And yes, young teenagers think about sex a lot. Sex in general, not "Spring Break in College", caps included. Given that the only thing stopping characters from having sex in, say, 5th year in /Patron/ is social convention, it just comes across as odd that they keep specifically thinking/talking about, once per chapter, "Year of Discovery" in specific as a shorthand for sex. Hermione's worried about girls coming on to Harry for casual encounters in the "Year of Discovery"? Good thing she doesn't need to worry about that in "The Year Before the Year of Discovery", then, since of course no teenager would ever violate an unofficial social convention. Like having sex with someone else's boyfriend...in the wrong time frame.
