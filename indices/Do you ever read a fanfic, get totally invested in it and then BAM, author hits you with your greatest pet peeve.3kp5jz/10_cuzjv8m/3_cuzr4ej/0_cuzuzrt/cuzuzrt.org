Teenagers fixate on sex. You don't think teens long for "Spring Break" in college, "when they'll have sex"?

The "Year of Discovery" is mentioned so often because that's what teens do. And as teens are wont to do, they overhype it. Reality is different, not that a lot of the sixth years will admit to not having sex every day. It's a bit like finally being allowed to drink - many will indulge a lot at first, and then return to a normal state quickly.

I still wonder how many readers seem to miss that I have no objective point of view in my stories - every scene, in every chapter, is written from the subjective point of view of one character, and therefore an unreliable narrator.
