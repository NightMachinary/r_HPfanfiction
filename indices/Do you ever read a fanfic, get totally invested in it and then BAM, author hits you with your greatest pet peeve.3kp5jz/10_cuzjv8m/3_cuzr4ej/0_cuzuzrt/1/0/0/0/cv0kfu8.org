No, I don't do such twists. It's more like that Harry and Hermione's, due to having been raised in muggle Britain, and having Sirius as their closest adult wizard and guardian, have slightly off ideas about year 6. Sirius hasn't been magically cured of the effects of 12 years in Azkaban, and he was one of the more extreme 6th years. It's not like everyone just continues as usual, but it's also not as if everyone becomes a swinger for a year - far from it.
