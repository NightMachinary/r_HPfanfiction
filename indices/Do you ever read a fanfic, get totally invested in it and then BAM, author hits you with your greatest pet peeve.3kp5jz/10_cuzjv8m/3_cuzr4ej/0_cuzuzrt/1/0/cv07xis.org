Not to be a dick, but it's mentioned about 30 times in almost 30 chapters, and over 250K words. That's not really "way, way too much" no matter how you view it. They talk about it when it seems opportune - and that's when they talk about their future or relationship. Sorry if I don't write entire scenes how they do homework, and write essays, or listen to a lesson in school - but those moments do not matter much for the story.

Same goes for the narrative viewpoints - if someone really misses that Draco sees mudbloods and Hermione sees muggleborn, then that's really not fault. Some people want to take offense at anything, and will see stuff that isn't there.
