Movies are one of the (rather few) things the wizard society in linkffn(Patron) can't do better, not even as well, as the muggles do. Wizards could create movies in a pinch, but they simply lack the amount of talented scriptwriters, actors, directors, cutters etc. to create great movies there.

I showed Magical Music as a truly magical experience, its effects more impressive than muggle music if performed live, and followed that with movies being music's muggle counter part of sorts. Neither is a major plot point, though the relations between muggle culture and magical culture are, and both music and movies are part of that.
