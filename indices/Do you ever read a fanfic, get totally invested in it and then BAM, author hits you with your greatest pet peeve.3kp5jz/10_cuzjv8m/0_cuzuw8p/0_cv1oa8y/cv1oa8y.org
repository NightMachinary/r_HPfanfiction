Perhaps calling it a major plot point is a bit much, but it has been a significant portion of the last few chapters. I see that you're using it to show something, and that's cool and all, but personally I just don't like reading a harry potter stories that try to "bring the muggle world to hogwarts". That's not a bash against your story, it's just my personal preference. I actually really like patron, even with the movies and the whole "year of discovery" thing. I especially like your Voldemort. Very bad-ass.
