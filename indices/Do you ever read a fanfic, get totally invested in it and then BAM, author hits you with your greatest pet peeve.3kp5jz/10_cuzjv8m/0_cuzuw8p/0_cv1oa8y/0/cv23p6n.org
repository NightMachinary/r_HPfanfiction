Well, it depends on your definition of "bringing the muggle world to Hogwarts". While there won't be any muggle guns brought into the war, or muggle soldiers and such, culturally there will be some influence. Humans tend to assimilate stuff from other cultures all the time. Often as a passing fad, sometimes, like manga/anime and many formerly exotic dishes, as a permanent addition.

Of course it'll be limited though. Muggle clothes are at best inspirations for magical versions since they simply can't compare to enchanted garments. Pens and other tools face a similar hurdle - in this world, unlike in canon, most important tools are enchanted. If you're writing with quills, fountain pens will quickly replace them beacuse they are far, far superiour. If you're writing with an enchanted, everfull, eversharp auto-correcting quill that can also write down what you say, a pen is an amusing toy, nothing more. There's not much in Patron's muggle world that is superiour to their magic counterpart.
