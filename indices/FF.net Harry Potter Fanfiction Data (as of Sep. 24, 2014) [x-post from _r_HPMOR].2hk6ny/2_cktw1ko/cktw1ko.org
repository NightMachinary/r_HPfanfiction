I think it's safe to say from that survey that quantity and/or popularity doesn't equate with quality.

The three most reviewed stories, e.g., are rubbish. I don't think I made it more than a dozen chapters into any of them before dropping them. While I have nothing against robst, aside from a general dislike of his storytelling, LessWrong and Perfect Lionheart both peg the annoyingness meter.
