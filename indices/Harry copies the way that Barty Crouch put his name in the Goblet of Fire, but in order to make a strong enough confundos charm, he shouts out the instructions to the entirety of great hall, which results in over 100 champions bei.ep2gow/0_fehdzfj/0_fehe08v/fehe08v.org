There was no applause. At first, the only thing that could be heard were to simultaneous "Uh-Oh"s coming from the Gryffindor table. Then, a buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry.

At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall. “Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”

But before Harry could get up from where he sat, the fire in the goblet turned red again. More sparks and another flying piece of parchment followed.

Harry turned to Ron in shock as a Dumbledore who grew paler by the second reached for this fifth piece of parchment.

"Ronald Weasley."

"Mum's going to kill me,"Ron whispered, pale faced, as a wave of outrage crushed down over them.

Harry tried to avoid looking at the head table, but he could feel the gaze of several of his teachers boring into them.

“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” Madame Maxime said imperiously.

“I'd rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” hissed Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Three Hogwarts champions? I don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed more than one champion --- or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”

Harry dared glancing at the head table. Dumbledore's face betrayed nothing, but the absence of a twinkle in his eyes and a smile on his lips told Harry everything he needed to know. The headmaster was livid.

The goblet's fire turned red again and another piece of parchment shot into the air. Dumbledore looked in Harry's direction, before he caught it and read, "Lee Jordan."

Harry and Ron stared at each other, jaws almost hitting the table.

"Subtle as a ton of bricks," Hermione mouthed.

A discussion had broken out at the head table. Harry could hear his name and saw them wildly gesturing in the direction of the Gryffindor table.

Dumbledore had meanwhile caught another piece of parchment. "Cho Chang."

Again, the Hall was eerily silent, before it erupted in angry chatter.

"Fred Weasley," continued Dumbledore, ignoring both the ruckus before him and the one behind him. George Weasley... Vincent Crabbe - you spell Crabbe with two Bs, Mr. Crabbe... Romilda Vane..." Dumbledore sighed and conjured a chair, sitting down in front of the goblet. "A- Argus Filch?"

"How?" whispered Ron, but Harry just shrugged his shoulders.

It was hours before all champions had been chosen and Dumbledore joined the discussion at the head table. Almost all of Hogwarts had been named a champion - all those who were old enough to cast a Confundus and were too young to enter their names the official way - and Argus Filch.

At last, the discussion at the head table died down and Dumbledore stood up to speak again. He cleared his throat. " We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. The goblet constitutes a binding magical contract. As it is, this year's Triwizard Tournament will see 680 contestants." He turned around to leave, but stopped, and added, "I would like to see Mister Weasley and Mister Potter in my office." With those final parting words, he left the Great Hall.
