There's basically no canon info about squibs, and what bits of information do exist contradict each other. E.g. it's strongly implied that Mrs. Figg can't see dementors in Book 5 when she struggles to describe their appearance to the court, but Filch is able to see ghosts and exist at Hogwarts when a muggle otherwise wouldn't be able to.

In Book 2, Ron describes squibs as: "A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards." That's really the only canonical description of squibs we have to go on, so that's what I'm going with. But it's really a blank slate for whatever headcanon you want.
