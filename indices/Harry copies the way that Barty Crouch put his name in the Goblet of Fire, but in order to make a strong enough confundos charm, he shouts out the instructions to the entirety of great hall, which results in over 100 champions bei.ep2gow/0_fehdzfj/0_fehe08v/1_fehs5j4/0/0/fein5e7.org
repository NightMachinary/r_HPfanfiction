I'm fairly certain this is a fanon interpretation of how the Goblet of Fire works. The book only describes it as a "binding magical contract," with no extrapolation as to how it binds the participants or punishes violators.

More importantly, a non-magical person would (presumably) be unable to enter into a binding magical contract in the first place, so the potential consequences of welshing are a moot point
