The candlelit Great Hall was packed. The air was full of excitement and anticipation. The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Everyone in the Hall craned their necks, impatient expressions on their faces, only to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet.

Harry felt an elbow poking him in his rib cage.

"Hey Harry," whispered Ron from beside him.

Harry turned his attention from the still eating Dumbledore to his best friend. "What?"

"Do you reckon what- ehm- happened yesterday... will have any consequences? You think Dumbledore will find out?"

"About us putting our names in? How would he?"

Hermione looked at them, annoyed. "Honestly, you two! You are as subtle as a ton of bricks. With how loud you yelled /Confundus/ in a hall full of people, I wouldn't be surprised if Sirius had heard you. We'll probably read about it in the Prophet tomorrow!"

"We had to," Ron moaned. "We can't do it non-verbally yet."

"You shouldn't have done it at all. What if they expel you? What-"

"Shhh," Harry whispered, "it's about to begin."

And indeed, at long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. Dumbledore proceeded to give a little speech that barely anyone listened to.

The flames inside the goblet turned red. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it --- the whole room gasped. Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.

“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.”

“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.

The clapping and chatting soon died down. Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.

“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”

“It's her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.

It did not take long for Dumbledore to announce the last champion.

“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”

“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table.

"It didn't work?" asked Harry, just as disappointed as Ron.

"Just because you put your name in doesn't mean the goblet will choose you. It obviously thought you two cheaters unworthy," said Hermione, sounding rather smug.

“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real ---”

But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him. The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment. Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out --- “Harry Potter.”
