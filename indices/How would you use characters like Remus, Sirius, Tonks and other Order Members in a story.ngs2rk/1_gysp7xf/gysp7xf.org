---I want to write a fic where Remus actually does go on the horcrux hunt because I feel like an adult along would be super helpful and the werewolf method of them being magic-proof could theoretically, at least in this story help stave off the horcrux effects enough to make the complications of a werewolf on a long term mission worth it.

I think having an adult along especially one who is used to living with very little on the outskirts of society would be very different than three kids with less experience in such things off by themselves.

---I also think that more mission-focussed order stories would be great. Because of Harry's limited POV in the stories we only see them at their decrepit clubhouse but I feel like the characters themselves are pretty awesome so seeing more of that would've been cool

I feel like a horcrux hunt with Sirius, Remus, Bill and Fleur would be fucking great. They're all smart, quick thinking and good at magic. One of them grew up in a dark family and has resources, another is a dark creature and the other two are gulping, fit cursebreakers. What was Dumbledore thinking letting horcruxes sit around when he had access to people like that?

---Also a Tonks and Kingsley buddy cop story would be so much fun!
