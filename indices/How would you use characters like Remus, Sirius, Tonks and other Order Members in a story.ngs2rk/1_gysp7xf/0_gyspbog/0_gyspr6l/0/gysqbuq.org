Sirius would totally work, if he had lived. So irritated at Rowling for killing him off. He would have been perfect to help Harry, Ron and Hermione out. Especially if he had gotten a trial after the DOM battle.

Harry didn't want Remus and Tonks to fight because they had a kid, so I can see Harry not wanting either one to join.

Using Andromeda would be interesting.
