I mean as I said Remus and Tonks are not a plausible ship to me. They're both flagrantly gay in my book, so they aren't procreating together and are a lot freer in any story I'm going to write. I just don't see Teddy happening, except though maybe a one night stand, because seeking out sex in times like that makes a lot of sense.

But honestly their arc reads like Rowling heard queer people going on about these gay characters and said â€˜we can't have that. Better kill Sirius off and make the other two have a baby together!'
