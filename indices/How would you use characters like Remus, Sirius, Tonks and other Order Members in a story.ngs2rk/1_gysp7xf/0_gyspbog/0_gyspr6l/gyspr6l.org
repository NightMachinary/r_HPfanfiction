Yeah, I mean first off I don't ship Tonks and Remus, but if I had them as a pairing I would also have them leading from James and Lily's mistake and pregnant Tonks takes her mum and dad and gets the fuck out of the country while Remus stays to try and help end the situation ASAP . I'm pretty sure Tonks and Remus are both action oriented people and point of find being out of the fight incredibly hard, so I figure Tonks to texting her parents and the baby, and Remus protecting the kids is a good action plan for them
