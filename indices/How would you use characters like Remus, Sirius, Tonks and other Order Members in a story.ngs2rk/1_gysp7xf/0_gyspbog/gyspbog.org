Kingsley and Tonks buddy cop story, yes! I want more stories in general with Kingsley, Tonks and/or Moody as Aurors.

With Remus, it's tricky, because he has a wife and newborn baby. Harry yelled at him because Remus left his family, Harry wouldn't want Remus to come with them, because he'd want Remus to be with his family.
