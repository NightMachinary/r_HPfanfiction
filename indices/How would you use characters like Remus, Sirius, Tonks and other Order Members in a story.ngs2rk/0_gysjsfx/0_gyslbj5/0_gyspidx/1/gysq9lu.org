That's true, but it's still a mission that only Harry (and the trio and Griphook) had information on and I think that, going by his judgment, he'd be wiser than to inform her.

On the other hand, Tonks might have been fighting for the right thing but, unlike Harry, Teddy was not in immediate danger (even assuming that the Order failed and Voldemort ruled forever, as half-bloods they were not yet targeted) so you cannot compare her to Lily. So I can't help but wonder if it would have been better if she stayed at home and not deprive her child of a mother's love instead of going in a battle that had no chance of winning outcome for the good guys until Harry went for his sacrifice. I mean Voldemort pretty much destroys the Hogwarts resistance which consisted of the Weasleys and the few remaining members of the Order (the Lupins, Kingsley, Aberforth), the teachers and the seventh years from three houses and some of the sixth years and then some ex-DA members. At the very most they could have been a hundred and Harry counts 50 bodies in the Tale of the Prince chapter. The tides are only turned when Charlie and Slughorn return with reinforcements and Voldemort is incapacitated to hurt people because of Harry's sacrifice.
