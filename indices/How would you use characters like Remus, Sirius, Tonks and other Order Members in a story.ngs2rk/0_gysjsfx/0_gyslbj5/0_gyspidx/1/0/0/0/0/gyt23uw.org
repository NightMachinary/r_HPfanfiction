I would..agree with her not going to not endanger teddy. But. This is also the mother who went to war rather then not. The last book had a lot of scenes like that. People dying without fanfare. Mad eye.remus tonks ect...realistic I guess but..bad writing for resolutions. I feel. Maybe if she had gone to that mission she would have been less willing to go to the final battle. Who knows.
