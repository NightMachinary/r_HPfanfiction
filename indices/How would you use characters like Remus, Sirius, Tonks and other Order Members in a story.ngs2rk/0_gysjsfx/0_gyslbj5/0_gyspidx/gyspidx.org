I mean letting a male kid tell adult women what to do is shitty. Mothers are some of the most resourceful people on the planet. She's been an auror for long enough not to be stupid about it, and as a mother who wants to get home to her kid would probably be less likely to take risks than anyone else, so I think she's a great candidate.

Harry would hate it because of his mother giving up his life for him but it's war, man. Tonks would be pretty bloody upset about the kids going in there themselves, I bet.
