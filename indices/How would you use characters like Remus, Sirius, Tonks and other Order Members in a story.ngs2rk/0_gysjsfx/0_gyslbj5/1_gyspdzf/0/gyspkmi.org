If you want to keep everything canon before that point, Ted would be dead. And I am not talking about Tonks's decision per se. I mean she and her husband abandoned their child in the care of the grandmother to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. But unlike that, the Gringotts heist was something that Harry called the shots on and judging from his earlier talk with Lupin in the book, he would have never accepted Tonks as a new mother to join him in his mission.
