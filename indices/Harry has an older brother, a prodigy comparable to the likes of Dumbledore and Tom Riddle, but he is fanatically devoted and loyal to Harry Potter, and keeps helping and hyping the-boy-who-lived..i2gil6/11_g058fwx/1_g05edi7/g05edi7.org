Have you read the Saving Connor series? Harry having a younger brother named Connor believed to be the Boy Who Lived, where Harry is essentially raised as a weapon and guardian for him. Only to find out he is the Boy Who Lived. It's an incredibly well written 7 part series. There is Drarry pairing, but it's very much in the background of things.
