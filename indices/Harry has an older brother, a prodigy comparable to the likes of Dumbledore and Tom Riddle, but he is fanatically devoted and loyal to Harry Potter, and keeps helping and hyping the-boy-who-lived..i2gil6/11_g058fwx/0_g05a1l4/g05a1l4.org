I was thinking just the opposite actually. There's hardly any sibling bonding/mentoring in the canon, not including the Weasley family. Sirius and Dumbledore both had bad sibling relationship, and they don't do anything to mend that. So I was thinking of presenting a story where there's a good sibling relationship, kind of like what Sirius and Dumbledore wish they had after seeing Harry and his brother.
