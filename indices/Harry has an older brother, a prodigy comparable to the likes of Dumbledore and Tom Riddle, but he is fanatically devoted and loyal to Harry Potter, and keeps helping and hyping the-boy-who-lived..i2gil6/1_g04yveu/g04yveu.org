This is making me want to write so bad! I don't think this would be a 'Potters live with the Dursleys' fic, it has more of a 'Sirius was never sent to Azkaban and takes in the Potters' vibe. Anyone agree? I can totally see Sirius loving and raising the boys and encouraging their behavior. Maybe Remus is a surrogate 'mom' and tries to balance out Sirius. (Could see Sirius and the boys calling Remus 'Moonmy' and Remus being absolutely not amused)
