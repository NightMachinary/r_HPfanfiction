Ok! This has officially cured my writer's block. I just finished a rough outline for what I estimate the first 8-10 chapters to be. I'll begin drafting them sometime soon, with the hope that I'll be able to start posting in roughly two weeks. The first chapters will cover setting up the story, and Harry and his older brothers first year. I don't want to entirely rip off the prompt (I will give credit) so I would very much appreciate suggestions for Older Brother's Name (first and middle) and I'll credit you in my story! If you'd like an idea of the plot, it starts with Sirius picking up the boys instead of going after Pettigrew. They will then leave the country with Remus. The fic will then time travel to Harry's first year, while OB is a fourth year. They both will be Hufflepuffs, and while I like Ron, I've decided that Neville will be Harry's BFF. There will be a BIG plot point at the end of first year, which will really shape how the story progresses. I do not believe there will be Wolfstar, and I have no idea who I want end pairings to be, as I have no idea where I truly want to go with this fic. Let me know if you're interested!
