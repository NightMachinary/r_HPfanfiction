I was thinking about this prompt and how it can be spun for a story. Decided to pitch it today, after a good sleep and clearer head.

But one thing, you should consider before making older brother more than 2 years older than Harry. James and Lilly were both 20 when they had Harry, so unless you mess around with timelines it'd be a pretty creepy reading 16 year olds having a child.

As for a name, personally love the idea that older brother is /something/ Fleamont Potter. It would be a good way for James to honour his father.

I would love to read your story. And if you like to discuss ideas for the story I'm interested.
