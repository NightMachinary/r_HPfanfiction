Charlus is a good middle name. I'd much prefer it over the hyphenated one.

If you're going going to make Charlus three years older than Harry, it might need some additional work. We don't know that many 'puffs, especially ones that'll be with Charlus.

My idea was making him 2 years older, so when Harry starts Hogwarts, Charlus has already integrated himself into the school. Also, by making him two years older you get access to a list of characters and things you can do/interact. The Weasley twins, Cedric and so on. Cedric can be Charlus' best friend, sort of like a mix between good parts of Ron and Hermione, supportive, loyal, intelligent, and so on.

Plus I have this hilarious image in my mind where Charlus does something impressive and dangerous without thinking much and Cedric, the perfect 'puff, pulling his hair out and saying, "No Charlus, not everyone can perform Arithmancy adjustments and modify spells on the fly."

"But Ced, Harry can also do that. And he's so much better than I was two years ago."
