At risk of being downvoted, I'll mention Methods of Rationality. It's a pretty divisive fic, lots of people either love or hate it, but it's mentioned often enough that I think it's worth reading it if only to make up your own mind. And remember that a skilled author, which Yudkowsky is, /does not always agree with the protagonist/. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is frequently arrogant, rude, impatient, and condescending except to those few people he considers smart enough to be worth talking to - but the story doesn't applaud him for it, it smacks him down. Repeatedly. The very last chapter has him looking back on the year and shaking his head at what an idiot he's been, particularly coming within a hair's breadth of literally destroying the planet by allowing dangerous magical knowledge to be widely disseminated; sooner or later, /someone/ would surely have misused it.

It's a funny, thought-provoking, and sometimes quite poignant read, in any case; whether you agree or disagree with Harry's point of view, he challenges you to consider your own positions. The alternate/expanded introduction, which I generally recommend, is linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).
