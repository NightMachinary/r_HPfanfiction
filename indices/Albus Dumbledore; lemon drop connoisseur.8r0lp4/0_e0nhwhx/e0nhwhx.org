In the classic linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo), which predicted most of the major plot points in Deathly Hallows before it came out, Harry and co. are speaking to Dumbledore's portrait. The portrait straight up admits he knew Harry was different because "in all his time at Hogwarts, Harry was the only one to ever accept a lemon drop when Dumbledore offered them one in his office."
