Linkffn(3695087) due to improper facts involving false storys about Snape abusing Albus in various ways Minerva is worried about him and thinks he shouldnt be doing his duties as headmaster anymore so she and a few others convince Hermione and Harry to lie to dumbledore and make him believe Voldemort is diabetic and that he should focus on searching the world for lemon drops and tasteing each one until he finds or creates the perfect one which can defeat voldemort. Minerva only does this of course because she cares for him and thinks it is the best for him do to the abuse she thinks he suffered. All in all I enjoyed the story and it had quite a few funny momemts in my opinion.
