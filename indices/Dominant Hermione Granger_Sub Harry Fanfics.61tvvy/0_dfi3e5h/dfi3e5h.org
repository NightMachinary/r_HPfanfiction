You didn't specify whether you meant dominant or submissive in the BDSM sense or whether you meant character relationship dynamic, in which Hermione calls the shots more so than in canon. In case you are interested in the latter, there's linkffn(Rule of two, dreams come true by Darklooshkin) and linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen), though neither has been updated in a long time. ([[/u/darklooshkin]], I'm looking at you.)

There's also linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen), which flips the typical relationship dynamic of a male protector with a female who keeps his violence in check through romantic influence.
