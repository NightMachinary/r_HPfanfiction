There's a good 4th year one (no triwizard, alternate mystery). It's an old one (2008) and it got abandoned before we got anything but crumbs about the "mystery". I remember the romance very fondly though -- it wasn't overdramatic, both Harry and Padma acted/talked their age and the whole thing came across as pretty lighthearted. Also bonus points for Padma's nuanced Ravenclaw-ishness -- she's shown to be pretty clever, but she doesn't like schoolwork all that much, preferring to focus on her own projects.
