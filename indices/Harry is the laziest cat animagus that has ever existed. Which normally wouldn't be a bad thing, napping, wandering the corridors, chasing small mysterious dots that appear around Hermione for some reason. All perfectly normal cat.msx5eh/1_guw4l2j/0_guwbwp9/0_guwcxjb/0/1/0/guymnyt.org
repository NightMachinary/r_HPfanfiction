Surely you mean Paw-Paw, for his big old soft paws?

I don't know why I imagine it this way, because the prompt didn't really specify, but I'm assuming that Harry is just staying in his animagus form as much as possible, because he enjoys it. Maybe he's forced to attend classes as a human because lions can't write or hold wands, but nobody is forcing him to walk the halls as a human, or eat his meals as a human, or sleep as a human. He's being a cat more than he's being a person at this point. Just completely flaunting it.
