If you want rare, make it Harry bringing dead animals to Lavender. She's bubbly and kind of an airhead, but she's honest, and brave, and competent enough to help lead the DA and fight alongside Neville when Death Eaters controlled the castle. It's sort of cute, imagining Lavender fawning over a big lazy lion.
