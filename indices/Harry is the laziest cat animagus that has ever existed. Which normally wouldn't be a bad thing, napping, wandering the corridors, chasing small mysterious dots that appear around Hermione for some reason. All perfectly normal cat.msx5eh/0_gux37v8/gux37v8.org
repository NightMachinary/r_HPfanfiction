After lounging in the sun all day, Harry looks for a cool floor to lay down on. After roaming the dungeons for a while, he finds a nice dead end and stretches out to sleep as a lion.

Some Slytherin students return to their dorms to find a lion stretched out in front of their common room snoring. It seems every time the get close, it snores louder or starts kicking its legs. Some students on the other side come out of the dorm and face the same problem.

Harry Potter, the big furry roadblock.

Hagrid comes back to his cottage to find Fang standing outside and whining.

When he goes inside, there is a lion in Fang's bed sleeping, Fang won't go anywhere near it.
