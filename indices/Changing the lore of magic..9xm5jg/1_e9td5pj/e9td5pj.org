As much as I love how J.K wrote the magic system, I tend to give it a more RPG feel to it. I make it all flashy and dramatic effects. I tend to also incorporate the system from D:OS2 where spells can stack. IE: Lightning hits water, electrifies people.

As such, the Killing Curse is far too powerful when you bring in this type of magic. Therefore, I give it a serious drawback that stops people just flinging it willy-nilly. Voldemort hardly cares about it as he's immortal, but others tend to use less â€˜black' magic.

It varies fic to fic. In one I'm writing, there are different branches of magic (called lores) that all behave differently. Essentially, I just tweaked the magic system from Warhammer Fantasy! Lmao.
