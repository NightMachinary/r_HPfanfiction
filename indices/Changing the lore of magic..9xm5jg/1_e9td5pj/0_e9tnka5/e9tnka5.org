Isn't the canon magic also flashy and dramatic? Big wand motions, colorful flashes and bolts and fizzles. The movies really sold magic short, visually.

As for the Killing Curse, it doesn't have to have "drawbacks" (though it's fine if it does) to not be plot-breaking. Simply stress that it's simply a /difficult/ spell to master. You have to get the wand movement, incantation, and state of mind /exactly/ right, or else it blows up in your face or just doesn't work.
