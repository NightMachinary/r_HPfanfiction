Oh, I agree. I feel like canon magic already has its own degree of flashiness and flair, but I simply took that and notched it from about six or seven to twenty. What I mean is that there are spells that twist the air, creating a storm and making it rain, with lightning zapping the area every few seconds. The storm moves, attacks at random, and, just like Fiendfyre, cannot be controlled. It goes where it pleases, destroying everything with lightning. There is also a spell that simply bounces and arcs off humans and objects, which makes shields relatively obsolete if you are unlucky. Then there are the more extreme spells, which is a tornado of swords, swinging haphazardly around, a sort of vortex that can be controlled by the caster, moving across the earth with intense destruction.

Basically put, I like to use a lot, and I mean a lot, of AoE spells, as well as PBAoE. There are a few that I use for single target, but they are simply dramatic with their effects. One, which is arguably one of my favourite, ages the target the longer the spell travels. It starts off moving really quickly, and after about a second, it slows down. If the spell hits point blank, it will age someone about a year, but if it travels across, let's say, a Quidditch field, it will age them about a hundred years. It also eats through shields, but the slow travel speed makes it easy to actually dodge (Seeing as it eventually moves about a meter a second.

As for drawbacks, the things you listed are drawbacks! Basically, I make it so it cannot be cast nonverbally/wandlessly or it has a complex wand movement that most seem to forget, other times, I have it so that each cast slowly kills the caster, taking their natural lifespan with each successful cast. You know, an eye for an eye. If you kill someone, you pay the price.
