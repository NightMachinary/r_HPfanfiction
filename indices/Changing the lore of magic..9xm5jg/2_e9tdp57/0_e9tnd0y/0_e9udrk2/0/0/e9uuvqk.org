That's why fics exploring other forms of magic is so fun! Wandless magic shouldn't be any less powerful than wand magic, just trickier, and also harder for Western wizards who grew up being taught only wand magic, cuz otherwise Pottermore is selling a seriously eurocentric white saviour-type world view. Non-western wizards and witches should be able to perform magic without a wand just fine.
