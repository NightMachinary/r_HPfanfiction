I may have somewhat understated 1). I'm not talking about Muggle devices not working at Hogwarts. Rather, if you switch on a phone, use a microwave, or drive a car in any magical territory, the results would be catastrophic. Enchantments could malfunction, or perhaps work in reverse. It might generate an explosion powerful enough to leave a 20ft deep crater. The device may even take a life of its own and wreak havoc upon the local population. Likewise, casting spells in the middle of, say, Times Square or Oxford Street would be equally as hazardous.

As for 2), I'm not so sure. JK's semi-retcon of wandless magic seems quite a bit more overpowered. Making someone's jaw fall off with a quick hand gesture in this AU would be well beyond the capabilities of any wizard below McGonagall/Snape-tier. The Uagadou entry suggests otherwise for canon.
