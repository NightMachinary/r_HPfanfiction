I've changed a few things:

1) Magic in my AU doesn't interact well with advanced Muggle technology. At all. But this is a necessary plot point, because it's central to current wizard/Muggle relations within the AU.

2) Wandless magic (i.e. levitating and banishing objects, not Potions or Herbology) can be potent, but is almost always less consistent and less precise than wand-oriented spellcasting. The vast majority of spells cast using an instrument are designed specifically for said instrument, and as such do not translate well or at all in other circumstances.

3) Almost all accredited magical schools (such as the "Eleven") trace their curricula back to teachers of the ancient Mystery Traditions, such as Hermes Trismegistus, Anansi, Fuxi, etc.

4) Magic at Hogwarts (and most everywhere else) is taught slightly differently. Not everyone is great at casting spells, but they might have a real knack for casting magic through the invocation of the divine or infernal. Some might be hot shit at potion-making, but haven't a clue how to decipher a star chart. So the only core subjects past second year involve learning classical languages and magical symbolism.
