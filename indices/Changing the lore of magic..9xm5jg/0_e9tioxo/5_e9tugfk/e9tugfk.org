Achilles!!! SNEKIES! :) I love your snakey theory! :) :) My theory (which I do mention in Fight For Rights as applying to spiders, but also it applies to snakes!) is that snakes are BABIES. :) Think about it Achille: when a human baby is born they are nothing and know nothing! They cannot read or talk or know what morals right or wrong is, they cannot even walk or know how to work a TV or open a book! They don't know what teeth are or anything!

But every baby becomes a fully functioning human who can do math and history and philosophy and stuff because we go through school and our parents do teach us it all on flashcards and stuff.

So yes, every human has the CAPABILITY to become a super intelligent complex adult human.

The same is true of snakes! They have that same innate intelligence and sapience...they just never got taught how to use it like human babies do! :)

So snakes are all babies who never went to school. :)
