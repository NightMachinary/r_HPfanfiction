The Animagus one was really clever. I definitely reject JKR's lore, but I just say it takes really intensive transfiguration training. A lot of the things I change in the lore are to keep things from being overpowered and breaking the story. (For example, mandrakes can only kill at point-blank range (based on the real historical lore) and can't be amplified.)

Your take on the Fidelius is interesting. I've seen it done that way before, but I use a different solution: the Fidelius is more difficult to cast proportional to how hard it would be to hide the secret conventionally. So hiding an ordinary house is doable, but hiding the known residence of a celebrity or the lost city of Atlantis would be immensely harder. And if you tried to hide a secret that's already common knowledge, there's not enough magic in the world to do it.
