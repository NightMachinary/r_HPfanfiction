  Thus, most snakes (as observed by Muggles) are stupid animals, but if a Parselmouth starts talking to them, or they engage by chance in some other stimulating activity, like the Zoo Boa Constrictor who had nothing else to do with his time than think, their mind will begin to expand to eventually reach human-like levels.

My main issue with this is how it shakes out in Philosopher's Stone. The snake showed intelligence before Harry said anything, he was just standing there bored and it winked at him, which is what caused the whole incident. Snakes seem to know when a person is a Parselmouth even before they speak to them, oddly enough.
