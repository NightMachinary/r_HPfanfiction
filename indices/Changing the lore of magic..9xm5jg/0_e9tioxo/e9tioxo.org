*PORTRAITS:*

I tend not to make much of Rowling's /Pottermore/ statement that the ability of a magical portrait depends on "the power of the subject" rather than the making of the painting --- it's a weird, somewhat abstract idea, and the one time I can think of in canon where somebody refers to the relative power of a wizard as an abstract quantity rather than a measure of their skill. As far as I'm concerned, magic portraits are made with magical paint (paint intermingled with Pensieve-style memory-fluid, and some other magical ingredients), and the level of their intelligence/lifelikeness depends on how many memories go into their conceptions.

*TIME:*

I'm not entirely sure Rowling herself has a coherent idea of how time magic works (the "time bell" in the Department of Mysteries scene makes me think she has only a very /basic/ understanding of time travel, or chooses to appear that way). But I have built a coherent model where base time travel is the sort that allows you to change the past (as seen in /Pottermore/ and /Cursed Child/), and Time Turner loops are an artificial effect made to make them safer to use by preserving history, achieved through probability-manipulation like Felix Felicis.

*GHOSTS:*

Rowling seems to go back and forth from one statement to another about whether ghosts are the souls of the people they represent, or just an imprint left behind where the "real" soul has still left for the Beyond. The second idea sounds weird to me (it makes the "cowardly choice" thing a bit wonky: those who choose to stay behind are doomed to... move on anyway, except with a half-sentient clone of them left behind? huh?), so I go with the first: the ghost is the soul wrapped in an ectoplasmic body that's an imprint of your corporeal body. End of story.

*PARSELTONGUE:*

I am not entirely sure, either, that Rowling ever thought the mechanics of Parseltongue through, or its corollary that somehow, snakes are sentient beings capable of intelligent conversation and reading (!!) in the Potterverse. I have decided that the way it works is that snakes are actually magical beings, whose magic manifests in the very particular way of boosting their cognition when they start exerting their mind (like a Mind-Sharpening Potion on steroids). Thus, most snakes (as observed by Muggles) are stupid animals, but if a Parselmouth starts talking to them, or they engage by chance in some other stimulating activity, like the Zoo Boa Constrictor who had nothing else to do with his time than think, their mind will begin to expand to eventually reach human-like levels.

*POST OWLS:*

Relatedly, I have decided wizarding Owls are basically to the owls /we/ know what wizards are to Muggles and kneazles are to cats. This allows for Hedwig to have the sort of intelligent behavior she displays, and neatly explains away all the times Rowling got owl facts wrong (they're just a slightly different species).

*THE EXCEPTIONS TO GAMP'S LAW:*

My take on the inability to Transfigure food is that the body of living beings has latent protective magic that Untransfigure anything it ingests. So you can transfigure a cake from a rock, except as soon as you start digesting it, it'll turn /back/ into a rock. I call this the Tantalus Principle. I think it's the most elegant way to explain it. (This is why magically changing food into other food is okay; you won't get the nutrients of what you created, but you /can/ eat it without risk.)

Similarly, you /can/ Transfigure gold, but any Goblin (or wizard businessman) will try to Untransfigure any significant money you give them in a transaction, just to be on the safe side. And counterfeiting even a single Galleon is a one-way ticket to Azkaban, as one of the foundations of all Goblin/Wizard treaties.

*ON UNFORGIVABLE CURSES:*

The Killing Curse brutally severs the soul from the body, collaterally causing the body's death. It just does. Shut up.

*THE FIDELIUS CHARM:*

The Fidelius Charm is exponentially harder to cast the more people know about the secret to begin with, because you have to list all the people who know the secret as part of the ritual. This is why wizards don't just Fidelius the existence of magic, let alone heroes loopholing the Fidelius by Fideliusing things like "Voldemort needs to breathe to remain alive".

*ANIMAGI:*

The Animagus Spell isn't actually the stupid leaf-under-tongue ritual from /Pottermore/. Rather, it's written that way in all the books, but it's actually coded writing for the /real/ spell. The cumbersomeness of the whole process deters idiots trying to become illegal Animagi, and the conspicuous oral discomfort of those who try make them easy to spot for law enforcement.

*MEMORY CHARMS:*

Memory Charms erase memories from the brain, but not from the soul. This is how it is still possible to retrieve them, but also why it's such a dangerous process. It serves to make Obliviation less existentially terrifying, as the memories are never truly 'lost' and the person will recover them upon their death.

*ARITHMANCY:*

Arithmancy is generally about the numerical significance of magic (e.g. how seven-point configurations make for more stable soul magic). The part that foretells the future exists, but it's not the main focus of the class taught as Hogwarts. It's made to appear that way in written documents because this boosts interest (more students want to know the future than learn how to calculate the optimal diameter of a wand movement). This is why Hermione still liked it even though she considered Divination to be a sham.

*DIVINATION:*

Speaking of Divination, there's a very sharp difference between small-p predictions and Prophecies. Predictions are very unreliable, and considered by some to be mere balderdash; the crux is that if they're true at all they only stay true insofar as the Seer doesn't reveal what they have seen, because that throws the timeline out of whack. (e.g. Trelawney foresees a path leading to a student's death, says so, and as a result the student's actions are slightly different and they don't die at all, making it appear as though Trelawney was raving mad.) This is in contrast to Prophecies, which are the opposite --- only ever self-fulfilling, and ineffectual so long as their targets haven't heard them.

*DEMENTORS:*

Rationalizing why Dementors feed on happy memories, yet seem to bring sad memories to the foreground: like reverse-Legilimenses, Dementors can only feed on memories and thoughts that the host /isn't/ currently thinking about. Thus, they make their victims think of their sad memories so that the happy ones will be left unprotected. This is also why they're physically hurt by Patronuses --- they need their happiness dormant and harmless, and Patronuses are the very opposite of that, being happiness that's not only vibrant and alive, but actually /fights back/.

Dementors can feed on /any/ sufficiently advanced souls, as what they /really/ feed on is the magical energy produced by a soul when it's having a strong emotion. (That's positive energy in the case of happiness; the Unforgivables instead harness the destructive energy generated by hatred or sadism.) As a result, they are capable of â€˜Kissing' a ghost or other disembodied soul, which is one more reason Dumbledore didn't want them inside the castle, and one of the main reasons why a Dark Wizard laying their hands on the Resurrection Stone and realizing its true nature would be just terrible (because from a Dementor's perspective, the Stone is an infinite snack vending machine).

*BOGGARTS:*

Rowling made it appear in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ as though Boggarts can easily be destroyed with laughter, then retconned them to be unkillable non-beings like Dementors, then belatedly realized the paradox and shoved it under a carpet. I choose to believe that Boggarts /cannot/ be destroyed by the Riddikulus Curse --- it merely forces them to Disapparate away much like House-Elves, and that's what the Boggart "vanishing" was.

Usually, Boggarts extrapolate their forms from the victim's memories, and thus they can be very inaccurate. If you'd cut open the Boggart's Snape-form, the insides would not have looked much like what anatomy textbooks would suggest you'd expect. Sometimes, however, if they have a live example of their desired forms in line of sight, Boggarts will imitate it more closely, which is why the Dementor-Boggart managed to imitate some of the Dementor's magic (it had a bunch of models all around Hogwarts to choose from).

*GOBLET OF FIRE:*

The Goblet of Fire is sentient, not unlike the Sorting Hat, though its intelligence is much more eldritch (as it sees into the past and future indiscriminately). It's also got a knack for showbiz. It picks, not necessarily the most competent champions, but those who'll put on the most thrilling show together.

*THE VEIL:*

The Veil's original purpose was as a fallback for ghosts who regret their decision and want to Move On after all. The Death Room's purpose is to be the place for the ghost to make their grand, tearful farewell to the world and all who knew them. However, when the Department of Mysteries realized it was a one-of-a-kind gate into the Afterlife, they hounded it for themselves as an object of study and built their entire Department around it just so that no one could access it but them. Not a ghost has used it for its intended purpose in a hundred years.

*PIERTOTUM LOCOMOTOR:*

Rather like Portraits, statue-animating spells like /Piertotum/ give their creations the personality the caster expects them to have. Thus, the Founders implanted even their non-living statues with a latent sense of duty towards the Castle, so that they would be ready to jump into battle minutes after their animation to defend Hogwarts. This is the sense of "duty to [your] school" that McGonagall appeals to in the BoH.
