Thanks for liking my idea! Yeah, it opens up all kinds of fun shenanigans.

About ghosts: I suppose that makes sense, but it's a little convoluted, isn't it? And it does call into question what a soul would look like, if the sentient but non-coporeal imprints of a person aren't it. When we do see "real" souls brought back from the Afterlife, with the Stone, they look pretty much like ghosts, albeit "a little more solid". So the entire thing seems to be to be pretty futile.
