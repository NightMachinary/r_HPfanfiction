I really like a lot of these. The Animagus one particularly tickles me because I can imagine the Marauders trying the "correct" method multiple times before realizing it was all a trick (and the teachers don't bother cracking down on them because they see them trying the fake method). They'd be a little ticked, but the fact that a book essentially pranked them would also appeal to them. I could also see them continuing to do the fake method well after they started the real one, just to throw people off the scent.

As far as ghosts, I'd look at it as an imprint that's left behind when a soul tries not to leave. I.E. you don't get a choice in the matter, you're moving on whether you like it or not, but if you're afraid of doing so and try to avoid it, you leave behind the imprint. Thus, the ghost itself isn't the cowardly one, it's a marker that the original soul was afraid of dying and moving on.
