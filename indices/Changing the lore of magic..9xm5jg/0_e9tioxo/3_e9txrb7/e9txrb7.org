  The Fidelius Charm is exponentially harder to cast the more people know about the secret to begin with, because you have to list all the people who know the secret as part of the ritual. This is why wizards don't just Fidelius the existence of magic, let alone heroes loopholing the Fidelius by Fideliusing things like "Voldemort needs to breathe to remain alive".

Does this make a lot of sense considering Grimmauld Place is in the middle of London?

  Dementors can feed on any sufficiently advanced souls, as what they really feed on is the magical energy produced by a soul when it's having a strong emotion. (That's positive energy in the case of happiness; the Unforgivables instead harness the destructive energy generated by hatred or sadism.) As a result, they are capable of â€˜Kissing' a ghost or other disembodied soul, which is one more reason Dumbledore didn't want them inside the castle, and one of the main reasons why a Dark Wizard laying their hands on the Resurrection Stone and realizing its true nature would be just terrible (because from a Dementor's perspective, the Stone is an infinite snack vending machine).

What happens to a soul once a Dementor eats it? Is it a prisoner until the Dementor expires or is destroyed? Is it destroyed?
