  Does this make a lot of sense considering Grimmauld Place is in the middle of London?

The Secret is not "Grimmauld Place exists", it's "Grimmauld Place is the HQ of the Order of the Phoenix". /That/ fact is known to a decently low number of people.

As a result, I would expect that people who weren't looking for the Headquarters could have seen Grimmauld Place (well, Muggles probably couldn't for other reasons, mind you); it's people looking for it as the Order of the Phoenix HQ who couldn't have processed its existence even right in front of it.

  What happens to a soul once a Dementor eats it? Is it a prisoner until the Dementor expires or is destroyed? Is it destroyed?

I dunno. A theory is that it's trapped forever inside the Dementor as a permanent food source; another is that it's digested into raw magic and emotion that the Dementor absorbs, boosting its power. I'm undecided. Perhaps Rowling will give us her opinion one day, and I'll most likely follow it.
