  As a result, I would expect that people who weren't looking for the Headquarters could have seen Grimmauld Place (well, Muggles probably couldn't for other reasons, mind you); it's people looking for it as the Order of the Phoenix HQ who couldn't have processed its existence even right in front of it.

I think I've heard that reasoning before. I'm not a huge fan, it makes the Fidelius incredibly easy to attack by using obliviations or by hiring an agent who doesn't know specifics.

Since everyone places such high confidence in the security of the Fidelius I would reason deductively that it can't be broken as easily as that and /must/ affect everyone.

Just to be clear: I don't hate your explanation, I think it fixes huge problems with the charm (it's too powerful), I'm just reluctant to accept anything that makes Dumbledore or all the other adults even stupider than they appear in the books, when they put all their eggs in one basket with the Fidelius. There's not a lot of room left going down in terms of intellect.
