  his mind would be unable to process the answer the Muggles would give him/the Muggles would inexplicably find themselves unable to divulge it. (Also, Godric's Hollow doesn't exactly have a lot of Muggle population.)

Is Godric's Hollow entirely Wizards? I forget...

In any case I was just trying to illustrate a point.

  And remember, per Prophecy, Voldemort was very insistant that it had to be him who killed the Potter, not some Obliviated underling.

Again, blowing up the house was just one solution. If he really wants to kill them himself he can order their kidnapping, tag them with portkeys or just bring in a big wrecking ball and huff and puff the housue away.

Or if he's really insane he can just obliviate and memory charm himself and start looking for the Smiths instead of the Potters.

I think you are purposely ignoring the point that the Fidelius is suddenly very weak by focusing on technicalities in execution. I'm just throwing around ideas here and I already have thousands, if I were Voldemort and I could experiment on actual Fidelius locations for decades I'd have a whole repertoire to defeat them by 1981 if they work as you describe (only a low amount of people are affected).

I don't think your Fidelius is useless, but I'd see it only as one layer of defense. Certainly I wouldn't leave the Potters alone in a cottage without any Plan B and Dumbledore is supposed to be much smarter and wiser than a mid 30s nerd.
