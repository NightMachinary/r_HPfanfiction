  I'm not entirely sure what you have in mind. Care to elaborate?

Let's say the secret is "The Potter family is hiding in Mainstreet 15 in Godric's Hollow". Being Voldemort: Just ask a bunch of Muggles whether they've seen a young family, a red haired woman with a young child and a man with messy hair (as long as they don't know the potters they are unaffected by the spell... similarly as people who don't know who the Order of the Phoenix is could see Grimmauld). As soon as you have the general location pinned down hire anyone to look into windows for you and report back when they find them. Then blow up the house.

If you don't want to use Muggles just obliviate any knoweldge about the Potters from random minions. It's probably going to go faster because they have magic at their disposal to find them. I'm sure there's a "see through wall" spell.
