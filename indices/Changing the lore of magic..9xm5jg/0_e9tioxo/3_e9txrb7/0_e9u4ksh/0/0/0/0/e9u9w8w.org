I don't think that would exactly work. As long as the information pertains to the Potter and /Voldemort/ knows it's about the Potters, his mind would be unable to process the answer the Muggles would give him/the Muggles would inexplicably find themselves unable to divulge it. (Also, Godric's Hollow doesn't exactly have a lot of Muggle population.)

And remember, per Prophecy, Voldemort was very insistant that it had to be /him/ who killed the Potter, not some Obliviated underling.
