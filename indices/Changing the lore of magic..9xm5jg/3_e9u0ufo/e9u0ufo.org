  I was thinking of making the Killing Curse not being able to penetrate Shield Charms but is such a dark spell that it would deteriorate the shield quickly anyway (unless you're a very powerful wizard/witch), something that wouldn't be abused as hell.

Interesting. I've seen it a few times the other way around, where they boost the spell. I saw one where it will go through all solid objects until it kills something.
