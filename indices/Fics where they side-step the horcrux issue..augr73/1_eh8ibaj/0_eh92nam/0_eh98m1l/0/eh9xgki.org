Yeah, I would assume that a Horcrux would contain the memories and feelings of Tom Riddle or Voldemort from the time that he made it, so if he was resurrected from it, he would regain those memories and likely the physical strength. Turning Voldy into a Veggie doesn't make the Death Eaters disappear either, and there would still be people who want to see him dead. Anyone could kill him and a Death Eater could them resurrect him, then you'd just be back at square one, possibly even worse because the whole process would be more secretive.
