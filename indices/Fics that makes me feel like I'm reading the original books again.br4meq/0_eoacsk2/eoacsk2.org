linkffn(11419408) Reads like a companion piece.

linkffn(12713828) A Fem!Harry fic that does a great job of expanding the magical world while maintaining the feel of canon. The first year adventure is more tame than canon, but I found it exciting to read.

linkffn(10758358) AU. Excellent mysteries that feel very canon like without being anything like a rehash.
