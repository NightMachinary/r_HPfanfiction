These fics feel very much like the original books:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is canon compliant Year 6 from Ginny's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is amazing because despite being an AU dark Harry story, the Trio characterizations and interactions totally feel like in canon.
