I had that feeling just a few of times reading fanfic. The most pronounced one was with linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) mostly because of the huge world building and great character dev, combined with true to canon personalities but with just a tiny bit more, well, character. They aren't so bland as canon, nor Mary/Gary Stu-ish, but there were others who gave me that feeling.

linkffn(Grow Young with Me; Behind the Veil; The Legacy by storytellerspw; Griffindor's Girl; Worthy of Magic; The Song of the Trees; Realignment)

Though it gets a lot of hate here, mostly because people dislike the fact that it has soooo many side-plots and the main plot never moves on, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) was for me one of the best fics where it introduced new or differents approaches to canon magic, like esoteric spells and the way the Mind Arts work, and the concept of an actual Prince and their trials to get to there were fascinating to me. Yes, I hate the sideplots as much as the next dude, but you can't argue that HP PoS is one hell of a fic.
