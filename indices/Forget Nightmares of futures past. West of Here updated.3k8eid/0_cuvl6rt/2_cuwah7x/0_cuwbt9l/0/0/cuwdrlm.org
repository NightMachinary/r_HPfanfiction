Are Harry and the consequences of his absence to the wizarding world the only thing that is changed? Or are their other AU aspects (changed magical system, OC characters, etc)

  That's why he talks that way. When he finally gets put back into his own time line he is much harsher

His speech patterns came across as hokey to me. What did people sound like back then and out west? I'm not sure. Maybe like that. I do like the element of Harry being harsher due to his experiences.
