Ingredients aren't on the list but in chapter 5 "Diagon Alley" of book 1 we get this:

"Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop)."

Plus in chapter 4 "The Leaky Cauldron" of PoA,

"He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients".

So it's clearly expected that students bring at least some basic stuff with them.

EDIT: Plus "Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed" from Ch 27 of book 4. "Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions" and "“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything ---” and "You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today" all from ch 9 of book 6.
