Except that could just have been Hagrid who remembered buying potion ingredients from his second and third year and so went to the apothecary with Harry despite the supplies list not mentioning ingredients. I also said first years. The faculty may not expect from first years to bring their own ingredients since they are beginners and they wouldn't want them to experiment with potions without being supervised while second years are â€˜allowed' to since have experience with the subject.

Could also just be that Rowling didn't look back at the supplies list, although it's a bit unlikely because how would you remember scales but not ingredients, and I don't think the scales are ever mentioned again after Harry buys them.
