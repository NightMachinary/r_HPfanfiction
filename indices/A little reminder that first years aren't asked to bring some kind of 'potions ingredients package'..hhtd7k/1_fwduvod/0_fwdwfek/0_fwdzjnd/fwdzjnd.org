That sounds like a stretch to me.

Scales are mentioned several times over the series:

“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales, “have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning ---they reckon Sirius Black's been sighted.”

Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.

“Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .”

“I haven't got a book or scales or anything --- nor's Ron --- we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see ---”

There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible.

Etc etc.
