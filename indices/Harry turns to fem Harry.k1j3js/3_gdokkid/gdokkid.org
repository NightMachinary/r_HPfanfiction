Many (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/cepls-introduction-to-femharrys.html][my comments on it]]), but two are outstanding:

- “To Reach Without by inwardtransience” linkao3(8495269) for its good description of anxiety from the transformation. Unfortunately, it is unfinished, and it seems to lead to some kind of OP!Harry, which I cannot care less about.

- “Becoming Harriet by Teao” linkao3(4876630) for good story unfortunately partially overwhelmed by the deluge of smut. If you skip lemons, the rest is pretty good and simple story.

The comments linked above have more examples.
