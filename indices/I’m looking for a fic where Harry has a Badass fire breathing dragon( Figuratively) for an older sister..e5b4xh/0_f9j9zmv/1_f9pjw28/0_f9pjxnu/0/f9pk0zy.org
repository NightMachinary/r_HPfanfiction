Will do! I'm intrigued by an actual redemption arc for Draco because I don't like him one jot normally. It's a reason I avoid Dramione- he's a racist prick who tormented Hermione and her friends at any chance he got, and honestly, if he could kill her without getting his hands dirty I feel he would. He was just too scared by the thought of having to kill Dumbledore himself in canon.
