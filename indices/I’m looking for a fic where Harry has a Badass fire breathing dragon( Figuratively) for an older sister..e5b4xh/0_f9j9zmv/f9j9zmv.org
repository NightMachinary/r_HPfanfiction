Is it a specific story you're looking for? Because I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To Be a Slytherin]] and it's about Harry's twin sister who's an absolute badass and she sometimes uses dark magic. She's very protective of Harry. It's monstrously long though so it's a commitment. But I recommend it. It's amazing.
