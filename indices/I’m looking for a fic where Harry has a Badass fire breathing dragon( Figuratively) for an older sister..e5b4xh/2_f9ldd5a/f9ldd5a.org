Oh boy do I have a good rec for you . White Heather For Protection linkao3(7228006) is so damn good. She's ridiculously protective of Harry. Harry's sister is two years older and they were at the Dursley's together for a bit. The fic is long but the pacing is great cauze doesn't drag anything out too long. Give it a go!!
