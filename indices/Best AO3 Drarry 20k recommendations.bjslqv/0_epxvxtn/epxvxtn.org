Read all the Advent fics by Saras_Girl on ao3. Seriously, they are freakin incredible.

Also, I just finished tea and no sympathy. I have to say I wasn't a big fan of some of the store's inconsistencies, it felt like there were a few things not thought through well enough. What really caught me though, and ultimately made me like the story very much, was the way Draco was portrayed. It was seriously one of the most realistic shortly-post-war depictions I've read in a long time.
