The only canonical on-screen international travel we see is Newt Scamander using Muggle means to do so. We can also assume that the Beauxbatons Carriage and the Durmstrang ship travelled from their respective schools. You can probably use Portkeys for official visits (between ministries of magic) or for international events, but other than that I think that it is up to you. Apparition would likely not work if you don't know the destination (destination being one of the three Ds of apparition).
