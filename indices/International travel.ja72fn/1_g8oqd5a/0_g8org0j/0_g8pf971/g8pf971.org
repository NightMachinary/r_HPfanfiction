I don't think there's an established alternative. I read a fic where the various Gringotts branches were connected by their own internal floo network.

Obviously in theory flight (broom/carpet) is also an option.

Generally I've felt that apparition depends on the distance being covered. For example: southern England to northern France is likely easy; but southern England to northern Scotland would be a stretch.
