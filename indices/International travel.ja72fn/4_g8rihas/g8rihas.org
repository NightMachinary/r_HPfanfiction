Judging by the sorts of transit we see in canon, most likely the alternative to a portkey would be an enchanted vehicle (H. Express, Durmstrang's ship, Knight Bus as you mentioned) or a carriage pulled by a magical creature (Beauxbatons' carriage, Hogsmeade carriages). Traveling via ship provides some opportunities for fun world-building---maybe the route passes through â€˜magical waters,' which drastically cut down on travel distance and host magical sea creatures and merfolk.
