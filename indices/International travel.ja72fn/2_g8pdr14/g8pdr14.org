While completely unsupported by cannon, my opinion is thus:

Apparation is difficult to complete successfully when traveling long distances, especially to somewhere you haven't been before. While it's possible to apparate based on a map, or even a good description and a general knowledge of location, it's still not something you want to do when adding complicating factors such as extra stuff/people or long distances.

Portkeys are better, but require that they either be made at the destination location /or/ by someone who knows the destination extremely well. And due to the risks of destabilizing the magic, it's not a very good idea to apparate or portkey while holding a portkey as you run the risk of wrecking the stored one. Similarly, traveling too far on a portkey risks failure. A sufficiently skilled creator can mitigate those risks significantly, of course.

This makes both portkeys and apparation poor choices for your "every day" long range/international travel. Perfectly acceptable for low volume travel by highly skilled/experienced travelers, or simply those able to spend the money to get a reliable long distance portkey made.

Next on the list is magical vehicles. The main issue here is that they're extremely finicky to make, as the spells that go into them have a nasty habit of reacting unpredictably. Take the weasley's car, for example -- it going feral is not an unusual or even particularly unexpected result. Nobody likes being thrown around in the knight bus, but why hasn't it been replaced? Because it /can't/ be replaced. Wizards had been trying to make something like the knight bus for /decades,/ ever since Britain start seriously building a national road network. All failures. The knight bus was one of the rare successes of a magical vehicle that reliably did what it was supposed to do and has, so far, never run off to do it's own thing. There's a reason why Durmtrang came in a 300 year old sail boat. Magical vehicles must be able to dynamically react to an ever changing environment and it's a fine line between "functional" and "functionally an animal." The Hogwarts Express has a much lower risk of going feral because it doesn't have to react to the environment - it just follows the tracks and it's up to the wizards on board to make sure the tracks are still there, not the train.

Which brings us to the next method: Animals. There are many, many magical beasts who are suitable for long range travel. Whether it's pulling a lightened carriage like Beauxbatons or riding it directly like Harry and friends did on thestrals, magical animals, when sufficiently trained or controlled, are some of the most repeatable and accessable methods of magically traveling long distances.

And then there's the last option, which until relatively recently, took the longest out of all of them: Muggles. Whether it's hiring a carriage, booking passage on a boat, or buying an airplane ticket, the muggles will get you there. Eventually.

There's other methods, of course, like brooms or flying carpets, but between the absolute explosion of muggles across the landscape and mental and physical effort involved, you're probably better off just hiring a muggle to take you there.
