There's a Hogwarts Express page that says the original method of travel was portkeys, but too many sick kids caused them to steal a train.

Most can't apparate from Scotland or London to Germany, Tonks was howling at the thought of riding through or very close to clouds at night from Surrey to London, and I think ships, carriages, trains and the like are for schools; thousands of people traveling from the same location to another.
