I agree with all of your pairings though I would change their "rankings". Of course I also like trios made out of the same pairings (eg harry is head of house Black and house potter). And then you can add multi until you get into full harems.

1.  Harry/Hermione/Luna

2.  Harry/Hermione/Fleur

3.  Harry/Hermione/Tonks

4.  Harry/Fleur/Tonks

5.  Harry/Fleur/Luna

6.  Harry/Hermione/Daphne

7.  Harry/Narcissa/Bellatrix

8.  Harry/Bellatrix/Tonks

9.  Harry/Bellatrix/Narcissa/Tonks

10. Then mix and match the above ladies to get various foursomes and up, adding girls such as the Patils, Bones, Davis, Abbott, Li, etc
