Well I have to warn you I have a high tolerance for cliches/tropes/and bashing and several authors that many here don't like. My only criteria is does the story keep me entertained none of the rest bothers me. With that said here are some Harry/Hermione/Luna recommendations.

But first since the OP was looking for single pairings.
