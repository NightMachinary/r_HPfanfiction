Technically this was only Dumbledore's plan, we don't see it happening and thus have no way of knowing for sure if it would actually work. For me it always came across as being more guess-work than anything else. Plus it would only manage to take the wand's loyalty, not it's power (eg. Voldemort managed to use it to great effect despite it being loyal to his enemy) so either it would never be loyal to anyone anymore but still be much more powerful than a regular wand or it would just chose it's next master by itself (maybe Olivander takes it to his shop and have costumers try it until it accepts someone?)
