Harry: /Lashes out, magic crackling/

Dumbledore: /pulls out wand to repair chair/

Harry: /magic disarms Dumbledore and pulls wand into hand/

Non-bashed Dumbledore: "[[https://tenor.com/view/anime-cute-shocked-zoom-surprised-gif-14778758][...]]"

Harry: "[[https://tenor.com/view/surprised-pikachu-pokemon-shock-surprised-pikachu-gif-15357817][...]]"

Dumbledore: /Plan B hatching/ "Well, that was unexpected, my boy, but it's actually perfect! Don't worry, I have another wand saved, just keep this one safe and don't let anyone see it. Here, take this, it's a little special thing you can carry the most important things to you in without anyone taking them, I feel it will come useful in the future." /Winks and gives spatial ring because fanfiction/

Harry: /Puts ring on, puts wand in and exits in daze because wtf just happened/

Dumbledore: /Already planning on the actual Master of Death ritual so that Immortal Harry can do afterlife management and be Immortal so that Dumbledore can get a nice vacation on one of Afterlife's many islands for free because he knows the co-owner of Afterlife/

/Because MoD is actually a permanent role that makes you an absolutely Immortal person of equal standing to Death and Death has been actually looking for a worthy friend and business partner for centuries. Harry shall forever be an Entity equivalent of the filthy rich owner of a giant hotel chain and islands/leader of a country except the hotel chain/country is actually an entire dimension./
