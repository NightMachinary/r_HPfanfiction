Joking aside, I personally regard the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal][Perfectly Normal]] series by BrilliantLady to be the best example of this that I've found. It explores the world and setting in a way Rowling never even considered, and it fleshes out every single character into a real /person,/ instead of a flat, one dimensional caricature.
