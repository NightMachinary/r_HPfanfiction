Not overall better than canon, but I can think of a few that deal with elements of canon better.

Linkao3(Common Sense by Grohiik) has better worldbuilding than most fics I've read, and definitely better than canon considering JKR's worldbuilding is so hit and miss.

Marauder Era characterisation in [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] can be considered at least canon adjacent, especially considering the sort of offal deemed canon these days.

Linkao3(In The Black by izzythehutt) gives an excellently nuanced look into high society politics and how privilege breeds prejudice, whereas JKR would have us believe that only a hat telling you to wear green when you're eleven makes you racist.

Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) takes a better look at how a war machine is supposed to work than just "Dumbledore said so", and gives Harry a hero's journey that he has to work for.

Tl:dr, there are a lot of excellent writers in fandom who've dedicated a lot of time and effort into exploring elements of the Harry Potter world where JKR has repeatedly dropped the ball.
