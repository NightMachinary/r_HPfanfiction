I find that the best fic are the ones where a authors build their own world, whether they only use the bare bones of Rowling's world is also a factor as well. For insistence, I find a story such as linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) is great because it is /so/ different from many other fics I've read, and it's because the author took the time to branch away from the norm, but saying it better then the cannon? No, but it's none convectional from many 100s of other Fic's I've seen out there.
