I'll say the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity, mostly because it's what I'm reading now. It reads a lot like the early books, except you have things like people noticing that House Elves are basically slaves as well as hints as to /why/ they're okay with that, an actual examination of what happens when wizards visit a loving Muggle household and don't make any bones of the fact that they're ultimately pretty irrelevant, and MUCH better worldbuilding of non-Hogwarts schools.

In fact, Voldemort is the only canon character who gets namedropped, to the best of my knowledge, and a witch who might be Luna shows up in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo during third year, but it doesn't use ANY canon characters apart from that.
