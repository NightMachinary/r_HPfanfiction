Really, fanfiction is a different beast than the novels. Authors already have a universe and release on a different schedule. It actually compares a bit to how Dickens used to release Novels, a piece at a time.

As for better, well that's opinion here. Rowling is a great author. She has flaws, but her work being so universally popular people can nitpick it is amazing.
