The fic that gets closest for me is Meaning of One by Sovran.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a Hinny Soul Bond fic, and I know they get a bad reputation, but this is legitimately amazing. The characterisations are perfect, I'd seriously just read it for McGonagall. The original ideas in world building like the Toy Shop in Diagon Alley, the Seeker's Duel, the Throw-Dough spell, all have the same depth and whimsy as canon. The relationship between Harry and Ginny is just the most wholesome and heartwarming thing, and the Bond between them has set rules abilities that are set in stone, but the Bond doesn't get explained due to some Flamel Ex Machina, it's treated the same way Love is treated in canon. And then there's the emotion, god, it made trapdoor in the third floor corridor exciting and tense again. The Ravenclaw Quidditch match had me waving my arms like a kid. The humour from the twins was just gut-busting. Then there's the heartbreak and drama, I don't want to spoil any of it.

I'm rambling aren't I...

I'll stop now. Check my flair.
