Well... it's similar to AO3's M rating more than an R rating. At least in the context of the fic.

For details, it went from I think it was “PG” to “R” after it described someone's nose getting blown off.

The most you have to worry about is violence similar to Deathly Hallows, and a mature and non-fetishising, yet realistic take on puberty.
