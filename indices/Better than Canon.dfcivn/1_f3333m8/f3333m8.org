I'm not saying it's better than canon in every aspect, but I've never read a fic that dives into the historical potential for the wizarding world like this one. It's a fascinating take on what European history would have been if magic existed. The main story has some trope-y bits, its not everyones cup of tea, but the history alone is significant.
