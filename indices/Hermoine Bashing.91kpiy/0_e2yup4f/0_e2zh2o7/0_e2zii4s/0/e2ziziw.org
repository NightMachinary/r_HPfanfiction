Gnomes think order is something that you do in a restaurant, and Hermione is pure gnome at this point morality wise. It's also really, really hard for warlocks to be anything but evil since, you know, soul sucking, and Hermione is going to be dabbling in necromancy, which is top shelf evil. Hermione might slowly slide to neutral (on the good/evil axis), but right now she's far to selfish and willing to break all societal norms to be anything but chaotic evil.

Remember, in the DnD alignments, evil doesn't mean you kill puppies and are always actively malicious, only that you are very selfish and have no interest in anything that isn't good for you personally, and perhaps one or two people you love (if it won't hurt you).
