Oh Champions of the Two Worlds is 100% Hermione bashing. Though less in the "let's drag Hermione's character through the dirt" kind of thing and more of "what would happen if Hermione let her curiosity get the better of her and dove head first into the dark arts because she was lost and lonely."

A big part of her start of darkness is that she was cut off from Ron and Harry for years, and when they did reunite both of them rejected her because they realized she'd become increasingly amoral. The last chapter shows just how far she's fallen, willingly killing other humans to achieve her goal and not even realizing she's become evil.

Spoilers: In the timeline the story takes place in, the Six Strangers manage to guide Hermione back to a semblance of "good". She's still a soul sucking warlock who develops a really unhealthy fascination with the undead and necromancy, but she tries not be completely evil a little. However, there will be an alternate timeline older Hermione who shows up who is possibly the most evil and dangerous villain in the story short of the Lich King and Sargaras (AKA Sauron Lite and Diet Satan). Even "good" Hermione is the Vegita of the group and is firmly in the Chaotic Evil alignment.
