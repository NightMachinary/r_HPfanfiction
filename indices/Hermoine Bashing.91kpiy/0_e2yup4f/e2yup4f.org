[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463)

I won't call it bashing, but she has become a mad scientist type warlock in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/][Champions of the Two Worlds]], who really likes to drain souls from sentient beings, linkffn(12888333). She's both amazing and horrifying in the latest chapter.
