My bad about rule 8. I've skimmed the rules before but I clearly didn't remember that one. A previous time someone asked for Cedric bashing and I asked them why because I legitimately didn't understand the logic behind it (like, he barely exists til book 4, then he spends the whole time being a nice person then dies). I was gonna do the same here but then it evolved into a rant, partly because I can at least think of some of the logic behind it (despite vehemently disagreeing with that logic).

I'll make sure not to go on rants during fic search or LF threads again.
