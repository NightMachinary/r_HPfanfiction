I don't like that rule personally. The whole point of this subreddit is for discussion about HP fanfiction, as long as you are discussing something relevant to the topic at hand I don't see the issue. If you responded about cactuses then there is an issue, but your comment was relevant to the thread (bashing).

Just my take of course, but I don't really think you did anything wrong.
