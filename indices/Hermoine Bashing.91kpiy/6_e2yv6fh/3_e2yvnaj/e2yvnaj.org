I read bashing fics as more of a guilty pleasure than as a serious read. It may be lazy, but god damn it can be so satisfying at times.

Deprived and Paid in Blood may not be the best fanfics out there but there is just something about them that makes me return to them. Is the bashing over the top? Of course. But it doesn't always mean that the story does not have any other redeeming characteristics.

I honestly can't imagine the fandom without bashing, its honestly so prevalent that HP fanfiction wouldn't be what it is without it. Does that mean I like it or thing it is good writing? No not at all, but it certainly has its place.
