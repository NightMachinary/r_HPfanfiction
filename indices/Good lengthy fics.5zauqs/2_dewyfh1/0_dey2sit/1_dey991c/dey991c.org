There's no singular ship. The overarching pairing is with Tonks, but they rarely meet 'cause he's still in school and she's busy with the war. Aside from her, he's flitatious with a few people and has a clearly deepening relationship with quite a few others (Hermione, Tracy). He's also got a motherly relationship with somebody other than Molly, which I absolutely adore and fervently wish other fics had more of.
