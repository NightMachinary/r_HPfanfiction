The Rune Stone Path is probably the only well-depicted polyamorous relationship I have read so far. Although it is Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Daphne with Daphne/Luna/Tracy is the background it is a superbly written story with a well-designed concept (Harry uses runes for everything and invents his own tools that way) and good characters.
