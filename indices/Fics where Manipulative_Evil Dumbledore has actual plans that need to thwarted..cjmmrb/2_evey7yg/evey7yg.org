I haven't re-read this series in ages, but I still remember it being good. Although that may have been when my tastes were less mature.\\
Harry Potter & the Viper's Brand was never finished, and Behind and Between are sort of snippets to the main story.

But as far as I can remember, Dumbledore isn't just a bad guy, he's a prophesied bad guy (the 'Spider' or something) bent on conquering the whole world for reasons I don't quite remember.
