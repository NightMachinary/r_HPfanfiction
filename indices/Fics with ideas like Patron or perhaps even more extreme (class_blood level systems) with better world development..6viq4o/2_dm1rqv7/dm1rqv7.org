The whole Sacrifices arc by Lightning on the Wave has pretty awesome world building and absolutely fascinating magical rituals. It does turn into Harry/Draco fairly quickly from what I remember, but I think it's low on actual physical scenes for awhile (she does all 7 books)... though I could be wrong since it's been a long time since I read it. Sacrifices does not have a strict caste system in relation to muggles/halfbloods/etc.
