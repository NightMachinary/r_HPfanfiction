Delenda est is well written, good dialogue and decent characterisation. Seventh horcrux is good as a crack-fic.

Anything that reads poorly does not pass well with me- Take 'we are the golden trio', and almost every re-do fic. Harry's response to going back in time is so underplayed, he acts completely irrationally, and in the aforementioned fic, you get poor dialogue like

"Please tell me you remember the next 15 years"

"I do Hermione Weasley!" said Harry smiling in relief.

Read it out out. Who the fuck talks like that.

'Harry couldn't believe it, baby Rose was here, and her Mummy and Daddy were 11-year-old virgins.'

What kind of rubbish writing is this?

You also get contrived plots- "Emit ni ogl lah su oyer ehw tube rau oye rehw ton woshi", as a 'Mirror of Emit'.

I don't even think a comment is necessary on that.

However, in the end, a lot of people do enjoy really poorly written fics, and the standard of fics is incredibly low. They're often written by teenagers, and I am not saying teenagers are incapable of writing, but often it is so. But really, if you do enjoy it, read it, nothings stopping you. But I am also going to give my opinion on recommendation of horrible fics as I feel like many readers agree with me, and someone commenting on this post would have saved me many a cringe.
