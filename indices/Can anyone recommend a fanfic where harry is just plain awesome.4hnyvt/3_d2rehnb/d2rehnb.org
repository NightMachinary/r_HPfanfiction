I guess "awesome" is relative but i really liked these two:

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

It is pretty dark i guess. I depends on what other fics you've read and what you personally consider dark. It has some very fluffly moments but also some incredibly sad ones. Harry is definitely awesome though.

Then there's linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). It's pretty well known by now. It sounds like a crack fic at first but it's really not. It's one of the best Drama's i've read in recent memory.

It's certainly not the usual awesome badass Harry but he does some really, really cool things with Divination. I guess this story really doesn't fit your requirements but i thought a different perspective on what the definition of "awesome" can be couldn't hurt.

(As you can probably tell i have a thing for dimension travel and Honks but i just can't help it. I just think Tonks deserves better than Remus Lupin :D)
