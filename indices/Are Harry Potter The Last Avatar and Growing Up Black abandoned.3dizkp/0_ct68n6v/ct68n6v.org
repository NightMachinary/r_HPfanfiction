Here is my personal rule. If the story has not been updated in 12 months, its abandoned. The only exceptions are if their profile is updated with info. Do some research on their profile, and generally, if its 12 months with nothing, its probably abandoned, sadly. /this only really applies to Harry Potter Fanfiction. Anime/manga fanfictions are normally abandoned after 9 months, movie fanfictions are normally abandoned after 6 months, and all else is 4 months./ *Keep in mind these are MY personal rules. I do not pretend to speak for others.*
