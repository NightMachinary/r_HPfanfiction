I would argue that Emperor isn't a good romance story, not because the romance is a background element, but because when it does show up, it's not particularly nuanced. The fact that they took a long time to get married is irrelevant in the face of the fact that they were pretty much described as the OTP since the very first chapter where they show up together.

Tl;dr - the Harry/OC pairing in Emperor isn't well written. Rather like Vin/Elend in Mistborn.
