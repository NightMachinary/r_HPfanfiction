  Lily Potter would do anything to save her son. A chance encounter with a passage about a ritual to Summon a Great Power leads her to make a desperate attempt to do so. The consequences are more than she could have anticipated. Especially for Harry, having this weird voice in his head calling itself a "Bright Lord." HP/SoM slight crossover
