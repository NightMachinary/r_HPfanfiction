I didn't 'shit' on anyone's responses bro, I forgot to explain properly and made a mistake. If you think I was rude, you're totally wrong. I just explained to him properly that I did not want to read those kind of fanfictions.... So I don't understand what you're getting at. I even acknowledged that person's preferences.
