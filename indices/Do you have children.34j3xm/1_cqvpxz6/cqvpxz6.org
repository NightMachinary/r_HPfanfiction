Writing kids is hard, full stop. Most people screw it up. I've personally found the writers who I happen to know are parents to have almost universally /terrible/ representations of kids in their stories, even compared to other writers. Maybe those terrible ones are just the ones who brag about it. Who knows.

Most people screw up writing kids from ignorance, but parents seem to do it from some ideological position than sends things into weird places. They usually massively under-age kid personalities, making a 12-year-old sound like they are eight or nine, and so forth. In writing teens, they usually also avoid the scary and gross parts of that age, making the characters either mature twenty-something date machines with only honorable intentions, or sexless child drones confused in all the wrong ways by adolescence. In those stories, no one ever giggles to their girlfriends about hearing their older cousin talking about blow jobs, or gossips about which girl in class has the biggest boobs with the other guys, like real thirteen-year-olds do.

Writers who happen to be parents rarely confuse kids with adults, true. But the odd moppets they so often write usually have more to do with personal fantasies of perfect little kids staying perfect forever than actual adolescents. This often means loving scenes of children being held and snuggled by parents well into their teens (this doesn't happen), the characters being oddly physically tiny and emotionally fragile (the better to hug), and all teens and tweens wanting maximum time hanging out with their cool parents (nope!).

I once suggested to someone wanting to write realistic modern kids that they search for boy band fans and videogamers tweeting to get an idea of modern youth culture and terminology. I never heard from them again, so either it worked or their brain exploded. Either way, that is the sort of level of dedication and attention to detail required to actually write kids and how they interact with each other. Brain exploding levels of attention to detail.
