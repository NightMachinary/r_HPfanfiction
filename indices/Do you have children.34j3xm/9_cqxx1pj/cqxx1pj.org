I'm a parent of a thirteen year old and a sometimes-author (though I've not written any child-Harry stories since my son was older).

It's a challenge to write children of that age. Even classrooms of similarly aged children are highly diverse inhow they act and perceive the world as they navigate puberty. There's no single tween/early-teen mindset. Even a given child can be expected to change so much from day to day that unless you took role it'd be hard to identify him or her as the same person.
