Eh, while I'm sure there are many theories on the subject, I don't think you can really apply them to every individual. It's not like there's a universal way that all 13-year-olds think and speak. As long as the characters feel like their canon selves, or if they don't it's because of an AU change that makes them interesting in and of themselves, I'm fine with it.
