  Writing Kids with realistic kid-like voices and thought processes is a rare talent.

I'd agree with that. You could say the same thing about ice dancing or juggling or country music, though. Just because I can appreciate the talent and effort it takes doesn't mean I necessarily want to experience it. For me, stories like PotDK are a struggle to read and enjoy precisely because of Harry's "kid-ness." While I appreciate the writing ability it takes to make Harry realistically eleven, I don't want to read about real eleven-year-olds, I want to read about heroically or dramatically or narratively /special/ eleven-year-olds. I want to read about the parts that make them different or interesting.
