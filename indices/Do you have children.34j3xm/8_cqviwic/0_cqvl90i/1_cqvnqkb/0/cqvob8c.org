  I don't want to read about real eleven-year-olds, I want to read about heroically or dramatically or narratively special eleven-year-olds.

Well, forget PotDK. Try to emulate canon in that respect. I always loved eleven year old Harry's voice in canon, and his growth as a character is realistic and well done. Surely you enjoyed the HP books despite Harry's "kid-ness"? If you want your Harry to be more mature, try to emulate PoA Harry instead. Your Harry is /way/ too mature for his age.

Then again, may be it's only my personal preference. I certainly won't begrudge you your preference, and I enjoy your story despite the fact. Still, give me a canon-like kid over a super-kid any day of the week.
