To be honest, Harry's "kid-ness" in canon isn't something I particularly enjoy. JKR is a good enough writer that it doesn't outright bother me, but the last time I re-read the series I skimmed pretty hard over the examples of this. The times I like Harry most are the times when he's cool and collected: slipping Ron fake Felix Felicis to pump him up for the game. Putting the pieces together at Shell Cottage in DH and deciding to go after the Horcruxes. Standing up to Rufus Scrimgeour. The last duel with Voldemort where he's explaining how he's already won.

Anyway, personal preference, yeah.

With respect to my fic, it's kind of a moot point, anyway. Even if I did agree that Harry (and Cho, and Cedric, and Fleur, and all my characters I suppose) are written too mature, it's not like I could suddenly change course and have them start talking like "normal" kids. It would require a systemic edit, and I'm not even sure how I'd go about it. Parse every line of dialogue and add a bunch of "likes" and "ums"? Take out all the parts where Harry is emotionally mature enough to think in shades of grey? Take away all the lessons he learned from his AU upbringing and make him more emotionally impulsive?

I'm not trying to be hyperbolic, I'm honestly asking. If I did want to write the characters in my story with more realistic (or canonical) levels of "kid-ness", how exactly would I go about that?
