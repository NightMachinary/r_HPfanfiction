  The times I like Harry most are the times when he's cool and collected
#+end_quote

So do I. But the reason I like him at those times is because that is not the way he normally acts. If Harry made himself out to be one the "Cool Kids" and generally acted like he does in the ever-popular indy-Harry fics, I probably wouldn't have cared much about those moments either.

  Take out all the parts where Harry is emotionally mature enough to think in shades of grey? Take away all the lessons he learned from his AU upbringing and make him more emotionally impulsive?
#+end_quote

Hmmm, I don't like what you're doing here. You basically smooth out any imperfections Harry had in canon and give his alternate upbringing as an excuse. I do agree that it would make Harry a bit more outgoing and confident, but being raised by Sirius and the ever-passive Remus should come with complications of its own. Sirius is hardly the paragon of virtue ...........\\

 \\
.......and doesn't really strike me as an ideal parent ideal, regardless of how much he matured from his teenage self.\\
 

Regardless of what Harry's alternate upbringing would entail, with no insecurities or internal conflict or guilt or any real challenge (yet) for that matter, your Harry doesn't make a very compelling protagonist. What made Harry's first year compelling was that Harry was experiencing a good life for the first time, and with all his insecurities, every class and indeed, every conversation held some sort of challenge, and Draco made for a worthy antagonist in those early stages.

 \\
Now, it would be pointless for you to have attempted to rehash the same story JKR was writing, but I do think that other stories -- /Boy Who Lived/, /The Last Avatar/, PotDK -- managed Harry's school life better than you did. Your story has other points where you have them beat (your descriptions of magic, for one) but not in this.\\
 

Your Harry lacks a Draco Malfoy. Perhaps you didn't intend to focus much on schoolyard rivalries, but when you /do/ end up writing so much about Harry's school life, you should have included more challenges. Perhaps some upper class men, like in Santi's fic? Zacharias Smith doesn't really count. I would also point out that many of my problems with Harry's characterization extend to Cedric and Cho as well, and that your insistence in making them strong, intelligent characters makes them less exciting than Ron and Hermione, or Viktor and Calypso, for that matter.\\
 

I would add that all of the above is purely personal opinion and what I dislike in the story. I would hate for you to take any of the criticism personally.\\

  I'm not trying to be hyperbolic, I'm honestly asking. If I did want to write the characters in my story with more realistic (or canonical) levels of "kid-ness", how exactly would I go about that?
#+end_quote

The "kid-ness" ship has long sailed and really, is a nitpick more than anything else. I would prefer it, however, if you do find some real challenges for Harry, because right now, his character seems to be he loafing about, waiting for Voldemort to return and for him to finally get to do /something/.\\
 

I think it would be good idea to add to the hints of arrogance and general disregard for his housemates, to make it a substantial character flaw and for it to come bite him in the ass and force him to change. This whole "maturation" can make for a pretty compelling story. Hmmm, have you read /The Phoenix and the Serpent/? Harry's journey, and his interactions and conflict with Dahlia in particular, make for some excellent character growth. /Hogwarts Battle School/ too, where Harry realizes that ordering his housemates around did not make him a successful leader. Teddy Lupin, when he goes too far with his showy protests in /Hogwarts Houses Divided/ and pays the price the time he's attacked. So yeah, flaws, insecurities, conflict, maturation. All that stuff.\\
 

Alternatively, you can just make Voldemort return soon. That works as well as anything. A bit of desperation and challenge is just what your story needs.
