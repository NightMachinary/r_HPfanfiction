Good thoughts. Don't worry, I have thick skin - I've written a couple original fiction novels, and I've long since learned to be able to talk about the strengths and weaknesses of my writing without getting all defensive or taking it personally.

I do think you're right about the fic needing more opposition, more things to challenge Harry and his friends. This will ramp up in the next few chapters.
