Alexandra has almost textbook ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). It's seriously as though the author opened up the DSM-5 and wrote the character. I think she's VERY realistic...because those kids exist, and they never /learn/ and never /mature/ unless you intervene. The adults in AQ are horrible people (seriously, I would say that's my biggest complaint about AQ...not a single one of them see a struggling child and think "hmm, gotta do something about that". Maybe it's a critique of the American education system...), so by the end of the fourth book, she's hit rock bottom in a fiery crash...which, sadly enough, is pretty much what happens to children with ODD.
