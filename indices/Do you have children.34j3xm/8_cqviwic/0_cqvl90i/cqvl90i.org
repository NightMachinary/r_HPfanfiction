Writing Kids with realistic kid-like voices and thought processes is a rare talent. I always thought Harry in your story felt more like a twenty year old than a kid. Stories like /Hogwarts Houses Divided/, /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ and /On the Way to Greatness/ actually make kids sound like kids.

Most importantly, there is a sort-of satisfaction in watching characters mature from their childish selves to adults in multi-year fics. While your story has plenty of positives, this is where you miss out, I'm afraid. This is also where stories like AQ fail as well -- Alexandra is immature and reckless, which is great, but she never /learns/ and never /matures/. She hasn't till now, at any rate.

In contrast, /On the Way to Greatness/ does this incredibly well. Harry in his first and second year is noticeably much more child-like in his thoughts and actions, and his evolution as a leader in Slytherin and in school is organic and very well portrayed. One of the many reasons it is my favorite fanfic.
