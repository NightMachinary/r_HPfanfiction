I don't have any kids of my own. I am around them on a daily basis though and have my degree in Human and Family Development, so I know what you mean when you talk about writers not doing well with writing different ages. I read a fic once where a four year old Harry was making an elaborate plan and I was like a four year old is not developed enough cognitively to even think of planning their day tomorrow let alone months from now. I don't think I would do well writing from a child's perspective even knowing how children develop. Their minds are so limited until they develop their own autonomy.

I try to make it a point in my fic to write the teenagers as teenagers. Granted they are teenagers taking on adult tasks in a war, but emotionally and maturity wise I make sure they think and act as a teenager would. Or I at least try to, I'm told I do a good job with that, but who knows.
