I find it amusing but highly frustrating. I have no kids of my own, but I have little siblings, we're all a few years apart, so I've had practice with all age groups younger than myself. Plus friends' kids.

The children I see written in fics aren't... Right. It's like a five year old masquerading as an eleven year old, or an adult in an eleven year olds body. Weird. Kids don't talk like that. Kids don't regurgitate a thesaurus when they open their mouth, speak in metaphor, or profess their undying love (usually) until they're at least in their dramatic mid teens.
