It is a lack of /social/ intelligence that really differentiates kids 12 and younger and adults, outside the obvious practical world experiences. Before then, kids often act like cute little Hannibal Lecters because they /can't/ know any better.

Their brains literally aren't developed enough to have adult levels of empathy and socialization, regardless of their personal experiences. It just won't stick very well before then, even if they are raised well and with kindness.

That's hard to write, because it makes little kids seem selfish and mean when their internal motivations are exposed in prose. And they are, by and large, realistically speaking. But that doesn't read very well. So kids are often romanticized, unfairly whitewashing their flaws in favor of more sympathetic and appealing portrayals. More adult ones.
