I can see Walburga making him play music composed before the Statute of Secrecy, and he hates it, but then another Marauder or someone introduces him to modern music and suddenly he's annoying his mother by playing [[https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ][Bohemian Rhapsody]] . She forbids him from touching the piano after that.

Edited to include a link to the song on YouTube, not that I think anyone hasn't heard this song already and needs help finding it, but just to save y'all the few clicks it takes to get to it. Just picture the classically-trained Freddie Mercury as Sirius Black. Even the outfit works.
