I read this really long wolfstar fic that had muggle orphanage-raised Remus introducing Sirius to rock music as a major part of their relationship, particularly Bowie, Zeppelin etc. The fic itself was named after the song All The Young Dudes most notably played by Mott the Hoopie, which Bowie wrote & also performed in live shows.

I could see that as a part of canon without the slash for sure.
