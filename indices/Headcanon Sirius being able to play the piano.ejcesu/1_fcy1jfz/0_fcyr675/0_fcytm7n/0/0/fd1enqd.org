I have not read that - thanks for the rec! That one was a great song.

Now I kind of want to read a 60s/70s musical Hippy-esque revolution of Hogwarts fic where some enterprising Muggleborn in the Marauder's era somehow works out how to play Muggle music in Hogwarts and the culture changes accordingly. Purebloods everywhere embracing Peace, Love, and Good Vibrations. :)
