Talking about headcanons: ever after reading “Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard” (on [[https://charlotteannrose.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/sherlock-holmes-chpt1-the-strange-case-of-amelia-bones/][the author's Wordpress]] with pictures, not on FFnet) I have imagined inside of the Grimmauld Place as [[https://www.bcd-urbex.com/crookham-court-school-aka-harlequin-manor-berkshire/][Crookham Court in Berkshire]].
