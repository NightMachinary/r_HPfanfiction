Just FYI for anyone who wants to read this, it says 'complete' but what it really means is 'I wrote 3 chapters of a sequel then abandoned it'. And it's not one of those sequels that's unnecessary like the Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness' sequels, the story just stops for the sequel.

I might be a little bitter.
