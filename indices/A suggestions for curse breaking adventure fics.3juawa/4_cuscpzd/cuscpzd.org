Woops, sorry about the title... "Any* suggestions" was what I meant. I'd fix it if I knew a way, but I'm new to the whole Reddit scene.

 

I'm no author and it's nearly 5am, (up late reading fan fiction, I'm sure you understand (; ) so I hope you can forgive my mistake. /bows apologetically/

 

Lesson learned, though. 'Double check before posting. '
