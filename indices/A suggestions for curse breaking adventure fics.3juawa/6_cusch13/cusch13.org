[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12260&chapter=all][Curse Breaker: The Maya]] by Jonathan Avery: /Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter./

Very good exploration of curse breaking and the ancient Mayan civilization. Ginny's the main character, Harry comes in later.
