Why not see it as A small and embattled minority(purebloods) having their cultural values and heritage

Constantly insulted and derided as backwards and foolish by people who just entered their society(muggleborns).

Whilst the Ministry is filled with corrupt incompetents and then you have Dumbledore and his cohorts of Teachers controlling the Children's education.

And harry is molded into the path of a hero by the liberal academia and because of the fact that his parents were killed in a war, Obviously i cannot stand here and defend Voldemort he is literally a Dark lord,

But Rowling is deeply biased in her view of the World, Seriously who would ever follow the Cartoonish insane form of Voldemort?

There is not even a attempt to make him reasonable or at least coherent. There would be far more depth in the series if both sides were shown more Realistically and not so one-sided, But i also like the themes of GoodVSEvil.
