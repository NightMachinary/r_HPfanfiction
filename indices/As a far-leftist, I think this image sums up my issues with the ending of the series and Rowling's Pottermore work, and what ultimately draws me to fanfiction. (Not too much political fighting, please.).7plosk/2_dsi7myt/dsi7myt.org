On a sidenote, I'm honestly kind of shocked there isn't more leftist fanfiction out there, considering the series' supposed themes of resistance and intolerance of bigotry. It's mostly either apolitical or thinly veiled endorsement of the corruption found in authority within the series.

Well, there is the /other/ option: Riddle was a totally innocent man rebelling against the status quo using pureblood arguments as bait, which rubs me the wrong way given we explicitly see his sociopathic tendencies give into murder and torture, even as a child.
