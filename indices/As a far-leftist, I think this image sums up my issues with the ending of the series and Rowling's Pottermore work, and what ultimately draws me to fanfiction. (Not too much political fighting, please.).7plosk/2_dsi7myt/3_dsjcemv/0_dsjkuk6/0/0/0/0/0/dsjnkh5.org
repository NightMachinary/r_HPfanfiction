But extremists use their ideology as excuse for violence, not because they believe in it. During the recent G20 riots in Hamburg a lot of the left wing rioters were wearing brand clothing, had expensive smartphones and even looted an Apple store. They are rioting against capitalism and yet use its fruits. If you disagree with the term leftist then perhaps stalinist or communist work better?
