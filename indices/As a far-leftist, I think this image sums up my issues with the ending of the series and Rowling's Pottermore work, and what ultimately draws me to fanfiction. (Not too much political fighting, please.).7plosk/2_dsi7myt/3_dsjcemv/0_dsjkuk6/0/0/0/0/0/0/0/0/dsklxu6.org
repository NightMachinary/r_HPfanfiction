USSR and CCP politburos were relatively... ideologically(?) stable until the deaths of Stalin and Mao respectively, regardless of actual implementation, in that even with the divides between factions in the party there was still a general purpose of pushing forward with Marxist-derived thought, compared to say the Khmer Rouge, which acted as LARPers without actually following Marxist thought (of course, Pol Pot's actions are still pinned on communists. hmm).

There's a reason permanent revolution became a staple of Maoist thought.
