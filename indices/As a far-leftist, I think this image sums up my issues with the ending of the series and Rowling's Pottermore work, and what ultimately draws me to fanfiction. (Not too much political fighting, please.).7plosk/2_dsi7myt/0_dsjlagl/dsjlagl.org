Indeed - the epilogue is pretty much an "and all is well, nothing changed, picket fence for the heroes" ending. Not even a hint at drastic changes and reforms. No thought about how Draco's the only DE that wasn't locked up for life this time, or how Hermione is the Minister and freed the slaves. Just some banal "let's get the kids to school" scene. But I wouldn't call that liberal - it's arch-conservative.

Heck, in many of my stories, the system is as much an enemy as the Death Eaters, and it gets changed in my happy endings. If so many good guys die, it should have been worth it - and preserving or restoring the status quo isn't worth it. Not in HP-
