Yeah, your stories are more or less probably the most well-written revolution-based stories in the fanbase, if that makes sense.

Also, the liberal title comes mainly from non-US usage, I think, as the general population of the US has a fairly warped view of world politics and ideology (I think radical vs. reactionary would be a better fit, as the average democrat politician and the average republican politicians views on economics aren't that far off if you look at wider policies, although their social views do differ a bit more, although not nearly as much as people claim them to be)

sorry for the ramble!
