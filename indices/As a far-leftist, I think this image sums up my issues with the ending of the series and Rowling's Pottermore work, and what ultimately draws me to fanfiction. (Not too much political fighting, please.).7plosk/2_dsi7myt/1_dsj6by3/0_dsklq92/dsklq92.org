Literally everything ever is 'pushing an agenda', dude. Politics isn't some thing you can isolate totally from entertainment, especially when its base work is fairly open about its lukewarm political views. I'd rather see sloppy works that have a more informed view of the politics within the HP world than yet another monarchism and nepotism apology fic.
