So let me breakdown your issues one by one, and see if I can understand them:

- Harry should have done more for muggleborns: This, in my mind, gets blown out of proportion. Muggleborns aren't really persecuted until Voldemort's coup. There already existed a muggleborn minister, several muggleborn department heads (Dirk Cresswell). Not to mention, the only /real/ hate speech we hear, are from the Malfoys, who are extremists. Here's the thing, if muggleborns were persecuted, /there wouldn't be motivation for Death Eaters/. They'd be satisfied with the status quo. It was in fact, the rise of prominent muggleborns, and overall idea that muggleborns were equal as any of them, that spurred them into action.
- House-elves: I agree with you there. Dobby and friends get the short end of the stick.
- Harry didn't form his own group: But he did, the DA. He was kept out of the fight, and so he taught his own group. They called it Dumbledore's Army because of Fudge's paranoia. At the end, it's Dumbledore's Army who are fighting alongside the Order.
- The Aurors: The Auror's aren't like the FBI as much as they are the FBI counter-terrorism unit. They work on catching dark wizards. For Harry, who lost his parents to a dark wizard, I can see how it's appealing to join the group whose job it is to catch Voldemort and those like him, and maybe, stop another child from getting orphaned.

Harry is the opposite of Voldemort. He's a talented wizard, but a great man who's willing to do what's right over what's easy, especially for those around him. Say what you will about his passiveness, but at the end of the day, he walked to his death, something so much of the fandom writes off.
