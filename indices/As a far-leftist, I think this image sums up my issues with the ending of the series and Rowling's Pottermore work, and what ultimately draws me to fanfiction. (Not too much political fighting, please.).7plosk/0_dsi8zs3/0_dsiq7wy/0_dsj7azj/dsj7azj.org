This issue is pretty much my main gripe with the Series:

The stake against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy even worse than the Nazis or ISIS), and yet JK Rowling wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle.

For example, the Trio knocked out Fenrir Greyback after he had already mutilated Lavender Brown. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again.

Fuck that!

I totally hate the argument "killing will make you as bad as them".

No Stacy, killing the psychotic inbred cannibal isn't going to make you as bad as a psychotic inbred cannibal. Everyone who dies from here on out is all your fault. Fuckin' idiot.

And even if it does make me just as bad, one man's soul, one man's conscience, is not worth more than the lives of thousands! Yes, I will stoop to the bad guy's level and it will be worth it.
