Alright, lets talk about Harry's sacrifice for a moment. First things first, I acknowledge that people die in wars and the death of a select few can save many more. As Bismarck said, Iron and Blood drive change, not grand speeches. My issue is not that Harry was willing to sacrifice himself. My issue is that he was very stupid about it.

He did not try to find an alternative to remove the Horcrux (surgery, cursebeaking, basilisk venom + phoenix tears). But for arguments sake lets say that Harry had to take a killing curse for the team. He is walking up to the Death Eater camp and then just surrenders himself. Just think how many lives could have been saved if he used his clock and Gryffindor's sword to take a few Death Eaters like Bellatrix with himself. He knew that others would have to finish the fight. He's doomed to die that night. So why not make it easier for his friends?

You don't win a war with non lethal weapons. The Soviets did not win the Eastern front with stun batons. The Battle of Britain was not won with tear gas. Rowling turned Harry Potter into a war story where the protagonist is fighting magical Nazis but forgot how National Socialism was defeated. When the Allies were done with my country there was nothing left standing. But in Rowling's utopia a war is pretty much inconsequential and war criminals are left walking free.
