It doesn't quite work like that. If you remember Hermione's instructions in /Deathly Hallows/, the container has to be irreparably damaged. That means, not coming back from, or the soul itself has to be exorcised.

My theory is that Avada Kedavra separates your soul from your body, which is why it leaves bodies in such perfect shape. If you're not going to extract the soul, you have to destroy the container. As soon as you apply the phoenix tears, the container isn't gone.

Also, you think Dumbledore didn't think of all this stuff. He was literally the greatest wizard of his time. In his mind, Harry's best chance was to sacrifice himself, and let Voldemort's blood tie him to the mortal plane.
