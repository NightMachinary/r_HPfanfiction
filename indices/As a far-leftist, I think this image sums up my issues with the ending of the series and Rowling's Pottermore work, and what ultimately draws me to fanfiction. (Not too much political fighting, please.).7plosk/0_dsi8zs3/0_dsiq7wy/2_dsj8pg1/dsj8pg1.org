Regarding the phoenix tears + basilisk venom, that combo did occur in CoS and apparently didn't work. The way I think of phoenix tears is that they're good for what ails ya--got a cut, poison and the clap? A few tears and you're all good! But clearly the tears or the venom didn't burn out the bit of Voldemort inside Harry.
