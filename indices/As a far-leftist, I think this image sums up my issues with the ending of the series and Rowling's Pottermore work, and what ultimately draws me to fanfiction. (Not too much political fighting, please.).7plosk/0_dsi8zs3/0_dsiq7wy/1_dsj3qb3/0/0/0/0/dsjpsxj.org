Well, several reasons I think. All of the Death Eaters are very talented wizards/witches, maybe Crabbe and Goyle aside. Also, Voldemort used to have armies filled with half-humans/magical beings. He also used to raise armies of inferius.

I also think there really aren't a lot of Aurors. Umbridge says the Aurors haven't taken anyone in 3 years. That suggests they're a pretty elite group, not unlike a special ops in the military. Remember, their training takes place over 3 years.

Lastly, Voldemort's fucking powerful. They used hit and run tactics to overpower muggles and wizards. Add in that all the Death Eaters were prominent members of society who were probably helping keep the ministry off of their tail helps.

Fact is, it their size, or really lack of, helped them since they knew how to take advantage of it.
