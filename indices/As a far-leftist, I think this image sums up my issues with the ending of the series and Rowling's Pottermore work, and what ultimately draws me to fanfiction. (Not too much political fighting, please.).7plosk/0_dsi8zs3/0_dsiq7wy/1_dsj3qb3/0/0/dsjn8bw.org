The two times the sword /has/ appeared, it's been when necessary for self-defense, not aggression. Also, you need the Sorting Hat, can't pull it out of thin air. Additionally, Godric prided himself on nobility, so a sneak attack/kamikaze might not have qualified. Also, why the sword? If he /was/ going to take people with him, why not use his want. A severing charm to the neck from behind is just as effective. Also, as I said before, doing this would be counterproductive. By sacrificing himself when he had a chance to walk away, Harry creates a similar protection for those at Hogwarts like his mother created for him. That saves more lives than a suicide run at several death eaters.

Azkaban actually wasn't quite a muggleborn kz. In /Deathly Hallows/, there are plenty of the wandless that are wandering around, begging people. The only muggleborn we know that go to Azkaban are high profile prisoners. Other non-muggleborn high profile prisoners /also/ went to Azkaban.

Your counterpoint to why Death Eaters weren't the KKK is rather weak. The Nazis systematically exterminated Jewish people on a large scale. The KKK worked on a far smaller scale, were organized, and led double lives. Until Deathly Hallows, most of the Death Eaters led a "normal" life in society, "hiding" their identity as Death Eaters. Add in the fact that there are only 28 death eaters? It wasn't a war, it was a power struggle.
