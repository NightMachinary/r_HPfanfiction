The sword appears in a time of need. There ought to be a way to get it back since Neville managed just that. The KKK did not build concentration camps. But the Muggleborn commission used Azkaban as Muggleborn KZ. They were executing their own Final Solution. That is not just some pissed clansmen trying to kill a few Black guys for the fun of it. As a German, I can tell you that Voldemort was basically using Hitler's playbook. Voldemort was using Pureblood supremacy for his own goals of power, not out of conviction like the KKK. Voldemort was not a pureblood. The KKK comparison falls apart in that aspect.
