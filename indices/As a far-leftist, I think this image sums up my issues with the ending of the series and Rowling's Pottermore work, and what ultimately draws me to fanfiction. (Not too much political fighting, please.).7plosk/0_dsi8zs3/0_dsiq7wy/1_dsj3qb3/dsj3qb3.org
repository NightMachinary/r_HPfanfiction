First, Harry didn't have possession of Gryffindor's sword. They lost it in the vault, and Neville recovered it in the scrum after Harry's death.

Second, Harry's death was an act of self-sacrifice. It needed to be. His death cast self protection on all of Hogwarts after. No one died after Harry died. So he actually saved more lived than he would have of he had "taken Bellatrix with him"

Lastly, what happened in the WW wasn't quite a war. The first was closer to how the KKK acted in the 50s and 60s. Many KKK members were prominent leaders in society, and weren't prosecuted. But, remember only Malfoy, Nott, Crabbe/Goyle and McNair walked free. Barty Crouch allowed the aurors to kill, and several were killed like Rosier.

The fact is, there just aren't that many Death Eaters, and the movie increases the scale more than it should.
