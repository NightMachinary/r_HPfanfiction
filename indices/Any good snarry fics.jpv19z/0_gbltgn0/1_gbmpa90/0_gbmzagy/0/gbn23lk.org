Yeah, I think that's the kind of attitude we all need to have. I don't really get Harry/Luna either; people talk about them like she's perfect for Harry and they had an amazing connection in canon and I'm like...really? Yes, they had some sweet moments but they screamed platonic to me. I think it's obvious Harry likes popular, athletic girls like Cho and Ginny while Luna is way better off with someone who shares her passion for the fantastic like Rolf Scamander. I get Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks even less. But everyone likes different ship dynamics and the beauty of a huge fandom like HP is that there's something out there for everyone.
