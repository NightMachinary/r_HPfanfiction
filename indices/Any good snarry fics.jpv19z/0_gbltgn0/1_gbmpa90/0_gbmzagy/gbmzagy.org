I don't get Harry/Bellatrix, Narcissa, Harem either Harry/Draco I can understand if both characters are gay, I don't read them because I don't enjoy boy/boy stories, ! but to each their own ! , I generally have a problem with a ship if it doesn't make sense, for example, Harry/Luna whilst luna is a nice girl I just can't see them as more than a Big brother looking out for his little sister who gets bullied for her weird obsession.

Thx for answering my question.
