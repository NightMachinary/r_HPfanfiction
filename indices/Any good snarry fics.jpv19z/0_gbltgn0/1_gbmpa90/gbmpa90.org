There are all sorts of readers out there. I'm not a Snarry shipper but I am a Drarry one and many similar questions are asked about why people ship them (usually in a much more judgmental and contemptuous manner than you). Yet I see people shipping Harry/Bellatrix and Harry/Narcissa and I don't go and harass them about it. (Not saying you're harassing anyone - you're not - but just in general.) There are people who don't like romance at all, people who don't like fluff, time travel, OCs, etc.

Taste is subjective. I see people saying 99% of slash is trash but I see them recommending fics where Harry is an edgelord with a harem who doesn't resemble Harry at all except his name (which is probably Hadrian so not even then). I'd like to see them reading a quality slash fic and then saying it's trash.

Also, while I agree the part about Snape being Harry's teacher and having loved his mom can be seen as perturbing, I don't think it makes them being in a relationship completely implausible. There is a certain appeal (not saying I feel it personally, just in general) about authority figures and the whole enemies to lovers trope is a huge thing. And there are time travel fics where people get around that.
