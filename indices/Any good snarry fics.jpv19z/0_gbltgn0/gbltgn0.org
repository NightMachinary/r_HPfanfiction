Just one question:

I don't blame you nor care for your preferences in fanfiction material... But for the life of me, I can't understand the Snarry pairing it just doesn't make sense to me I read one on accident because it was a WBWL story and I had no idea what Snarry ment so please can you give me a reason why this pairing should work in any way shape or form?
