Your vocabulary is fine as is your grammar however, the story is too fast paced. It feels rushed. I don't know how old you are but you write like someone with very little experience - I hope you're not too offended. It doesn't flow, if you get my drift. You should expand you paragraphs, make your writing more descriptive.

I hope the above made sense.
