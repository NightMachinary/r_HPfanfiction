This was the basis of a fic I'd started, where all purebloods had some degree of inhuman ancestry in their family tree, due to rituals that mingled their blood with a magical creature in order to ensure that every child was a wizard. The Weasleys were going to be redcaps, explaining their trademark red hair, while the Prewetts would be ghouls, explaining the ghoul in the attic at the Burrow.

Dumbledore was going to be part dragon, explaining how he was so adept at both transfiguration (in D&D, high dragons are skillful shapeshifters and intelligent, well known for having half-dragon offspring), and at finding uses for dragon's blood.

The Gaunts were going to be Dementors, the Blacks were going to be Vampires, the Bullstrodes going to be hags, the Parkinsons were going to be dwarves, the Lovegoods were going to be fairies and/or ghosts, the Notts were going to be giants, Quirrel notes that he'd always had a gift with trolls, the Zabinis were going to be part Siren, and I think the Longbottoms were House Elves, and obviously Flitwick was part Goblin, while Metamorphmagi were the result of very old boggart blood resurfacing.
