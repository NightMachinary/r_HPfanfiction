This is really awesome! In this ficlet, I'm curious what the heritage of James Potter is then, if all the other wizarding familys are mostly mixed? I'm not sure what JKR's current version of the Potter family tree looks like, but I remember a Dorea Black in there, and it's hard to imagine the Potter family being so prominent and strong (James was an auror) without some inhuman genealogy.
