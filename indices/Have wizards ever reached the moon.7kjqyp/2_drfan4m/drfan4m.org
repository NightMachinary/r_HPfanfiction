I think an important point to consider is that there's more to space travel and moon landings than just hopping in a broom or grabbing a portkey and going there.

Do wizards even know there's no air in space? I imagine someone's tried to portkey into orbit and then promptly died of asphyxiation. Or flown to high altitude and frozen/passed-out and fallen to their death. I doubt they know about cosmic rays either, or orbital mechanics.

This is all stuff that muggle scientists took decades to piece together and find solutions to. There's no way wizards could skip all that research without stooping to relying on learning about what the muggles already know. A magical space program only seems easy to us because all that work is already done.

That doesn't even get into motivations. Do wizards even care about space travel? They're notoriously stuck-in-their-ways. It takes a certain drive to explore the unknown and try new things to start a space program that appears to be rather rare in wizarding culture.
