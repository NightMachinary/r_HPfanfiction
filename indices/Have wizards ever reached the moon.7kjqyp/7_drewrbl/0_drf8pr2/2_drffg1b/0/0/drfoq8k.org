Searching @jk_rowling for tweets containing "Hermione" turns up nothing. (Surprisingly, there are only 7 of them, assuming Twitter's Advanced Search is correct.)

Edit: quote on Harry using the Internet from a [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-raincoast-interview.html][2001 interview]]:

  *Has Harry ever used the Internet?*

  No. He's not allowed near Dudley's computer and Dudley's the only one who's got a computer. He gets beaten up if he goes too near the keyboard. So no, he's never used the Internet. I use it a lot but not Harry. Wizards don't really need to use the Internet but that's something that you'll find out later on in the series. They have a means of finding out what goes on in the outside world that I think is more fun than the Internet. Could anything be more fun than the Internet? Yes!
