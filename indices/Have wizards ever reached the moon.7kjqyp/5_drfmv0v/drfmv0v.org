linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) has an interesting take on this. I think it says something like one of Malfoy's ancestors proved that ley lines do not extend into space; therefore, space travel is impossible. Many purebloods are convinced that the Moon Landings etc are a hoax as a result. Fred and George, upon hearing that muggles have been into space, want to become the first wizarding astronauts.
