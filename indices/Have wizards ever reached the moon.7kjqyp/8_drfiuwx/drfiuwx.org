  do you think wizards would take notice at Muggles leaving to colonize other planets en masse?

Wizards, although a little slow on tech adoptions, did create magical versions of Muggle inventions that appeared useful to them, such as cars, cameras, radios, and trains.

If Muggles had great success colonizing remote planets, you can bet Wizards wanted to have a world of their own.

The big question remains however whether magic could be used in outer space or had very different laws there. After all, lots of lore require magic to be near living beings.

If magic worked in outer space or required only minor modifications, then they were definitely going to build their magical spacecrafts.
