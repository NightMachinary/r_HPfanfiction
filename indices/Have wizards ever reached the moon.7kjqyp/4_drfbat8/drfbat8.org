Very easily, as I have previously noted.

The Undetectable Expansion Charm (see for example Newt Scamander's briefcase) means we do not suffer mass penalties for our fuel, which break the tyranny of the rocket equation (see for example [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/38/]] for explanation thereof), as the mass of fuel is a small constant (the mass of the container we cast the charm on). Clearly, the 'external' mass is the mass of the container (otherwise Newt's briefcase would have the mass of the entire zoo, he'd be unable to lift it).

We see the same tech applied to Mood'y's trunk, so clearly this charm also works to create long-term living spaces. So instead of a massive, heavy spaceship, the size requirement is "big enough to hold a hole big enough for the largest non-shrinkable thing we need to pass inside to fit through".

So quite small. Unbreakable and Impervious Charms allow us to use very light or flimsy materials in the construction, thus giving us insane acceleration and efficiency (Presumably, Newt's briefcase has some kind of magical internal dampening field, if not, a magical equivalent shouldn't be to hard to create).

Thus accelerating even to large percentages of the speed of light should be relatively easy.

Furthermore, you could presumably employ Apparation and Portkeys to create some kind of relay system (assuming that those [can] travel at a reasonable percentage of the speed of light).
