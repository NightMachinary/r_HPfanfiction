I'm just imagining it now...

Random wizard 1: "well...this is neat."

Random witch 1:"yeah...so wanna go ho...hey who's that over there."

Neil Armstrong:"ground control you're not gonna believe this."

Random wizard 2:"Obliviate."

Sound of portkey going off.

Random person at ground control:"what's that Neil."

Neil Armstrong:"what...where am I...is this the moon."

Ministry of Magic.

Minister of the time(too lazy to search):"...and that's why we're banning travel to the moon."

With Portkeys, apparation, vanishing trunks, and a whole host of instant travel open to them, not to forget maybe a bubble head charm the size of your body anchored to a runic necklace. It seems like just about any Hogwarts graduate who did Runes(if runes are even required for the trip) could do it.

Thanks,

Warryn.
