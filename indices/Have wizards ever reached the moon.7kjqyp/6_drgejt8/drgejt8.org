It's my head canon that the Blacks have constellation names because one of their nutjob ancestors was obsessed with the stars. I'd like to see a story where a Black invented a (crazy) way to get to other close planets and that's why the naming tradition came into effect. It fell out of fashion, though, and the only remnants of wizarding space travel include the Hogwarts astronomy class.
