Maybe some random eccentric wizard would have done it, like the guy who made the cheese cauldron, but I doubt wizards would really be interested much in /travelling/ to space. They can study astronomy perfectly well from from Earth so they don't really have any particular reason to go to any celestial body. For us Muggles it is desirable because it is difficult, and therefore we wish to prove that we can. But for wizards it would be rather easy (if time consuming due to the distances involved) to go to the Moon and back. Given that, and given that there's not really anything there, it barely seems worth the effort.
