Wizards certainly don't want for any non-magical materials that they can't get on Earth.

But there might be magical things out in space that wizards are interested in. Is there anything magically interesting about Mars soil?

Can you make a better Wolfsbane potion with moon minerals?

Or would Centaurs cooperate (IE, by performing divination services or the like) with a wizard who agreed to get them pieces of celestial objects?
