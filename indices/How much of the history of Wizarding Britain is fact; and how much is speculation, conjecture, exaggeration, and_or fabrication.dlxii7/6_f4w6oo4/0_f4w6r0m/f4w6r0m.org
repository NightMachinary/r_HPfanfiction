[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16467041][*/The Foundation of the Founding Four: The Place of Hogwarts' Founders in Wizarding Britain's National Myth-Making/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/seekeronthepath/pseuds/seekeronthepath][/seekeronthepath/]]

#+begin_quote
  The Founders Relics encountered by Harry Potter are NOT consistent with tenth century artefacts. Nor is the narrative of the Founders that he learns typical of how actual people behave. However, the STORY of the Founders is one that has obviously been put to political use, and is well-established by the time Harry encounters it. In this essay, I will argue that the Founders Relics were created to bolster personal and communal political objectives during periods of turmoil following the ultimate separation of Wizarding Britain from the Muggle world, as part of a wider cultural phenomenon which imagined the Hogwarts Four as the founders of a nation.(no seriously, I swear the argument makes sense)[This essay will be DELETED from Ao3 in January, but will remain available at https://authorgwendavidson.wixsite.com/hogwartshistory/ ]
