Wizarding Britain's history is likely heavily mythologized - but I don't think we know all that much about it, nor the wider world's history.

What I would expect is to have outsized emphasis placed on the great British magical users - for instance, the mythologizing of Merlin and the Founders fit neatly into that view. That fills multiple good roles - in general, it makes it seem like the British are the most important/powerful in the world, with a storied historical background in magic, and then for the purebloods, it lets them have a gloried past to show why they're better than the Muggleborn/half-bloods.

Past that, canon wise we don't have too much information there. In fanfiction it's up to the author to fill in that gap, should they choose to - and there, I'd expect it to follow those lines. Depending on how violent you make the magical world, they could make wars or battles some of those mythologized moments in history - akin to the battle of Agincourt in british history, from my understanding of how it's viewed/taught there. They could pick other moments - victories in Quidditch/other international sporting events, major inventions/advancements, and so on.
