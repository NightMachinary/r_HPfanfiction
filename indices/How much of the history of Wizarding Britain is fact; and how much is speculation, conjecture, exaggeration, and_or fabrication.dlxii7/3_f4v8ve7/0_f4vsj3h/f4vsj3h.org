Honestly I like to imagine the wizarding world being more brutal before Hogwarts

wizards either had to find a mentor, or where trained by their parents, leading to some wizards having mastery of transfiguration but no knowledge of potions.

Maybe slytherin was trained by someone who was trained by someone who was trained by Merlin, leading a later rumor that it was the other way arround.

I imagine the founding of hogwarts was quite bloody and I imagine the founders met during a war get along well enough and decided to try something together
