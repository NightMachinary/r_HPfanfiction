You could ask the same question about most societies in human history, even modern ones (aka formed in the last two or three centuries). Every society mythologizes, diefies, and exaggerates its history, figures, and culture over time to the point that the true nature of history is distorted to fit the needs of the modern culture. The most pervasive of these are what you would call 'national myths,' where cultures mythologize their founding/founders to suit the modern narrative. Examples include:

- Romulus's mythical founding the city of Rome and the seven early kings
- The descent of the imperial throne of Japan from the line of the sun goddess Amaterasu
- The foundation of various cultures incorporated into Mycenaean and Classical Greece through the various children of Zeus

These things exist into the modern day too. Did George Washington really chop down a cherry tree? Did Kim Il Sung really defeat the Imperial Japanese single-handedly? Was Simon Peter really crucified upside down?

Its not some sinister conspiracy either. Hearsay, oral tradition, and so on changes over time until the story no longer reflects the actual events. Or more simply, think of most of our knowledge of history as the Telephone Game, only stretched across time and geography and cultures. Most of the time, their is a some event or catalyst that the history is based off of. A good example for instance is the history of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy][City of Troy]], which was thought to have been entirely fictional until someone actually went looking for it. That doesn't mean that a ten year war was waged because some Trojan prince was given a choice between being king of asia, being the wisest man in the world, and the most beautiful woman in the world and chose the egg-hatched hot girl from Lacedaemon.

Anyway, like most of the Wizarding World, I would say similar patterns exist as in the muggle world. Namely, I imagine their history is likely based on actual events (especially the more famous tales), but has been bent or contorted over time through the lens of the succeeding generations. A good example of /this/ in the Wizarding World? The three brothers and the Deathly Hallows. The Tale of the Three Brothers is highly fictional in how it /seems,/ what with the literal personification of Death going around talking to people. But...well I'll just pull back to this from DH Chapter 35:

  “Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.

  Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.

  “It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric's Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.”

  “So it's true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers ---”

  “--- were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

  “The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus's last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric's Hollow.”

And the same likely goes with much of the history of the Wizarding World. Some of its true, some of its false, but the farther back you go, the murkier the difference becomes.
