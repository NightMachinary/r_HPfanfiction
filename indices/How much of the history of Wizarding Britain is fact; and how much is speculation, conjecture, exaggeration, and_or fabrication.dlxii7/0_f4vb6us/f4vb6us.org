I love this question!

I'm currently outlining a founders era fic that I want to deal with this quite heavily: what little information about the founders we get are very tied to a very mythologised middle ages that, if it ever existed, existed hundreds of years after their time. I'm not an expert, but I've done a little reading and I'm interested in writing a fanfiction that really deals with an early medieval/11th century Hogwarts and how wizarding culture would have fit within Britain in that era.

The Merlin thing other commentors have mentioned is a great example of this, but it's also worth thinking about how much Hogwarts as a school draws from much, much later boarding school tropes: an early medieval Hogwarts predates universities, even. The educational model it's going to be structured after would be strictly monastic, but no one talks about that because it doesn't fit the mythical Hogwarts "brand" of the now.

Honestly, I wish we /knew/ more about wizarding history full stop, but the bits we get are at the very least highly biased. Take the implementation of the international statute of secrecy: the idea that every society in the world had the same relationship with magic users, isolated them the same amount, and was growing equally antagonistic really doesn't hold up to more than about ten seconds thought. One day, I'd love to write a fanfiction exploring the statute of secrecy as a colonialist European project implemented without any care for local nuance across the world, and how that might have devastated other communities...
