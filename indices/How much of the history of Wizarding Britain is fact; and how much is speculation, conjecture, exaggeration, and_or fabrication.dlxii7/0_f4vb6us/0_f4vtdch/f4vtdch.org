The fanfiction series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] has some interesting ways in which it uses parts of our history and implements that with the Wizarding World. The dedication with the linguistics both make me weep and make me so excited for it, though.

The 3rd installment is the first one actually set in the founding era. There's also parts that cover Rowena's and Godric's early lives and another one that captures some time later with Salazar.

I don't want to spoil too much, but it heavily relies on people forgetting so much about their history, especially when people set out to sabotage it.
