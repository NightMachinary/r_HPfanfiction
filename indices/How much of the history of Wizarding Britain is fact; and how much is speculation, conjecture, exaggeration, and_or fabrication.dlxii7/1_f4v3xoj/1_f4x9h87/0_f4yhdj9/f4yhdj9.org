And that's why it's super annoying when JKR tweets that she planned all this stuff for 20 years.

JKR said that she'd planned Nagini to be a human for 20 years, according to [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044579634581401600?lang=en][her Twitter post here.]]

  Q: How long have you been holding the Nagini secret?

  A: Only for around twenty years.

Nagini's identity was possibly foreshadowed by Dumbledore in the books:

    "I don't think so," said Dumbledore. "I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behaviour of the snake, Nagini?"

JKR, having known that Nagini was an human woman all along, chose to dehumanise her in the books and use her as a plot device. Nagini is treated as soul jar and weapon by Voldemort, a disposable McGuffin by Dumbledore and the Horcrux hunters, her death by Neville applauded as a triumph. Even in her Crimes of Grindelwald backstory she's a victim, abused by the circus owner she works for, and a voice of exposition and tagalong to Credence, the real hero.

Nagini, who was apparently planned to be an Asian woman the whole time, has no character or personality outside of being a tool or accessory for white men. It's a horrible look if this was all /intentional/ on JKR's part.
