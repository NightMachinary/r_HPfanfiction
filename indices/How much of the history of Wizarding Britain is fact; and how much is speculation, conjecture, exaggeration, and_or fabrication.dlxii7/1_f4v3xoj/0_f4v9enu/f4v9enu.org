  The full extent.

And then some. One of the more egregious bits is having Merlin attend Hogwarts, when the earliest known source for the man dates (we don't have the original, just a 12th century copy) from about the time Hogwarts was founded and recounts his role in the battle of Arfderydd /in 573/. If you accept that the later stories of Lailoken and Saint Mungo are about the same chap, again the sources are older than Hogwarts and have him dying around 612.

(Both stories have him spending his declining years in the Caledonian forest, so my own personal headcanon is that he took up residence in a broch in the valley that would later be home to Hogwarts, which broch would later be incorporated in the fortified school built on the site nearly four centuries later.)
