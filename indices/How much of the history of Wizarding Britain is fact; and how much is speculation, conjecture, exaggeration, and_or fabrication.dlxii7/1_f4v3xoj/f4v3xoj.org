  to what extent Wizarding Britain has done this

The full extent.

The wizarding history you've read from the books and Pottermore was written by a squib called JK Rowling who patched the information up with hearsay, headcanon, internet Tweets. That's why the numbers make no sense, the timeline is broken, and the facts contradict themselves.

Every time I read JKR's interviews, I become more and more aware of how much HP is built on a shifting foundation of headcanons.

  *Question:* How old is old in the wizarding world, and how old are Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall?

  *J.K. Rowling responds:* Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty, and *Professor McGonagall is a sprightly seventy.* Wizards have a much longer life expectancy than Muggles. (Harry hasn't found out about that yet.)
