Some fics do crack up the abuse to cartoonish levels, but people who dismiss the Dursleys' canon abuse as unrealistic or try to gloss over it are in denial about real life. And also proving the Dursleys' point, because people wouldn't doubt that some poor addicts are abusing their kids. But "normal" middle-class class family in a good neighbourhood? No way!

Also there's this popular idea that it's only realistic when abuse victims are depicted as "broken", and it's pretty offensive.
