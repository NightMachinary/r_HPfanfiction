I'll give some basic behavioural cues I'd look for, but I'll stress that I'm relatively amateur.

Cupboard stuff - would generally trigger a lot of kids with claustrophobia and dislike of small spaces (this is when it's used as punishment or as a place you're forced to go when you have high emotions.

Food- as another user mentioned you'd expect him to hoard or steal food if there's a child that's had lack of food when those around him have had excess

Physical - it's unclear to a large extent what degree Harry has been physically abused but you generally see one of two behaviours depending on the severity. Kids are generally overly skiddish around adults when they've been abused and body posture is always defensive. Once they trust you though it's like having a leech attached to you. They've been so starved of attention and positive touch that literally just want to be hugged or held constantly.

Attention - kids who've been largely ignored tend to be attention seeking, loud and obnoxious. No one likes being ignored and they don't know how to get attention in a positive way so they generally garner negative attention because it's easier. Draco actually probably exhibits this behaviour most. In Harry, I would assume he would lean into the fame massively because he's attention starved and ‘love being loved' and important. Even if it was shallow. Later in life this could turn into objectification of women because the thing he may crave most is positive female attention which he lacked from a young age. But that stage is more conjecture and based on surroundings, culture, and personality.

Boundary testing - when children are abused by angry parental figures about arbitrary behaviours they become overly cautious and tend not act out around them much. Depending on the severity they almost become catatonic where they don't respond to anything for fear of punishment. When they are coming out of this with adult figures they trust they tend to ‘act out' and push boundaries in what seems like ridiculous ways in comparison to their usual behaviours. It is also to test if the adults ‘really love them' or are just hiding their own true feelings about the child.

Relationships - this is an interesting one as it varies widely. There were a couple different behaviours that I saw from the kids I worked with. The most severely abused ones often only befriended children younger and smaller than them as a method of control. They felt safe because they were the senior in the relationship and could protect themselves if need be. This was particularly worrying in children who'd been sexually abused because these ‘friendships' often turned more sinister even at young ages.

Other, less abused children often struggled to express themselves healthily when conflict arises. I one time saw a child stab his best friend with pen over a small argument because conflict resolution in his family had always been violent. They struggle to adjust to normal behaviours like talking. On the other side when someone may try to talk to them about conflict they just lock up and stop talking because they don't know how to express what they're feeling. No ones ever listened .

That's just some of the more overt stuff, but there's loads more subtle stuff that other experts could tell you about.

Edit: to put it even more simply. Look at Tom Riddle's behaviour. That's more normal for someone with their background.
