Not necessarily. Those are just stereotypes - if every abused child acted like Tom Riddle we wouldn't have kids slipping under the radar at the rate we do. Any safeguarding training will tell you that you might never see a sign. It also doesn't correlate that neatly onto each type of abuse - neglected children often 'act out' too.

Nor does it directly correlate on the most or least abused children. However, when you are looking at the most extreme abuse, even then, you find children who are explosive and children who struggle to attach.

More generically, becoming withdrawn, quiet, tendency to run away, perfectionism, mental health difficulties.

Likewise, the VAST majority of children who are sexually abused don't go on to abuse anyone else.

Tom Riddle's behaviour isn't normal, even for abused children though negative life experiences can cause propensity. This sort of outlook causes people to unwittingly discriminate against abused people who are first and foremost victims.

I do think Harry could have had more obvious signs, though. Really, what you would be expecting would be his 5th year behaviour.

Although it is a children's book, we do actually see some evidence:

- Even at 11, Harry has frequent nightmares. He remarks on them being different to usual re: Voldemort happenings.

- Harry runs away with a stranger he doesn't know and then runs away again in the 3rd book.

- Harry doesn't go to adults for help unless forced.

- Harry doesn't seek comfort from other adults - he has at best a loose relationship with Lupin, turns down open door offers from his head of house.

- The exception to the points above are Hagrid and Sirius, both of whom he feels responsible for helping and keeping safe (the dragon, Buckbeak, Grawp) and Sirius from getting caught.

- Harry functions best in crisis fight/flight/freeze because he is constantly running on it. (Some go the other way and have panic or dissociative issues).

- Harry is known to horde sweet treats in his trunk for when he goes hungry.

- Harry immediately agrees to live with a recently escaped convict, despite Sirius seeming unstable to Ron and Hermione.

- Harry shows little value for his own life over that of others.

- Harry doesn't really connect well with most people outside a couple of friends.

- Harry reacts poorly when he feels adults make decisions for him, as he is used to making his own decisions.

- Harry asks Dumbledore not to go back, but does not expand on why nor does he talk about the bars or cupboard with the Weasleys or even his friends.

- He's got a bit of a temper, despite pretty much everything being toned down.

In Cursed Child, I would say it is more obvious that he has ongoing Dursley nightmares and also struggles to connect with his kids. It is evident he never managed to switch off and settle into a peaceful life.

Children's books that do cover this sort of thing more are 'Max Kowalski Didn't Mean It' (Susie Day) and The Star Outside My Window (Onjali Rauf). None of the children in the books are like Tom Riddle.
