The thing is, not every abuse victim is the same. Some are functional, some can slide in a dark place if triggered by something and some can't function in everyday life. If you write realistic consequences, I think that Harry would be functional for the most part, with perhaps an occasional bad day. He would probably be more wary of others though.
