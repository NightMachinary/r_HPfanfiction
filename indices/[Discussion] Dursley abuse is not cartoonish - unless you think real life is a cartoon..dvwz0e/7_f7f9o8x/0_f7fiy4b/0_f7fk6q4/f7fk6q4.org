This is true too; the effects of child abuse vary from person to person and from situation to situation. I personally think that abuse like the Dursleys perpetrated in canon would be more likely to have a tragic result than not, but since I don't particularly enjoy reading news reports about children being stuffed in closets and starved, I also don't seek out fanfiction that focuses heavily on the detrimental aspects of a Dursley upbringing.
