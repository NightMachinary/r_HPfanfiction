Any such fanfiction? (Call me cruel, but the Dursleys not lasting long sounds like something I'd enjoy reading! I hate abusers and bullies with a passion, since I was bullied in school (and victim blamed! "It's your own fault that they won't accept you!" - Yeah fuck that and fuck you, too! Teachers like that make me question the system! They shouldn't be teaching a freaking brick!) and had less than ideal support (parents didn't dare to either involve the media or the ministry of education...cowards!)...so yeah, I can get behind tortured bullies/abusive guardians!)
