Well, we do see some of it! Harry defaulting to self-sacrifice (instead of trying other solutions first or looking for other solutions!) and Harry seldom defending himself! He lets Snape verbally abuse him, but draws the line at his parents and friends!

Harry IMHO has accepted that he's worth less than other people (if you hear things too often you do internalize them after all - or rebell against them to prove the nay-sayers wrong...but Harry isn't ambitious, so yeah that's no it! Harry was the ideal sacrifice...well done Dumbledore you piece of human trash (...ten dark and difficult years...so yeah, Dumbledore knew and didn't care!)!)
