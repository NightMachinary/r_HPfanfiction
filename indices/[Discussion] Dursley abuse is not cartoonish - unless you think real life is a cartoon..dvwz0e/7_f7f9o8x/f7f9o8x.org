If Harry was described as going through the realistic consequences of starvation and solitary confinement as a child or if the Dursleys faced legal consequences for their actions instead of the abuse being treated with levity like in canon, then it would not be derided as “cartoonish” here. I think it is the juxtaposition of the horrific emotional and physical abuse Harry endures (which unfortunately happens all the time in real life with devastating effects) with the complete lack of physical/psychological/legal consequences in canon that makes the Dursleys' actions seem “cartoonish” and unrealistic within the context of the Harry Potter books.
