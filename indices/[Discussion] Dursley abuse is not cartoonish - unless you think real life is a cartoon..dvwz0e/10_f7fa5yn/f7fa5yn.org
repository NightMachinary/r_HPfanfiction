I think what people mean with cartoonish is how it is framed (often with a slight of humor) in the books and how other characters react to it. That and how open they were with it. it was so obvious for people so concerned about what people think. Harry didn't have a room, even for alibi. He has ill taken care of, with his clothes and the broken glasses, they didn't bother to replace, while shower Dudley with expensive presents. They didn't make sense in their motivation.

and additional, it is in such a stark contrast to how you feel people should react and that means one of those things has to be but perspective. either all the other characters actions or the Dursley's behavior.
