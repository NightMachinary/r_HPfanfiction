I believe you're right. If you compare it to a book like Mathilda, you can see a parallel of the abuse being so over the top that the child reading it doesn't necessarily take it seriously. But Mathilda stays pretty over the top and we don't have to consider what lasting consequences her parents' treatment would have on her as she grows older. This is not the case with the Harry Potter series.
