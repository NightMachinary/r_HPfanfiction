Appologist!

Seriously, hitting kids with frying pans (even if you miss!) is (attempted) aggravated-assault IMHO, so abuse!

Denying a growing kid food is abuse, too!

Letting a kid sleep in a cupboard is abuse!

Locking that cupboard (and later Harry's room) is abuse!

Calling a kid "freak" is abuse!
