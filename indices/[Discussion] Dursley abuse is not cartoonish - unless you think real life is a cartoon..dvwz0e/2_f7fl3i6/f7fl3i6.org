The abuse itself is not cartoonish, of course. However, in the context of the first (or the early) books, it's also not written to be taken literally/seriously. It's using some of the tropes from children's books - just like how all the tasks in the first book are easy enough for the kids to figure out, and all the adults are incompetent.

I don't think it's a good thing, and looking back I'd prefer it if the abuse had been painted as much less in scale than it was - but it appears to me to have (at least originally) not been meant to be taken seriously. Of /course/ his 'step-parent' equivalent has to be evil/mean, that's just how it goes in those stories before he finds out he's actually someone rich, famous, and important! It's the same as a million fairy tales and other children books.

The big issue is that, like for a lot of the plot holes and incongruities in the early books, the series got more serious/mature in the later books. And at that point, the abuse that's portrayed as more cartoonish in the earlier books can't come across in the same way when it's being played straight.
