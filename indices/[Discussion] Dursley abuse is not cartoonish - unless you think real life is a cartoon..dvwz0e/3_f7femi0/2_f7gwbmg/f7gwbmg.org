Since I'm the one who recced that fic, it's 110% crack. Later on FemHarry does a dance routine to Taylor Swift while cosplaying either Sailor Moon or RWBY. And most of the conflict is resolved by slicing things in half with a goblin made scythe. And the audience during the first task sings Men of Harlech as a symbol of Welsh pride.

Does any of that sound like an attempt at a realistic plot?
