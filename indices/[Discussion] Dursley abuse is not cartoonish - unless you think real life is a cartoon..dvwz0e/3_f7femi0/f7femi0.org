Meh. Depends on how it is written. In cannon the Dursleys are definitely abusive- there is no doubt about that. But it can be done very badly in fics. Just yesterday I followed a recommendation from here about a mute female Harry. The reason she was mute? Vernon cut out her voice box with a pair of scissors. Just read that again. How does someone in a sales department even know where to find the voice box, let alone perform a surgery to remove it without killing the victim? Presumably while in a fit of rage or under the influence. It could have been written as Vernon hitting Harry and Harry hitting his head on the floor and losing his voice or something. Or even as Vernon cutting of his tongue. But noo, let's have the evil uncle perform amateur surgery with a pair of scissors without nicking an artery or other organs, infecting Harry with unsanitized instruments or leaving him to bleed to death. Another one I remember had Vernon straight-up owning whips, chains and other medieval torture devices and torturing poor Harry so much that a grown-ass man would have died several times over. It was both disgusting and funny at the same time. Shit like this is why Dursley abuse can sometimes be cartoonish. Vernon having fits of rage or being drunk and beating Harry with his hands or belt is plausible and can be written well. Vernon being a surgeon on the side or owning torture devices is cartoonish.

​

Just not to be completely negative, here's a good example. (By "good" I mean well- written and not cartoonish.)
