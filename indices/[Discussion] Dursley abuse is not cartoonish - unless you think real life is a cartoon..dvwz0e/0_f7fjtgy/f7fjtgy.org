Are people saying the abuse is cartoonish, or the Dursleys are cartoonish? Comically fat, walrus-mustached, incoherently angry man obsessed with being normal, who's married to a rail-thin, horse-faced gossip who's snippy and snooty and judgmental of others despite her own family's many shortcomings, and their enormous, portly bully son? Each of them absolutely convinced that they're the definition of normal, and that people who collect for causes are abnormal troublemakers?

That actually does sound like a cartoon, doesn't it? Like a one-episode antagonist family for the Simpsons who show up for the occasional gag. I can already see Homer bonding with Vernon until he does something too over the top, while Petunia snipes at Lisa and Nelson and Dudley bond over bullying Milhouse and Bart.
