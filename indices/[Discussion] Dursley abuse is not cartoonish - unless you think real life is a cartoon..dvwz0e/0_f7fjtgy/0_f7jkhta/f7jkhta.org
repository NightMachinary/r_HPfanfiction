Yes, but Rowling is writing for children here (the books got more mature as the audience aged) so she is exaggerating the Dursleys (kids aren't good with subtlety).

The abuse itself was never written like that! So yeah, the Dursleys were really abusive pieces of shit who should all rot in Dementor town for a few decades (except Duddley, who should be sent to a military academy IMHO to drill him till he isn't an abusive tub of lard anymore!)
