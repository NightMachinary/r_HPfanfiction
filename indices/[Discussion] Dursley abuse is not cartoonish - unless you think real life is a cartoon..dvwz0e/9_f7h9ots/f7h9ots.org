That's a perfect description. It doesn't refer to the literal nature of each event that happens, if you imagined them in the real world, but to the way it's written. The Dursleys are cartoonish, the situations are cartoonish, the abuse is cartoonish, Harry's reponses (usually accidental magic) are cartoonish.

Nobody is denying it happens. Nothing in the word "cartoonish" implies that abuse never happens. You've completely misunderstood everything.

When Wile E Coyote is injured by something that Road Runner does, no one says "oh, it's cartoonish, you won't really be injured if you fall off a cliff in real life" or whatever. We all know you can fall of cliffs in real life and it has very serious consequences. People die from falling off cliffs all the time, and those are immense tragedies for them and their families. But the situation is cartoonish because it is exaggerated and played for laughs.
