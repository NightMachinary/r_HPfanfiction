I wanted to touch on something implicit in what some of what the other's said, in that a lot of fanfic treats the (first three) books as if they are your standard fantasy novels and not children's literature*, which is actually how we end up with so much fanon.

Take the first book where Hagrid gets sent to give Harry his letter. It makes perfect sense in a children's novel, that the first contact our MC has with the magical world is a lovable goofy giant. In a fantasy novel, though? It smacks of either incompetence or evil plots. The same goes for the defenses for the Philosopher's Stone. They are so flimsy a first year student can get through them. What does it mean? That must mean it was a plot by a Manipulative Dumbledore to get Harry to fight Quirrelmort, of course!

Its this kind of context that we need to keep in mind when we are talking about the Dursleys and their abuse of Harry. The level of abuse that the Dursleys enact is a function of them being in a kid's book, and not because they are actually that despicable.

In the same way that a lot of fics ignore the plot holes and inconsistencies, we can add the abuse on top of it. We can take the emotional truth (that Harry had a family that despised having to raise him and he suffered for that) without the literal truth of what they Dursleys did in canon.

*HP remains fantasy even when it's Children's Lit. But not the same kind of fantasy, you know?
