Interesting thing about all of those stories? they are old as hell and abuse was much more common and socially acceptable back then. What happens in them is not some trope, it was just life.

Hell blatant infanticide was not at all uncommon until ~100-150 years ago and still happens an appalling amount today.

For abuse in general i was beat with a belt once in the 1980s in a family considered old fashioned and not really acceptable in its behavior (which i found out in school, good times that).

Both of my parents were beat much worse when they were children. My grandfather beat my mother with his fists many times and kicked her down the stairs once leading to a doctors visit and broken collar bone. She was hit countless times with a belt or switch to say nothing at all of spankings with a hand. She was born in 1949 in newyork and her parents were from the same general region born in 1919/1920.

Dad was from oklahoma born in 1946 and his family was what is called dirt floor poor. He was whipped once (the scars were still visible 50 years later and beaten with all the "normal" things.

So talking about abuse in huck finn, matilda, and oliver twist isnt a literature trope, it was a fact of life that was very common. Cinderella and snow white have origins much further back so it just depends on the version you use as to what was common then.
