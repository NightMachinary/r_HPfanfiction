I'd say it is a trope so far as its a very simple way to make us feel sympathy for a character without much effort on the author's behalf. People cheer for underdogs. People want to believe in Cinderella, not the Brothers Grimm version though, because the idea a hard done by person can rise above it all and become special appeals to most of us. That doesn't mean its not real, it doesn't mean it wasn't more common but I would call it a trope in that its a device for quickly establishing characterisation. Calling it a trope might be a bit extreme but I don't think unfair.

Edit: There are plenty of modern examples too. Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars was literally a slave, that's not on his parent/carer but it is an abused child. Percy Jackson, one of the biggest book series to have come out since HP, the title character has a less than pleasant step-father who beats Percy's mother and Matilda, the Roald Dahl book features neglectful parents as just a few examples of mistreated kids in mordern(ish) media.
