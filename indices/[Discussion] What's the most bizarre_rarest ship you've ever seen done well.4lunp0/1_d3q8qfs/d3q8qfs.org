  Filch squinted up at the ceiling as if reviewing some mental catalogue and then nodded to himself and promptly led Severus to the third-floor cupboard where Professor Flitwick had apparently locked up everything his Ravenclaws were wont to pinch for the purpose of still-making.

  "But it's Potions equipment," Severus protested, feeling the need to defend the fact that he had just spent four hours looking for the bloody things.

  "Should it not be in the dungeons, where the Potions classroom is?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "Well now, sir," Filch muttered, and sniffed. "It'll be a long wait if you hold your breath for any fucking common sense around here."

  Severus managed to startle himself with the sound of his own laughter, which was pitched slightly too high and sharpened to the edge of hysteria with too little sleep.
