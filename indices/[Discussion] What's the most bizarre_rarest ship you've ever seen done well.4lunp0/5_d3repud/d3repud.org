Snilch or Fape? Perhaps SevArgus?

Anyway, I don't want to think about it.

I've seen Harry/Hedwig done decently, in linkffn(A Promise From Her Boy). It's well within readable range, and there are some very cool and interesting ideas, but it's not /stellar/.

linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) has a truly bizarre Hermione/Draco/Neville situation, but it's well-crafted, and the writing is perhaps /the/ most beautiful and erudite I've ever come across in the fandom.
