I got one chapter into it and I dropped it immediately. I lost it at the part of he rose to the rank of Lt Colonel. The higher you go in the military the less fighting you'll actually do. You'll do more planning and strategic ops. Even though the author is right as Lt Colonels are the highest rank still on the front line, it's still a senior officer rank and they will be commander incharge of the entire battle group. And the fact that he "quickly rose through the ranks" was so off the mark of any real military that I dropped it. Rant over, soldier out.
