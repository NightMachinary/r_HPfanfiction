I guess it sounds a lot like this one, Harry was in Azkaban for doing his duty, Bellatrix was in cause she's Bella, They escape and get struck by Lightning while using point me, Harry lands in the body of his Death Eater Alternative Self, Bella lands in a similar situation, Harry tries to end the war by himself and figure shit out. Way to much in the way of unnecessary action scenes though.
