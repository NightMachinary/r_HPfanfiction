  The War ended when Harry finally killed the Dark Lord. His reward? A cosy cell in Azkaban next to Bellatrix Lestrange. But a pact is made & during an escape, an accident puts them in another universe. Realising violence is the modus of survival, Harry fights to find his way in a world where enemies lurk in the shadows, trust is a scarce commodity & Death is just a heartbeat away...
