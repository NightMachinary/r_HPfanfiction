I feel like pre-movies it was less prevalent because of the allure of 'enemies-to-lovers' which is common in het ships too, and because Ron is the closest thing Harry has to the 'childhood friend'/boy-girl next door trope, which is generally a less popular pairing than the 'exciting new' character.

Post movies, simply because Ron's actor is probably the least conventionally attractive of all the pairing options within Harry's age range.

Having said that, there definitely was /some/ - I would hazard to say a higher ratio of it pre the movies, I remember reading some! An additional difficulty/change of pairing Harry/Ron as an author is who to then pair Hermione with, especially if you want to avoid Dramione.
