  The second thing is that a long, long time ago a few fans saw Draco's bratty behaviour as pigtail pulling and Harry and Draco being "archenemies" as UST, and Drarry ate up most of the slash part of this fandom, and somehow enemies to lovers became the most common slash dynamic in HP, at least for Harry.

Enemies to lovers is one of the most popular tropes in the shipping community though so it's not very surprising that Drarry became so popular. Tom Felton is very attractive and he and Harry seem a bit obsessed with one another in canon. Despite hating each other, they have amazing chemistry together and tons of potential for an emotionally charged relationship. I don't care for this ship, but can easily see why it's the most common in the fandom. Ron just lacks the sexy bad boy vibe and his and Harry's interactions are more brotherly and boring in comparison to Draco.
