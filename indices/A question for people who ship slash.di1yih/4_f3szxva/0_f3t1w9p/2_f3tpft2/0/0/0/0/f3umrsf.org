Yes, because at that point Neville is not as close to them as after the DoM. Neville is an acquaintance, Sirius is Harry's last father figure. And like I said, the only reason I find Bellatrix acceptable in that scenario is because she has served more than a decade in the worst place on earth. She has been punished for her past, with an inhumane severity. If that isn't enough to atone for mistakes, you don't need prisons since the only alternative would be executions. Which would mean Snape, Malfoy and the lot have to die as well.
