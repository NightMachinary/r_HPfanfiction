I am fine with Bellatrix and Malfoy pairings under one specific circumstance, each. For Malfoy, that would be scepticism after year 1, for Bellatrix a change of heart after Azkaban (she needs to be punished after all) and before the DoM (so Sirius isn't an issue). I can't see a Malfoy pairing work after his actions during CoS, much less after his actions towards Hagrid and Buckbeak. Same with Bellatrix. Once Sirius dies, no game.

  probably because she's hot

No. If looks were the objective, I'd simply go for Harry or Hermione with Andromeda after the war since they look almost the same but Andromeda is the lone good Slytherin from canon and has balls the size of a small moon. She's even 1-4 years younger and hasn't been in a gulag for a decade. Bellatrix is appealing because she is basically the Vader of Harry Potter, the competent evil enforcer. Put her on the good side and the Death Eaters are in for a pounding.
