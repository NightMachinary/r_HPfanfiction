There is no need to bring your nazi argument into this. But of course you don't see the sexual chemistry since you are presumably a straight guy. The actors are both hot and have great on screen chemistry as actors = this translates to them getting shipped by teenage girls and women in general.

This is also fanfiction so anything can be changed. Make Draco less of a whiny brat who can change his mind on death eater stuff and bam, you have yourself a redemption plot. The details regarding war crimes don't matter since those can be changed or glossed over. Just like you are fine with Harry/Bellatrix pairing (probably because she is also hot), others are fine with Draco because he is hot and want to read more about him. I don't even care about this pairing but as a a straight woman it's obvious to me as to why he is so popular.
