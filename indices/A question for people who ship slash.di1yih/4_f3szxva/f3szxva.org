I think it's two things. Ron's relationship with Harry, the way it's written, comes off as properly familial, in a way not many other shippable characters are. This is the main reason I don't ship Harry/Hermione either. I, at least, don't see much potential there for tension of the romantic or sexual variety. The best Harry/Ron I've read is the Two Households series by Mad_Martha on ao3 and that has Slytherin!Harry and Gryffindor!Ron in a slightly adversarial relationship when the story begins. Harry and Ron are very much in character, and the progression of their relationship feels almost painfully real at times, so you should read it if you haven't already. If it was just them being friends, Wolfstar wouldn't have become the second most popular pairing in HP. Wolfstar is supported by the prose in the books so heavily that you don't even have to look at it sideways to pick up on it. Sirius and Remus aren't "just friends", there's something more already there.

The second thing is that a long, long time ago a few fans saw Draco's bratty behaviour as pigtail pulling and Harry and Draco being "archenemies" as UST, and Drarry ate up most of the slash part of this fandom, and somehow enemies to lovers became the most common slash dynamic in HP, at least for Harry. I'm a hardcore slash shipper and ship Harry with non-standard people who are just popular enough that I get one or two quality fics every few months, so I understand your pain, but once a ship makes an impression, it becomes very hard for people to look at things in other ways.
