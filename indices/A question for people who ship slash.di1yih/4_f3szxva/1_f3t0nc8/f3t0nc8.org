Oh thats a really good point I know other brotp type ships that got very popular. Hell even in HP Dean and Seamus are very popular. But you get to see more of Harry and Ron becoming friends Harry becoming like Rons newest sibling . Hes close with all the Weasleys but i agree it feels most familial with Ron.

And i like playing with unconventional relationships too! But i know not everyone does and if i didnt Id never think to read this ship.

Thanks for the rec! I hadnt heard of it before now.
