So I am generally (at best) apathetic to pairings in fanfiction, so long as they aren't ridiculously unbelievable within the context of a mildly canon HP story (looking at you Harry/Tom and Hermione/Tom). So I will try to offer what may be an outsiders view on the subject. The optimist in me says "authors want to explore more unique ideas and are using the pairing as a springboard for making that happen." The pessimist in me says "pairings are more often than not a form of fulfillment for the author and are never really realistic within the context of HP fics" (i.e. if 90% of fanfiction is crap, 99% of pairings in fanfiction are crap regardless of sexuality).

The realist in me? Its complicated. Both through observation of people watching/reading/hearing fiction in real life and statistics about preferences for romance and relationships (real or fictional), I have come to a particular conclusion.

/People seem to prefer the contrast./

What I mean by this is look at most relationships in real life. They usually arise from mutual or similar interests (ex. you like basketball, I like basketball, we have something in common), and these unite them in relationships. At least when they have a choice in the modern world. But overwhelmingly what I see in people is that their favorite pairings/ships in fiction are ones where the characters are diametrically opposed on many issues or lack many common interests. People like the friction, the arguements, and the eventual overcoming of the gap between the pairings. Basically this is why I think the Daphne Greengrass or Draco Malfoy pairings are so popular - the contrasting values of X-character create more entertainment than more organic and frankly believable relationships.

So why isn't Ron popular as a slash pairing? Ignoring the character sexuality, its basically the same reason I think people are less vested in pairings with Ginny. /They are the characters who (arguably) have the most in common in canon with Harry./ They like the same things, they are bullheaded and passionate to a fault, they value family to a tee, they don't like Slytherins/blood purity, they don't really care for rules that impede them, and so on. And to read, thats kind of boring in fiction for most people. Its more believable, but in a fanfiction of a story depicting magic schools, immortality-granting rocks, dragon reservations, and bad guys with snake fetishes does believability really matter?
