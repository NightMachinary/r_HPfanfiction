I'll also add Ron is just not the least bit gay. And yes, Harry is heterosexual in the books/movies and at no point is his sexuality in canon particularly in question. (Not the point at the moment.) But Ron. That kid is just not, at any point, in any way, shape or form, queer. He is super straight. Plenty of characters you can run with being queer with even the least bit of incentive, but Ron is never once, at any point, coded as anything but a straight white male. (I don't even dislike Ron, he's just not written in anyway that could be construed as anything but Straight.)
