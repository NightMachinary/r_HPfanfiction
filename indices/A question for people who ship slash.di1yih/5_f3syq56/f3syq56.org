Hm, this is a valid question. I think it may be because the friendship is so thoroughly written that we only see it that way? Ron is also very dude-ish and really doesn't draw much attention for coupling with anyone. He's a solid bloke who's a pal's pal and... that's it.

With say Harry/Draco there's tension and drama. With Harry/Ron there's... awkward exploration followed by smooth sailing? There's really nothing to write it would be so convenient for them.
