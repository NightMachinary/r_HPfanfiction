  But I know quite a few couples from school who were friends who decided to try dating and worked out.

Oh I do too, I'm not saying that close friends can't become romantically attached, it's the the whole idea that these kids were around each other /all the time/ for 10 months out of the year since they were were preteens. They didn't have just a "see each other regularly" friendship for 10 months out of the year, but rather a "take every non-elective class together, take meals together, study together, go through dangerous adventures together," relationship. And on their downtime, they /still/ hung out with each other. To me, that kind of interaction is way more likely to develop a sibling-type relationship, rather than foster any kind of romantic feelings.

  I think what a lot of fiction authors get wrong is the order of things because love is, in most cases, something that needs time to develop.

Agreed 100%. I usually drop a romance-based fic if the relationship develops in a very unrealistic way.
