I thought the cutoff for sibling attachment was 6. At least from a psychological perspective.

I can certainly think of a few moments where canon could spawn romantic involvements. Hermione comforting Harry after Cho, Harry comforting Hermione when Ron got together with Lavender, Harry comforting Lavender...

A rebound is not the best foundation for a relationship, I freely admit that. But there is a difference between "Let's see if I can still score in a bar" and "shoulder to lean on". Even if the wishful "sometimes, you will make someone very happy" is very clich√©.

Of course, you can always the rather badly written "noticing". Sometimes, you just spontaneously develop a crush on someone you have known for a long time, be it through an action, a piece of clothing, a new haircut, the lighting or even an idle thought. I feel like this is the most realistic start for a crush, and simultaneously the most difficult to write properly because it is very easy to oversell the crush in the narrative. As soon as the MC notices someone, they have big tits, long legs and a pert arse. Which is rather unbelievable for, let's say Hermione.
