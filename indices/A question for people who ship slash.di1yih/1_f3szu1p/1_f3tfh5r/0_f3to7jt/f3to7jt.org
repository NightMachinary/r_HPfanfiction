I'd argue it depends a lot on how the romance is set up. If you go down the popular mutual pining route, that indeed feels a little odd. But I know quite a few couples from school who were friends who decided to try dating and worked out.

I think what a lot of fiction authors get wrong is the order of things because love is, in most cases, something that needs time to develop. Perhaps it's something cultural, but I don't know a single example of people who declared their love before kissing, something incredibly common to read. Quite a few of my class mates got together simply because they were comfortable around each other, didn't find each other hideous and wanted in on the couple stuff. The feelings came later, or never at all. One girl made out with a bloke she had just met because he had a tongue piercing and she wanted to know what that would feel like on her tongue.
