Personally, I'm not a fan of Harry/Ron or Harry/Hermione precisely because they're such close friends. To me, Harry always seemed to share a more brotherly/sisterly relationship with Ron and Hermione respectively.

In general, I'd probably put it down to Ron not being a fan favourite, as well as the deeply unfavourable portrayal that he got in the movies. His humour and his loyalty were downplayed, and that made him an easily bashable and to an extent, unlikeable character. A large part of it might also be down to whether people preferred, aesthetically speaking, Tom Felton or Rupert Grint, for example.
