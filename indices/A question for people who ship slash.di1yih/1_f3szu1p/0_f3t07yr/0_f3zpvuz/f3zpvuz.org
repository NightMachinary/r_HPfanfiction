Fic was being written prior to the movies coming out, and Ron wasn't popular even then. I agree that the movies had stupid characterization, but even book Ron just isn't a fan favorite. He's kinda the sidekick archetype, which across all fandoms tend to be somewhat ignored.

People tend to write pairings between two characters they like, not because it makes sense. That's the same for all ships, slash or no. Those that have some kind of chemistry to begin with wind up being the most popular.
