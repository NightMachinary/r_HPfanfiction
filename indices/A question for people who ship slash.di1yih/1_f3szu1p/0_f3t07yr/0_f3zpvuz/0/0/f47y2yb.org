I CAN speak to it because I WAS around then, mainly LiveJournal and the like. After book three came out is really when the fandom first started exploding with meta and fic. Ron and Hermione just weren't as popular. I remember Ron actually had some heated debates around his wand in book two (why he didn't inform his parents he needed a new wand because it was affecting his ability to learn properly versus him being sympathetic to his parents' financial situation). In book three more people actually took Hermione's side in the Ron vs Hermione fight over Scabbers and Crookshanks. Hell, I even remember people disliking the initial encounter with Ron on the train in the first book.

And then book four came out, and even more people were unhappy with Ron over everything you mentioned.

My point: Ron might have been likeable, but that doesn't mean he was well-liked, and I remember a lot of the reasons that people have as to why.

The first movie didn't come out until over a year after the release of book four. In other words, fans in the early days had no foresight of what was to come in terms of Ron's development.

I'm truthfully uncertain of fics written prior to book three's release because book three is when I first heard of the books, read them, and joined the fandom. The first big slash pairings were Draco/Harry and Sirius/Remus. I'd even venture a guess and say that Sirius/Remus was more popular than Draco/Harry in the early days (the LJ communities definitely had more members in SxL vs DxH, anyway), likely because they were adults and writing romances about very very young characters weirds some people out (which would be another strike against writing slash about Ron, at least in the fandom's formative years).
