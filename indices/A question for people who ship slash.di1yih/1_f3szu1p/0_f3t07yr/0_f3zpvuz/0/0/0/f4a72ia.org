That is otetty interesting and yes for me personally Drarrys chemistry is like dramione in the sense its based in potentials and what if scenarios. While Wolfstar is popular based on their canonical interactions and because of potentials and what if situations. So Wolfstar has more shipping fuel than Drarry. Thats not to say one is better but one has more fuel to be popular.

So there could be a bigger resurrgence of it since those who were kids and grew up with the fics are now adults in the fandom and Sirius abd Remus aren't unpopular characters. But its possible they might gravitate towards Harrys gen as adults as opposed to the Marauders gen.
