I cant really speak to the fics before the movies as I only got into fics long after the movies came out and I have no idea what the fics were like pre 2001 before the first movie came out. But in my experience in books 1-3 people seemed to like Ron decently well. Hermione was the one they had more mixed feelings on.

It was book 4 where people got pretty pissed by Ron. His fight with Harry was pretty jarring because Ron was such a constant presence even more so than Hermione who was paralyzed in book 2 and had a fight with Harry and Ron distancing herself for a good chunk of book 3. Harry and Ron on the other hand had been inseperable for 3 books from the moment they met. So it felt much more isolating for Harry and it was over something Harry didnt even do but Ron had accused him falsely of. So it made his actions stand out even more as horrible than if Harry had been less attached to Ron.

Ron had another horrible moment by making Hermione feel like shit after the Yule ball. So overall that was I think when the favorite friend started shifting. But you still had 3 books of Ron being very likable before this point.

But then Chamber of secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban came out as movies. Ron started to look like a nothing character. Not bad persay just kinda boring while Hermione started looking much more interesting due to toning down her flaws and giving her Rons better qualities. And therefore the dynamic of their friendship shifted. Harry and Ron were less close in the movies. Their bond was emphasized less and since Hermione got alot of the better qualities of Ron the aspects of Ron that made it easy for Harry to get along with him applied to Hermione now so their dynamic seemed better. Hermione never seperated from the group in movie 3 either. So now in movie 4 instead of it being jarring because of how close Ron is and all his positive qualities its just you getting a poor opinion of the least interesting member of the movie trio. And movie Ron never recovered.

While there were positives of the book version to go back into the movies were more influential and that depiction of Ron started seeping in.

So while you could say Ron was never a fan favorite i do think that he was popular enough that shipping would have been considered had the movie potrayal been closer to book canon. Especially pre movie 4.
