I personally like Harry/Ron, because when you read fanfics about them they are pretty much the same with just a more intimacy. Fanfictions can hold a factor because you can deny it all you want, but fanfics really do affect your vision on characters and Ron is...well really bad in fanfics. It could also be the movie since people often use that for 'proof' when discussing stuff. I personally don't really understand why, seeing as how I ship it. But I guess, when I didn't ship it was because Harry was shipped with so many other people, and Ron was never really shown any attention, that I just didn't really notice.
