  Because blaming Ron for leaving in book 7
#+end_quote

Who said that I did that? I dislike Ron for books 3 and 4, not 7 (other than the epilogue) His behaviour in 7 is understandable, although I still maintain that his Horcrux vision shows his entirely wrong priorities, but GoF was the book which made me dislike him. Well, and the epilogue was the death blow to any sympathy I might have had.
