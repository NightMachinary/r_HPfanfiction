Look, I've had my share of spats with friends. But none of them went on for longer than a weekend. Ron didn't talk to Harry for four weeks, and apologising after the dragon felt cheap. Especially since Ron probably knew about the dragon through Charlie (if he knew Charlie was in Britain, he knew why) and didn't tell Harry. Harry could have died.

Also, the Yule Ball. I've been envious and jealous of a lot of people in my life, but never did I act like Ron that day. Not at 12, not at 14 and not at 18. Hell, I don't know anyone who acted in such a fashion.

And Ron was certainly not in the right, bringing an illegal pet to a school where it was prey for two of the three sanctioned pets is simply stupid. His actions towards Hermione were dickish (she was a dick to Lavender though). And he never apologised for the wrong accusations.
