I'm saying that Ron's biggest worry was if Harry banged Hermione, which is a pretty awful priority to have when she could have been dead for all Ron knew. Or taken by Death Eaters. Yes, the Horcrux isn't a boggart but merely wants to drive Ron away, but there should be more effective ways to get that done. For example a vision of the Lestranges brothers taking turns with Ginny while saying how it was all Harry's fault while his brothers are bleeding out and Molly is savaged by Greyback as retaliation for Ron coming back to Harry. Add enough horrifying details and that vision should be able to drive Ron away if he had his priorities straight. Instead there are his best friends making out and taunting him a little. Given the alternatives, one of which I outlined above, it puts Ron in a bad light.

Ron should be on his knees begging Hermione for forgiveness, not worrying if she has slept with Harry. Because Ron should know that Harry wouldn't do anything Hermione didn't want, something you can't say for the likes of the Lestrange brothers.

Except that it is, and all you have as evidence of the contrary is ONE family who is the exception, which by common logic just proves the rule.
