Ron was definitely in the wrong, but it wasn't just him.

It's very heavily implied he tried to reconcile with Harry, but Harry rebuffed him.

Plus he learned from it. By your logic with the Horcrux, Ginny's views was that she should start attacking muggleborns.

The pet was not illegal. I hate it when people say that. It's just that you're only allowed 1 owl, cat, or toad. Percy had him as a pet.

Owls pretty much eat everything else on the pets list on occasion in real life. If Hedwig starts trying to eat Crookshanks, do we blame Hermione for that?
