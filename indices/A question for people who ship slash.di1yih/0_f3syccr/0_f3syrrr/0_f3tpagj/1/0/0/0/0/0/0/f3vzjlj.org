  “What's that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you doing down here at this time of night?” “I just wondered where you ---” Ron broke off, shrugging. “Nothing. I'm going back to bed.” “Just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he didn't care --- at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.

Ron shows concern until he realizes Harry snarls at him.

Ginny did face a Horcrux. You can't blame her for her actions, so by extension, anything Ron did is also fairly blame proof. Unless you're talking about hating on insecurities only acted upon when influenced by a piece of Voldemort as a character flaw?

Let's talk about the owl. Owls have a variety of species and the larger ones in fact will prey on cats if given a good opportunity. It is not their general prey, but it was used as an example here because it is possible. If Crookshanks was repeatedly attacked by Hedwig, would Harry or Hermione be at fault?

Percy is a fairly rule abiding citizen. It's not proof in of itself, but it does support the argument. The rat was not explicitly banned and in fact was a pet for a known stickler for the rules.

I repeat, the rat was not banned and that list is not exclusive. What that list implies is that if Harry decided to get a cat, he would have to return his owl, or if Hermione got an owl, she could not have a cat.
