Ok here the thing about the books. Even though the book isnt the nicest to Ron all the time he still has his moments and because of this you have people who call out the narrative like pointing out how the narrative paints Ron in a negative light for being jealous but paints Hermione as sympathetic for being jealous.

But in the movies the positive aspects are cut out all together or given to other characters. So you only have the negative traits with none of the positive. Also his impact on the surrounding characters is lessened.

In the books there are alot of small scenes with Ron and Harry you really get to see and feel that bond. So its depressing and jarring when hes not friends with Harry with Harry for a bit in book 4 and 7. In the movies because they have to cut more out this effect is lost. But not just that. In moments where his presence or abscence could have been noted its not.

In book 7 when Ron leaves Hermione and Harry are really bummed out . Its depressing without Ron things are awkward and uncomfortable between them. They work best together during like intense activity and brainstorming together. If they have to lounge around together its boring to them without Ron.

The same thing happened in book 4 when Ron wasnt talking to him. But in the movies Hermione and Harry get along so well that Ron just feels unnecessary. His abscence isnt really felt at all. In the end of movie 6 when Hermione gives the we going with you Harry speech Ron kinda just sits in the back doesnt even stand next to him.

In the books Hermione third wheels their friendship and Ron is the glue almost. Hermione might have fights with Ron and Harry and stop talking to them but its never as jarring as Ron and Harry. Hermione and Harry as a pair is very awkward romantically or platonically.

In the movies Harry and Hermione work way better together Ron feels entirely unnecessary minus being comic relief and Harry Hermione not being the couple just seems weird.

Essentially while both have flaws Book Ron and Movie Ron just end up being different characters.
