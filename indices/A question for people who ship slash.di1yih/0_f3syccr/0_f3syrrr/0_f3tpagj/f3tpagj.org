Why does everyone blame the movies? Even if you use just book stuff (and limit yourself to in-universe explanations), that doesn't paint a very favourable picture of him, and the epilogue is especially awful in that regard (the movies even did Ron a favour there since they cut his assault on his driving instructor).

For example, I've read PoA countless times, and I've seen the movie often as well. I never paid much attention to who stands in front of Harry and those fan favourite scenes were never something I spent much time on because a serial killer could have easily slaughtered all three of them. Especially since Sirius is infamous for blowing up an entire street with one spell. Same goes for werewolves. Lupin would make mincemeat out of them all. The order of death would not be consequential as they all would die within a few minutes.
