  I never paid much attention to who stands in front of Harry and those fan favourite scenes were never something I spent much time on because a serial killer could have easily slaughtered all three of them. Especially since Sirius is infamous for blowing up an entire street with one spell.

Because Sirius offered them a way out, and Ron refused to accept it.

  Even if you use just book stuff (and limit yourself to in-universe explanations), that doesn't paint a very favourable picture of him, and the epilogue is especially awful in that regard (the movies even did Ron a favour there since they cut his assault on his driving instructor).

Pretty sure we've had this discussion about the driving instructor, but mostly it's because a substantial part of the fanbase believe that the movies influenced the writing of the later books.
