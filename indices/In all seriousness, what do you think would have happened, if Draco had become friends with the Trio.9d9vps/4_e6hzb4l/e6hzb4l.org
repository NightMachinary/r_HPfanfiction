Ahhh I have been hunting fanfics about this. If someone knows of one, let me know. I am very curious about it.

Draco had some... peculiar education, let's not forget his slurs against Hermione or everyone's family. It could have been interesting for me to see him being called out, to be educated and to break the circle of... well. Being what he was expected to be from his family. He clearly cares about his parent's approval more than anything else... I have a lot of feelings about this, lol. Not to romanticize him, he did bad things, he is not a hero! But since the books are from Harry's perspective... ehhhh we will never know.

Cursed Child, polemic I know, kinda showed us that... he is not evil. And as he matured he was able to do what he probably never got from his parents. To let his son BE. To support him. To care about his wife. I think he did all the things Lucius didn't. He didn't want his son to carry his dad's reputation on his shoulders. To some extent, Harry wants the same for his son.

Draco Malfoy is not a character to romanticize, but to analyze. We know so little about him!
