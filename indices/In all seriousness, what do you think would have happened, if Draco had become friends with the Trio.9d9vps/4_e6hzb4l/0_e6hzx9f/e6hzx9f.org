Also, if a change had occurred during his student years I think it could have been interesting to start at POA and just... develop and mature in HBP. He was breaking emotionally speaking. All eyes were on him. There was /some/ hesitation to finish his task, maybe even remorse. He cried and Myrtle tried to comfort him! He lashed on Harry in the bathroom. But that, in my head, was the moment where he could have let his emotions push him to do the right thing. That moment of weakness was perfect for Harry to maybe step in and. I dont know, be there. I think if Harry had known he needed or wanted help, he could have helped him. Potter is stubborn and his hero complex could have lead the story to places my imagination can only begin to scratch the surface hahaha!
