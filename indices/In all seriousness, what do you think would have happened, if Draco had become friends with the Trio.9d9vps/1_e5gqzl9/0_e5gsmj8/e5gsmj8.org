I can imagine an AU where Draco eventually is friendly towards Harry and Hermione, IF the mudblood incidents don't happen. I don't see Ron accepting Malfoy or the other way around however. They both hate each other. But unlike Harry and Hermione, who got in his good books through their actions, there is little canon Ron does which would impress Malfoy. I think scoring Lavender might be a first.
