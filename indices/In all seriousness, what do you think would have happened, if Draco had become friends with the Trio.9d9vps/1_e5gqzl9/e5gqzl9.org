  Picture this: the events of book 1 occur more-or-less the same, though by the end of the book, Draco is puzzled as to why his olive branch to Harry had been snapped.

I always scoff at the notion that if Harry just had shook Draco's hand they would have become best friends. I see no way this would have happened. You'd have to change Draco's entire upbringing for him to seriously consider Harry as a friend (instead as some kind of political maneuver) and even then Harry might not look favourably towards a friendship with him, because he clearly dislikes the snooty attitude. Any kind of comment about Ron, Hermione or other of Harry's Gryffindor classmates or Quidditch teammates would kill this pseudo friendship immediately and entirely.

I'm not sure what you are alluding to here? Mudblood is not that difficult to grasp even for a 12 year old. What would he have to learn about the word? You don't do Draco any favours by painting him as some kind of imbecile who doesn't understand what it means to call someone's blood dirty. Canon Draco hates Muggles and thinks they are filthy, not much more than animals. He doesn't have to look that up in a book.

I always thought the idea to de-convert Draco would be interesting, but some nuance is needed to pull it off. As [[/u/Hellstrike]] has already pointed out it needs to be a slow process. This necessitates that you don't take the easy way out, like

  Once he has everything he can get his hands on, Draco relays the information to Harry and Ron, who don't trust him but accept the information.

I hate, hate, *hate* writing like this. It's incredibly lazy. [You may have seen me criticize the way Ron returns in Deathly Hallows, getting there just in time to save Harry's life]. If you want to bring Draco into the Trio he has to do it on his own merits and not just be planted in a position where he gets to save the trio somehow. Particularly the whole ordeal shouldn't just be about the Trio accepting Draco, but also about Draco accepting and understanding the Trio as people who deserve his respect: They have to somehow 'prove' themselves to Draco to make it believable, not just the other way around (and preferably without them having to save his life 5 times in a row until the idea permeates his thick brain).

That's no easy task. Draco despises Harry and his parents in particular (blood traitors and a mudblood, who were in league with Dumbledore the barmy muggle lover). He needs some reason to come to understand that the whole pure-blood ideology is bullshit and somehow come to the conclusion that Harry and his parents are good people. Getting Draco to genuinely respect Ron (blood-traitors *and* poor) or Hermione (ewww, Muggles, she's barely even magical) might be even harder. All in all quite a tall order! If that is conveyed convincingly the issue of the Trio accepting Draco will be minor. They are nice and aside from Ron not super prejudiced, if he truly changed they will give him a chance.

In general I prefer the idea of a AU with differences prior to Hogwarts (for example Draco distrusts his father for some reason, a minor change that could have huge impact: Draco starts to think that the opposite of what dear old Dad claims is usually true) or just getting Draco as an ally without becoming friends: There are practical reasons for him (and possibly Narcissa) to abandon their cause. They don't immediately have to become best buddies with their former enemies. This grudging cooperation would be a more natural position for him to slowly de-convert ("Oh hey, wow, I didn't need to intimidate or bribe them in order to trust them with xy").

Edit: One of my favorite parts of HPMOR is when the Harry in that fic tries to seriously de-convert Draco and after all the work... it just doesn't work and Draco is still a bigot.
