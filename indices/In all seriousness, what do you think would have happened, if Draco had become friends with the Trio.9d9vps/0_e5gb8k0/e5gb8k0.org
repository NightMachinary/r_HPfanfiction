Draco still called for genocide in the same book. It wasn't just one insult, it was a deeply rooted belief.

If you want to change things, he needs to question the ideology first. Hermione is living proof that pureblood supremacy is bullshit and if you want him to change in a believable way, you need a longer time frame. End of year one, Hermione is top of the year. He talks to his father, but the answers aren't satisfactory. He talks to his mother, who points out that her half-blood niece is a metamorph. Draco decides to observe things in Hogwarts. It takes time to change beliefs on such a fundamental level (unless the Red Army swarms your country while the Allies wasted your cities and there's some large-scale denazification going on).

If you have Draco question things at the beginning of book 2, the real Change would probably not happen in the same year and no big changes in the next one either. The Buckbeak incident and the aftermath might even be similar.
