This is why I both love and hate dramione fics: a lot never bother with character growth; they just alter draco in the very beginning, which is often simply infuriating. But a great dramione will lead his character on a path of self-doubt and discovery. In canon, Draco had so many opportunities to question his circumstances and become better. JKR never went there, sadly. So reading a fic where a transition from 'pureblood racist snob' to 'conflicted hero' is handled gradually and poignantly...well that can be extremely fulfilling.
