I want to see this so bad. I'd like the story to show little moments of all of these suggestions, followed by a canon divergence in like year 5.

3 - I can't see Hermione trusting someone like Draco when she has a huge secret.

4 - Some author would use this year to replace Ron with Draco, which isn't what I want.

5 - The perfect year for Draco to swoop in and help the trio. Use his authority to keep the DA hidden, help Harry escape (or even confirm Sirius is safe, I dunno). Just perfect timing. Then you get the whole 6th and 7th years to show them getting closing and more trusting.
