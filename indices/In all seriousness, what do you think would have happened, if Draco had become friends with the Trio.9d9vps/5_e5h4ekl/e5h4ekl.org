I think you'd have to model draco more similarly to Sirius and his upbringing. We know that sirius' parents raised him with a lot of pureblood ideology and he ended up bucking the trend. Maybe sirius is naturally rebellious or his parents were more abusive. Im not sure. So maybe with draco, maybe narcissa was less loving to him, maybe Lucius failed to stay out of Azkaban. That might bring draco more towards being friends with the trio or even being sorted into gryffindor.
