Yeah, that's fair. If you made it as far as the post-Wood reset and didn't like it then it's not worth carrying on with. TBH I think I read it live update-by-update so it could be much angstier than I remember when read all at once.

I can see why he had a great friendship with a character and would try to rebuild that after a reset only to find out he's too different for them to have the same relationship.
