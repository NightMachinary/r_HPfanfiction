Yeah I know that. And it also makes sense, because which eleven year old would not be scared if this was happening to them, but I still couldn't read all the angst.

Also I don't quite understand her choice in having Harry think that his relationships with some characters (like wood) would be the same after he essentially "reloads" at an earlier time, where he hadn't even met the guy yet and when he did things differently (and more violently) the second time around.

I kinda guessed from the summary, that he might toughen up a bit later on, but as I said, the angst and paranoia just got to me...
