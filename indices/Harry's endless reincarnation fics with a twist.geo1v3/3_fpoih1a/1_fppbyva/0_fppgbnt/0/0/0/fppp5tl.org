Stick with the story. It's very worth it and gets more satisfying as it goes on. It's one of those rare fics where Harry's skills do not feel unjustified at all and his behavior does not seem out of character.

Also, we as outsiders can understand that Harry's relationship progress would have reset after a reload, but look at it from an 11-year old boy's perspective who just got hit by this fact that one of his few friends is a complete stranger once again.
