To be fair he gets less scared and less paranoid fairly quickly. I think the author tried to write it as if Harry was an eleven year old who kept getting killed which would fuck him right up rather than a teenaged eleven year old like most fics (if you know what I mean). He gets some people to train him up a bit in first year and toughens up from there.
