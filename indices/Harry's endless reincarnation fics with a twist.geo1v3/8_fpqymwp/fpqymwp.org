Forty One Times Dead, linkffn(6511737), does something similar.

It's a oneshot Bleach Crossover fic. Fed up with having to change the timeline after each and every one of Harry's (many) deaths a Shinigami trains him to actually fulfil his destiny.

Quite AU and depending if you like/know Bleach it might not be up to your liking.
