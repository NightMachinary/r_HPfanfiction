Yes, but Sisyphus was being punished by the gods for greed, violence, yadda yadda. I don't think that story ever gave us a reason for Harry's endless looping. It also elided over things in a way that was stylistically appropriate but narratively /really/ unsatisfying - it just tells us that Harry can't escape Hogwarts, for example.

And the thing is, the whole time Harry seems to simply grow more experienced without growing wiser, more mature. He's stuck in a loop, not just of time, but the limits of his own personality, his own ego.

Maybe it's the hopeless optimist in me, but I'd like to think that basically anyone in that kind of situation would slowly develop a depth and wisdom that would help them reach some sort of transcendence - some sort of metaphorical nirvana that gets them to escape the cycle of suffering that is the world.

To me, that story very much feels like the first of what should be a two- or three-part story where Harry finally, /finally/, grows up instead of just growing old. It should end with him finally getting to just... die...
