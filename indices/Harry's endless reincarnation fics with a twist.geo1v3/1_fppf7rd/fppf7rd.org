Harry was a strange boy, Arthur thought to himself. Whether it was his habbit of yelling "SKIP" at people trying to talk to him, or his strange ability to somehow be in just the right place and time to deal with problems before they escalated. He didn't deserve this though. Being put on trial in front of the entire Wizangamot for defending himself.

Just as they were getting towards the doors to courtroom 10, Harry suddenly made an abrupt turn and sprinted towards the department of mysteries. Arthur was too late to grab him before he'd slipped through the door. Following, he watched in horror as Harry got to a circular room, yelled "DEATH" and threw a bag through the door as it opened. There was a moment of silence, as Harry paused, then there was a horrible screeching sound and several black shadows were drawn through ceilings and... out of Harry's scar? And into what he now knew as the Veil of Death. He stood dumbfounded as Harry proceeded to take out a stopwatch and do some kind of happy dance.
