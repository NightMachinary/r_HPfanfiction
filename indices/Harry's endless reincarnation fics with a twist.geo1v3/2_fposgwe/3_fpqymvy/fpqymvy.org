Harry Potter and the Game premise is exactly that-his life is turned into a game featuring skill level, experience points, quest, an inventory, and a whole other load of game related ideas. It's been a while, so I don't actually remember if he can save but I'm inclined to says he cannot. It's still a good fic though
