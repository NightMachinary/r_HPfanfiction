A couple of years after My Immortal, I found this Twilight fanfic that was /very/ similar to MI, except there was better grammar/spelling and the sex scenes were more "adult" (but still hilarious though). I remember wondering if they could actually be written by the same person, now in high school and reading Twilight instead...
