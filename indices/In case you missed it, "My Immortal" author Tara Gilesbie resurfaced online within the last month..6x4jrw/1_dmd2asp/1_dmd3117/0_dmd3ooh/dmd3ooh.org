Eh, I think it could still go either way. Tara being able to write now is equally well-explained by "she grew up" as it is by "she was a troll", which means it isn't really /evidence/ in favor of either hypothesis.

(I still lean on the side of thinking she was genuine, since I knew a couple goths in high school who were /exactly/ like her. If it was a troll, it was very authentic)
