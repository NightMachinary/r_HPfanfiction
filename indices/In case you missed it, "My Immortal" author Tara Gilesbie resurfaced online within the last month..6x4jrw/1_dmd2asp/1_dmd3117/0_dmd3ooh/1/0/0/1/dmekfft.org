  Also, even the worst grammar I've ever seen has consistency in its failures; My Immortal changes around what it messes up too much.

I have a theory that could explain the inconsistencies. Was "My Immortal" perhaps written by a tag-team of authors, each one picking up where the last one left off? Similar to what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleny,_or_The_Reverse_of_the_Medal][Oscar Wilde and friends did]] with the gay erotic novel "Teleny"?
