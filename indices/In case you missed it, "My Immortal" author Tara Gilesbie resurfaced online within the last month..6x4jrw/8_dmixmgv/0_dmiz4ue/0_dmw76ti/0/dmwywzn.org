Well, that fits with what Rose Christo has said about [[https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/post/164921122309/do-you-agree-that-my-immortal-is-gay-culture][going through a super-straight phase]] at the time she wrote "My Immortal". Justin, if you're anywhere out there, your ex-girlfriend is famous now.

Also, I like how Blink-182 was misspelled twice: "Blink-183" in this bio and "Blink-821" in the petition. And I'm finding "Hiraly Doof" much funnier than I should.
