Rose Christo's Tumblr page has been [[https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/search/my%20immortal][flooded with My Immortal-related messages]] over the last couple days, and she appears to have revealed herself as the author. I think the mystery has just been solved. Given that the person on FP said she uses her real name on Tumblr, these two accounts definitely seem to corroborate each other.

Furthermore, there's a couple tweets on Christo's Twitter page which I think will settle the question of whether it's legit or not: [[https://twitter.com/rosechristo1/status/902779683649056768][this one]] from August 29 in which she asks for Xing Li's email - /two days/ before a similar appeal was made on the FP account - and [[https://twitter.com/rosechristo1/status/903168571697704961][this one]] from August 31 in which she shows a screencap of her FP profile from before she made the updates.
