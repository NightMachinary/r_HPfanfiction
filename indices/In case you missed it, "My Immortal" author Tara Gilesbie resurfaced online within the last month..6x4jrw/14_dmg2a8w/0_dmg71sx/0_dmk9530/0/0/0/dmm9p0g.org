In the interest of balance, I should point out that someone has already sifted through the evidence on Tumblr and [[https://furiousgalaxypizza.tumblr.com/post/165014478708/why-rose-christo-is-not-the-author-of-my-immortal][presented an argument that Christo /isn't/ the actual author]]. There's definitely some points in here that are worth consideration, but still, this is the most convincing case of "someone-claiming-to-be-Tara-Gilesbie" that we've ever seen.

I don't expect the debate to end here by any means. As I said earlier in the thread, if this is a hoax, it's an elaborate one. Because let's remember: there's more people involved here than just Christo. There was also [[https://twitter.com/TiffanyDiahann/status/900819008907358209][that publishing agent]] who tweeted about knowing who Tara Gilesbie was.
