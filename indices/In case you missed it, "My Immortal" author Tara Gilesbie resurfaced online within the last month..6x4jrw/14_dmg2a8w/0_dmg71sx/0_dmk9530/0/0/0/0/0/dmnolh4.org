This thread is mostly old news by now, since I started it back when all we really knew is that there were some suspicious rumblings on FictionPress. I certainly didn't expect it to spiral this far. By this point, the news has spread from our community to the larger fanfiction community as a whole (hell, it's even [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/my-immortal-author-hi-vampire][a story on /BuzzFeed/]] by now), and the main conversation is now taking place [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/6xxi4e/in_a_stunning_turn_of_events_the_author_of_my/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6yh6vx/so_tara_gilespie_of_my_immortal_fame_is_basically/][here]]. I recommend that everyone who is still interested check there for any further updates and debates.
