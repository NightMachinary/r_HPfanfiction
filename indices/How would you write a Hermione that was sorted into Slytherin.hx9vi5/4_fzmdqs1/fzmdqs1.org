The way I see it, for someone who doesn't fit into the Slytherin's existing mould well---whether Harry, Hermione, Snape, or Ron---Slytherin is a high-risk--high-reward place. It will either spur them to do great things (possibly great and terrible) or chew them up and spit them out; and sometimes both, as in Snape's case.

Hermione---gifted, resourceful, outspoken, blunt---is a particularly extreme case of this, for reasons others have outlined. It will seriously test her "Killed---or worse, expelled" mindset, but it will also light a fire under her arse: unlike the rest of her year, the only way she can get any friends and even ensure her safety is by displaying overwhelming magical power---while keeping some in reserve, in case someone surprises her; and Hermione is very good at learning difficult magic quickly from books.

I can see a concerted effort to make her drop out; but Dumbledore could probably mitigate that by announcing that /if/ Hermione is driven to drop out, then Slytherin will be denied the House Cup until every single student in the house at the time has graduated. Sure, it's a collective punishment, but House Points are already a collective punishment. That would /probably/ reduce the incidence of severe bullying and sabotage, but it won't make Hermione any less ostracised---perhaps the opposite, even.

I don't think anyone will actually try to murder her until after Voldemort returns---at that point, Dumbledore won't have a monopoly on uberwizard violence. By that point, she better be ready to take all comers.

--------------

Several years ago, I outlined a 7-year fic in quite a bit of detail, even wrote some scenes, then decided not to write it because there were some issues that I was not able to resolve some issues to my satisfaction. It was quite a bit Darker and Edgier than what I described above, however. The assumption is that she would be constantly bullied by students of all years, and there would be little that Snape (and Dumbledore, though he'd be largely ignorant) would be willing to do. If I were to outline it today, I probably wouldn't make that assumption.

In the end, she becomes a vicious Dark witch and an anti-Malfoy, anti-Voldemort fanatic. She spends most of Hogwarts throwing her grades and playing the meek perennial bullying victim, while assassinating several of her peers in order to influence politics outside of Hogwarts and make a horcrux. The main points:

*Hogwarts:*

- The canon plot gets derailed pretty hard at the end of the first year, when Harry never confronts Quirrelmort, and Quirrelmort grabs the whole Mirror of Erised and flees. (He never does get the Stone out of the Mirror, but after a few years of work, he manages to synthesise enough Elixir of Life to come back---destroying both the Mirror and the Stone in process.) It is further derailed in the second year, when Hermione, being friends with Myrtle, ends up taking the Diary before Harry; then as an unintended consequence of her Legilimency practice, exposes Pettigrew, and then manages to knock him out with a crazy-prepared Potion.
- She makes the horcrux on Hogwarts Express at the end of her fifth year. She does it for the greater good, of course: she is just too indispensable to the anti-Voldemort cause, even if Dumbledore himself doesn't know that and only knows that there have been deadly several tragedies on his watch that have been awfully convenient for him and exonerated Sirius politically. In fact, up until she felt her soul tear, she wasn't sure it would take, since the cold-blooded murder she had committed to make the horcrux was for a good cause.
- Around the start of her 6th year, shortly after she had made the horcrux, Dumbledore finally connects the dots and summons her. They have a long conversation during which they reconstruct WTF had happened over the prior 5 years, including the 2 of Voldemort's horcruxes that had ended up in Hermione's possession and how Voldemort managed to get a new body. Hermione does not admit to any of her crimes, and Dumbledore believes strongly that she has done what he thinks she has done, but he also can't move against her without handing Voldemort a huge victory. In the end, they discuss (in hypothetical terms) the philosophy of how justified her tactics are in the world they inhabit. They have several more conversations over the year, as Dumbledore is increasingly incapacitated by the ring curse (that did get him on schedule).
- It does enable her to get the Horcrux out of Harry without killing him, because, having performed the horcrux ritual, she can reproduce the parts of it needed to separate the two souls. (Hence why Dumbledore didn't do it in canon: he didn't have first-hand experience making a horcrux.)
- She caps her Hogwarts career off around the end of her 6th year, by manipulating Draco into killing her with the Killing Curse, while making it look like he did it to make a horcrux. She then flies off to get herself restored by her followers (at that point, Penelope Clearwater, Ginny Weasley, and one or two Slytherins she had turned). However, she gets greedy and tries to lure out Lucius Malfoy to assassinate him before Draco is Kissed (the punishment for making a horcrux), which backfires, and while Lucius dies, Draco is mostly exonerated though now as terrified of Hermione as he is of Voldemort, and Voldemort becomes aware of her and followers.

*Conclusion:*

- To salvage the situation---since Voldemort is still significantly more powerful than her, and since Dumbledore had died---Hermione pulls out her last resort scheme. She had figured out how to conjure antimatter a while prior, but it requires constant effort to contain without annihilating, so it only works as a suicide attack. And so, she asks to meet Voldemort under truce---and offers to let him choose to take whatever precautions he wants---and the moment they are close enough, she dispels the containment magic and annihilates them both and everyone around them, to buy her side more time. (My headcanon is that the restoration ritual is only possible three times a year: the Summer Solstice and the two Equinoxes. You /don't/ want to try it during the Winter Solstice.)
- Once they are both in their shadow forms, she realises that her soul is bigger than Voldemort's (since she only made one horcrux, whereas he made 7), and so she spontaneously decides to ram it, and they begin to fuse together, increasingly sharing a mind. Hermione is mostly in control, but Voldemort is better at mind and soul magic than she is, and so she can feel that he might win in the end.
- She flies to the homunculus that her followers had prepared for her and enters it. She then proceeds to tell them and her allies (Sirius, Harry, and possibly others) where to find Voldemort's remaining horcruxes from the information in their shared mind. (Voldemort might have rehidden some of them under Fidelius, but isn't it convenient that she happens to be sharing a soul with him at the moment?)
- She also tells them how to find her horcrux and instructs them to destroy it as well, keeping the homunculus sedated using the Draught of the Living Death until that's done, then killing the homunculus to send both of them into Limbo---because the risk of Voldemort taking over their combined mind---including the knowledge of how to conjure antimatter---is too great.

*Ending:* Two possibilities:

- *Happy:* Some time after, the homunculus is slain, but even as Hermione feels herself without a body again, she feels herself being cleansed of Voldemort's soul. Her followers and allies risked not destroying her horcrux, but for her willingness to sacrifice her life and her afterlife, magic gave her a boon. She returns into another homunculus and restored to her physical body. Restored, surrounded by friends who showed such faith and mercy for her, she feels an urge to cast a Patronus and succeeds for the first time.
- *Bittersweet:* Her allies do destroy all horcruxes as instructed, but while Hermione never quite repented for her actions, her willingness to sacrifice her life and her afterlife healed her soul enough to allow her to continue to the Next Great Adventure, as Voldemort's soul remains in Limbo.

*The planned title:* /Hermione Granger and the Greater Good/.

Now, if all this strikes you as a tad wanky, I am well aware of this, and it's part of why I decided not to write the fic after all. I /have/ written a few snippets that I'd posted in various places, however.
