  Myrtle wasn't even a murder, it was an accident, so manslaughter. Like, why would Riddle want to murder her? She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, she looked at a strange noise and was petrified.

How do you know this? In particular, there is a general consensus in the fandom that Myrtle's murder was used to create the Diary horcrux, and I don't think a mere accident would suffice for that.

  Like when the entire ministry collaborated with deporting a minority to Azkaban (whew most probably died)? Like when Malfoy was happy to carry out murder plots as long as he didn't have to do the dirty work himself? Like when no one batted an eye at Umbridge threatening unforgivables at minors?

Fun fact: they were shipped to Azkaban /after/ the Dementors had left it.

To the point, with respect to the Ministry and Umbridge, what you are describing is people standing by as evil is perpetrated, or contributing to it in very indirect ways, just by doing the same jobs they were doing before, but under a different government. You are describing a failure to be a hero, not a lack of squeamishness.

Draco proves my point: he only had the stomach for convoluted, indirect plots; but the more complex the plot, the more likely it is to fail or kill the wrong person and, paradoxically, the more tracks it leaves.

Actually, that could be a plot point in a Slytherin!Hermione fic:

1. Some upper-year slips Hermione a cursed artefact.
2. Hermione detects the curse or discovers the plan, and manipulates one of her bullies---say, Pansy---into stealing it from her as she is wont to.
3. Pansy is killed or maimed.
4. Adding to the official investigation, the Parkinsons call in favours to find the culprit, who is ultimately betrayed by their peers and sent to Azkaban.
5. No one ever touches Hermione's stuff again.
