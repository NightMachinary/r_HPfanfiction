Myrtle was an eyewitness to the basilisk, and so Tom Riddle killed her, even if he hadn't been planning to. That's murder in the common use of the word, as well as under both English and US law (Second Degree Murder in most US jurisdictions). Anyway, I think that your point is that he didn't plan it and so his cover up was not ideal, and it doesn't hinge on the definition.

I take your point that he probably could have orchestrated a murder in Hogwarts even better had he had a chance to plan it, but that only partially negates all his advantages, and it doesn't change the fact that Hogwarts was considered safe for children on both sides even in the middle of a civil war.

Very few Ministry officials were actually involved in the tribunal or had close contact with those they oppressed. Vast, vast majority just continued doing their jobs. The way I see it, to attempt to murder Hermione prior to Voldemort's return, a Slytherin or a group of them have to pass through a number of filters, which includes being willing to commit a murder in the first place, believing themselves able to do it in a way they are willing to and get away with it (or willingness to be prosecuted for it), actually being able to do it, and not being squeamish about doing it directly, if that's the most effective way. Each filter makes the attempt less likely or less likely to succeed.
