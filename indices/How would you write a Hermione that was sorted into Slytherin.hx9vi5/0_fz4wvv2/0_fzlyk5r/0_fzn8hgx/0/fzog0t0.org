I think we've had this conversation before. Yes, there are more methods to conceal a crime. There are also vastly more methods to investigate one---not to mention the risk of your victim becoming a ghost---so it's a wash.

Despite a civil war raging outside of Hogwarts in the 70s, parents from both sides still sent their children there. It took once-in-a-century genius, a "clean" murder method nobody could even imagine, a gullible headmaster, and a highly convenient patsy for Tom Riddle to get away with murdering Myrtle---and even then, had Dumbledore been the headmaster, he would have probably dug deeper and caught him.

Now, combine that with the general squeamishness that people, including Slytherins like Draco, have towards murder and the Slytherin traits of self-preservation and distrust. How many Slytherins would have both a decent chance of pulling it off and the willingness to martyr themselves to the cause of their house's purity?

Now, once Voldemort returns, Hermione better be ready, because Voldemort's favour may well be worth risking Dumbledore's wrath.
