It's a fic that I follow and sometimes recommend, but I feel that it's throwing in too many extracanonical setting elements, favour from others, and power-ups to the protagonist to genuinely explore the premise.

In some sense, a Hermione who has a prophecy about her or a destiny is no longer really Hermione: she no longer has the self-made newcomer ethos. If the New Blood thing had been entirely a bluff backed by her intellect, massive amounts of hard work and discipline, and no small amount of skulduggery, I would enjoy the story far more.

I also felt that her being friends with Harry while scheming behind his back with her Slytherin classmates to harm Ron should have had more consequences, and getting away with that bordered on /Green Girl/-style suedom.
