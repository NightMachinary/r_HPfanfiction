Another neat Slytherin!Hermione idea was originally [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ten-a-surprise-you-be-sure-not-to-miss.636976/post-59860717][posted here]]. I don't know whether this person every wrote the fic, but it could be a very elegant Slytherin!Hermione: single point of divergence, and avoiding the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine][Trauma Conga Line]] that the premise suggests.

1.  Hermione's parents are murdered by a renegade Death Eater when she is around 10, or maybe as late as during her Diagon Alley shopping trip.
2.  As a PR move, Lucius Malfoy proposes to adopt her.
3.  The Malfoys charm Hermione and she agrees to the adoption.
4.  Dumbledore would let the Malfoys adopt her in the hope that amid their virtue-signalling, some of the virtue might diffuse into them; but he would take precautions. (I can picture him taking some object, like Hermione's mother's necklace, enchanting it, and telling Hermione to wear it always; and telling Lucius that if he or Narcissa hurt her, he will know and will not allow law to bind his wrath.)
5.  The Malfoys spend some time parading Hermione in public, but then when the novelty wears off, they pretty much leave her to her own devices, interacting with her as little as possible.
6.  Draco makes up for it by saying out loud what his parents are thinking.
7.  Lucius and Narcissa are not happy that their adoptive daughter has more talent and a stronger personality than their son, but there isn't much they can do about it.
8.  By the time she gets to Hogwarts, after being paraded around as a Muggleborn charity case, and resentful of the parental affection Draco is getting, Hermione has a chip on her shoulder a metre in diameter, and ends up right alongside him, in Slytherin.
9.  Driven by the need to prove herself and a sense of foreboding that if anything happens to a supercentenarian wizard, she might just be quietly disposed of, she seeks out any and all magic that would help her, and any and all allies she might be able to find.
10. But, the time with the Malfoys have given her somewhat better social skills and some preexisting connections, as well as a "model minority" status, so she is not completely ostracised and at least has study partners, if not outright friends, mostly in Ravenclaw, but a few in Hufflepuff and Slytherin.
11. Draco is somewhat radicalised by his experiences with Hermione. Based on their preexisting conflicts, she is going to rub her every achievement in his face---while calling him "brother". That would inspire a level of loathing towards Muggleborns that would make him far more eager to serve Voldemort than the more abstract sense of solidarity he had in canon. Ultimately, though, he just can't keep up.
12. Of course, at some point, Voldemort returns and demands that Lucius dispose of the Mudblood as a loyalty test---if nothing else to prove that he is more afraid of him than of Dumbledore.
13. Hermione executes a contingency plan and narrowly escapes to go to Dumbledore for help.
14. Dumbledore stashes her with the Weasleys and/or Sirius over the summer, where she becomes acquainted with the Order as well as Harry and Ron.
15. I can see her snogging Ron: she finds him attractive, Ron is the anti-Draco, and she is in the habit of going after what she wants; and Ron despite himself finds the scary workaholic Slytherin witch appealing.
16. There would probably be some non-bashy friction between her and Mrs. Weasley, since Hermione is used to taking care of herself and doesn't appreciate her form of mothering.
17. Back to Hogwarts, Hermione is conflicted between returning to Slytherin to show that she is not afraid and being able to sleep at night, because some upper-years ganging up, murdering her, and fleeing Hogwarts to join Voldemort is a remote possibility but one that she can't ignore. Ultimately, despite spending a summer around Gryffindors, she chooses safety; she can't be resorted, and she attends her classes as a Slytherin, but she sleeps at an undisclosed location.

From that point, you'd probably have a wizarding war with Hermione being unambiguously on the Order's side and quite a powerful asset, but she never quite puts herself into the chain of command: she just has too much resentment over being used by others.
