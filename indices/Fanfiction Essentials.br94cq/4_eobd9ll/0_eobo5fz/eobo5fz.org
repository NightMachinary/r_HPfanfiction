The wiki's shit - half of the links in it don't even work, and it's bizarrely shipping focused.

My top 3 must reads would be

They Shook Hands by Dethryl - all 7 books with a convincing Slytherin Harry

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin - best WBWL fic that isn't abandoned

The Lie I've Lived - Jbern's comedy is top tier and his magic scenes are great
