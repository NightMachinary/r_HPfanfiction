Personally I'd have them start with a time travel fic, maybe the previously linked Oh God Not Again, then once they're hooked to the idea of fanfiction, start throwing slightly different fics at them till you've reached heavily AU fics like Wizard of the Kaleidoscope, over this time you can ask what they did/didn't enjoy and tailor your recs with that information.

also, obligatory “eww, harmony.”
