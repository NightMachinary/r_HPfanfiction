I think the best fic I've ever read is 'Tightly Knit' by Kmbell92. It's on Wattpad, not FFN or AO3, but is written SO well (I dont think I've read anything wrong in it). It's pretty long, 100+ chapters with high word count in each chapter, but is the type of book that you just don't want to put down!

It's focused on an OC, who is best friends with Cedric Diggory, and doesn't really go along with the storyline, but there's a huge character arc and the actions of the protagonist change the story slightly (personally, I think that to have a good book, if you have an OC they should have an effect on the storyline). It's not predictable at all and the plot twists are incredible but also really believable! And the canon characters are so in character and are developed really really well!

Honestly, all the stories by kmbell92 are amazing!! I'd honestly reccomend it so much!
