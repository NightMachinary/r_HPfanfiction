  Inspired by the writing prompt:Person A: *clenching fists* fight me!Person B, standing behind them softly shaking his head, sword in hand: do not.-Harry was rescued from the Dursely's very early on... and instead of the weapon Albus wanted, he grew to be the formidable consort to the great Dark Lord. One day, Harry desperately wants to help in one of the interrogations- and who is Tom to deny his love anything?

  When Lord Voldemort attempts to kill baby Harry Potter, Magic decides that "this won't do" and thus creates a bond between the two. Voldemort's body is still destroyed by his Avada Kadavra, Harry is still raised by the Dursleys. The only change is that Neville becomes part of his group. At least that's how it goes, until Fourth year, and Harry is entered in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry is exposed to Voldemort, gives in to the bond, and helps him regain a body.Now, with a bond that needs them to be close to each other for some time before it settles, Harry has to come to terms with his actions. Mix this in with Voldemort not really being Voldemort but rather Tom Riddle, past lives, potion Masters being a pain in the ass, the Ministry not Understanding Anything and a budding romance between the Boy-Who-Lived and one Dark Lord, and Harry's pretty sure his Fifth Year and Hogwarts will be interesting.

  Turns out Harry's got a bit of an exhibitionism kink. Unfortunately (for someone), Voldemort's both happy to play along, and has plenty of servants to serve as an audience.

  "Who are we killing today?" Voldemort asked from just inside the doorway; Harry might look terrifying covered in flour, but Voldemort did not.

  Harry's never had someone smile so nicely at him before. There's always a look of disdain or disgust, or maybe something in between the two whenever the adults in his life look at him. The stranger doesn't do any of that, only smiles, then asks if Harry wants a better life. Harry, who's only known his cold tiny cupboard, who barely knows what a full meal is like. Harry, who's been told to never trust strangers---but this man can't be a stranger, he knows Harry's name. The stranger asks if Harry wants a better life, and who can fault a little boy for saying yes? Lily and James Potter die, but their son doesn't become fate's latest casualty.A story of reprieve.

  Severus Snape's loyalty has always been to Harry, not to Dumbledore or the Order. When he finds out that Harry is a horcrux and Dumbledore intends to have him killed, Severus goes to the Dark Lord with the information in an effort to save Harry's life, and in doing so changes the fate of the world.
