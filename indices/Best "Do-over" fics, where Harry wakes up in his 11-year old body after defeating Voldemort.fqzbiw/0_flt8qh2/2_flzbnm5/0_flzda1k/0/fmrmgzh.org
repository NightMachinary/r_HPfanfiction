I mean not really, it literally adds in stuff that didn't happen so the author can bash Ron, the Weasleys, and Dumbledore. It's hard to look past, cuz it's written fairly well otherwise, but the bashing is just... cringe.

I'm in chapter 10 and it's basically just a Dumbledore bashing fic right now. The author also has some extremely wrong views on his power levels lol
