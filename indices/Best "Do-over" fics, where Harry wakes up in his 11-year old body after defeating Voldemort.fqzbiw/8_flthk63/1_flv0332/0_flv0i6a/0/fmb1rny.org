Other than the aforementioned "Ah, Screw It!" could you share some others you've enjoyed?

I read one recently (can't recall title, alas) where Harry falls through the Veil instead of Sirius, and ironically winds up on a planet circling the star Sirius. A couple years later (after battling Guaould and Jaffra) he's rescued by SG1 and returned to Earth, where he proceeds to smash up the usual Harry Potter continuity. It was fun.
