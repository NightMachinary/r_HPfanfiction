I have yet to see the series in full but I love the Harry Potter and Stargate/SG: Atlantis crossovers. So refreshing at times. Sure they usually consist of Harry finding advanced ancient technology and exploring the galaxy, rebuilding old alliances and making new friends while fighting a common enemy. Most have Harry popping into Stargate Command and playing the odd prank or helping in various ways (usually humorous). And some have Harry rebuilding a society on another planet while continuously being Fates punching bag.
