  NoFP is still being written. Matthew (the author) had health complications that left him needing tons of physical therapy. His writing speed was, for obvious reasons, severely compromised, but I think he's improving and is a lot better now according to his FB page.

As much as I enjoyed NoFP, I'm far happier that Matthew is well on the way to healing.
