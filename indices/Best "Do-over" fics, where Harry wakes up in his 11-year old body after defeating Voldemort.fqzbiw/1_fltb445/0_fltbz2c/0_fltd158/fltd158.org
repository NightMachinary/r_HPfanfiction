NoFP is still being written. Matthew (the author) had health complications that left him needing tons of physical therapy. His writing speed was, for obvious reasons, severely compromised, but I think he's improving and is a lot better now according to his FB page.

NoFP was deleted from FF due to being flagged for song lyrics, which is stupid because NoFP never had any song lyrics (except for the Sorting Hat IIRC).

As of right now I think his Patreon is the main way to access it? Or you can try [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/index/][here]]?
