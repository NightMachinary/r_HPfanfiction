Not a do over, but I remember an extremely interesting one where Harry's transported back in time to the first wizarding war, into the death eater headquarters. He manages to stay alive by becoming a death eater, but Voldy instantly knows somethings off and interrogates Harry. Harry is forced to tell voldy that he was from the future, and was the child of james and lily, but didn't have the best childhood (And brings up images of the cupdoard while looking into his eyes), tricking voldy into beleiving that James wasn't a good parent.

Anyways, Harry is tricked into taking an modified dark vow that makes it so that he's physically incapable of telling his true origins to anyone. Poof, there goes his plans to fix things. Then, on a mission, he calls out to dumbledore, and the death eaters instantly know he's a traitor. He gets captured, Sirius interrogates him with HATE, and things go downhill from there ( Because Harry can't explain a thing)
