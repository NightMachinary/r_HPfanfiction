It is. I like these ones cuz in my opinion it portrays the naivety of Dumbledore. Everyone knows that he wants coexistence with muggles so seeing these is great. There are others too where Harry doesn't come tho in his first year rather than later. And “Again and Again” isn't a typical dark!harry . Its more like a flexible Harry where he doesn't really care about it. No spoilers lol. 😂😂😂

PS: normally i don't post or ask stuff here cuz i know that someone else will ask the question i wanna ask anyway. 😂
