I always imagine both male and female variants with dead eyes/a thousand yard stare after the first year.

Also, a female Harry would look noticeably harder than a normal teenage girl, sporting more than a few scars and a more muscular body than normal-a side-effect of the Dursley chores not being any different despite their nominal attitude being more relaxed towards a female than another male household member as well as the whole 'help me, I wanna live' aspect of things.

Basically, by the time female Harry hits fifth year, she has short hair to avoid someone pulling on it and nailing her from behind, sports a lot of scars due to various (mis)adventures, has the body of a fitness fanatic (because no wand + not allowed to fight= run away fast was a lesson she learned early on) and a slightly feral gaze to her.

Basically, sexy? Eh, it's not like she has the time for that sort of stuff anyway what with everyone trying to kill her and all that. If she survives, then maybe she'll consider it-unless she needs to go the Alastor Moody route afterwards in order to stay alive.
