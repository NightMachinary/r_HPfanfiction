Mainly due to headcanon. The key difference between the male and female Harrys would occur prior to Hogwarts, namely their respective treatment by the Dursleys. I picture female harry as having to put up with a lot less in terms of hardships from the perspective of food & bedding arrangements, though she experiences the same problems otherwise. No idea why, it's just what I believe.
