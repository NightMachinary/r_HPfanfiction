I started writing a fic years ago where girl!Harry was a literal inversion of Harry, Red hair, brown eyes, etc. The result I had for Petunia was that while Vernon and Dudley were slightly worse to her because she was a girl, Petunia would sometimes secretly gift things to "Heather"

Nothing huge and nothing new, but for slightly worse treatment, she had slightly more freedom, and as a result, fought with Dudley a lot more often. I don't think I cleared 4 chapters, but when they eventually got to Snape he was going to ignore her as hard as he could, never make eye contact, especially since he saw James' eyes staring out of Lily's face. I should pick it up again at some point, I just hate my own writing lol
