Do you know what site you read it on? I was just now looking for an Addams Family cross-over (not this one, sorry), and found that simply typing "Harry Potter Addams Family" in the search bar on AO3 got me a list of crossovers, and the one I was looking for still had the link showing as followed so it was easy to pick out of the list.

Alternately, you can check your AO3 history, but mine was too long to wade through which is why I tried the search.
