Mm, I once came up with the idea of Harry receiving a set of enchanted quills; originally designed to work in conjunction with an early Room of Requirement (you write down what you want to happen in the room, and presto, it happens), the high magical energy present throughout Hogwarts causes anything written by the magical quills to become 'real' in a holodeck sense.

Hilarity would ensue as Harry, Ron and Hermione write bad fanfiction about their own lives, only for the horrible cliches they use to come to life; Dumbledore would have an incompetent goatee-wearing evil twin start wandering around, Draco Malfoy would repeatedly be kidnapped and herded away by goblins, dozens of clones of Umbridge would run around getting themselves blown up, doppelgangers of Hedwig would fly in every morning to announce X character's new titles and places in the Wizengamot...

That could be played more seriously, too, actually; Harry, blessed by the ancient god of wisdom Thoth, possesses an enchanted quill which he can use to literally overwrite the narrative and impose his wishes on the world.
