This is quite fascinating. It's interesting to see how the nobility treated each other in the Victorian era. But if we're going to go with historical accuracy, wouldn't the Statute of Secrecy preclude Victorian forms of address? The Statute of Secrecy would have to have come into effect during King William the Third's reign (William of Orange), in 1692, and without heavy Muggle influence, they would have taken a vastly different route in terms of the development of their culture.

But even further than that, Rowling's mistakes involving Merlin and the founding of Hogwarts have to be either largely ignored, or accepted, creating a vastly different timeline. Hogwarts was founded in 990AD, roughly 500 to 600 years after Merlin is actually born. Since in Rowling's timeline, Merlin was around in the medieval era and attended Hogwarts, he must have come at least 60 or so years after 990, because it is likely that he would have otherwise been involved in the affairs of the founders (Wizards and witches live long). However Merlin most likely was not born towards the end of the medieval era in the 15th century, simply because Flamel is a fair bit over 665 by 1992, which meant that he was born somewhere in the 14th century. Unless Flamel is hiding his true age, the sheer importance of Merlin would have made it noted on something like the chocolate frog card that Merlin and Flamel were alive at the same time. Moving up Merlin also shifts up the existence of Arthur, which means that he would have had to fight off some invasion other than the Saxons. Since King Arthur is a figure so closely tied into Welsh mythology and related to Celtic myths, we may surmise that distinct Celtic and Welsh influences would very likely survive for a while, influencing the Wizarding World.

Of course, a lot of what I wrote is conjecture, but still, it is important to note as it does point out along with a whole host of other details in Harry Potter that Celtic and Welsh influences may have been very strong in a more consistent timeline.
