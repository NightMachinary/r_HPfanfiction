The view of Merlin aging backwards seems to have originated from T.H. White's work /The Once and Future King/. It was based on /Le Morte d'Arthur/ by Sir Thomas Malory. Essentially making it fanfiction of fanfiction. Merlin aging backwards seems to be from /Le Morte d'Arthur/, but other than one source on Quora that notes that Merlin simply didn't age and that there is no real mention whether Merlin goes backwards in time, I couldn't find it by searching a pdf. Perhaps what the Quora user said is true, but I'll have to do some of my own searching. If you want to know, I'll get back to you in about a week or two.
