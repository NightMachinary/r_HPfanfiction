Didn't Merlin, like, live backwards or something, though? Couldn't he have been young and gone to school in 990 AD, then aged backwards through time until he was an old powerful wizard in King Arthur's time? He'd need to live for quite a while, but Albus Dumbledore made it to 115 and was very spry, so who knows how long wizards can live.
