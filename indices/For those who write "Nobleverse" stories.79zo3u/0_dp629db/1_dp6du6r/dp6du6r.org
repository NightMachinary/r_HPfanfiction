One thing to note however, is that Binns states that Hogwarts was founded /over/ a thousand years ago. For all we know, it could have been founded in the sixth century.

Alternatively, there are two Merlins, one who lived in the sixth century, and one who attended Hogwarts, possibly a descendant or successor of the original.
