Neville may have mattered more in the end in some ways, particularly in universe, (slaying Nagini and leading the resistance in Hogwarts in 7th year), but he did next to nothing for the first 4 years (his biggest role was getting body bound by Hermione when they went after the stone).\\
Malfoy was relevant every year, as a minor antagonist with plenty of 'screen time' then in 6th year he's the one who lets death eaters in and is behind the botched assassination attempts, in 7th he's less important, though it's noteable that without his minor role Narcissa wouldn't have lied for Harry.

Edit: just realised, without Malfoy's involvement in Dumbledore's death Harry wouldn't have the allegiance of the elder wand and would likely have lost to Voldermort (and who knows how that would go, his sacrifice would probably still work to save people, so Voldie might still lose)
