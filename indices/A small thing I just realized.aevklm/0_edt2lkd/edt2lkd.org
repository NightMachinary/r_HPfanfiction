How is Neville more important throughout the books? Malfoy is his main rival throughout the first 5 books and becomes a more important character in book 6 with his mission. Neville plays an incredibly minor role (most people even forget that Neville played a role the night they rescued the stone). I think he only has a couple major contributions later in the story (DoM and seventh year which was mostly off screen).

In terms of characterisation and developing the story Malfoy was way more important and Neville negligible.
