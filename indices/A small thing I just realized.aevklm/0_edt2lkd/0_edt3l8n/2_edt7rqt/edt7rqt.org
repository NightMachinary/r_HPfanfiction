He's only important in book 7 (mostly offscreen) and plays a minor role in book 5.

DMalfoy was a consistent factor throughout with more importance in book 6. You are confusing the fact that Neville played a more important part in actually ending the war with actual value in terms of story and character development. Neville was not important for things getting to the point where he actually did something relevant, if for instance Seamus or Dean had taken up the role of Neville in book 7 the story could be exactly the same without any raised eyebrows.

If you are actually referring to the roles both played in the war then I agree with you. But story wise Malfoy was a far more relevant and important character.
