Malfoys a bully in the first few books. He just makes life for Harry harder. Sometimes he's the red herring.

For example, what did he do during the goblet of fire? Prisoner of Azkaban?

Later on, it's like worrying about a skinhead during a Nazi invasion. Even his later gained importance as Dumbledore's assassin is quickly taken over by Snape and his whole family gets a reduced role by Voldemort for failing

In contrast, Neville lead the Hogwarts resistance and destroys the final horcrux.
