You're confusing the importance of Neville from a plot perspective with his character in a literary perspective I think. If that makes sense.

Neville isn't really important at all (compared to Malfoy) until the7^{th} book. Though I guess you could argue for him in the 5^{th.} Malfoy appears often, and consistently affects the protagonists in meaningful ways. Neville does not with a couple exceptions. I also am fairly sure that Malfoy appears more than Neville does.
