This could be my head-canon doing the thinking but what's the possibility of Hernione's parents knowing of everything she has been through/is going through in the magical community? Hermione's a smart character and part of me believes that she kept quite a bit from her parents (or at least altered happenings to some extent so that she wasn't the focal point of it). This allowed her parents to believe that she wasn't in any real danger only because 1) They didn't know about it and/or 2) Hermione lowered that danger's threat level to a non-existent factor.
