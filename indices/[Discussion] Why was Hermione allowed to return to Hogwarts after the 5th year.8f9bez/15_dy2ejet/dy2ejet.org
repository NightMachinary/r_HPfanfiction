I don't think the parents of muggleborn have any say what so ever if there children should attend Hogwarts, Hermione parents even if they did forbid her would not be the first to do so i cant see the wizardry world care. And how should Hermione parents know what is happening would stuff like that happen to me i would not tell my parents i dont think many childeren would tell there parents if they had to decide between magical and muggle world and i believe Hermione did understand if she told her parents what happened that she would not be allowed to go back not that i think that the wizardry world would care much about what muggles think.
