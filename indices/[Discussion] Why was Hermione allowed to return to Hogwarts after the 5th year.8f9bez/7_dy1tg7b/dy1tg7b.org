I guess in order,

...Even if her friends would be considered toxic from our book perspective, her parents would only know from Hermione's. So instead of Ron made me cry and only because of that did the troll attack me. It is Harry and Ron saved me from a Troll, with no magical contexts a troll could be those rock things from Frozen. Instead of the roughly 12 foot monster.

...5th year? Why would she tell her parents about that? She broke into a government building, even a no magical kid would be afraid or embarrassed to do so.

...Danger? Again no context, giant basilisk could just be a very large magical python. How much would hermione's discussion go into? Just because she's bright doesn't mean she's a great story teller. Rashomon effect, people go over events in their head and focus on different things. Giant 3 Headed Dog? Nah but there was a cool trapdoor. In this case Ron would be the better story teller.

...Less and less time with parents? That's just growing up. Magic has little to do with it.

...Mad terrorists? Killing Muggles? The only reason we know Harry Potter is specifically targeted is because of magical perspective. Imagine say a friend from another country, say China, telling you about a national movie star. How much would you care is they got Starbucks behind you? Now a movie star from your own country. Same difference, magic terrorists, they probably don't think about it.

..16 so she can leave? ... so? That's a pro for if she does leave, not a reason to leave.

...She can also have sex legally then too so that probably matters more to them realistically. Also she's been in that system since 11, she's gonna drop out before finishing? Stop at high school and not go to the Magical College years? Or Uni after Secondary?

And what if she tells them nothing? That's her business, I can't judge her for sharing or keeping information. I judge actions, and she's done some pretty nuts things. But without context we don't know how amazing the other students adventures are or aren't.

There could be a whole seris of... Patil Twins and the Secret of the Willow, Patil Twins and the Vanishing Hufflepuff, Patil Twins and the Search for Sanctuary. It's only fantastic to the muggle not the wizard. Merlin was a real guy. I'm sure his adventures put Harry to shame.

Kids could get into fights at regular school and never tell their parents, be bullied or be the bully. And their parents never know. It's up to the parent to raise them and hope they actually do it. Not receive reports on it, cause really they could say anything.

The whole truth, lie of omission, or a story that's totally a lie. But they can have only acted one way and generally parents don't get to see how their children act. Just 2nd hand reports.

...

So I suppose my answer to your discussion is that sure magical school is more dangerous. But so is untrained magic, who knows what kinds of accidental magic there was with mini Hermione? Forget the later added on stuff with kids exploding and religious undertones, just imagine your daughter wanting to wear all blue or something, and then turns her whole outfit and entire body blue.

Probably for the best to send her to a school that knows how to, and can handle it.
