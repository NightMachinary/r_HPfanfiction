I can smell the ‘Muggleness' of this post and OP's opinion. Hermione is the brightest witch of her era and as Dean pointed out - Muggleborns dont tell shit to their parents. I mean how do you expect people to believe that the biggest bad guy ever is an immortal bald snakeface with no nose? OP also pointed out that Hermione not telling shit to her parents makes her immature lol. If anything, that was the most mature thing to do. By telling her parents shit, she'll only be putting then in danger. Not telling them shit and obliviating them actually saved their lives. And this may sound cruel, but what Hermione did was right. By abandoning her parents and returning to the Magical world, Hermione helped to save thousands from Voldemort's reign. As dear Dumbledork loves to say, “For the greater good.”
