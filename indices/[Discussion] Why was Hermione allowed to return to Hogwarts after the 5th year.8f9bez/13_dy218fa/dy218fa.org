Hermione probably just didn't tell them so they wouldn't have any way of finding out. And even if they did, they probably weren't capable of stopping her. By the time fifth year roles around, the shit is hitting the fan and things are getting serious. Hermione is willing to directly oppose authority to the point of organizing what is essentially a small army. She's not just going to accept it if her parents tell her she can't go back. Further, Dumbledore probably wouldn't have let them pull her out. By that point, she was obviously too important to Harry's ability to function efficiently for Dumbledore to let her go.

  Than what do you think about a daughter who for years were looking into the eyes of the most important people for her and lying about life and death situations in her school?

I think it would be a reasonable thing to do. And they probably weren't the most important people to her by that point.
