I doubt her parents had half a clue of what was going on. I can see Herms thinking "what they don't know won't hurt them" from a mile away.

I know fanfic likes to present the Grangers as the best parents since Joseph and the Virgin Mary, but canon indirectly points towards them being pretty indifferent. Hermione chooses to spend the holidays away like 60% of the time and basically deletes their minds without a second thought.

How did a fanfic put it... /"or maybe Hermione was one of those only children, whose parents loved their lava lamp more than her."/

It was a parody, but still.
