Rowling has said that she conceives of the Granger parents as "decent normal people" who don't really understand half of what they hear about the Wizarding World, but genuinely love their little girl and are proud of her "special talent". So not neglectful, no, but perhaps with a sort of pampering, wide-eyed naïveté that Hermione didn't want to shatter by telling them "oh, and a giant snake almost killed me this year, controlled by part of the soul of a teenage necromancer".
