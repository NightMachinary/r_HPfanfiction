To be fair, she was a real bitch...

Hermione was fucking cutthroat man. She had her code she lived by, and fuck anyone else who got in her way. In truth, she was so damn ambitious, I don't think there's anyone who did a better job of showcasing all four major traits of the houses than she did. She was smart as hell (top in the class). She was brave (didn't flinch to go into dangerous spots with Harry. She'd question the reasoning sometimes because she was smart, but she was always down). She was loyal and hardworking (only person to NEVER waver support for Harry, and in fact, even when Ron wavered in his support, she never wavered from Ron. Ultimate friend). But she was CUNNING, and ambitious. She was probably the most Slytherin person in the whole book who wasn't actually in Slytherin (Dumbledore a close second).
