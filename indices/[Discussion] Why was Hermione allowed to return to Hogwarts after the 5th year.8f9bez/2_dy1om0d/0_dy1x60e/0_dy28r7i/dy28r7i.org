"I was almost killed by the ghost of a despotic madman that supposedly died a decade ago"

"I was almost killed by a giant snake who can turn people into stone."

"Oh my teacher was a werewolf, he almost killed us when he forgot his medecine. Also, let's not forget those soul-sucking creatures that served as guards for the school and the fact that a supposedly mass-murderer who escaped the most secure prison in the world infiltrated the school. Twice."

"Remeber that ghost of a despotic madman tht supposedly died a decade ago? Well he didn't! He's back now, madder than ever. Also, his equally fanatic bootlickers managed to infiltrate the school and teach children. We saw lots of fun stuff, like how to torture people, kill them and mindcontrol them."

"I ran an illicit club that learned how to fight and went against the government. I also infiltrated that same government because my friend had a dream that his godfather was imprisoned, so I followed him without question, while leaving our current headmistress in the woods with unfriendly centaurs (she was a real bitch tho.). We all nearly died in the process, had to fight fanatic murderers and Harry's godfather died. But we didn't."

Yeah I can see all five years going real well in the "how was your year sweetie?" conversation.
