My dad is pretty distant about my schooling and he's not neglectful. He just never went to University, so it's of little important to him and doesn't really care much about my field of study, so it's not interesting. I'm not going to push the subject in his throat if he's indifferent to it, but it doesn't make him neglectful either.
