You're missing the point. If Hermione's parents are distant about her schooling and trust her, and Hermione (or the school) don't report the danger she's in, there is no way for them to assume that she's in any danger at all.

It's not being neglectful, it's being naive.

Your whole premise is based on the fact that they /know/ the danger she's in and willingly puts her back every year. But your premise is unproven. For all we know, they have no knowledge of what really transpire at school. They never event went to the place.
