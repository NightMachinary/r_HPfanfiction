  A lot of teenagers are eager to take their autonomy and independence. But it doesn't make them mature.

Yes it does. It literally makes them more mature, with time. It works just the other way you think it does. First you take your autonomy and then you grow more mature. This is because you need to learn how to be mature, and this is done through finding yourself in situations where you have no other choices than to take your responsabilities.

If your child refuses to take his independence, what you end up with is a 30 or 40 year old child. Not a balanced, experienced and mature adult.
