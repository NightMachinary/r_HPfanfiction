I have nothing against responsible adults joining the professional army. As I see in the US you can join the army when you're 17 (with parental consent) or 18 (without parental consent).

But I'm against teenagers tagging along their friends to the war without any professional help (in other words on suicide mission).

This topic is about very specific case: Hermione is going to the school where her life is under constant danger (and later to the war without any help).

The books clearly shows that Magical World and Magical government don't share Hermione's values. She was fighting for others to get all benefits.
