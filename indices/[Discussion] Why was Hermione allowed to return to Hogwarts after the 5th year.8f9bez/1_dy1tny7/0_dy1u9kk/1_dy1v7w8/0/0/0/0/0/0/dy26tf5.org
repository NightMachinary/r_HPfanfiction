  ...Will you send your children to the war right after school?

If required, yes. One hopes it never comes to that, obviously, but we don't always get to call the shots. (Bad pun.)

My son will register for Selective Service in the U.S. in a couple of years, making him eligible for the draft. If it happens to be his choice to join one of the military branches after school, I will respect that.

Sending our children to risk death in defense of their nation and values is part of the price we collectively pay for liberty. One has to think that Hermione understood this in the fictional series we're discussing. I get that this perhaps doesn't jive with your values but it's a real thing among many (Hermione included).
