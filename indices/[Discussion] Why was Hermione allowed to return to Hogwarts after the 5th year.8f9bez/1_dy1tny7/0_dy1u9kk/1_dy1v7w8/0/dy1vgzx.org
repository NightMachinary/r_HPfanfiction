  It clearly means student from boarding schools often act this way. It seems easy to understand...

Yes, a woman with similar experience clarified it in the parallel thread. While it's not my view, I accept it and won't argue about it.

  Maturity isn't about running to your mother crying ;). It's about taking your autonomy and independence.

A lot of teenagers are eager to take their autonomy and independence. But it doesn't make them mature.
