  She's at boarding school - it's quite normal to just spend a week or two with your family before going off to see friends.

Really? Does it mean that a boarding school totally replaces family?

  Also I imagine that Hermione was protecting her parents by not telling them anything about the dangers she was facing due to being friends with Harry.

I think that such points makes her an immature child who can't make any responsible decisions.

They are her parents and she's hiding life threats to her parents also.

  Also since they come of age at 17 in the wizarding world I do not think you can call a 16 year old a child.

It some government declares you of age person it doesn't make you such.

She's still 16-17 years old girl with no experience outside of school and fully dependant on her parents. Mentally she's a child-teenager, not a grown up.
