'Really? Does it mean that a boarding school totally replaces family?'

No it means that you see your family for a week or so and then go off and socialise with your friends or your friends come to you. One of the major points of boarding school is to foster a sense of independence. I was at boarding school in England (and loved it by the way!) and when summer came I would spend a week or so with my parents and then go off and stay with friends. Quite normal.

'I think that such points makes her an immature child who can't make any responsible decisions.'

No it makes her an independent young woman shielding her parents from things they cannot (as muggles) understand in her view. She is being responsible because to her mind assisting Harry and her magical life is more important. I mean are you seriously calling the HIGHLY responsible Hermione Granger immature?!

'It some government declares you of age person it doesn't make you such.'

Um yes it does. It means you gain the responsibilities of an adult person in the country within which you live and 17/18 is plenty old enough when you have mainly grown up in a school where independence and self-reliance are very much encouraged.

Again please tell me how 16 year old Hermione is completely reliant on her parents? She could get married or leave home if she wishes to. And most 18 year olds only have experienced school at that age but they are considered adults so why not the responsible, has-been-on-many adventures-and-survived-to-tell-the-tale Hermione Granger at 16.
