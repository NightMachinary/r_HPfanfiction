I mean, ya, we don't need to resort to that argument every time a discussion arrives, but you're taking it just too far for what it's worth. You're treating this discussion as if 'Muggles' and 'Wizards' were organic and natural societies.

They are artificial and constructed, contrived. They weren't born, they didn't evolve, or change, they were created and are static, frozen. It's just not comparable to real, organic human structures.

It's like trying to compare a conlang to a natural language, it doesn't work and the conlang will necessarily fail if you try to view it from a natlang perspective, because they were not designed the same way.
