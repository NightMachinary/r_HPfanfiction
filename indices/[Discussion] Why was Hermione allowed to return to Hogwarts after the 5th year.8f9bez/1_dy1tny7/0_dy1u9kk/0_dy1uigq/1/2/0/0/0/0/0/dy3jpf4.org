While I understand your point, it's hard for me to see how it correlates with the topic I created.

There were many threads about HP characters their behavior, it's just one of them. Or how s it different?

My question is about one very specific event, or more precisely it's about Hermione's parents view on it. It's not about societies or how they are integrated together.

To be honest I'm disappointed in most threads here.

The most upvoted answer is that Hermione lied about life and death situations in Hogwarts to her parents for years. Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer.

But most other talks were more about protecting Hermione from being a 16 year old girl who has caring parents.

Taking into account all downvotes I got even expression of such thought is sacrilege.

For myself I concluded that HP series is so successful is that despite of their adventures Rowling managed to portray her heroes as mere teenagers even if a lot of people couldn't look past hero frontend.
