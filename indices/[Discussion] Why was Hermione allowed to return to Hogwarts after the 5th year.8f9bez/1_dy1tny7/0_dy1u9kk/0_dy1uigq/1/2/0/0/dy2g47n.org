You're taking this way too seriously ffs. It's a book. They needed Wizards to be stupid for the children to look heroic and they needed Hermione to come back for plot reason. End of the story.

We can be all in love with the serie, and wish it was real, or want to expand it and make it as plausible as possible. It's not. It's fiction.
