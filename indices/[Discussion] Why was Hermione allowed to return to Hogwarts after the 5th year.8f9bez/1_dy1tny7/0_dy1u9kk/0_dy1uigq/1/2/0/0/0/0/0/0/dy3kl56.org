  While I understand your point, it's hard for me to see how it correlates with the topic I created.
#+end_quote

The topic under the arguments that were brought is trivially linked to societies. As the artificial societal norms in the Harry Potter movies were behind most of the actions of the protagonists in the serie (yes that includes reckless school management). These constructed, contrived norms were designed by a single human to create and narrate a story and the characters were made to fit that story, Hermione included. The flaw in the argumentation - this discussion - is when you, and others (me included) tried to approach these artificial societies - Muggle / Wizard - through our organic views. That is to say that what seem illogical for us is not applicable in this story. Many points of logic that you will see in Harry Potter, and most other work of fiction, will fail spectacularly once scrutinized, simply because the author was not so much focused in producing the closest thing to an organic society as they were interested in producing a story. As such, instead of doing it the "natural" "logical" way of designing a story around a society, Harry Potter, like most other fictions, saw the societies shoehorned inside the stories and only superficially thought through.

The discussion in this thread grew to this level because you try to apply organic morals to a story that only have constructed ones.

  The most upvoted answer is that Hermione lied about life and death situations in Hogwarts to her parents for years. Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer.

This is the way you approached every single replies in this thread. Moral is irrelevant. The most likely opinion that creates the least cognitive dissonance in our understanding of Hermione's family dynamic (Hermione as caring parents and Hermione's parents lets her come back to school year after year ; ergo they must not be aware of what is occuring at school) is the one that got the most upvotes. We do not know what happens, we do not care, ultimately, because the reasoning is irrelevant to the story. We can try to shove our own logic down the story's throat and, yes, our morals ("Putting aside the moral, I'm ok with such answer."). It is what it is. The story revolves around teenagers hero, and for teenagers to be hero, adults have to be incompetent. It's not a fallacy, it's a rule of the fiction genre. One which would fail in the real world. But this rule is the backbone of the whole Harry Potter saga. Adults are incompetent.

Adults are incompetent.

This includes the school, the government, but also the parents. The teenagers have to be heroes. To be heroes, they have to shine and there would be no way for them to shine if the adults were anywhere close to competent. If Hermione's parents were competent, they would not have let her go back to school, but they couldn't. Because J.K Rowling needed them to be fucking miserable at their parenting. That's really the end of it. There's no morals, there's no values, there's no logic because it's an artificial, constructed story relying on incompetence where there would normally not be in the real world. This is where all discussions questionning the actions of characters will end up, because it is the tragic, needed flaw for the story to work as it did.

As soon as people tried to view this discussion through organic societial rules, with morals and values, it was bound to take this weird, kafkaesque turn.
