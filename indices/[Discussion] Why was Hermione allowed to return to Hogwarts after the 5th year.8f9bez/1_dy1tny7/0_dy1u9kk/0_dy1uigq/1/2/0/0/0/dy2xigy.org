  You're taking this way too seriously ffs. It's a book. They needed Wizards to be stupid for the children to look heroic and they needed Hermione to come back for plot reason. End of the story.

But this argument can be applied to any discussion and therefore it makes such discussion meaningless: “it happened because the plot required it, there's nothing to talk about”.
