  It's pretty popular point of view. But what couldn't non-magical people understand? Can you provide any examples?

That they can cure and heal pretty much anything? I mean, Harry broke his arm, had his bones removed and the next day he had his arm back to normal.

Broken bones takes months to fully heal, they can do that in two minutes. Parents of magical children are much more freespirited when it comes to injuries and the likes. Downright neglectful and abusive to Muggle's eyes. Just look at how Neville's upbringing was. Security to Wizards is laughable because injuries are rarely serious, or at least to a different extent than what is considered serious for Muggles.
