'I think this is where out understanding of the family clashes. For me as a teenager spending just a week in a year with parents is not normal. It devalues the parenthood and meaning of the family.'

Well then I hope you didn't go to boarding school then! I did and within my peers and the like it was very normal. I was (and still am) incredibly close to my parents. You still communicate through letters and phone calls and I treasure my family AND my independence highly. I said one to two weeks in the summer holidays, I'd then spend a week with them over Easter and another at Christmas. Different types of families do not negate what a family is - I am upper middle-class English woman, this is quite normal.

'Why is it more important? How does it make her an adult? I recommend to read posts of 15-18 year old riddlers in [[/r/relationships]] and parents point of view in [[/r/Parenting]] Any 16 year old girl can get pregnant and then marry, but it just make her highly irresponsible person.'

Yes I've read them and always wonder about their parents to be quite honest! We are talking about Hermione ' brightest and most responsible' Granger not the 15 year old down the road.
