  Well then I hope you didn't go to boarding school then!

I didn't.

I understand that our views there aren't the same. I fully accept it. We're just different in them.

  We are talking about Hermione ' brightest and most responsible' Granger not the 15 year old down the road.

Brightest -- may be. Her academic achievements are remarkable (still Bill Weasley and Barty Crouch Jr. were better).

Most responsible -- how does following her friends into breaking into the government building and obvious trap make her responsible? Loyal -- yes, but responsible?
