  But we are talking about different types of independence I think - encouraging independence in young people and financial independence.

I can see how a person thinks about himself/herself as independent while he/she lives using money the family provides.

Also I see big difference between "encouraging independence in young people" and sending your only child to a school where her life is under constant danger.
