That cannot be used in comparison to Hogwarts as Hogwarts is a STATE boarding school and funded by the state.

But I personally attended with a musical scholarship as well so my parents actually paid nothing for me to attend the school but had i not been gifted in that sense then yes they would have paid for me to attend. But we are talking about different types of independence I think - encouraging independence in young people and financial independence.
