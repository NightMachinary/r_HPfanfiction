Considering that the terrorist is not far from taking over the government and implementing his own Final Solution, I would probably let her go since apparently there are ways to track people with magic. Because forbidding her from going doesn't stop the magical SS from showing up, killing me and taking her to a magical Concentration Camp or outright killing her. It comes down to do or die in the magical Holocaust.
