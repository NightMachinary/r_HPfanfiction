  No it means that you see your family for a week or so and then go off and socialise with your friends or your friends come to you. One of the major points of boarding school is to foster a sense of independence. I was at boarding school in England (and loved it by the way!) and when summer came I would spend a week or so with my parents and then go off and stay with friends. Quite normal.

I went to English boarding schools too. What you describe is /not/ normal except in the last couple of years. I spent the vast majority of my holidays with my family. There was one kid I knew of who didn't do that. One, out of dozens in my year group that I was friendly with. He was a right weirdo.
