She's at boarding school - it's quite normal to just spend a week or two with your family before going off to see friends. Also I imagine that Hermione was protecting her parents by not telling them anything about the dangers she was facing due to being friends with Harry.

Also since they come of age at 17 in the wizarding world I do not think you can call a 16 year old a child.
