Hogwarts actually gives students money if they can't afford school supplies, and she would just stay at the Weasleys, as for emotional support, she can get that from friends and teaches buts she's very self assured so I doubt she needs it. I doubt her parents can give her much support any way, they're muggles she can talk at them all she wants but they haven't experienced how to be a witch or wizard and most things that she now finds normal they find new and strange and they probably have no clue what she's talking about.
