Yes it does change them, they have responsibilities that normal teenagers or even adults don't normally have, and it would most definitely lead to them maturing way faster and making harder decisions than other teenagers, but that doesn't mean they can't act like a normal teenager most of the time or some of the time. Not even every teenager in the real world can afford to act like every other teen out there, simply because they had to take on responsibilities that other teenager don't.

But you can't fit every single person in the same box, even if they're fictional, because they simply will not all fit your idea of them.
