Experiencing a different culture from another country that you knew has existed your whole life isn't comparable to stepping into a whole other reality which the Wizarding world pretty much is. Knowing that other countries do things differently is not the same as having the world as you know it turn on it's head.

They may not be bared from Diagon Alley but they certainly don't have a reason to be there, they're muggles adults with full time jobs and with a daughter that goes to a boarding school and when she comes home all she has to talk about is things they don't understand or have too much of an interest in, to them she may as well be talking quantum physics. As long as she says she's doing well and that she's getting good marks than they have no reason to pry, they also have no reason to see that anything is going wrong, she could tell them that Voldemort is back from the dead and they wouldn't think much of it because they don't know the significances of that, it's just another wacky thing about that would that their daughter is in.

You may have put yourself into Hermione's parents shoes but you assume they know everything that's going on and that they understand it, and you also haven't spared a moment to put yourself into Hermione's shoes and why she is doing what she's doing, you are just simply calling her immature or that she's mentally ill for wanting to protect her friends and save lives.
