  you also haven't spared a moment to put yourself into Hermione's shoes and why she is doing what she's doing, you are just simply calling her immature or that she's mentally ill for wanting to protect her friends and save lives.

There were a lot of talks about her perspective and characterization. I don't see any sense in creating another one clone.

I tried to do something different, but as I see event thought about her as a mere teenager is a sacrilege. I think it's strange, but I accept it.
