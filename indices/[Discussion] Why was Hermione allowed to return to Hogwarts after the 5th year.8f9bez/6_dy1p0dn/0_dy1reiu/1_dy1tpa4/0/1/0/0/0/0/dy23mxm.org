Knowing that Japan exists and has a different culture to yours is very different to finding out that a magical world exists and leaning about it from a second hand source wouldn't help.

I never said you can learn everything about a culture from TV or going to a restaurant, but it doesn't take a genius to pick things up here and there. where as with the wizarding world the only portal they have to it is though Hermione and of cause she's not going to tell them all the bad things that have happened because she wants to stay in that world and she doesn't want them to worry.

Why are you so hung up on Hermione? The Dursleys don't want Harry to go to Hogwarts but he still does. The Weasleys know most everything that goes on and they never seem to consider home schooling or sending them to a different school. Why are you even here? you seem to hate Hermione and you have called Harry and Ron toxic so you obviously don't like the three main characters. Do you actually like anything about Harry Potter?
