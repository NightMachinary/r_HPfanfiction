You can imagine her as a normal teenager all you want but the truth is is that she's not, it's like saying Peter Parker is an normal teenager or Harry Potter is a normal teenager, they have the illusion of being normal and relatable but in truth they just aren't normal. it's like trying to shove a square into a circle, you just can't do it without cutting off vital parts of them that make up that character.

Though I'm sure a fic from her parents perfective would be an interesting read.
