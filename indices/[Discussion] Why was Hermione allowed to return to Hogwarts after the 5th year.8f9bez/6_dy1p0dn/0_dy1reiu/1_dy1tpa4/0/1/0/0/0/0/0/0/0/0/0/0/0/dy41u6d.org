Hermione being a witch doesn't automatically make her something bigger than daughter of her parents. It doesn't put any additional weight on her shoulders, besides maintaining the SoS.

Her parents don't have any reasons to treat her anything else than as their beloved daughter, because she is their beloved 16 year old daughter.

Everything you're talking about is just a part of their "Hero" images. But under that frontend there're mere just boys and girls not very different from others.
