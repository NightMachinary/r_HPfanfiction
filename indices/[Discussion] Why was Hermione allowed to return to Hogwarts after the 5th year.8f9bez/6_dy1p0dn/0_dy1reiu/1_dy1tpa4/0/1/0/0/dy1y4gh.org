it's not just two different cultures it's basically two different worlds, one they've never even heard existed before Hermione tuned eleven, we see that people have a different culture from a young age, we see it on TV, we experience it by going on a holiday there or just going to a good Japanese restaurant, Hermione parents however are adults being told that there is a whole different world that lives next to theirs that have animals and humanoid beings that are different from anything that they have experienced.

They might not even be that interested in the first place, they might be happy in their muggle world. I can talk all I want to my mum about makeup or fandoms I like but that doesn't mean she's interested in hearing about everything and most of what I say will go over her head because she's not used to hearing all the terms that I'm using. No one tells their parents everything, teens don't tell their parent that they're sexually active or that they're drinking at parties or that they smoked some weed. Instead of doing all that, Hermione just busy helping Harry save lives.

the reason people can write about it is because they've "experienced" it though Harry Potter, we know what people are talking about when they mention boggarts dementors or Death Eaters.
