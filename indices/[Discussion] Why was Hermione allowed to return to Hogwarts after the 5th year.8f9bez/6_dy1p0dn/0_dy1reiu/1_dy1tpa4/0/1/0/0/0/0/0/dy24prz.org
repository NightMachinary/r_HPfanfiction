  Knowing that Japan exists and has a different culture to yours is very different to finding out that a magical world exists and leaning about it from a second hand source wouldn't help.

I believe it's perfectly normal behaviour.

Where did you get it from?

Is it because I looked at a 16 year old girl as a 16 year old girl? Why is it bashing or hating?
