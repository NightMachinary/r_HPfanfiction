Yes but you are saying 16 year old Hermione has not experienced the world outside of school and I am saying that the 18 year olds we called adults have experienced the same yet they are adults. And she at 16 has experienced more than those 18 year olds.

Also on a couple of posts you've put 'can' when you clearly mean 'can't' - it makes some of your points a little confusing.
