In the first 5 books she is the most on the ball of the trio. She figured out the devils snare, and the potion in first year, the basilisk in second (not counting making polyjuce), was right about almost everything in 3rd year, 4th year she was hampered due to it being a tournament but she was the one training Harry, and in fifth year one of she was basically the mastermind behind Harry.

Her being slightly arrogant and abrasive is understandable and helped keep her out of Mary Sue territory.
