Actually she seems to be firmly in Mary Sue terrortiy as her reason for exististing is explaining things to Harry and Ron. And the fact that a part of the fandom doesnt really count in the flaws but only the good things.

But figuring the devlis snare en the potion. I have no reason to assume Harry and Ron wouldnt have figured them out. In the same categorie you have the obstacles Harry and Ron took down.

In 2nd year she figured it out thats simply true.

In 3rd year tough she had no idea what she was talking about and was just whining for attention.

4th year she learns Harry one spell. While having a ridiculous campaign about elves.

5th year if she was the mastermind her plan basically backfired into epic proportions.
