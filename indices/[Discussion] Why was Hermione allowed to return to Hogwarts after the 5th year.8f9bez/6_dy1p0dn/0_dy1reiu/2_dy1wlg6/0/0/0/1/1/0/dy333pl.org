  Still are you using them as role models for your children?

Col. Bud Day? Absolutely, I use him as a role model for my child. Day was among the greatest heroes the U.S. ever produced, an exemplar of bravery and honor. Like Hermione, he left school early to fight for a noble cause. I have had the good fortune to have heard him speak and consider it a high honor.

As well, I use as a role model to my child my great uncle, a decorated soldier who enlisted at 16 and fought in Patton's Third Army.
