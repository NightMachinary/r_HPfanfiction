  If fighting Voldemort isn't a good enough reason, what would be one?

This is my question and point.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think everyone who joined the army to fight Hitler in WW2 had serious mental issues?
#+end_quote

*World* War 2 is a complex issue. The most of Europe citizens didn't have any choice, because the War was global and they didn't have resources to escape over the Ocean.

During WW2 US army had age restriction of 18 years.

Also my point was about a 16 year old teenager who threatens to run away, because parents don't allow her return to school where her life is under constant danger.

Still, even if it's about 16 year old teenager who wants to fight Riddle for the government that treats her with disrespect at least, threats of running away are very immature.
