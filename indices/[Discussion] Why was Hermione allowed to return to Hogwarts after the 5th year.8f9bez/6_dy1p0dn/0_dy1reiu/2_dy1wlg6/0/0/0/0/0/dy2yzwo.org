  Why would anyone think her doing the right thing is crazy?

At the end of the book 5 she is just a 16 year old girl who got almost killed while tagging along her friends in breaking the government building tin order to fight a group of terrorists.

From a parent standpoint I don't see even one action of a matured and responsible person.

If after that she's threatening to ran away, the only reasonable response is to ground her and take her away from that crazy environment.
