*Bud Day*

George Everette "Bud" Day (24 February 1925 -- 27 July 2013) was a United States Air Force colonel, World War II veteran, Korean War and Vietnam War pilot, prisoner of war, and Medal of Honor and Air Force Cross recipient. As of 2016, he is the only person to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and Air Force Cross.

Day's actions from 26 August 1967 through 14 March 1973, were the last to earn a Medal of Honor prior to the end of U.S. involvement in the war on 30 April 1975, though some honorees (e.g. Leslie H. Sabo Jr., honored on 16 May 2012) were cited for their medals after Day's recognition on 4 March 1976.
