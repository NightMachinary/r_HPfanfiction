  the Grangers would have to be stupid beyond belief to think they can tell Hermione not to join the war and make it stick.

Why?

She is a teenage daughter and they are her caring parents who don't want to see her dead, because the shitty government couldn't handle the mad terrorist.

Let's remember that Hitler and Nazis weren't defeated by native Germans or German Jews. It was a coalition of other countries that did it.

So if Hermione truly wants to fight Riddle and his DEs, it's more reasonable to get out the country, finish education and join the force (army) that can really deal with him.

Of support that force with academic research as Albert Einstein did.

"I want to fight without any plan, training and support, because it's Right and Noble" -- the argument of a really immature child.
