I agree with your point that running away is a bit extreme.

However, in this case were Hermione to take that step she's gone until she turns 18. And once she hits that magic age she can go back to the muggle world with little concern.

As for schooling and living arrangements, Hogwarts is tuition free. That, and between the Weasleys taking her in (which they would) and Harry would likely loan/gift her a few galleons for her school books so she is set.

Again, I don't think it's the best solution, but it's not nearly as difficult an option as you make it out to be.
