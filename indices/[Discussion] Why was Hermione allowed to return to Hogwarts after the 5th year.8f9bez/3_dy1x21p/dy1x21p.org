Hermione's birthday is in September. Which means that she'd be 17 nineteen days after 6th year began. Even if her parents would be able to force her to stay at home after her fifth year, she'd be a legal adult after little more than 2 weeks from the beginning of term. After that date there's nothing they can do to stop her. Even assuming her parents knew the whole picture of what was happening at Hogwarts (unlikely), I'm pretty sure Hermione would have pointed out to her parents that forbidding her to continue her education would be quite futile in the end. It would just have delayed her a tiny bit, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore would have graciously allowed her to come back to Hogwarts come September 19th. Assuming he didn't send his Order wands blazing when she didn't show up at the Express (or before that if she was prevented from contacting her friends).

As someone pointed out, the Dursleys were pretty against Harry going to Hogwarts. That didn't seem to stop Harry in the slightest. I seriously doubt that Hermione's parents would have fared any better. You should keep in mind that to most wizards, even the most fairly headed of them like the Weasleys, muggles are curious and funny little creatures, not real people. They might not want to torture and enslave them, but to their eyes they're not equal. They're 'just muggles'.

Ps: also, Hermione used a timeturner in her third year. So she was an adult before the start of term, biologically if not legally. And despite what you might or might not think an being or not being an adult solely depends on reaching the age of majority in your legal system. It has nothing to do with maturity.
