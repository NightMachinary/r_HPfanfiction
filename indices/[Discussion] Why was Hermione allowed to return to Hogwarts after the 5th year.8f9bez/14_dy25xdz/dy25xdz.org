I think, like many posters above, that Hermione likely didn't tell her parents most, if any, of what happened at Hogwarts. Combine that with their lack of access to the Wizarding World during the year, makes it pretty likely that they had very little knowledge.

Also, in the early years especially, Hermione spent quite a lot of time with her parents on holidays. She goes home for Christmas, spends time with them in France, and even goes to Diagon Alley with them. I think something to remember is we see the story through Harry's eyes, not Hermione's. Therefore, for all we know, she could be spending tons of time with them that we don't see.
