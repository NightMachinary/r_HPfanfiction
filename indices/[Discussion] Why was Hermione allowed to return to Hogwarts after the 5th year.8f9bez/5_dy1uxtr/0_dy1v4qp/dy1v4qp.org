Sorry, I missed "almost".

She saw them a handful of times during a year. Refusal to spend time with them during holidays I see as neglecting the family.

  she's 16 years old child; She's a 16 years old witch.

What is the difference? How does her being a witch change her mentally and her maturing process?
