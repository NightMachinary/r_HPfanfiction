  1.The culture you're immersed in

The culture is represented by the school only.

  A 16 y.o. muggle is never gonna be handeld the same way as a 16 y.o. witch.

And?

Taking risks and tagging along the friends into returning to the school that is dangerous are two different things.

Yes, I can't see how a child, who is constantly lying to his/her parents about dangerous things, cab be seen as responsible.

  when you only play safe and don't take risks (which kids and tenagers are naturaly prone to take), you just don't improve your maturity.

Are you encouraging you kids to try drugs, have unsafe sex, broke the laws, getting into fights, be friends with criminals, etc.?
