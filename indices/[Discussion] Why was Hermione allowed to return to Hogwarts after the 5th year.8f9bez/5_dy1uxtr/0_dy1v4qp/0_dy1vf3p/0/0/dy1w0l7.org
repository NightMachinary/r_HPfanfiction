I'm not encouraging nothing. I'm telling you how it works. The thing about taking risks is that sometimes you fail, sometimes it hurts, sometimes it really was just a bad idea, but it's still the only way to grow.\\
It doesn't mean that anyone comes out on top. In the big world you'll find just as much opportunities to grow as opportunities to break you life.\\
But learing to differenciate between those sets of opportunities is called experience and can oly be obtained by confronting yourself to the world.\\
It isn't good or bad, it simply is.
