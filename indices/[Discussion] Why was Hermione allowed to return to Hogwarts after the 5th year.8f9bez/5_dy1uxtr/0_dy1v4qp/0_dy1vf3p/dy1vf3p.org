  What is the difference? How does her being a witch change her mentally and her maturing process?

There's a huge difference in the way you'll be treated depending on 1.The culture you're immersed in and 2.The law system that applies to you.\\
A 16 y.o. muggle is never gonna be handeld the same way as a 16 y.o. witch.\\
Secondly, maturity doesn't necesarilly correlates with age, and in fact, when you only play safe and don't take risks (which kids and tenagers are naturaly prone to take), you just don't improve your maturity.\\
You say elsewhere that Hermione is immature because she hides things to her parents, I say she's very mature because she had to face many obstacles and as a result, she grew.\\
It's part of what it means to be a child to avoid your parents vigilence.
