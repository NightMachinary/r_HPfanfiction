I don't think muggle parents have much of a say in the matter. The Dursleys certainly didn't.

  her friends a toxic and got her killed several times during the school years;

I don't remember Hermione getting killed.

#+begin_quote
  she is spending less and less time with her family even during holidays (is she being brainwashed?);
#+end_quote

Yeah. Either that or she's trying to take some independence, you know, like any regular teenager.

#+begin_quote
  she got her OWLs, so she won't lose her magic in case of leaving;
#+end_quote

What's that about losing your magic? Hagrid, who was expelled from hogwarts was still perfectly able to perform magic. Why would Hermione lose hers? The only place in canon where someone loses their magic is Tonks due to trauma (And only part of it). And it is never stated as permanent.

#+begin_quote
  she's 16 years old child;
#+end_quote

No. She's a 16 years old witch. She actually belongs to a different society where different laws are enforced.

The standard way to deal with the parents of muggleborn children is probably persuasion and if need be magic assisted persuasion.\\
Since any untrained wizard has the potential to turn an obscurus, I's be surprised if the ministry were comfortable letting untrained muggleborns roam free and unsupervised.
