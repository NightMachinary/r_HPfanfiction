Why do you think the Ministry gives any shit about muggles trying to keep their child out of Hogwarts?

Hermione probably feared that her parents would try and stop her from attending Hogwarts, the Ministry would obliviate or charm her parents into either letting her go or forgetting about her. She doesn't want this and thus prefers not to tell her parents.

In general, muggleborns seem to often lose contact with their families since the worlds are so closed to each other. Hermione is in a shit situation with this and took the one that she thought causes least problems for her family.
