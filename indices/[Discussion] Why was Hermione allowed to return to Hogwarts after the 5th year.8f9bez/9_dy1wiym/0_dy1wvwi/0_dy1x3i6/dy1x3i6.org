  Parents' approval is required for attending Hogwarts and for allowing visiting Hogshead, even if the parents are muggles.

Source? I don't recall any instance where muggles who are legal guardians under muggle law have any say in whether a magical child goes to Hogwarts. Harry is taken to Hogwarts against the explicit refusal of the Dursleys. Tom Riddle's orphanage was never even told what school he would go to, Mrs Cole was just bewitched by Dumbledore to stop asking questions.

  That is very reasonable taking into account that her life is under constant danger there.

And the Ministry most likely wouldn't take that into account. Between staying in danger with her parents obliviated about her and staying in danger with her parents not knowing about the danger she's in, I can understand why Hermione wouldn't want them to know about everything going on.
