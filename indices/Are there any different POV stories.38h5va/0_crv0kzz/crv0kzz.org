Welllll, there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series set in America a few years after the fall of Voldemort. Super interesting! Doesn't include anyone from the books (although they casually mention the Weasley joke shop and Hermione Granger's reforms). It's beautifully crafted and well-rounded.
