It's not plot/story that makes smut good so much as characterization. (Unless you're writing 1000 words of pwp. But that's not what we're talking about.)

The best I can do for you is throw out a few disparate threads of evidence I've come across---most of them coming from outside Harry Potter, unfortunately---which all point in the same direction.

First, you can go to Literotica and sort by top-rated stories. I'm yet to find a highly-rated story wherein sex precedes the characters becoming reasonably well-established. On the other hand, there are quite a few extremely highly-rated stories that start with telling readers to go elsewhere if they sought immediate satisfaction.

Second: I think we all accept that overpowering Harry such that he trivially overcomes opposition makes a story unsatisfying. But then come along stories in which Harry is comically OP and yet they work. See, for instance, [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]], which features the most OP Harry I've ever read, but it works because the story isn't driven by Harry needing to overcome adversity, but by character interaction. If you're willing to look in the Buffy fandom, please check out M McGregor. In particular, I'd look at [[https://m-mcgregor.livejournal.com/?skip=60&tag=fanfic:%20i%20am%20what%20i%20am][I Am What I Am]], because it has author commentary and is probably his best work, and [[http://xanderzone.osiris-web.com/stories/LoversReciprocation.html][Lover's Reciprocation]], because it's well-executed smut. In these stories, what little plot there is serves only to drive characterization, but it works because these stories aren't about the plot, they're about the characters---and, where applicable, the sex these characters have.

(If anyone knows of any fics that do what Lover's Reciprocation does in terms of character-building from the HP fandom, please *do* comment with recs.)

Third is Mr. Plinkett's discussion of lightsaber duels in his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORWPCCzSgu0][Phantom Menace review]]. If you're not invested in the characters, the flawless choreography becomes empty. This is probably applicable everywhere, but it's particularly important when you're writing smut. People want to have sex with people. Two automatons having the wildest, kinkiest sex imaginable is not remotely as interesting as two well-developed characters in missionary.

So, I don't think you need more than the barest amount of story to given characterization context. In fact, I think having a substantial plot takes away from the story (one of the shortcomings of Hope), since it's neither characterization nor sexy time, the two elements that are necessary and sufficient for good smut. But just because there shouldn't be much plot doesn't mean just write HP characters engaging in sexy activities. Harry Potter is a fundamentally asexual work, which broke broke my suspension of disbelief more than anything else. That's fine: children's stories are under no obligation to maintain an adolescent's or adult's suspension of disbelief, whereas they /are/ required to not contain sexual thoughts typical of an adolescent. But it also gives fanfic authors both the room and responsibility to expand upon the existing characters when writing smut.
