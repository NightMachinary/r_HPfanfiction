Even if I am in the mood for smut, I want at least decent plot plain and simple. I want the plot to drive the story forward, and to play at least as big a role as the smut/lemons do in the story itself.

*Note that this does not mean the plot has to be entirely realistic or of any particular style.

Also.... to be honest, even if I am not in the mood for smut, I would rather read a mature fic that included smut as a realistic part of the plot/story, than a T rated fic that danced around it.
