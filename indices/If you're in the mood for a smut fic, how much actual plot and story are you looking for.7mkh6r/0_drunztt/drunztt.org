I think that depends on how canon compliant the characters act, and how interesting the sex itself is.

Post-war Bill/Fleur smut doesn't really need a story can be 100% written porn because their relationship is well-established and doesn't need explanation.

A Harry/Bellatrix missionary scene in a random hotel doesn't really do anything because the sex is boring and the characters aren't explained.

A no-explanation, Hermione and Futa!Luna three-way with Cedric and Nearly Headless Nick as the narrator spying around the corner doesn't need a story because the sex itself is the interesting bit.
