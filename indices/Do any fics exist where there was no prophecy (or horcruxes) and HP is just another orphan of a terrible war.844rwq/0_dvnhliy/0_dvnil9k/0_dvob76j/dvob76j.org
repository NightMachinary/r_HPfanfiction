Not really. At least not until that fateful(ha, pun) halloween night, and since there's no prophecy, Voldy has no need to focus his attention onto the Potters, and instead focus on the war. Afterall why focus on three people, when he could focus on Dumbledore, Hogwarts, MOM, etc...

If I remember correctly, it was only, because of Harry, and Lily that Voldemort didn't win. He was that close. So chances are, any story where the prophecy doesn't exist is a story that has a high chance of Voldemort being the victor.

Thanks,
