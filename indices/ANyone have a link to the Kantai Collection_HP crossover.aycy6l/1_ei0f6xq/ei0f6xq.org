Another HP/KC story (albeit a BIG one) is Harry And The Shipgirls on SpaceBattles.

The story (primarily by Harry Leferts but with many others contributing) has grown so big that you can find thread one [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][just here]] and thread two [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][over here]].

Harry being the adopted big brother of an Abyssal (Elder) Princess is just awesome... especially when she shows up at Hogwarts just in time to deal with a certain troll...
