It's worth pointing out that Immortality isn't portrayed as evil in canon. Nicolas Flamel isn't thought of as evil because he created a philosopher's stone, in the same way that had Riddle accomplished that he would not have been considered evil for doing so. Riddle's evil comes from the actions he takes to achieve immortality, not the pursuit itself.
