Initially, I would say yes. BUT the overarching theme of the last book (among others) is that what makes Harry superior to Voldemort is that he accepts death whereas Voldemort cannot. Even in PS, Dumbledore says Flamel destroyed the stone so that he could 'go on to the next great adventure.' While immortaility is not stated as bad, Dumbledore repeatedly reiterates that accepting death is better and that the fear of death is something almost disdainful.
