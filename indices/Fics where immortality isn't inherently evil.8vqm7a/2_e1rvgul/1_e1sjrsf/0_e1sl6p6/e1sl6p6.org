That patronus was probably my favourite part about that fic too. I'd never thought about it before reading this fic but the way this fic played our pretty much single-handedly formed my opinion on the subject.

I'd never heard about Sailor Moon or Ranma either, didn't bother me at all. It actually added to the appeal because the new element made the world more wide and novel. It's also pretty self explanatory, though I suppose I wouldn't actually know if I missed anything of importance.

The whole death thing for me has been a bit of a topic of interest as well over the last couple of years. I notice it doesn't exactly bother me anymore. The reason I'm interested in the idea of a deathless humanity is the absolutely vast and beautiful potential it has for the growth of our species. I've also never quite been able to point out what about my existance is unique to me, and seeing as even the thoughts we express and exchange right now are not ours alone, but those of whoever reads them or has explored them in the past, and seeing as how many ideas or visions worth striving for have found their way to becoming reality throughout our history anyway, I'm not that scared about the notion of not me but somebody quite like me living in that future we're beginning to envision. Like I said, I'm more interested in seeing to it that these seeds of ideas we're planting right now have room to grow, I feel like that is something that our effort is well-spent on.
