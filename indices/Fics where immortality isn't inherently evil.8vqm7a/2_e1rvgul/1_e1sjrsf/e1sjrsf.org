I've previously read and deeply enjoyed HPMOR. I think most people brush off the whole Patronus thing as fanfiction nonsense, but for those that were into the philosophy, I think that was one of the most memorable and powerful parts of the book.

I loved the emotional and longing nature of HPMOR. I think it explores the plight of our species accurately. Immortality /is/ something to deeply and emotionally long for, as death is the greatest travesty in the history of humanity - the tone fits.

I've never heard of Sailor Moon or Ranma. Will that second fic still make sense?

On another note, as I become older, I'm starting to realize that we probably won't gain public support fast enough to make advances in anti-aging/synthetic representations of the brain in my lifetime. Just finished college, but the future is looking pretty grim. And I'm too lazy to get off my ass and go to a cryonics firm ;-/
