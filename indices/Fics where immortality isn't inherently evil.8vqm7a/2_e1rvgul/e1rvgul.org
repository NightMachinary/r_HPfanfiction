If you think about it, the uniting factor among all humans is that we like to solve problems, and problems are really just that which is on our mind and bothers us. Death is definitely a problem to be fixed, all it takes is a little change of perspective to no longer see it as a necessary part of our being.

The only fic which really did this is HPMOR. If you're into this, read that. It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it to the fullest I think, and I happen to be that kind of person, but not everyone is. Your OP makes me think you'd be able to enjoy it though, so I recommend giving it a try.

Other than that, the only other fic which contains the struggle for immortality that I've read is linkffn(The Girl Who Loved). It's an integral part of the story but not explored philosophically at all, which is honestly almost more refreshing than the deeply emotional and longing way in which HPMOR approaches it.
