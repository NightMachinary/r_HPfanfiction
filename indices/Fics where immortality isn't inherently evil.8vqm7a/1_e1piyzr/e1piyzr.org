linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is the obvious one. As to me, though, I fully agree with anti-deathism in real life, but I don't think it's altogether very applicable to the /HP/ world, since there's no real "death" in the Potterverse save a Dementor's Kiss. Not having your lifetime limited by dumb accidents or an arbitrary 200-hundred-years limited would be /nice/, but it's not as direly needed as it would be in the real world.
