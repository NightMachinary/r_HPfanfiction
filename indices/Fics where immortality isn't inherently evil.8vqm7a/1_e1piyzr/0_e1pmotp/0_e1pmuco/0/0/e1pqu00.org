I think that the key difference is between longevity and resurrection. Staving off death by old age is /relatively/ trivial, though the Philosopher's Stone is much more reliable and easy to use than Human Transfiguration and other types of Healing. Surviving the complete destruction of your body through violent causes, on the other hand, now that is something else entirely, something only the Horcruxes can offer.
