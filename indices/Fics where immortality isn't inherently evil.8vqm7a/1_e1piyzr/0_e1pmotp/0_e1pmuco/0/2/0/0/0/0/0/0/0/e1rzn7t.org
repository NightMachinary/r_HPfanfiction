yeah I definitely agree that that's how it probably works in the books. I just feel like there's an opening there for fleshing those concepts out in fanfiction.

I mean even in the Books none of what you're saying is ever explicitly stated, but it does work out that way. There's a nice symbolism there but it also makes me wish that there were more "realistic", for lack of a better word, ways for things to play out. That's one of the things I particularly love seeing explored in fanfiction.
