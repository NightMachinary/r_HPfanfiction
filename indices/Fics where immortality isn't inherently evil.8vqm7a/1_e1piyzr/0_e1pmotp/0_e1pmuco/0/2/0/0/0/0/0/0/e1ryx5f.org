The essence of self is the soul. You're right, its not exactly concrete, the consequences tend to be symbolic. E.g. creating a Horcrux, an attempt to permanently lock oneself to the plane of the living, will in death result in being permanently locked out of every other plane (no heaven, no hell, can't even send a ghost back). Or take Voldemort. His birth was caused by someone wanting to force another to love them, only to result in a child completely unable to love. Observed incidents for the law could, for example, have been issues with time travel resulting in horrifying consequences. We know time travel experiments were outlawed in 1899 in HP for this reason.
