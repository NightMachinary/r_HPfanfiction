I'm just saying, it's not concrete. What's the essence of self? what kind of consequences? how does whoever wrote that law know that, what did they observe to be able to come to that conclusion? Were they just inspired by magic to pen that down? I doubt it, so what's behind it?

It's stuff to explore.
