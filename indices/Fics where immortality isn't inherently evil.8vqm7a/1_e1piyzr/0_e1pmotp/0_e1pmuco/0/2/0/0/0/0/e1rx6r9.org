It's not really vague. In many ways, curtains laws in magic are partially moral in nature (notice how gross moral violations in magic allow for some of the most extreme effects, e.g. Killing Curse, Voldemort lacking all empathy due to being the product of faked love and rape, Horcruxes and the sacrificial protection). But if you wanted to make it science-y, you could say something like: The danger of a piece of magic is directly proportional to its danger index.
