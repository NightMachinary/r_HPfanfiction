It does sort of make me wonder what /other/ means of immortality may exist now.

On the one hand, the Philosophers Stone is the only mentioned method besides Horcruxes (and that seems to just be you make a new body for your anchored soul). On the other hand, Dumbledore seems to have not immediately realized how Voldemort may have survived. Perhaps this is an indication that Horcruxes are not the only feasible method to extend or even protect your life.

Doubtful though. I think Rowling may have realized that if you have a lot of different methods of immortality, it makes Voldemort and his Horcruxes look less /special/ in the wizarding world.
