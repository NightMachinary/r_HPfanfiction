Dumbledore not realizing how Voldemort survived doesn't indicate that there are other methods of immortality. Voldemort was a genius. Dumbledore probably thought he did something that hadn't been done before to become survive. This is exactly what Voldemort did, as I doubt anyone else managed or wanted to make more than one horcrux before.
