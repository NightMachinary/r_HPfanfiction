In-universe answer or the out of universe reason?

Because the out of universe answer is that it didn't exist, because IIRC the first time it pops up is in Goblet of Fire. Along with the way that he needed to escape in the first place for the narrative to work ;)

In universe, we need to come up with a reason - even without a stunning spell, they could have used a body bind (eg, petrificus totalus). I think the best we can do is chalk it up to all of them not thinking straight, really - it's a chaotic, stressful situation where none were at their best. We're not going to get anything more reasonable than that in universe.
