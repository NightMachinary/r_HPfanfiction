Yeah, pretty sure that 'rule' was put as an answer to why they don't just accio Pettigrew when he ran for it, the right answer being Rowling hadn't invented that spell yet and didn't think it through. On the other hand you have Fantastic Beasts casually accioing magical creatures, so who the fuck knows at this point.
