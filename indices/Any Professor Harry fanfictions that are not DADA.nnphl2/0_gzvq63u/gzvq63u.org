Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer has a powerful older harry get dumped into an alternate universe just prior to 1st year. He ends up taking over transfiguration. I do enjoy it, but there is also a fair amount of dark backstory in it, so just a warning. linkffn(8175132)

The Archeologist by Racke (which was heavily inspired by Jamie Evans) has an experienced cursebreaker Harry end up back in time in an alternate universe, and ends up taking over the History professor position. This one is a bit hit or miss for some people, because stylistically the author leans a bit heavily on telling over showing, but I still enjoyed it. linkffn(13318951)
