Self promo here: linkffn(13582160) is a story that follows Regulus, an OC, and the Marauders from Regulus's sixth year through the end of 1979. It's a bit more romance/love-triangle oriented right now, but we're starting to get into more of the First Wizarding War shortly, ultimately exploring Regulus's reasons for doing what he did.
