Being trans certainly provides enough conflict (vs self, vs society, vs nature) to base a story off of, and that's before considering the fact that HP takes place in the early 90's which increases those factors signicantly. Beyond that, it's still a long form HP fanfic, so obviously there's going to be more to the plot than just Harry being trans. I wouldn't be 25,000 words into the fic and just getting started if that wasn't the case.
