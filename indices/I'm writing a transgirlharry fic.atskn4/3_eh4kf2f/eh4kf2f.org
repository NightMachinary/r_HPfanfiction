I gave it a skim and can only really echo what others have said here.

You need a plot. "Harry is trans" isn't a plot. It's a character attribute. A related plot could be "Harry fights for LGBTQ+ equality in Magical Britain." That would delve more into politics and, depending on where the focus exactly lies, could appeal to a wide audience. It would also likely take place post-Hogwarts, not before first year.

An extended rehash of canon is not appealing to me, and I doubt it is to many others. Yes, it may be a little different, but it is only a /little/ different.

I guess you don't really /need/ a plot if this is going to be primarily romance. However, if this is going to be primarily romance, do you need to start before first year? Start the story with the divergence from canon.
