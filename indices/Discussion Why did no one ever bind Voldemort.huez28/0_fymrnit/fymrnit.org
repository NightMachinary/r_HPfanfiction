The Goblet of Fire contract doesn't seem to be binding in that it will enforce physical consequences but rather that three countries and schools entered into a legal contract that cannot be changed. Note how Crouch and Bagman refer to the "rules". Now if you could get Voldemort to sign a jinxed parchment, that'd be another thing.
