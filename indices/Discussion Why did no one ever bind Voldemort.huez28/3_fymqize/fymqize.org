Yeah, Harry being forced to compete and then no one using the apparent ability to enter people into contracts without their knowledge or consent is a huge plot hole.

All I can think is, if Harry hadn't competed, whatever consequences of not competing must be visited on Barty instead because he's the one who actually put the name in.
