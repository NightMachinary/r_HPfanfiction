Not exactly true as in Canon harry was bound to a magical contract for a tournament he never entered. So for Voldemort could one of his old school assignments be used to bind him? I would say yes as that's how Harry got bound.

There's a short story called Magical Contracts by Kalen Darkmoon that ran with a similar concept.
