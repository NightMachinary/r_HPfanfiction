We have no idea if Hogwarts retains every assignment for every class. Considering with magic that they could all be placed in a magical trunk and then the trunk shrunk to the size of a matchbook it is possible that all assignments are retained.

The reason it doesn't happen IRL is because we don't really have the storage for that much paper. Of course with digital tests/assignments and the cheap cost of storage media we are now seeing things kept much longer.

It took a confundus charm and a torn signature from a homework assignment for harry to be bound in a magical contract. So the same thing but with a torn signature from one of tom's old assignments might work.
