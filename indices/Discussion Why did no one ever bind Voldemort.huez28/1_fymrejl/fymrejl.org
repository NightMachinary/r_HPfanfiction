While I don't remember if this is actually canon, a common fanon detail is that the Goblet requires the signature of the person entering the tournament, and Crouch gets this from one of Harry's assignments. Maybe a wanted criminal would be more careful with their signature if they knew magic like that was possible. Or maybe the Goblet only works for the Triwizard Tournament, not magical contracts in general, and the Goblet can magically tell whether it's being used for an actual Tournament or something else.
