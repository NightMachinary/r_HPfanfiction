I'd say very important. At 11, a child is proclaimed before their parents, peers, and teachers alike to have certain character traits and values. The child then spends most of their time surrounded by people who have been similarly proclaimed to have these same character traits, and, furthermore, may in fact have them. This goes on for 7 years, with only short 2-month breaks for the summer. I can't see anyone graduating without either adopting these traits and values or being broken by them.
