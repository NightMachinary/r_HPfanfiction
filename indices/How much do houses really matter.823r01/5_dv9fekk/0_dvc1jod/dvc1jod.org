I'm not so sure about that. We see Harry's perspective in the stories, so everything is filled with danger and adventure, but for most of the students, Hogwarts isn't nearly the character-defining trial grounds that it is for Harry. The vast majority of them would probably be as affected by their time there as they would at any boarding school.

As for the houses themselves, we don't really see them stressing the "core house values" outside of the sorting ceremony. Aside from maybe Slytherin, where political and social standing seem to be more prevalent issues due to familial pressure, students aren't characterized by those traits very often. We see a lot of house expectations emphasized in fanfiction, but not so much in canon.
