The effect of other people's expectations on people's behaviour has been studied pretty extensively, and my reading of it is that we are influenced far more easily than we'd like to think. Often the effect is quite strong even when the expectation isn't verbalised explicitly. So, people don't talk about their house values, of course, but that doesn't mean they aren't affected.

Harry's unique adventure is a double-edged sword in this case: sure, he is probably more affected by his Gryffindorness than others; but we also wouldn't know if they were affected.
