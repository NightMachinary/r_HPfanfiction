From my experience with kids, the younger years would take it very seriously, but as students get older the boundaries begin to merge and eventually it is seen as a way to help with timetabling. It would also be used as small talk in later life - "What house were you in? Oh, lovely! Did you know so and so? I always loved the sound of your common room, blah blah blah."
