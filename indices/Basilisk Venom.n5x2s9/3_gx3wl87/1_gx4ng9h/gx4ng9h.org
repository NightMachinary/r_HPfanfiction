Harry's body is not Harry, Harry's body is Harry/Voldemort. It's implied the AK works by killing the soul, as there is no physical cause of death. But what happens if an AK hits a body/object that has two souls? Let's assume it kills BOTH souls. Well, alright. But Harry's soul has Lily's sacrifice protection, and is the Master of Death, AND Voldemort was using a wand against its own master to boot. So there are at least 2 possible protections and 2 weakening effects here:

1) Lily's sacrifice protection

2) Master of death protection

3) AK power dilution as it is hitting a body with 2 souls

4) AK power dilution as it is cast by a wand against its own master

We don't know what is the factor or combination of factors that ultimately saved Harry's soul. We also don't know what would have happened if he had somehow been given a Dementor's Kiss while protecting his soul - could it have sucked out /just/ Voldemort's Horcrux? Interesting questions...
