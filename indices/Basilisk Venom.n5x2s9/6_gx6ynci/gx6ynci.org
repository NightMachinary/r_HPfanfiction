According to DH the container has to be damaged beyond repair (in the case of a living container that would mean dying). Also from DH, the Horcruxes are opposite to souls. While a soul will continue to live no matter how damaged the body is, a Horcrux will cease to exist when its container is no longer functional.

JK's explanation was that since Harry didn't die due to the basilisk venom, the Horcrux remained unaffected, while he died temporarily in DH. Of course it's a convoluted situation but it stays consistent with the story. The basilisk venom doesn't destroys the piece of soul but it typically damages whatever it impregnates beyond repair if Phoenix tears are not applied immediately and as a result, the piece of soul is destroyed.

That's the best somewhat canonical explanation we have.
