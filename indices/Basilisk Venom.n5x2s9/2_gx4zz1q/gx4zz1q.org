What will follow is a headcanon so I may be wrong. But the way I understood it, there are a lot of misconceptions concerning the way Basilisk Venom (or Fyendfire for that matter) work.

The Basilisk Venom is not some kind of poison that directly attack the Horcrux. The Venom is just some kind of magical super acid that can destroy anything that is put inside, regardless of the magical protections that may have been put on the item. The Horcrux is then destroyed because an Horcrux is incapable to "survive" without its vessel.

In the case of Harry, the Horcrux was not destroyed because the vessel was not destroyed. Harry didn't die, and didn't even lose consciousness before Fawkes healed him. So, the Horcrux was not destroyed because its vessel (Harry) was not irremediably destroyed.
