Let me add some:

Unsung Hero: Depressing as all hell, but worth the read

A Cadmean Victory: Again, it can get depressing but /oh so good/

Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance: Long and still unfinished, but definitely one of the best Slytherin!Harry's out there.

Hogwarts Battle School: It makes you lose all hope. It's so good, and discontinued, that you wonder how you will enjoy something after that.

I have more, but I think those four are fine additions
