Northumbrian is also the master of unfinished works:

- “James and Me” linkao3(8402590) ... we still wait for the conclusion and explanation of the story which started with “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” and continues in this story.
- “MIT: Strange Place” linkao3(9117694) ... the last story of MIT team with the homicidal house-elf of the Lestrange family.
- “Friends and Foes” linkao3(3068435) ... again, the conclusion of the larger multi-volume story started with “Hunters and Prey”, “Research and Development”, and concludes here. Unfortunately, although this is one of the start of the story which could be one of the best of his, it is just multiple beginning of the multiple subplots (the detective story itself, story of Bobbie Beadle, story of Dudley's birthday party), none of which leads anywhere.
- “Aurors and Schoolgirls” linkao3(6057483) ... Hermione & Ginny at Hogwarts for their last year, Harry & Ron dealing with their Auror trainings.
- “MLT: Muggle Liaison Team” linkffn(7071175) ... the first story in the cycle, but unfortunately never finished

And there is many times mentioned (but never even started) story how Lavender, Bobbie, and Camelia dispatched vampire in Whitby.

It is such pity, that these will probably never be finished as Northumbrian seems to left the community.
