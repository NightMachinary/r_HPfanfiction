... I had a cat named KilKenny Starfighter, after the beer and the main chatacter of a Swedish satirical Sci-Fi series respectively (not even joking, we called him Kenny for short though, which makes the whole thing even more stupid). So I'd say Filch's more sane than I am with the naming conventions.
