Okay, I don't know if I should be saying this, as you might not be cleared for it, but, seeing as it will be hard to trace this information back to the source...

Mrs. Norris is really a high-level agent sent by the International Confederation of Wizards to watch over Argus Filch. Filch isn't really Filch. In particular, he doesn't remember that he's actually Gellert Grindelwald.

After his defeat by Dumbledore, Grindelwald was repeatedly obliviated and confounded to convince him of the reality of the Filch persona. Just convincing him that he's a squib and unable to perform magic took over six months of careful alterations performed by experts in Geneva. The entire thing took years to do.

Mrs. Norris is in fact a sentient wizard-dragon cat animagus. She was sent to both guard Grindelfilch and to kill him should he ever show any signs of remembering his true identity.

The Grindelwald imprisoned at Nurmengard? He's just a decoy, a poor muggle actor who was convinced to take on the role of Grindelwald in exchange for his family, including his six children, all of whom were afflicted with terrible terminal illnesses, being well looked after.

Why did /they/ go through all this effort? Well you see, Dumbledore was in love with Grindelwald, but Grindelwald, who was not sexually attracted to Dumbledore at all, wanted nothing to do with him. Even so, Dumbledore pined away for him for years, and when it became obvious that only he could stop Grindelwald's conquest of Europe, he still couldn't be convinced by the ICW and UK Ministry of Magic to go out and fight him without a deal where Grindelwald would still be available to him on an ongoing basis for... well, certain sexual practices just shouldn't be discussed on a non-NSFW subreddit. Suffice it to say, though, you probably don't want to know.

Grindelfilch, poor thing, doesn't even remember what happens after their weekly assignations.

And yes, I agree, this is very, very awful of Dumbledore. Kind of changes your whole view of his character, doesn't it?
