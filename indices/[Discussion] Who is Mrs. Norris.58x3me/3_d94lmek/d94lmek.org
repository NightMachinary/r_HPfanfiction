So, there are two straight up squibs we know of in the series: Mrs. Figg and Filch. Both are obsessed with cats (Figg with quantity, Filch with specificity). COINCIDENCE? Probably, but that's boring and therefore I shall assume there is a connection.

I believe it is canon that Mrs. Figg's cats are part kneazles, and therefore more intelligent than the average cat. Mrs. Norris is clearly far more intelligent than a normal/muggle cat (and seems to be more intelligent than any of Figg's hybrids), and is therefore presumably more than half-kneazle. However, this explanation is boring, and therefore I'm ignoring it.

Squibs don't actually lack magic. However, their magic can ONLY manifest by increasing the intelligence of felines. This is why Filch is truly angered at the thought of a dead Mrs. Norris, his only true magic has been robbed from him. This also explains why Mrs. Norris is so much smarter than Figg's cats. Filch's magic is focused on only one feline, while Figg's is spread apart into a network of cats.

This information is kept classified by the Department of Mysteries, who is trying to recruit all Squibs to create a Spying Network called /Operation: Squibcat/ to further their plans, which uses the Rotfang Conspiracy as a front for the true power in the Department of Mysteries: The Knights of Walpurgis. It's not Love in the locked room, but SQUIBCAT CONTROL CENTER (SCC).

So then, why is Crookshanks so damn intelligent? Because she isn't Hermione's cat, but a Squib's planted spy as part of Operation: Squibcat to keep an eye on The Boy Who Lived, Dumbledore /and/ Argus Filch (whom many in SCC are beginning to mistakenly suspect is a double agent for the International Confederation of Warlocks after not getting any intelligence from unit mrsNORris, when in reality Filch was just embarrassed that he let his cat get petrified).

Beware a Squib with cats if ye have a secret to keep.
