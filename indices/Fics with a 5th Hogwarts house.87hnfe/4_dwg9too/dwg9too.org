[[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2xd4on/eu_for_generations_hogwarts_students_have_been/coz3r8q/][House Ambaret]] by [[/u/luna_lovewell]] is really good. It's pretty much an origanal story set at Hogwarts, where the OC main character is sorted into the newly rediscovered House Amberet.

You do have to subscribe to Luna's Patreon to read the second half onwards though.
