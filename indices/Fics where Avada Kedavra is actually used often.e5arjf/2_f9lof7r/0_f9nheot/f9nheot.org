They're actually one of the ways to destroy horcruxes. One of the common misconceptions about horcruxes is that they're inherently indestructible, they're not. Rather creators usually place enchantments to prevent them from most means of destruction. Killing curses disable/destroy horcruxes. And I don't see why not, you /can/ defend against killing curses and I think it removes from the story when characters do not use everything to their advantage.
