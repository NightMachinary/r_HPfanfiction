I'm not sure what you are arguing against here. From my arguments on this post, I have emphatically declared they are /excellent/ at killing people and go through magical shields, adding excellent variety to one's arsenal. However, I hardly think they're that strong considering you can prevent the spell from hitting you like you can many spells through methods such as dodging. Basically they're good so they should be used in some stories, but they're not guaranteed kills. After all, Voldemort could not kill Dumbledore with his rapid use of the killing curse.
