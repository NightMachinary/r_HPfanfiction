It's the murder, not the Killing Curse specifically, that splits your soul. Voldemort's first Horcrux was made using the basilisk's kill on Myrtle. The Killing Curse was made to be a lethal dueling spell, because the alternatives you mentioned were too messy and hard to explain to Muggles. The reason it's Unforgivable is because there are nonlethal ways that are just as easy to use if you need to defend yourself, and using the Killing Curse makes it clear that you just aren't bothering to try.

But most importantly, this is a Request post, not a Discussion one.
