While I agree that the killing curse should be used more often, especially considering their ability to destroy horcruxes without chasing down basilisk venom, I think the cruciatus requires someone to take pleasure from it (wiki) unliked the killing curse. I agree that it would be an excellent incapacitating spell but it seems like it is channeled (I could be wrong) which would leave you open to retaliation unlike the killing curse which is fire and forget.
