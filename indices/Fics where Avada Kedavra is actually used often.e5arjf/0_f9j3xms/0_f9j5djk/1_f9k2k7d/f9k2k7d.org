I always found this whole point of the Killing Curse ridiculous what's the point of mutilating yourself repeatidly, for an Instant and unshieldable move. That seems like an counter balance made to stop an over-use of overpowered spell, It's basically J. K. Rowling calling out the good guys "don't use it or you will as good as the bad guys" meaning becoming monsters. If it was this detrimental, Why dead eathers|KoW and Voldemort didn't use other way to kill their enemies, like for exemple Transfiguring objects into letal (spikes,swords,Daggers) ones and just shooting them at their target during a fight or large scale battle, you didn't need the Killing Curse to destroy your enemies, Bombarda maxima, Incendio, or just a good chunk of consecutive transfiguration spells would do the job, especially again adversary who don't use "Lethal" spells.

Noting (from a dark side point of view) that an instant peacefull death doesn't seems like a way to strike fear into your enemies, when you could do so much more with Magic i.e things like Crucio, Mind attacks, blood magic etc..
