I agree that there are certainly many ways to kill someone with magic. However, I think you are discounting many of the advantages of having the killing curse in your repertoire. It cannot be blocked my magical shields unlike physical objects and many other spells (protego was able to physically separate two people). I also think you are mildly confusing canon and fanfiction as I do not believe blood magic was used offensively in the books (no source so I could be wrong). It does not actually mutilate the caster, and I think it would be an effective spell. Imagine casting an explosive spell to force a magical shield, followed by a killing curse to go through the shield.
