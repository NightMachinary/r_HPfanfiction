I agree with killing being the thing to rip the soul. It seems with some intent and a hefty power requirement "t/he Killing Curse is a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed"/, it can be casted. It's why I don't understand why it's never utilized. Even in stories where Harry is a burgeoning dark lord does he rarely cast the Killing Curse.
