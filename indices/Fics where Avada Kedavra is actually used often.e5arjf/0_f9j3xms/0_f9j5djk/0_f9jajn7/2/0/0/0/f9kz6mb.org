That's fair, but do you know of any fics where it used often? And wouldn't an instant death be favorable in combat? Something like getting shot is not always very instant when it comes to threat removal. People have been shot many times and kept on posing a threat to law enforcement. I think it is a very effective spell and I would like to see it used in some fics.
