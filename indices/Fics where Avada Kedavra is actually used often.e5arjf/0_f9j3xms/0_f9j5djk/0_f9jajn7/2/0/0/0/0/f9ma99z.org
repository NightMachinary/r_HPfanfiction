I just remembered this one. There was another one that was longer. I remember the killing curse was unblockable. Like really unblockable- Bill and Harry were raiding a house, looking for horcruxes and Bill got killed by a killing curse through a door. Not even doors or walls could stop it. Unfortunately, I don't remember what it was called and can't seem to find it.
