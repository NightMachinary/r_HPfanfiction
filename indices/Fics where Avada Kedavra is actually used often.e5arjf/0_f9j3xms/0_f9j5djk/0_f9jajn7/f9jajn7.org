  The killing curse, in particular, must tear your soul and require hatred to cast.

"You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation."

It's the act of murder, probably of an innocent, that rips the soul, which can be achieved with a number of spells. And while murder and killing are often one in the same, we are shown that's not always the case. I doubt Harry's soul would take a beating if he hit Bella with one successfully.

Also, where does the hatred thing come from? All Bella says is "you need to mean it" and "righteous anger isn't enough." I would think that means you need to want to cause me pain/want me dead and the latter isn't a bad thing when speaking of Death Eaters.
