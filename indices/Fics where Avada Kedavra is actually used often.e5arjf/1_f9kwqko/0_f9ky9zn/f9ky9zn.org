We know that is it entirely possible to use it silently - Bellatrix Lestrange killing a fox/Voldemort in his duel with Dumbledore. The main drawback appears to be concentration and power requirements (evidenced by my quote from fake moody) as Rowle tossed them around in the attack on hogwarts. Interestingly enough though, he was defeated rather quickly by Harry, Hermione, and Ron in the cafe. What other faster ways are there? Fiendfyre which seems to travel more slowly and is hard to control? A lot of diffindos which cut Ron's jeans? Perhaps the sectumsempra which can be healed and takes time to die from? Maybe some explosive spell? But wouldn't those be blockable with magical means unlike the killing curse? And even if it was hard to pull off, surely there are some fics where the killing curse is utilized.
