Because there are other ways you can kill someone that are faster or easier in a fight. A-Va-Da Ke-Dav-Ra is six syllables and takes longer to cast than other deadly curses. It's also supposed to be difficult to cast and require a build up of negative emotions making it even more difficult and time consuming. For a powerful dark lord like Voldemort he can cast the curse easily and repeatedly without effort so it is effective for him. Weaker and less experienced death eaters would find other curses easier. Also the fact that the killing curse is instant and the more powerful death eaters are insane like Bellatrix Lestrange and would prefer their victims to die a horrible and painful death.
