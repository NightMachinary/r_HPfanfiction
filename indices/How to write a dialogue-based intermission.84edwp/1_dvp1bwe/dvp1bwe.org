I agree with TE7's comment of doing it with prose. Don't just leave the dialogue, that sounds quite boring and bland. There is way more that you can say other than "Harry laid in bed and stared at the wall". Describe Harry's feelings, what he is thinking, doing with his hands or expressions, reactions, how the other voice sounds , etc. Maybe look at some examples where the main character is speaking someone in their head.

One fic I like that does this well is linkffn(Harry potter and the accidental Horcrux). There are whole sections where it's just Harry talking to Tom Riddle in his head and yet none of it is boring because it's not just dialogue between the two of them.
