I mean for the most part its gonna be prose but i was thinking of having an 'intermission' between Harry in Diagon Alley (thats when the voice is awakened) and when he goes to Kings Cross? And that'd just be like, bits of conversation between the two of them that characterize their developing dynamic, without me having to write full scenes?
