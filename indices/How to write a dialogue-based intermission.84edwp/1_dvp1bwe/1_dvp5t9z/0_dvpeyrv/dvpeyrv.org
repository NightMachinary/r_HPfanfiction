When I say 'I'd use prose' I don't mean 'write a normal scene' I mean I'd literally use prose, and not dialogue, to hold the conversations.

IE: Rather than: "Why would I want to roll around in a bathtub filled with asparagus?" Harry asked the voice in his head.

Do something like: Roll around in a bathtub filled with asparagus? That seemed like an odd thought. Why would anyone ever possibly want to do that?

Hey, you never know, don't knock it till you try it.

Nope. Too strange. Not going to try that.

Back to non-examples now:

I'm of the opinion that dialogue, as a whole, should only be used specifically for the spoken word. So unless Harry is literally saying these things, I wouldn't use dialogue. If Harry is speaking aloud to nothing like a crazy person, then I would use dialogue.

But given that I doubt the voice inside his head is actually emitting a sound to the rest of the world, I then would not use dialogue for it's responses, but rather write them as prose like I did above.

Also, if Harry is aware of said entity in his head then I would do something to separate what is Harry from what is not Harry. Likely I would just italicize what is not Harry.

If Harry is not aware of it I would prod the reader in that direction with subtle shifts in tone whenever it's not specifically Harry's thoughts and try to make the narration seem a little schizophrenic to indicate something was going on.

I actually do a lot of this in the latter chapters of Limpieza De Sangre. There are quite a few scenes when the actual 'prose' of the scene is a conversation happening in Harry's head. The opening scene of chapter 28 is probably the most 'overt' example of this.

But at this point Harry is not aware that there is a voice inside his head, as it were. So he treats it as his own thoughts, more or less. And since the narrative perspective is third person focused on Harry, I don't do much more than provide a few hints here and there of what's actually going on. It's enough, I think, that if Harry were to sit and think about it he'd be able to figure it out. But given that it has melded with his thoughts by being a very slow process that occurs throughout the vast majority of the story, he isn't cognitively aware that it is happening.
