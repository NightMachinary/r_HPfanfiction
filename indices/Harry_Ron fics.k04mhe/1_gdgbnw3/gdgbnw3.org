Someone commented with a really nice fic to a prompt on this post.

A bit too tropey for my taste, but others might enjoy it: linkao3(26163478)

Oneshot: linkffn(11508951)

Prelude and Fugue is a Groundhog Day style fic. It's also absolutely adorable: linkao3(562941)

Will add more if I can find them.
