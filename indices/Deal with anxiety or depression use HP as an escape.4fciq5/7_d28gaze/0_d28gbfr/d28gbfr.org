This was not sustainable. At first, whenever real life reared up I would buckled down by devoting more time to fanfiction. By December, I was probably reading eighteen to twenty hours a day. That left maybe five hours for sleep with some change for making food. In an average day, I might wake up at eight, read for sixteen to eighteen hours, fall asleep at two the next, wake up at four, read for a couple more hours, fall back asleep at six, and start again at eight.

One day, as I drove to the department to 'fulfill' my other TA responsibilities, I broke. I realized that there would be no escape; that there was little chance of me living through January.

For the first time in months, my unyielding focus on fanfiction fell away at time and was replace by thoughts of suicide. Turns out even Harry Potter couldn't help me escape that.

I can't tell you why I am certain that I would have killed myself. In the end, I never made an attempt. The real world finally broke through. It broke through in the form of a call a few days before Christmas from my brother. The brother whose broken leg originally led me to Harry Potter and whose companionship the previous summer had momentarily stalled my descent.

He had been diagnosed with Leukemia. I didn't believe him at first; I made him send me a picture of the bag of blood on his IV. And as quickly as the certainty of my impending suicide hit me, it went away. I was not better. I merely decided not to attempt suicide while my brother was in the hospital.

My parents ordered me home for Christmas. I'm sure that if had returned under normal conditions they would have immediately noticed that I was a mess but these were not normal conditions.

I don't remember much of the next month. I spent time with my brother in hospital room. I saw a couple of friends. I ended up borrowing another book from my brother: ASOIAF.

One distinct memory that I do remember is the last time I visited him in the hospital. I walked out of his room without saying goodbye, which is something I would normally do. I stopped in the lobby to wonder if I really wanted to leave without a goodbye. I don't remember what I decided.

I 'returned' to school at the end of January. Nothing real had changed; I still read Harry Potter fanfiction for sixteen to eighteen hours a day. I decided to hold off on any suicide attempts. Of course all bets were off when my brother's status resolved.

My brother successfully underwent a bone marrow transplant. After about two months in the hospital, he was released. Over the next couple months he appeared to progress; he travelled a little bit and seemed reasonably upbeat. Then, at the beginning of May, he crashed. Graft versus host disease. When I returned, he was already in a coma. He was tubes and machines and awful, flaky, weak-looking skin.

He never woke up. There a couple of weeks in which his condition might have been said to make some slight improvement, which, per my understanding of Doctor-speak, essentially meant that he was dead yet. My parents hoped those improvements were real. But he never woke up.

I had left in the interim. Staring at the tubes and listening to much parents was too much work. I came back for his funeral. His body looked constructed from paper mache. And I promised him or me or something that I would try. That I wouldn't give up.

I did. I weaned myself of off fanfiction. Somehow I was able to return to school. I got back into shape. A year later, I found an advisor.

Some times were worse than others. Bad days, bad weeks, and maybe a bad month. Times when I felt myself sinking again. Strangely, the worst part of the bad weeks are the highs. The lows certainly suck but the highs are worse. Like a roller coaster, it is during the highs that you see where your headed.

During those times I often wished it had been me. Or thought that maybe, if I had pulled the trigger early on in his illness some small thing would change and he would live. I am not stupid; I know I would have changed nothing. But I also know that the world would have been a better place if it had been me. Not in some grand global sense, I am not so egotistical. But the little corner of the world occupied by our family and friends would be better. He was a better son, a better friend, and a better brother than I ever could be.

I pushed through. Until about two months ago. Two months ago I finally hit the real warning sign: I started reading Harry Potter fanfiction again. Like five years ago. This last month, I have gotten back to reading eight or ten hours a day. I had planned on defending my thesis in July but every day when I sit down and try to write I feel awful. And fanfiction is just a click away to dull that pain.

This time is worse because I know where I'll end up (though I must my story selection has improved). The first time I focused on the good feeling. Now I can't help but recognize all the feelings and thoughts being pushed down.

I struggled against the pull a little more this time. And I hold hope that writing this will help. Maybe after finally saying things that I needed to say ages ago, even to internet strangers such as yourselves, my head will clear enough that I can pull myself through. Or maybe not. I kind of wish I was an indy!Harry that so many people write. Not because of his overpowered badassery but because they always seem to know the future, which sounds fantastic. The benefit of being the author's in-universe avatar I suppose.

I suppose I should actually answer your question. I have used Harry Potter fanfiction as an escape from depression and anxiety. I have realized it can also be a drug. And I suppose that by providing me a place I feel comfortable enough sharing, Harry Potter fanfiction can provide me a real escape.
