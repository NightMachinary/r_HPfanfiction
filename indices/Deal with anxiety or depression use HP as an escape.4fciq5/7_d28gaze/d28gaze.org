Yes I have. This is my story. Never has it been told anywhere near in full and right now I need to write. It is therefore much longer than strictly necessary to answer your question, for which I apologize; however, all stories need be begun.

My story begins, and hopefully ends, with escape. I was one of those exceptionally lucky kids who first experienced Harry's story when they were his age. I turned twelve a couple of months before the summer of 1999, which is the summer that my younger brother, idiot that he was, proceeded to break his leg falling off of a fence. My mother was already with a broken her leg from earlier that spring and so, in an attempt to free my father from the complications inherent to a pre-teen, I was bundled off on a vacation with my aunt and uncle. In one of those curious coincidences inevitable in chaotic environments, a book, originally intended as a gift to my brother for breaking his leg, ended up amongst our suitcases.

That book quickly found its way into my hands whereafter I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone nine times in a row. That is, as soon as the last page was finished I began anew on the first. Perhaps the anticipation of a Hogwarts letter is more magical; the hope that maybe magic does exist. But I didn't need hope, an owl, or a letter for I already was at Hogwarts. I adventured with Ron and learned with Hermione. Though my childhood did not resembled Harry's in the least, in that moment, with attention focused on my brother, I felt completely isolated. And like Harry, Hogwarts was my escape.

At the time I lacked the awareness, but looking back each book renewed that sense of escape. My interest piqued, I quite quickly found and consumed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. A year later, I unintentionally borrowed my relatives newly purchased copy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire; later I learned that it hadn't been quite intended for being lent so quickly. My very first family-less travel happened to set off mere hours after the release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix; I barely managed to read the first two chapters and on that trip I decided to listen to those two chapters, and only those chapters, over and over again. In an attempt to savor Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I promise to limit myself to a couple of chapters per day, which lasted only as long as the time I took to promise.

Throughout this, despite my tremendous enjoyment of the Harry Potter series, I never was involved in what would become the stereotypical social activities of Harry Potter fanatics. I never attended a book release party nor, later on, a film release. I spent little time in discussions about characters, future plot lines or magical theories. In fact, from perspectives external to that of my immediate family members there likely would be little evidence of Harry Potter's significance to me. For the beginning, Harry Potter was always an escape; it never connected me to the community.

After Deathly Hallows, I never anticipated that I could ever again truly escape with Harry. And then, five years ago, just before bed, I re-found him. He came in the form of a link to HPMOR posted by a random redditor on a random reddit thread. That year was my first year in graduate school and I was struggling a bit with all that entails. And here came Harry Potter, familiar and willing, to be my rescuer. I finished the first eighty or so chapters of HPMOR over a couple of days (and interestingly have never gone back). I found and read other stories but initially I retained a focus on school. But, as we all know, there is no end to fanfiction; there are always other stories. And similar to Deathly Hallows, I couldn't stop. Harry Potter fanfiction quite quickly became more than my escape from life; it became my life.

I started to read until two or three or four in the morning. Quite quickly my thoughts were totally focused on what had happened in my current story, when I could read again, or where I would find the next one. School fell by the wayside. I read eight to ten to twelve hours a day. I jumped from Snape's Chronicles to Backwards with a Purpose, from Timely Errors to Prince of a Dark Kingdom, from A Stranger in an Unholy Land to Promises Unbroken and on and on. I knew then that my behavior could get me into trouble but I managed passing grades in my classes. Fortunately, in a sense beyond the obvious, I had hope for some respite over the upcoming summer.

For my brother, whose broken leg first revealed Harry Potter to me, and I made plans to spend that summer traveling Europe. We were able to visit, however briefly, a number of beautiful and fascinating cities. From Dublin to Tangier and Venice to Oslo, we drank, explored, and had a couple of adventures. As we travelled, I managed to limit my consumption of Harry Potter fanfiction to a couple of hours here and there. I hoped that my experiences would stop the fanfiction binges.

When I returned, I picked up right where I had left my consumption of fanfiction. Initially, I attended my classes but, with my new apartment further from my department than the old, that quickly stopped. By the halfway point of the semester, only food, beer, and the single hour of problem sessions on Thursday nights required to "fulfill" my TA contract could pull me away from my apartment and my attention, however briefly, away from my phone.

Instead, I read fanfiction all day. What, in the previous semester, I spent eight to twelve hours of my day on became twelve to sixteen. As we are all aware, not enough good stories exist to fill all those hours. So, and this is no exaggeration, I literally trawled fanfiction.net. I picked a character, Lily was first, and went through the list of stories for which they were the chosen characters page by page. After finding a readable story, I would spiderweb into that author's other stories and onto their own favorite stories and authors. Sometimes I was led to tumblr or another fanfiction site and sometimes I found nothing. After I exhausted those strand, I would return to my previous spot on the list.

I did this for at least four characters. To put this in context, right now Lily is a labelled character in around twenty thousand stories; back then, I believe she was in around fourteen thousand. I probably read anywhere between twenty and thirty percent of those fourteen thousand stories not including stories that I found off site.
