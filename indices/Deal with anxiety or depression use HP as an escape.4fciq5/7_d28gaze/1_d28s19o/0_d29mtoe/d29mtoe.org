I definitely recommend that you find someone to speak with whether a counselor or a trusted parent or mentor. My mention of advisor above was in the context of a research advisor; however, I have spoken with counselors in the past. The most recent, which corresponded with my improvement about 4 years ago, did help some.

If you are still in university, I would definitely recommend exploring the options they provide. They are generally inexpensive and have experience with many of the particular issues that students can face. It can be a bit of challenge to find one who works well with you; definitely search around.

Good luck!
