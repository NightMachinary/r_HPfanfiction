Definitely. 99% of fanfiction is popcorn. Easily consumable, don't have to think or expend energy. It's free. There's no commitment as it can be quickly binged.

I have no self control when it comes to reading. It's actually really limiting. I can't read while in school because I cannot control myself. If I start a book, I finish it. Then I think, just one more chapter in the sequel. And then I finish that one too. And I start in on the next book and finish that as well. And somehow it's 4:45 and I have to wake up in less than two hours.

So, fanfiction helps deal with my real world stress and also avoids adding in the stress that reading "real" books does.
