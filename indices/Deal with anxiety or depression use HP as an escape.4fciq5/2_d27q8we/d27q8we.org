I was diagnosed with depression about three years ago, and last year I really involved myself in writing HP fanfic and roleplaying on Tumblr, primarily as Harry and also as Lucius Malfoy.

In terms of experience, it really helped me to flesh out AUs the way I did - I wrote and RPed a completely non-canon Harry post-war, as I wasn't a big fan of the epilogue, and sinking myself into characters was a great distraction for me.

Part of depression's insidiously soul-crushing nature is in the way it saps away your passions, ambitions, and desires - feelings fade from full-colour to black and white, and it becomes hard to remember who you are as a person, how it feels to function, almost.

Sinking myself into Harry's character really helped, to be honest - I could temporarily detach myself from feeling nothing and feel vicariously, delighting in world-building and plotting and working.

I'm medicated now, so my depression's not a working weight on me, but I'm grateful for how writing in the HP universe with other HP writers shored me up, I won't lie.

I think when the world goes sepia like that, a splash of colour from anywhere is good to grab onto, and for me, HP was it.

IDK if that's the sort of experience you were looking for, but yeah.
