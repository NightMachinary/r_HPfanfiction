yes, and it=s nice to know that i=m not the only one! I am re-writing a story that is therapeutic for me in a lot of ways, and it helps to explore, how another might have reacted in a similar situation, and to see how other characters react to it. Reading when i`m depressed helps, especially hurt-comfort fics. It lets me get engrossed in another character and detach myself for the anxiety or depression.
