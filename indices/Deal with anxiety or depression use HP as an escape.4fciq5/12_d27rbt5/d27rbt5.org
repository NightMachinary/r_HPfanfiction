A little yes. I have had anxiety since I was two (26 years of this stuff has given me adequate time to learn about my needs when it hits). What I have learned is if I can find a way to get my mind off of the thought (mine is characterized by an OCD thought process - I fixate on my trigger) and off my routine, it helps me through the episode. Fanfiction in general helps me with this. Writing makes my mind focus on something other than my panic and my trigger thought so I get through it easier. If I can get out of my anxiety cycle, the subsequent depression can't set in as quickly.

HP fanfiction helps on a higher scale because there are many high quality writers and readers to compete with and satisfy so I have to put my whole mind and heart into it. When I write HP, I can't focus on my anxiety thoughts.
