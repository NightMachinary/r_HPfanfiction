Mines not neccessarily in a good way. For a stretch of about 3 months all my life would consist of was doing drugs going to work and reading fanfiction. I'd get high and read fanfiction for hours, wake up get high go to work and read fanfiction for hours, come home get high read fanfiction for hours. My memory of the times are so hazy I can't even remember which ones I'd read. It wasn't a great time for me personally. However on the flipside reading fanfiction helped me get through withdrawrals as well. So every cloud I guess.
