I don't have anxiety or depression and I use HP as an escape from the stress and pressure of everyday life and a highly demanding career, sometimes to my detriment. If I find a fic I really like I'll often stay up have the night reading and go to work exhausted the next morning.

Hell I've been using HP as an escape since I was in grade school.

That said, it's not a bad thing. Depending on how you define escape, anything that's not an obligation could be considered an escape, and that's perfectly healthy and normal to do.

Fan fiction isn't weird or taboo. The only unfortunate thing is that most people think of sex when you say fanfiction. Calmly correct them and they will accept it as any other hobby.
