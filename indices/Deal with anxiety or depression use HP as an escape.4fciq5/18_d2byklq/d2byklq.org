I have bipolar disorder and anxiety. Reading in general has always been a very big part of my life. The Harry Potter universe is like a little anchor, something that's for the most part stable and not going away. And I can immerse myself in it however I like. So it's an escape at times, a way to vent without doing it myself, a release for emotions (nothing like a damn good angsty fic with the deaths of your favorite characters to make you cry like a baby). But it's safe.

Abusive relationships, death, harm, war, you name it. I can trick my head into 'experiencing' dangerous or harmful things without actually getting the urge to go do things I'll regret. Keeps my head busy.

I can't safely take the medications that I should because of unrelated health issues, so this is like a form of safe self medication.
