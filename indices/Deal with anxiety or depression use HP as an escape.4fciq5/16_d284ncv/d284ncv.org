Yes, I was unhappy socially as a younger teenager and later suffered from diagnosed depression. At times fanfic was a little too escapist, but since you can use practically anything as escapist, escaping into fanfic didn't have many side effects. I still love it and fanfic>trashy novels.

I just wish I'd gotten more involved in the community aspects or tried to unleash my own creativity more.
