About three years ago I realised that I'm transgender, after that my life basicly fell apart. I turned to fanfiction and grand strategy games as a form of escapism. At my peak of dysfunction I was reading about a half a million words a week and gaming for 40-60 hour on top of having a full time job. Fanfiction saved my life, on at least two occasions I managed to convince myself to kill myself after I'd finished the fic, by the time I'd finish the fic my dysphoria and anxiety would have receded.

I'm better now (mostly) but my love of fanfiction has remained.
