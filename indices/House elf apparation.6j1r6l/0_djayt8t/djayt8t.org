It's canon, but it's enough to call for the elf, you don't have to scream.

Harry saw Sirius attempt it with Kreacher, at Christmas at Grimauld Place (just after they got news that Arthur was going to survive), but Kreacher didn't answer the summons. Presumably because he was off tattling to Bellatrix.

It's in HPB, late at night in the hospital wing, that Harry thinks of summoning Kreacher, to have him tail Malfoy, but realises he has no idea how. Just to try it out, he tries just speaking the elf's name, and is surprised to find that both Kreacher and Dobby appear -- Dobby having tagged along because he doesn't trust Kreacher.

So technically the first time Harry wirnessed it was when he himself tried it out, witth no idea if it would even work.
