Honestly! It should be HG:MOR because goodness those /boys/ haven't got an ounce of rationality to them! We live in a /wizarding/ society; its /wizarding/ Britain, but what about the witches? Perhaps it should be Herstory of Magic, yes? You don't see any witches running off and forming "Death Eater" groups or conquering Europe!!! Wheres your rationality now? Checkmate, wizards!!!!
