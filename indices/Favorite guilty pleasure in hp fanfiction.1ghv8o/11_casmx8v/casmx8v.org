Fem!Harry and H/Hr romance fics. It's just such a cliche set of preferences.... but I cannot get enough of them.

Example: "Yeah, nonjon's stuff is awesome /dammit portkey, load that fic already!/"

Also, Harry/Ginny when Harry's a girl - because girl!Harry totally tops the fangirl. Male Harry and Ginny? Meh. Female Harry and Ginny? Holy balls.

I shall forever deny having mentioned this, by the way.
