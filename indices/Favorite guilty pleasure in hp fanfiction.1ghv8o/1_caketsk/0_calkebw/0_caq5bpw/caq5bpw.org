I agree to this, and while I think the 1st-3rd books are great for kids to read, they need a more mature mindset for 4th-7th. (Especialy 7) Because JK had the books grow with the readers.

I think she could rewrite the 1st-3rd books for more mature readers and up the content of the obvious abuse done.

Your not alone.
