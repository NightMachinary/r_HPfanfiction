I hate to say... but me too. It's strange, but I think I like it because I enjoy action and, like someone else said, the vulnerability of it all. Plus, I think it's often (if done well) a more realistic depiction of what Harry probably faced at times at the hands of the Dursleys. Honestly, sometimes I felt like JKR downplayed their brutality, particularly Uncle Vernon.

I know it was a children's series, especially in the beginning, but I still feel like there had to've been more going on than just emotional abuse and neglect.... Maybe that's just me.
