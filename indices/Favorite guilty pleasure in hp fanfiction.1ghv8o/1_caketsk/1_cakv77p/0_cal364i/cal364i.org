Oh god the pressure! Um, quite often I just read trashy ones to get my fil and then forget about them, some of the ones I have been able to find are [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2271468/1/The-Problem-With-Cupboards][The Problem With Cupboards]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal_Harry][Brutal Harry]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3164465/1/Shame][Shame]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6066769/1/Identification][Identification]], sorry it's not a lot, and I'm not all that sure of their quality either. If you want more I find that the communities are a great place to look because it sort of allows you to narrow down what you want by themes etc. and their popularity.
