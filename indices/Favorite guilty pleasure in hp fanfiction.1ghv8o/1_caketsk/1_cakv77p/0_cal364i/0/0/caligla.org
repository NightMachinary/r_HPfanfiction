Oh, sorry! I'd tried to find ones that were mainly just Harry. I know what it's like when you like the plot and the characterisation but not the pairing. I totally get what you mean about the vulnerability thing, but I do love it when Harry's abused and then either becomes a BAMF or when his abuse is revealed and then the Dumbledore bashing begins. I'm a bad person.
