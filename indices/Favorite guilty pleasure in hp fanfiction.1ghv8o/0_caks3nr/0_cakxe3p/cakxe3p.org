Time travel is great because it is an incredibly honest way to write fanfiction. The narrative exists explicitly to fix the original story, while the characters themselves are conscious of it. Good time travel fics are always fun to read.

Any specifics you would recommend? I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783428/1/The-End-and-the-Beginning][The End and the Beginning]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past][Harry Potter and Future's Past]] myself.
