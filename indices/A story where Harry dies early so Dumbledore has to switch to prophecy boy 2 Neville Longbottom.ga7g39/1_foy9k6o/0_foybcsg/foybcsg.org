Might remember that prophecies are fluctuating thing, nothing in the Prophecy says that the Dark Lord is Voldemort, Nothing say that Harry would be the Chosen one, LV could have "marked" Neville years later in another fight even with Potter already being "marked" and in the case Op asked being already dead.

All of this to say that even if LV already marked HP, if he thinks that Longbottom is his equal and marked him after Harry's death the Prophecy would still work, "The power he knows not" is super vague so it's doable no?
