Always thought that the theory about the power he doesn't know being mother's sacrifice was completely bollocks or Rowling forgot herself.

Riddle and death eaters butchered tons of family where parents must have sacrificed themselves for their kids and it didn't save them from the killing curse or way of dying. So either the concept is true and it only worked for Lily and Harry because of protagonist plot armor, or it's not the mother's sacrifice and Lily was just a brilliant witch where she managed to trick Voldemort into a magic pact where he could only kill one person is the room without him realizing what he agreed to respect, and when he chooses to kill Harry after killing Lily, the pact interferes and the Killing curse bounce toward him, end of story.
