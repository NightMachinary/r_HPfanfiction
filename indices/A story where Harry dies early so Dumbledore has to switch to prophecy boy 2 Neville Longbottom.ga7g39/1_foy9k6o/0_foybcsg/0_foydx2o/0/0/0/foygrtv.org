True, but it doesn't need to Voldemort or any deatheater, someone sacrificing themselves for another loved one is something that must have happened before in the magical word prior 1981, and they (and we the readers) never hear anything about the saved one being unkillable because of the sacrifice, Rowling never made true rules for her Magic system, so we don't know if Lily's sacrifice is something that is reproductible or a one case scenario, that why I don't really agree on the concept of the power he doesn't know is the mother's sacrifice, especially as it only helped Harry to protect himself against Voldemort and not "vanquish the Dark Lord".
