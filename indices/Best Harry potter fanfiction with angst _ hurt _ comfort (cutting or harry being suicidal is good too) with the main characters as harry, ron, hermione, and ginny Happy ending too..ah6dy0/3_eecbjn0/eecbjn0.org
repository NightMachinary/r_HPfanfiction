If your okay with non graphic slash there is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/959625][The much better, Dursley's can fuck off, Slytherins are people too AU by Des98]] it features a much heavier abused harry who has to deal with the consequences. It it's heavy on the comfort and focuses heavily on Hogwarts students relationships and growing up, A lot of the characters are LGBT+ but it also makes characters like kreacher, winky, Hermione, pansy, and Minerva badass as hell. Plus it towards the end features Gordon Ramsay as the new potions master. I can't recommend it highly enough.
