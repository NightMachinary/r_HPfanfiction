I can't say anything for Harry specifically but I imagine Muggleborns would actually be disappointed more than those from wizarding families. I mean, magical theory and stuff is all grand, but when you actually have to study it? I'd get bored pretty quickly, especially if I was expecting to learn cool spells and potions right off the bat. Whereas kids in wizarding families would probably already know they start off slow, and not have as high of expectations.

That being said, I imagine more Muggleborns would be excited and a tad more motivated to go out of their way to learn things outside of their classes (such as how wizarding society works in general, and what sort of creatures are real) but for the classes themselves, first and second year at least to me seem rather dull. I imagine second and fourth year would be the worst actually, since first and third have the added excitement of beginning new classes
