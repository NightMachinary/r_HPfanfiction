I feel like this is part and parcel with Rowling's overall indecisiveness regarding whether to have Harry be more the traditional sort of hero (the special, the exceptional, the one chosen by destiny, which we see hints of throughout the book series) or the everyman forced to become heroic by circumstance, which is more or less how canon ended.
