I don't think Harry really ever showed any interest in schoolwork to begin with. Yeah, in the first book he reads his textbooks ahead of school, but that was only because he was just introduced to this new world and was curious - not because he wanted to get a head start and enjoyed homework and stuff like that. And also because he was kinda trapped in his room and had nothing better to do.

I do agree that JK did tone down Harry's curiosity as the books went on, but like many others have pointed out, that might just be because novelty wore off. But Harry never tried hard at school, apart from the â€˜reading his textbooks before school started' thing there is no other hints to him enjoying schoolwork at all.

There was also this line - can't remember where - where Harry mentions, as a kid, he wasn't allowed to get better grades than Dudley. This could explain why he doesn't try to excel at school: because as a child he was taught not too.
