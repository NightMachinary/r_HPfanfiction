  There was also this line - can't remember where - where Harry mentions, as a kid, he wasn't allowed to get better grades than Dudley. This could explain why he doesn't try to excel at school: because as a child he was taught not too.

No such line exists in canon, I'm afraid. In fact, Harry almost never talks about his experience at primary school apart from the few anecdotes at the beginning of PS where the narration talks about Harry accidentally apparating onto the roof and one later when he thinks about having to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.

On one hand, I can definitely see Vernon having an anti-intellectual strain to him so it wouldn't matter if Dudley got bad marks because Real Men aren't namby pamby intellectuals. Harry getting better marks wouldn't matter to them (also, this is primary school, I don't remember my primary school reports having real grades to them).

On the other, I can also see Harry being conditioned to not bother trying to do well. I doubt Vernon and Petunia would help him do his homework at the kitchen table so he was probably doing it in a very rushed manner, Dudley would probably have enjoyed destroying or taking Harry's homework just to get Harry in trouble, Harry likely struggled on with eyes that needed glasses until a teacher put their foot down which means he may have copied things down wrong or been seen as a troublemaker. Added to that would be the incident with the wig and the incident with him on the roof, meaning teachers were unlikely to give him the benefit of the doubt.

All of that could easily add up to a kid who won't do well in school. Not because his guardians laid down some abusive edict that he could not do any better than Dudley but because he'd learnt that trying to do well was pointless.
