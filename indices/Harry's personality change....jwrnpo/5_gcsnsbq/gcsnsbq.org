That's a part of being a teenager. 13-14 is usually the years when independence and rebelliousness kicks in big time, it makes sense that Harry would be less interested in schoolwork and exploring the wizarding world since he's reaching that age where he's instead looking more to himself and his relationships with others.

Not to say that JKR didn't alter characters as she went. The biggest shift in personality for me is book 5 and onwards where Harry becomes very passive in his own story and reliant on others. Same with how Ron becomes stupider and less active, Hermione's intelligence and amazingness gets amplified until she's like Wizard Einstein instead of just a bookworm who reads too much, and Dumbledore's eccentricity disappears almost entirely.
