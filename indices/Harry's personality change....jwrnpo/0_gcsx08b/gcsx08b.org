I think it's important to consider what the third book is about thematically. It explores Harry's loneliness, isolation, and feeling trapped. Sirius Black being on the loose means he has to stay at Hogwarts while everyone else gets to go to Hogsmeade. The dementors being literal depression monsters means that people are going to be depressed, meaning a lack of care about school work.

Factor in puberty kicking into high gear, his best friends arguing with each other, people keeping secrets from him, constant death threats in a class he picked only because his best friend did as well, and the other new class he could have been excited for being ruined because of what happened in the first lesson, it all leads to an amalgamation of feelings that can be very demotivating.

You also have to factor in that the Harry Potter books are mainly mystery stories disguised as urban fantasy. PS/SS has the mysteries of first the letters and then the stone, CoS has the Chamber of Secrets be its main mystery. PoA subverts Harry and grew actively trying to solve a mystery early on when Arthur tells Harry not to go looking for Black. Harry is given a less proactive role and more reactive, and even then the reaction is basically an order to stay out of trouble.

Harry's main goal in the story is to find a way to get over his weakness to dementors, or in other words, deal with his depression. Which he manages to do by figuring out that 'he can do it because he already has.' It's a more internal story than the previous two books.

TL;DR - The reason is because PS/SS and CoS is about solving the mystery and fighting the bad guy, while PoA is about overcoming personal +dementors,+ demons. One's about curiosity, the other self-reflection.
