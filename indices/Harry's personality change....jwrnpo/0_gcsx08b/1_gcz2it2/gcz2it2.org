Quite insightful, but unfortunately hits the Watson vs Doyle problem.

While it's quite understandable from the writer's point of view, when looking at a literary work - it's quite reasonable, yes.

Unfortunately, the other side, that of character continuity in-story, is quite another matter alltogether.
