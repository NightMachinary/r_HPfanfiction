Here you could just put it down to things happening over summer that we don't see. We only really see the very end of Harry's summer with the dursleys in the first chapter of most of the books. we do heard about things, I think, when he speaks to his friends, but events over summer bearing him down before third year could explain it.

This is lazy, and I don't thinks it's the case, but it's possible. when I write I try to include anything that has enough of an impact the character to change them. Minor events like details of conversations, if not important, can just be footnotes.
