I don't think that's true. Harry is only very excited about magic over the summer. At Hogwarts, he and Ron just complain about schoolwork like regular kids do and are pretty average students. If anything, him learning the Patronus Charm in PoA is probably the first time he learned magic outside of class that wasn't required.
