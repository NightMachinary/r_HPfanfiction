its my personal opinion that in the latter books, both Harry and Ron get nerfed to give Hermione room to shine, Harry goes from being a sassy little brat, to a kid that relies too heavily imo on Hermione and other pepole.

Ron meanwhile goes from being the "ordinary" kid in a family full of prodigies, that wants recognition and too stand out amoung them, to becoming a person that constantly takes the easy route, eg Diviation.

Hermione went from being a student that studied to hard, to a genius that were capable of performing advanced magic eg contract in book 5 and the DA galleons.
