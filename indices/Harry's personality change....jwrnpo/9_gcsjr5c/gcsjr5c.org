As someone else said... the novelty wore off eventually. Harry still remains curious but his curiosity shifts towards other things. In book 1 it's all exciting since it provides an escape for him and everything is new. In book 2 he learns about the British wizarding culture and how some of the old families look down upon those below them such as muggle-borns or house elves. In book 3 he learns about his parents' past. In book 4 he learns about other wizarding cultures. In book 5 he learns about about the magical government's inner workings, as well as how it's like to be under constant threat from a dark wizard. In book 6 he learns about his enemy's past and gets to discover some really dark magic (Horcruxes, Inferi, Sectumsempra). In book 7 he learns about wandlore, death and mythological artefacts that even wizards think are fairy tales. So I think Harry learns something new every book and he is genuinely curious but his curiosity shifts.
