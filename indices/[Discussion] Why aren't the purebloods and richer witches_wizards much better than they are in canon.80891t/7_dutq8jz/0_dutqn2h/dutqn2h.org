Starfox I do the same thing in one of my stories! :) Well they use cosmetic spells on their clothes and hair and eyes and nails, but not really their bones and stuff to look more attractive overall. But they do still put protective spells on clothes, like the shield hats in canon. It's still not as /abundantly used/ as it seems in yours though. :)
