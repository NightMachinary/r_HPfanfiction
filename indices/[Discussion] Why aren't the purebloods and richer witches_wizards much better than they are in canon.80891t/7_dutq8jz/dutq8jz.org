In my AU story, "Patron", wizards use much more magic than in canon - including all sorts of spells on their robes. Which also grant advantages in combat. And even if lack the skill to cast those spells, you can pay someone to do so and you're tougher than the poor. Of course, the more spells on your robes, the higher your status as well. There are other effects as well - most muggleborns do feel like ugly ducklings when they enter Hogwarts, where everyone uses magical cosmetics and charms.
