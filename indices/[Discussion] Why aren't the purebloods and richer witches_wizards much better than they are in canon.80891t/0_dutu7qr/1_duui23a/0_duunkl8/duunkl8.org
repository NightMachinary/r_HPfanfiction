That was an unintended effect of the potion though, so it doesn't appear that strictly human transformations can work that way with Polyjuice, which is hard just to produce. And Crouch Sr was dead. The issue isn't that transfigurations will undo (outside human transfiguration and conjuration, they usually last indefinitely IIRC), but that human transfiguration, of a living person, is difficult, dangerous and appears to be less than longlasting, if even Grindelwald's was undone by a simple revealing spell.
