I wonder, though, in Chamber of Secrets, when Hermione's accidentally turned into a half-cat, it takes 'several weeks' for her to go back to normal, when the original potion was only meant to last an hour.

And Barty Crouch Jr. mentions transfiguring his father's corpse into a bone to bury it in Hagrid's garden, so I guess transfigurations can last for a pretty long time too.
