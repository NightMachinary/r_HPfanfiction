Well, the Malfoys are clearly absurdly wealthy, and the Potters were rich enough James and Lily didn't have to work.

I think Sirius ended up with a decent amount, purely because he was his uncle's main/sole inheriter, and he was unable to touch it for 12 years. I doubt it was anything like you see in Lord Black fics.

Most other purebloods seem to work.
