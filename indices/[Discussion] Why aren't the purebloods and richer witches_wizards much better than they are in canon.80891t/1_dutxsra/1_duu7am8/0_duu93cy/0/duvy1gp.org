You have a point. But I figure they actually have less costs. Electricity, water, gas, internet and phone, cars, they have none of those bills. There's food, clothes, stationery, floo, plumbing, toiletries, household items, and I'm struggling to think of other ongoing or major costs. I don't know how the plumbing works, whether it's fully muggle or not, but I see zero reason why a house elf or a person couldn't just vanish a septic tanks contents every day, or week, or month.

I dunno how expensive floo powder is, but it's probably one of the bigger ones. Food can easily be grown - both Hagrid and Molly manage to produce an impressive amount, and food can be engorged without affecting taste or nutrition, to a certain limit I think. You can conjure most essentials - probably, toothbrushes and stuff would be more expensive, because less demand, but that's cos most people would conjure or transfigure one.
