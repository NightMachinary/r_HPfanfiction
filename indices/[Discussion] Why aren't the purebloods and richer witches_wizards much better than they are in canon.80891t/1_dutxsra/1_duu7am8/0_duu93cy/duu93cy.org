The Malfoys may be very rich by their own societies standards. Those standards may fall a little short however when it comes to the muggle world.

I can imagine that the quality of life may actually be much better for muggles than it is for magicals. This is mostly due to the size of the wizarding world. People take for granted how much the world has changed in the past 100 years alone, mass production and global trade have really changed things and increased the quality of life greatly.

We don't know enough about the wizarding economy or their own methods of growing food or manufacturing things to know.

Being "Rich" in the early 1900s wouldn't hold a candle to the quality of living of the average citizen of a first-world country today. Basic things we enjoy and take for granted were luxuries back then. It's possible that it's the same with the wizarding world. Due to a smaller economy and possibly less trade, things could be more expensive or not even available.
