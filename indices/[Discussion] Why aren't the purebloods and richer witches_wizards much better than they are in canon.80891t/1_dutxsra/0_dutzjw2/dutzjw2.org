  I can't imagine a muggleborn from a much larger, more sophisticated global economy being too much worse off than their pureblood counterparts.

We know for a fact that you can convert between currencies - that's seen in canon. I think the problem really just comes down to statistics. The rich are a humongous minority, and the chances of being born with magic outside of the established wizarding world isn't any greater or poorer depending on your background. It's entirely random, although genetics may play a part.

Unlike quite a few things in life, you can't "buy" the ability to use magic. So, really, the chances of someone being super rich and born a muggleborn are absurdly low.
