Meh, no reason why vaults actually need to be expanded. If a flying carriage can contain multiple rooms Gringotts can probably be a hell of a lot larger underground than would actually be possible. The common vaults could be stacked right next to each-other like storage units but be massive on the inside with multiple rooms.
