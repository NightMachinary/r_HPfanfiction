I would say yes, honestly. Despite the fanon trope, Goblins canonically don't seem all that interested in the business side of the Wizarding World. "Inflation" is only a concept which would screw with the wizards themselves - the Goblins just /make and store/ the money. If anything, a huge surplus of it would make them even more necessary. With inflation or a lot of money being minted, wizards would be required to get larger and larger vaults or, at the very least, get more of them.

Considering Goblins are also the only ones capable of minting the money (a secret which they horde and have never shared with wizardkind), they're in full control of that aspect of it.

The real question is whether or not any of the treaties demand they protect some kind of balance.
