It might be interesting, but really the assumption here (and one not supported by canon) is that the lines between rich and poor have been drawn between Pureblood and Non-pureblood. We never really get a good idea of the wealth of anyone besides the Weasleys, so we don't know if it's a general rule that pure-bloods are rich and the weasleys are just the exception.

My take on it is that the purebloods are probably generally richer by their own society's standards, but if you were to look at the "wealth" of a muggle-born plus their family they may actually be on average better off. I can't imagine a muggleborn from a much larger, more sophisticated global economy being too much worse off than their pureblood counterparts.

Wealth is also probably measured differently in both societies anyways, so it may be hard to do a real comparison.
