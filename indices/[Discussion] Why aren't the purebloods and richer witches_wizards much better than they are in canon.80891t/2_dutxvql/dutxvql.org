I feel like it could make for a pretty fascinating AU. Depending on the route taken it could easily diverge into a systematic class system depending on what you could afford or were magically capable of performing. Or it could turn more towards the "family magic" type AU, with families developing their own spells and potions independently and jealously guarding them. As has been said, it doesn't make much sense within Canon, as a lot of assumptions and extrapolations have to be made about the nature of self improvement magics since they aren't really covered at all; but as an AU it gas potential to be very interesting.
