The theme is actually "shit sucks because of pureblood /bigots/" - and that is pretty much the core theme of the original books.

My protagonists aren't fighting "the purebloods" - many of them, like Ron, /are/ purebloods. They are fighting Death Eaters and other bigots. And that is a major theme indeed in my stories - and, as I said, in the original series - but "/foreign pureblood governments/" aren't appearing as villains in major roles in many of my stories.
