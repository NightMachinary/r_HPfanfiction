I don't think that will help if people ignore or dismiss the actual pureblood OCs I did use so far as "not counting". And it also runs the risk of turning the stories into "purebloods fight purebloods for the poor oppressed half-bloods and muggleborns who can't do anything themselves - and that is not a narrative I like.

I focus on the trio and usually Sirius as well anyway, which means good purebloods are the majority already.

With regards to the majority of purebloods supporting the status quo: If they wouldn't support the status quo, muggleborns wouldn't be discriminated against in the first place. So, yes, it was my intention to show that there's a lot of bigotry, albeit not on a violent level, common among purebloods - like racist tendencies are found among many in Europe and the USA. If that weren't the case, people wouldn't drown in the Mediterrannean and wouldn't rot in dirty camps in the USA because we'd have kicked the scumbags doing this out of office long ago.
