I'm not about to whitewash racism and bigotry by claiming it's all just a small minority of evil people oppressing all those decent people who have no racist or bigoted bone in their body. That wasn't true in Nazi Germany and it wasn't true in the USA with the KKK. A huge number of people have racists or bigotted leanings.

Still, the purebloods who don't like muggleborns but won't join the Death Eaters or actively oppress muggleborns aren't enemies or villains, nor targets for my protagonists in my stories.

Also, the Weasleys, the Lovegoods, Shacklebolt, the Longbottoms, Sirius - lots of pureblood heroes in my stories. It's not as if the numbers are better in the original series, either.
