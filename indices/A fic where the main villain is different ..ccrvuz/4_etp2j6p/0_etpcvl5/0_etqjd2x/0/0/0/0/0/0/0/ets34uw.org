I see. Well the point of my original (flippant) comment is that, as a reader of much of your work, it feels like the /vast, vast/ majority of purebloods in your world are bigots and support the status quo that keeps non-purebloods subservient to purebloods. Therefore it's pretty safe to say purebloods are the bad guys because pureblood is basically synonymous with bigot.

If that was your intention, cool, you did a great job. But if it wasn't, then consider writing more OC purebloods (beyond Sirius' interchangeable French wife characters) that either join with your protagonists or are shown speaking up against the antagonists, maybe?
