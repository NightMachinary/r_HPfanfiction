Actually, foreign pureblood-dominated governments don't play a major role in most of my stories. They are the main opposition in "Marriage Law Revolution" and meddle with Britain's politics after the civil war in "Divided and Entwined", as well as during the civil war in "Reformed, Returned and Really Trying", but that's it. The trio deals with a number of foreign governments in "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", but they're not the main enemy, and the pureblood aspects don't really matter that much compared to other differences.
