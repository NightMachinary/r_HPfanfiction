Well you're bringing real world racial elements into the story so by definition? There's not supposed to be any real life prejudice in the stories so everyone can read about equality without it being overt. It's why so many racist families love the books, they're happily mocking inequality and praising equality. Bringing actual racism in defeats the point.
