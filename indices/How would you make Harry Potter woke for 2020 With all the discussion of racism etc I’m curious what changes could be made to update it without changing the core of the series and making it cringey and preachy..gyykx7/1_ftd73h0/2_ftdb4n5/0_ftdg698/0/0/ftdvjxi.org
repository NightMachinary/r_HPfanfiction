Look at Avatar. It's categorically a show for kids, but it tackles things like personal responsibility, nature versus nurture, terrorism versus resistance, the nature of power... I could go on for ages. Complex themes =/= complex plot, as long as the writers know what they're doing.

Compare the defeat of Voldemort to to the defeat of the Fire Lord. Avatar explores the new power vacuum and heavily implies that the characters still have a lot of work left to do.
