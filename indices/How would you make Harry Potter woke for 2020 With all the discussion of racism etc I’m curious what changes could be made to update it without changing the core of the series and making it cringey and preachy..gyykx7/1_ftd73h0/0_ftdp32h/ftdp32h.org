/Are/ we supposed to think that everything's fine? Maybe it's because I was older when I read the books, but I always thought Rowling was deliberately portraying a messy world with its own systemic issues that would be difficult to solve - the oppression of magical creatures isn't really subtle, nor is the classism, and even before Voldemort's return, the depiction of the Ministry and the press are pretty deeply cynical. Having Harry from ages 11-17 go to school, learn magic, defeat a dark wizard, AND revolutionize society seems like a lot to put on his plate.
