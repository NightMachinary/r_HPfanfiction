I don't think Cho's name needs to be changed. In Japanese, “Cho” means butterfly. It's possible that she has a Japanese first name and a Chinese last name.

The only thing I would change is to describe characters explicitly as white if JKR imagines them that way. Because she explicitly describes the race of non white characters. Not doing so would imply that the default race is white which I think is problematic.

I don't think Dumbledore needs to be shown in a gay bar unless it's an important plot point. There are a lot of details implying that he is gay.
