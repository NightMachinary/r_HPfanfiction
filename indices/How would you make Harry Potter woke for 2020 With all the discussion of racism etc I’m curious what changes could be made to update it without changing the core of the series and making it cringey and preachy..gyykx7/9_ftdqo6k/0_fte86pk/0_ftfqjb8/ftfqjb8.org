I guess for me, Parvati and Padma were obviously Hindu names and with the given descriptions of their black hair, I knew they were Indian.

I think Cho is a Japanese first name or Korean last name. Chang as her last name along indicated to me that she was East Asian.

Dean is explicitly mentioned as black in the sorting ceremony in the first book though.

I agree that a lot of causal fans forget how long JKR has been writing HP. She first came up with the idea in 1990 and got the first book published in 1997. I thought the representation was as good as it could be in the 1997-2007 timeframe.

I think having the main issue be blood purity was a good choice as it makes it easy for readers to apply it to real life issues. It was a good way for people to examine their prejudice. I found it nice that discimination based on race isn't a thing in the books
