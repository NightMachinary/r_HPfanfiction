JKR doesn't really describe the race of non white characters explicitly. We mostly know them through names. Eg Parvati, Padma, Cho. Parvati and Padma are Hindu names. Cho could be a Korean name. Dean Thomas is a black Londoner according to JKR but we wouldn't know that reading from the books except that he supports a dodgy football team. She does describe Angelina and Kingsley as black.

I think that people forget that she wrote these books 25 years ago about a boarding school in Britain. Given that, I think the book is pretty representative of its time and society. What was also refreshing is that race, ethnicity etc. is never made an issue of.
