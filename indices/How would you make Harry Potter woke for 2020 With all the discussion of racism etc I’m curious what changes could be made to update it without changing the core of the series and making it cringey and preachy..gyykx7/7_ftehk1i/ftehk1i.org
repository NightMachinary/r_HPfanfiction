Speaking of specific fanfiction, the writer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] is pretty good at setting up AU versions of the wizarding world that are lending themselves to more radical action than accepting the pre-Voldemort status quo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]] is from Neville's PoV, as he is getting increasingly comfortable with returning to the Pre-Voldemort status quo as a pureblood Wizengamot member, whilew Hermione is getting increasingly radical as an agitator for equal rights.
