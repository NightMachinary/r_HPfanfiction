Make Hogwarts disabled accessible. There's a wheelchair using character in the Hogwarts mobile game, but they never show him getting around all the steps everywhere (my headcanon is that his wheelchair is made of broomwood, and can levitate short distances) but there's a lot more to disability than just wheelchair accessibility. The war would have left people disabled, disfigured, and traumatised. I want to see how the magical world accommodates them!
