I can guarantee you a children's book with clear societal critique won't undo the prejudice of a child who was raised by bigoted parents(because only such a child would already be prejudiced by 7) and the parents would remove the book anyway.

However, when you cleverly weave it into the material, like Star Trek and many children cartoons and other materials did/do, the child can associate that as normal and upon growing up it may even make them question their beliefs, since their parents didn't see any 'problem' with the material.

And OG Star Trek was very child friendly too, it inspired more than a few astronauts, engineers and actors(like Whoopi Goldberg), heck, Dr. Martin Luther King convinced the actress for Lt. Uhura to stay so she could inspire the children that watched with what they could achieve(again, Whoopi Goldberg has repeatedly said it inspired her as a child).

Today's custom of some media to blatantly and loudly tackle societal issues can be detrimental, because the people that need it the most will reject out of hand saying it has an 'agenda' or something, while for the people that don't need it, it will be like preaching to the choir. Doing it with subtlety IMHO is much more efficient, again, ST was very popular, even with people that were racist or xenofobes, and after several episodes or years watching it, perhaps they were more used to hearing different accents or seeing different people than when they started, to say nothing of the children, better results than if it loudly screamed 'DIVERSITY IS GOOD' and turned off the TV or changed the channel and dubbed the program 'too liberal'.

And there's also the fact sometimes people just can't do it in a way it doesn't hurt the quality of the product further reducing it's effectiveness. Most blatant attempts will also go right over a child's head.
