Yes, they did, but it was not that blatant(at least for the people that complain about that stuff), it was more relatable to antisemitism because it had more to do with the origins and ascendance than appearance, also immigrants.

And many of the people that would complain about that, wanted to bar it because it had magic. And I think they didn't even realize it because it was cleverly hidden in the Good vs Evil fight.

Heck the DE were practically KKK, they even had pointy hats in the movies, and again, that was woven into the plot and played into it. You can ask many and most won't say HP wasn't 'woke'.
