I don't think something needs to be forced to be "woke".

Take Star Trek from the 1960s, it had a very diverse crew of officers,(a black woman as the communications officer, a Japanese and a Russian as pilots and an Alien as a second in command). And there would be even more stuff if the studio hadn't put their foot down.

It was incredibly ahead of it's time and those things were treated as natural, no need to directly focus on then(the creator just said he thought humans in the future would be beyond such prejudices as to color and gender).

There was an episode however about a planet where the population was half-black and half -white(literally split down the middle of their faces) and they warred with each other depending on if the black side was on the right or left(they considered this to make them different), the Captain and the crew were fast to point out how stupid that was.

That said, I would probably make more characters more prominent, and bring some issues more to the front. Like the prejudice of the Blood Supremacists, the overt racism of the Ministry with the non-humans.

Perhaps how the system itself was wrong and how it allowed people like Voldemort to incite and practice violence through it.

All of this would have to be woven naturally in the plot and characters and not despite them.

Edit: Regarding Dumbledore, I don't think he's a good character for that, I mean, I don't see a way for it to come out naturally other than Harry learning it through memories and realizing how awful Grindelwald was for having abused those feelings to control young Albus. Since, from then on, Dumbledore seems to have abandoned any romantic pursuits altogether.

I also don't think every work of fiction has to be "woke" or rather tackle societal issues to be good, while many writers/artists can do that naturally and even subtly to escape suit censorship(ATLA, Percy Jackson, LoK) some just want to tell a story and there's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't spread hate.
