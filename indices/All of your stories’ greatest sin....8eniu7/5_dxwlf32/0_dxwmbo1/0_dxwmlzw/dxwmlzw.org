But the story is set in the 90s and you should try to accurately reflect that. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12884777/1/One-Way-Or]]) does a good job at that. Having widespread LGTB acceptance in the 90s would be as odd as Harry pulling out the latest iPhone to take a selfie in front of the Basilisk.
