Idk about you but most of the stories I read are set in 90s. But, that's probably cause I'm very picky with what I read.

By your logic, people who wrote some of the greatest stories in our fandom are lazy, homophobic and etc because they didn't think/found need of writing a lgbt character and that's so stupid that it hurts me internally.
