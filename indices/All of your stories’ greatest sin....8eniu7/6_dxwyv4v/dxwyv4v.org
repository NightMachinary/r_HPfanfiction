Yeah...so if there is a story based on only LGBT or LGBTQ I would never say there had to be more straight relationships and individuals in it. Disregarding that, how dare you put a label on someone just for something they write in their free time for fun. It not realistic? Magics not realistic. Fiction is not realistic. Everyone has the right to write whatever they want (although I am not a fan of stories that cause harm to others specifically, but I am not going to call out people who write them)
