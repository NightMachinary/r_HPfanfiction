I have several suggestions that I use:

1) Branch out into crossovers

Some crossovers are quite good and you don't have to know a lot about the other universe to get into them. It's very hit or miss, but it might helps you branch out a little, since crossovers are inherently different from pure HP fics.

2) Find a pairing you didn't read that often.

A bit self-explanatory, but there are several obscure pairings, although only a few fics are good among those, that people often overlook. Try to think of a pairing that you don't like, look for a fic, maybe you'll find yourself enjoying it.

3) Check the fav lists of your favourite authors.

It's a very good way to find good fics. Prolific authors sometimes, but not always, have a very well developed fav story list. Check them out, maybe something will strike your fancy.

4) Find a new fandom.

It's a bit heretical to say here, but search for fics from a different fandom. Sometimes it helps to orient yourself and consider HP fics from a different perspective by reading fics from another universe entirely. There are few as prolific and with such quality as HP, but there are some.
