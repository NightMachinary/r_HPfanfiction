Im on the same page here xD for me i usually set searchfilters to be minimum 40k words (and without Draco and Snape in tags, but thats just me trying to avoid slashfics) and sort by update date. That way you get access to all sorts of new fics beeing written :) also crossovers! Click crossovers and check each one that sounds exciting, or just search all crossovers and spend time looking through the top ones :)
