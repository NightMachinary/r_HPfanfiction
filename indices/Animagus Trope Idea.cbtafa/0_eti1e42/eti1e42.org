It's been a while since I've read it but I do believe you're describing the plot to linkffn(6690487), Growing Up Kneazle wherein Harry gets stuck for a good few years in the magical cat form and ends up at Hogwarts more cat than boy much to Dumbledore's distress even seeing another cat in the mirror of eriseD.

I agree it's more interesting, too many fanfics treat it like just another transfiguration- Perhaps Animorphs should be required reading for any animagus fanfic author.
