For iBooks-

You can message the bot with linkffn(... and it has a direct link to an EPUB of the story.

The website which does the conversion is ff2ebook.com (on mobile, no link, sorry). Basically on that website you can put in the link for any fic on fanfiction.net and it'll convert it for you. On an iPhone/iPad you can open the files directly into iBooks.
