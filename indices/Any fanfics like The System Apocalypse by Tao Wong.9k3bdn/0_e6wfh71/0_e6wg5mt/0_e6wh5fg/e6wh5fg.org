I'd have to think about it because when the divergence happens can set a lot of tone for the story.

Example 1: If it appears before Halloween 1981, it could disrupt Voldemort's first fall. Maybe it gives him knowledge of the full prophecy, maybe it changes power dynamics, or something else, but he could wind up dictator of western Europe by the time Harry would have started Hogwarts. Or maybe the newly empowered muggles off him and wizards become super hunted.

Example 2: If you want to have Harry's generation meaningfully involved in leadership (rather than being led around by Dumbledore), they'll need to be mature enough to assert independence. I would probably time it to coincide with Dumbledore's death both for maximum chaos and because that's the time Harry decided to stop waiting for other people to solve his problems.

Personally, I lean heavily toward the second option because incompetent adults syndrome in canon made a lot of the characters in James/Lily's generation unattractive. Plus, I would want to rewrite the second war to be about more than Voldemort and Harry's +wangs+ wands.
