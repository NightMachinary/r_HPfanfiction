Fourth year some time after the other two schools got there, Maybe the night/morning after the second task or the morning after the final battle. Mainly because I think that Hogwarts would be a level 100+ zone so on launch of the system all the students and staff of the three schools would end up with a small,medium,large and greater perk for starting in a 100+ zone.
