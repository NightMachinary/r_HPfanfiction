Unfortunately, the fic which most came to mind to me for Fred and George is a Fullmetal Alchemist crossover, and since you're asking for canon characters interacting with them I assume that isn't what you're after. I can still give you the link though if you want.

However, I do have two other fics that I really like the Fred and George in:

“Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay” (linkffn(13230340) and it's on AO3 but I don't have that link handy). They aren't main characters, but I definitely liked the fic's versions of them.

They aren't main characters in “The Prince of Slytherin” either, but the fic also does a lot to flesh them out as separate characters. But also that fic is /long/ and some people don't care for it (I personally didn't like the prologue and love the rest, but YMMV), so I'm not sure if that'd be something you want to bother trying to read. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 series link]] and it's also on fanfiction.net, with a link to that version present on the AO3 page.
