Welp. Unless you used another website I'm pretty sure it's gone. Unless you can find the author's email or another way to contact them.

I found the exact link for it but Wayback doesn't have it archived. All the links to it are null and void, and it wasn't one of the fics archived at ao3. But you can try contacting the archivers because there's a chance they just never got around to it.

I believe this was the link.
