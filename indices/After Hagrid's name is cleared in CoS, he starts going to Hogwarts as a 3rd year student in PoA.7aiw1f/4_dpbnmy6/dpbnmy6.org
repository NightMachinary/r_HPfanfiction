Personally I would not find the situation funny or even remotely feasible. Besides the fact that I think it was Hagrids 5th year that he got expelled, I think that all his experience and his focussed knowledge would allow him a definite instant OWL graduation if not specialized NEWT graduation.

Possibly if someone wrote it well, I would find a crack fic funny but usually I find those just stupid instead of humorous.
