I would love to read a fic like that, it has a lot of potential but it would have to be done by someone who could write Hagrid's speaking pattern.

And Hagrid could actually help Harry, Hermione and Ron capture Scabbers aka Peter. That could be interesting, having Sirius potentially be freed after Peter is captured could lead to a bunch of different things.

And then even afterwards Hagrid could help out with Harry with Umbridge and stuff like that if the author wanted to go even further with the plot. I could definitely see a lot of potential.
