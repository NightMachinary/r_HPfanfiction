Hagrid is a character with loads of comedic potential there. He could add some surrealness to the students which can make for funny moments (for example, in potions class) but he can also be a "rational one" who can handle things that are too big for the students or at least help.

For example, imagine the whole "Sirius Black / Lupin / Snape"-Scene at the end of PoA with Hagrid interfering.

Or Lupin telling about all the dark creatures in Defence, and Hagrid pointing out how friendly they are when you feed them right.

There is potential, as long as you don't drag it out too much.
