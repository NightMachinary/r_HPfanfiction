The story I am going to mention is not a HG/RW story and I know you aren't looking for recommendations so please feel free to disregard this opinion. However, in the spirit of holding out for a decent Lucius but still having a badass Hermione I'm going to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.nets/8311387/1/][Roundabout Destiny]]. The reason is because as a strong female character, Hermione has lots of influence in this alternative universe. So much so that the characters gravitate toward a different path. I really loved it!
