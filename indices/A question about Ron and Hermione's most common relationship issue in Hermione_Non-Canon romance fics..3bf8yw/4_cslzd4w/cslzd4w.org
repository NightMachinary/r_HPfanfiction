I find that it's mostly bullshit vilification (as bashing usually is). In fact, while Ron can be a bit indignant about being showed up, it's something he starts to grow out of as his character develops, and he seems to be more in awe of Hermione's talents than anything by the time they actually get together. Whit that in mind it's unlikely, I think.

At least it's not as stupid as /"Ron's got such bad table manners, better shag Draco instead"/.
