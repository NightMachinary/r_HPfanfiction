This might not answer your question exactly, but I think the reason it's so common is because it's an easy way to highlight the qualities (the intellect, mystery, woobiness, etc.) of the other man, as opposed to a boring, narrow-minded Ron. He exists as a weak foil. And this being fanfiction... don't expect a lot of nuance.
