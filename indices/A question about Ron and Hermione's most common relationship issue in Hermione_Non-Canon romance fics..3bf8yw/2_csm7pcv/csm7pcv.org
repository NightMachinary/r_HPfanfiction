Ron could go either way, the problem being that he remained fairly two dimensional in the books at times. Actually I am surprised that Ron doesn't get written to become Arthur ver. 2 instead. After all there's whole 'men marry women who remind them of their mothers' and Ron's role model for a loving relationship is that of a henpecked husband who hides from a hypercritical wife and for the woman in his life to be controlling and domineering. Plus if Molly was in charge of her husband's salary, then Ron might be comfortable in a situation where Hermione controls all the income/power in the relationship and lists out every chore she expects him to do before she gets home from work.
