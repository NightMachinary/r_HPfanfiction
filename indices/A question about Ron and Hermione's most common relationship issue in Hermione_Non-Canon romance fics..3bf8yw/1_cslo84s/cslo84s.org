We don't know. Molly is not detailed enough for us to really understand her opinion in this matter. And Ron is also not very clear in what he wants in a wife. So we don't know how they will react/ might have reacted in canon.

What we do know however is that Hermione won't settle for being a housewife. So if you are going to break them up and you don't want to bash Ron by making him cheat on her, then this difference of opinion is the closest you can come to a canon-compliant reason for their break-up.

It at least makes sense that Hermione would break up over this, so it's already far more realistic than other reasons you can come up with.
