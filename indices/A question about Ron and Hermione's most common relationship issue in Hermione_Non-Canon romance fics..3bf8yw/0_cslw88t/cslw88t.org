I don't think there's any evidence that Ron would insist on Hermione becoming a homemaker. I doubt it, since Wizarding World has been egalitarian for much longer than Muggle. I can see Hermione clashing with Molly on this subject, with Ron being caught in between --- which could cause a breakup where both parties are pretty sympathetic.

What I wonder is, are there any fics where they break up and it's largely /Hermione's/ fault, not with cheating or anything like that, but, say, with lack of respect for Ron? For example, Ron goes on a week-long magical wilderness survival and evasion exercise, as a part of his Auror training. He comes home, dead tired, only to discover that Hermione has, in the meantime, picked out and rented an apartment for them to move into, without ever consulting him. (It seems like a very Hermione thing to do.) Now, she gives a hundred rational reasons for why this is an excellent choice and an excellent deal --- and she is right, but the fact that she made an important decision for both, and not for the first time, causes a blow-up.
