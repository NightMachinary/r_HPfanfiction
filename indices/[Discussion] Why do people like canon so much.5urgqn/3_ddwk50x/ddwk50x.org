On one hand, I absolutely hate canon rehash fics because I don't need to reread canon events hundreds of times. I especially hate them if the underlying conditions were greatly changed, such as Harry being raised by someone else.

On the other hand, I do enjoy missing moments from the canon, especially Ginny's POV during Year 6 and 7. Postwar gives writers even more freedom to work with.

My impression is that this sub prefers AU stories, while main HP likes canon compliant ones.
