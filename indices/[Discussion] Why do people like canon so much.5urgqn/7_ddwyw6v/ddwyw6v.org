There is a mentality in fandom: I love this work, so I have read it hundreds of times and know all the ins and outs of it. I know the recipe for Amortentia and could perform the wand movements for the Patronus Charm in my sleep. If someone says something that doesn't match my knowledge of the series, they're simply wrong.

Another mentality in fandom is: this work sets my creative juices flowing, so I'm going to see what I can come up with, using canon as a font of inspiration. Or I'm interested in seeing what other people can do when they take canon as their starting point.

Canon compliant fics attempt to appeal to both camps. So then because they are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue them out of my mouth.
