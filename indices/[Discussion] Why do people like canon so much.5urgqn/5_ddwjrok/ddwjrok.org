I'm not a writer, but I'm a fan of canon-ish stories. I liked the characters in the books, I liked the pairings, I liked the magical setting, and I want to read more of it.

I want to read more of these characters, I want to see what they were doing while Harry was somewhere else. I want to see these missing moments that weren't important to the plot, but that shaped the characters nonetheless. (/I also like canon-divergence stories, where it's set in the canon verse and everything is the same up until a certain point, because then the characters stay recognisable. Like what if Ron and Hermione got together after Ron's birthday in sixth year? How would that change the Horcrux hunt? Would Ron stay if one of his insecurities was proved to be false? Or would he still leave because his fear for his family and Harry's apparent nonchalance would still be there?/)

I don't read fics that name, for example, Daphne Greengrass as a main character. I have no connection to that character, she is a blank slate and might as well be an OC. Same with fics that have the characters act extremely OOC, if the only similarity to their canon counterpart is their name, then it's basically an OC and I click out. I don't want to read what an OC would do in a certain situation, I want to read how Harry (or Hermione, Ron, Luna etc...) would act.
