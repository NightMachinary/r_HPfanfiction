Reading through all these responses I still don't understand it. I like to read interesting fun fictions and often the future we can diverge from canon the better. I've read Fem!Harry, Evil!Harry, No!Harry and everything else in between, why would you just want to read about canon characters acting in canon compliant ways?!
