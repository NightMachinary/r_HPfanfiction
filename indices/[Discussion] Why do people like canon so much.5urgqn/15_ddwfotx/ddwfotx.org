I love the world of Harry Potter but found books six and seven disappointing. Therefore I like to read alternative versions of what could have been.

I dislike Ron, I openly admit it so I don't like fics where he is a good guy. He deserted Harry twice and treated Hermione horribly but somehow he is still the good guy at the end.

Snape and Dumbledore were forgiven, another strange idea that Rowling had. Snape was an utter bastard but hey, he lusted after Harry's dead mum so it's alright. Dumbledore was utterly incompetent. He had many important government functions, being close to a dictatorship (highest justice, head of parliament, head of magical UN, Head of special forces) he still did allow many Death Eaters to remain free instead of pushing for a trial.

The romance with Ginny had no build up. Rowling could have written it well but instead we have Harry being a jerk to Dean and stealing his girl with a potion coincidence (Felix Felicitas).

Molly knew about Harry's abuse and of course the first meeting where she loudly asks about the platform seems fishy as well. Still she's a good guy (woman).

Hermione stands always with Harry, unless it is beneficial for the plot not to. Being the rational, analytical person she is she wouldn't have ignored Harry in the summer of 95 or ignored his theory about Malfoy. Also her romance with Ron makes no sense. Treating a girl like shit is not a way to get her.

Canon has many faults and fanfiction can correct them. Therefore I see your point and don't get the love for canon either.
