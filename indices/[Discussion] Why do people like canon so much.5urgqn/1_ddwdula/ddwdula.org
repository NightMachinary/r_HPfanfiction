I view canon as a template. It's a good template, sure, but it can be expanded upon, rewritten to fit other tastes - even improved.

As for a fanfic being canon compliant - I feel that this is not positive or negative by itself.

You want to write a canon-compliant story? Great. That means you feel there's something to say that goes parallel with canon events. Hopefully it's entertaining.

You want to write non-canon compliant fanfic? Well you get the added privilege of building upon /why/ your shit is different from canon, what it offers and how it makes your story good. The burden is on you to prove changing the template is worth it.

For me, results matter. Is the story good? Is it clever? Did I enjoy reading it? Did it entertain me? If some of the answers are positive I couldn't give a fuck on how the story relates to canon.
