You have your main plot outlined, the ending planned, and most of the steps inbetween. You have to then make a few minute changes, and work on characterization a lot. And don't get me wrong, characterization is one of the more challenging things in writing to do, and frankly the most important, but you have to do all those plus the aforementioned detailed for completely AU or wildly divergent fics.
