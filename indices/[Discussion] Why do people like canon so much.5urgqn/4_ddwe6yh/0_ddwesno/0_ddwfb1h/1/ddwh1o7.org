Not necessarily. I can see what you mean because obviously for something like my fic Not From Others this was the case (but then there is the challenge of making it seem believable and interesting when everyone has their own headcanons), but for something that is post hogwarts like my fic the Aurors I still had to construct a complex plot that was not prepped for me. My readers didn't know what was going to happen, yet I didn't break any canon rules. You could argue that was because it was post hogwarts, but I would say that any good canon compliant fics that takes place within the time frame of the books should also have another plot line that gives some element of mystery or suspense to the reader. If you're not constructing any plot yourself you're going to end up boring people. For example, you might want to show what happened to Dean during DH. Well, you could construct an entire new plot line that wasn't set out in canon. All you would have to include would be that at some point he meets Ted Tonks and Co, and that he ends up at Shell cottage and ultimately the battle. Theres all this extra time that you have to fill, and that is where your original writing has to be. I won't deny that I found NFO far easier to write because there was an established timeline for me to follow, but it came with its own challenges and there were points where it was tempting to ignore canon.
