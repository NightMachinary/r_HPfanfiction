A rather large downside, in my opinion, since often, there is a need for quite convoluted explanations and excuses to make canon fit, which hurts a story. As an example, trying to explain why Dumbledore took a broom to travel to London in book 1 usually leads into "senile!Dumbledore" or "Manipulative!Dumbledore" territory. Much better to assume he was apparating or using the floo, but to an emergency he couldn't easily leave.
