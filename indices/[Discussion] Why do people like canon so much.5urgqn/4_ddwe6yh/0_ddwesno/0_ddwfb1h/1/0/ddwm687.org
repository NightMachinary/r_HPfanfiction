I actually would think canon-compliant makes a bit more trouble, since canon contradicts itself so often, and introduces really stupid stuff that would be vastly overpowered, if only someone would think of using them efficiently (House Elves, Unbreakable Vow, several spells, Taboo). So, if I want to stay canon compliant, I have to figure out how to explain why my characters don't call elves in for that problem, or decide that instead of killing the three Death Eaters they'll offer them the opportunity to swear an unbreakable vow to fight Voldemort and help muggleborns instead, or why no one wanted to use the taboo to track down the Unforgivable, etc.

But when I'm going AU I can simply say: My house elves can't do all that stuff, they are simple servants. There are no Unbreakable Vows. Taboo doesn't work.
