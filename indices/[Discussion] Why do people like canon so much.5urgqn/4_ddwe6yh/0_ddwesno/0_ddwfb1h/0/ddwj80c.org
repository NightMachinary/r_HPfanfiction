I can't see why you think the main plot is already outlined. In my own fics I have made up brand new plots which converge with canon events here and there but were certainly not already outlined for me -- other than I knew where it had to end. Although writing fanfiction generally is easier than writing original fiction, mainly because of the worldbuilding, there are very distinct challenges to making a new story fit into a prescribed set of events and I have often thought it would be easier to just ignore the difficult bits.
