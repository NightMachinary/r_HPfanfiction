You're talking about writing a compelling story that people would recommend to their friends.

If the objective is simply to complete a story, staying close to canon reduces the amount of work you have. You don't have to explain to the reader how your world differs from canon. You don't have to come up with a plot. You don't have to figure out how diverse actors would react to circumstances and how their plots would conflict. You don't need to come up with macguffins. You don't need to think how events would change someone's characterization compared to canon.

It's a lot less work for a lower quality product.

Alternatively, if you want to write a higher quality story that's consistent with canon, you have all the work of writing an interesting AU fic, and you also have additional work to ensure that canon events happen on schedule.
