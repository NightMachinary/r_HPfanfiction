Look, when the Canon was published, it opened an entire new world of imagination to the readers. And that's what I love about Harry Potter World. That it showed us a beauty of human imaginations.

An extreme example: I don't believe in religions. But I have read Bible, Gita, Quran etc because all of them shows us a world of imagination (whether it's real or not.)

As for canon compliant fanfictions, I usually avoid it. Because I have an imagination of JK Rowlings' word & world. I would prefer how differently other people captures their imagination of HP world, not JKR's imagination of HP world.
