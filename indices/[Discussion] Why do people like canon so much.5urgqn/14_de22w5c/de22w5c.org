The way I see it, fanfic is to its canon is as original fiction is to real life. (If you prefer the SAT notation, "fanfic : its canon :: original fiction : real life".) Just as real life provides a point a common --- but not completely common --- point of reference for the readers of any fiction, canon provides one for the readers of a fanfic. Many of the same notions about realism (i.e., how a work of fiction relates to the real life) apply to the relationship between a fanfic and its canon.

In particular, when an work of fiction's setting and characters deviate from what can be found in real real life, including creation of fictional people (i.e., is there a point to this character?), technologies that don't exist in real life (i.e., sci-fi), or magic (i.e., fantasy), there has to be a good reason for it --- there must be a pay-off. The pay-off can be as simple as providing aesthetically pleasing descriptions, or they can be integral to the story, in that the story is not even remotely possible without the elements not found in real life, but there must be /some/ pay-off, because every deviation imposes a cost on the reader: reading time, cognitive (e.g., keeping track of what's different), emotional (e.g., people not acting like they do in real life), and generally makes immersion more difficult.

Analogously, every alternation to the canon setting, addition of OCs, or removal or modification of well-defined canon characters, it costs something, and the change has to pay off.
