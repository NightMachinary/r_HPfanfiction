I have also read those. I'm one of those people who have read probably tens of millions of words of fanfiction of all kinds of things and it's quite hard to find something both high quality and new. I just really love new twists and looks taken even from low quality works and making new and interesting variations from a static base. Something about how so many awesome divergences from a setting that stays the same is just massively enjoyable
