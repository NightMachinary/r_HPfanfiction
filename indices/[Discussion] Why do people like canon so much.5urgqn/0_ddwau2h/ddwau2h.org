If I wanted to read something completely different I'd read an actual published book. For me fanfiction is about exploring the 'what if...?'s in a story. A point of divergence and exploring how that effects the characters and/or plot. Sure it may sound slightly boring, but it's pure personal indulgence and certainly not the only thing I read.
