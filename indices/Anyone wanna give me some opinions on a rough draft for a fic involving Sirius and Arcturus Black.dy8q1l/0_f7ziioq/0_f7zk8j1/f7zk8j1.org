ah, sure! The ravenclaw rebellion was basically a club within the order of the Phoenix that held meetings every week, they were dedicated mostly to research, scavenger hunts, things of that nature. Basically, as Sirius described it, a swot-fest. Thanks so much for your input! I'm glad you liked it, it especially means a lot considering Im a huge fan of your Black family fics as well!
