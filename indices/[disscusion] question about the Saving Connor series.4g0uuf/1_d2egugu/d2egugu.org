Yes, you are.

This fic is extraordinary, and I assume the author has some experience or study in mental health issues because it is so accurate. It caused me to experience a lot of emotions and thoughts that hugely improved my life and helped me work through things that I hadn't even realised were an issue until I saw Harry face them.

It does get a bit bogged down later, though, although it does wrap everything up at the end.

Also, look at the dates: it seemed to update with a new, extensive chapter every single day for 7 long, novel-length books. How?
