It's definitely a remarkable piece of work, but I have to admit I only read the lot because I hate to leave things unfinished and it's not something I would ever read again. As a writer, I envy the author's skill, but the story is intense and as you said very emotionally evocative, but a lot of those emotions are negative ones that you have to be in the right mind to handle.
