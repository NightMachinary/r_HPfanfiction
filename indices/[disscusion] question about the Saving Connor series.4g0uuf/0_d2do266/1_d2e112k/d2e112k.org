  I did eventually stop reading somewhere in the sixth book since I realized none of that was healthy.

I didn't have as much problem with /what/ emotions it was trying to instigate as with /how/ it was trying to do that.

The regular formula that was used over and over was that 1. there is an OPed person currently in control of Harry's life; 2. they think\say they want to help Harry but their actions are much more harmful than helping; 3. Harry eventually manages to “win” against them against all odds.

The problem I had with it was that /all/ OPed characters like this were acting like fucking idiots. Dumdledore, what's-his-name Dumbledore's mentor, Lily, etc --- if you think about it, their only /real/ motivation was not to effectively manipulate Harry in-universe, but to manipulate the reader's emotions out of it.^{1} Once you realise this, you don't even get frustrated by their idiotic actions --- you either close the story entirely or start skipping frustrating parts to read the interesting ones (e.g. descriptions of magic and battle scenes).

^{1} well, that and maybe to support author's opinion that preventively disabling a walking potential WMD controlled by a child's mind is /eeviii~l/.
