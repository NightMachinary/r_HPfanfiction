Yes. The whole series caused me to strongly feel a wide variety of emotions. Anger, relief, despair... and very rarely happiness. I skipped school because I had to know things got better for Harry and, honestly, I fell a bit into depression. This was in high school, mind you. I did eventually stop reading somewhere in the sixth book since I realized none of that was healthy.

Still, a story that can cause such a reaction is impressive and thus I always recommend it.
