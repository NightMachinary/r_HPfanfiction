I agree with pretty much all of it.

The swish thing was mostly a joke. And the reason I want Ron to know random muggle stuff is because they inhabit the same world. So Ron should have some peripheral knowledge.

But he is a 11 year old kid, growing in a post war society. A society that is mired in providing an explanation as well as justification for their pro-bloodlines sentiment.

So, the propaganda will leak into art and literature. Especially a comic about "Mad Muggle". In my story, mad muggle is this unfortunate chap, who is a bit simple, mostly harmless (propaganda- muggles are simple, they need a master), who always gets stuck in some situation or another.

Muggles having something as natural as anxiety, which every human has, being portrayed as a muggle thing is also another silly thing included in Mad Muggle. To put this idea of superiority of magic, without actually saying that. Sublime messaging and all that.

Which is basically saying all dogs are scooby doo. So, that's what Ron is using as a guide. As he goes through life, he will learn that people are people. Magical or otherwise.

I can see why it might not come off as that. I really wasn't writing this as a story. Just a one-shot.
