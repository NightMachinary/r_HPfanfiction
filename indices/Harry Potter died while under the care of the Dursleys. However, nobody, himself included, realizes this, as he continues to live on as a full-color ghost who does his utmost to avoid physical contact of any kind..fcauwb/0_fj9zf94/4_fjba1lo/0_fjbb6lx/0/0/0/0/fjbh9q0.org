I agree. And that is the plan. If I reach there. I find it weird that Ron, and other kids too, would be so flabbergasted by phones or pens. I mean, I understand, JKR had her reasons. But since I am writing this, I want a more intertwined, and more misunderstood worlds. I don't want Hermione or Harry to adjust as well as Ron to magic, either. Because formative years can help with lot of conditioning. So, I want the trio to help each other grow into this.

I also plan to slow down the friendship plan.. and I don't know.. I have all these ideas for plot. But I am basically writing and seeing what fits.

But yeah, that is definitely the plan. I want to show and not tell. Ron has weird ideas about muggles, that seem harmless, but are dangerous. And it is okay, as long as he is willing to learn better. I also want to bring Draco and Neville as contrast. But like I said, I won't know the direction until I am writing it.

I posted the story on ao3 with 3 new chapters.
