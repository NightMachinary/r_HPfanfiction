Magic may exist, but there's logic to it. There's even a theory behind it.

This is why there was a wizarding school, rather than a big book of spells. There are limitations.

Magic doesn't do well around electronics being a small example. Healing magic is (theorized) to be temperamental, and even dangerous at times--- much like our technology is temperamental and dangerous at times. Potions can often help, but not always cure. You take a sleeping draught like you take nighttime medication, but that doesn't cure all the insomnia for the rest of your life.

Note; I'm only bringing this up, because I've seen some strangeness in fics that will pull me out of the story if it's too wildly explained.

If I see one more story with “muggle cigarettes”, I might lose my mind. The cultures were different, but there were overlaps. I'm pretty sure wizards still had combs, and toothpaste. They still had to cook, they couldn't just poof a meal from nothing.
