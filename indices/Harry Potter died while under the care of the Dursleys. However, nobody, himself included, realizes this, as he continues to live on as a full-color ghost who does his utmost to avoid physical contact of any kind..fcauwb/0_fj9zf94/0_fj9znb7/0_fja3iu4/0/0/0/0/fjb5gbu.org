Thank you. :)

I was thinking the same thing. So, the way it is set, it's not obvious on first look that Harry has the unfortunate case of death. So, if he is not following the obvious rules of death, he has leeway to break the other rules too.

Which means Ron, with his limited, but still decent, knowledge of the magical world will have to explore other options and include other characters as the story goes on.

As for NHN, that's a good idea. I was thinking of involving the Baron, as the most powerful ghost, but Ron would be more comfortable with NHN. He can perhaps act like a bridge.

I am also using other POVs to expand the story beyond the trio. Though they will be the central element.
