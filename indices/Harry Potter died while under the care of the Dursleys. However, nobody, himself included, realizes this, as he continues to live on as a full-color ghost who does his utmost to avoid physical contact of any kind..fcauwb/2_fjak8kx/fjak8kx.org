Evil is remarkable banal. You wouldn't say it, looking at comic strips where Evil is as comfortable far away from the average viewer as is reasonable possible, but it really is more about snatching the last piece of bread, /knowing/ someone will go hungry tonight. Evil is giving that last kick in someones stomach, in some darkened corner of a hidden room (after everybody else was already gone but surely you didn't hurt him much?). Evil is not even bothering naming the person in your head, althought... Evil is forgetting they exist after a house-fire. Oh, it wasn't on /purpose/. Nothing as clever as that. It was, however, frighteningly easy to be on your way to a new home, glad everyone survived, before thinking 'shit, we forgot the Freak!' It is.

The Freak in question (AKA the Boy, Boy-Who-lived, Harry Potter), was remarkable dense in some aspects of his life (pretty much anything Dursley-related). It helped that his annual letter arived the day after the fire, and that he was used to strange dreams. He quickly forgot about his dreams of the fire, and moved on to Hogwarts. His one true home at last. He didn't eat much, unlike the previous years, but that could be attributed to stress, and grieve, and thousand other things. Nobody noticed him skipping more meals, caught up as they were in ever-new adventures. Nobody noticed -at first- when his shadow disappeared, once, on a moonlit night. He didn't sleep, but that, too, could be explained. The nightmares (or he was just mental. Something involving a chicken and a egg, in most minds). He jerked away from touch, which /wasn't/ unusual really. So nobody, including the dear departed himself, was aware he was dead. Not even Dumbledore seemed to suspect (though it is impossible to guess, even now, how much that man knows and suspects). Hermione, who didn't believe anything that wasn't properly detailed in books before, managed to miss all the clues. No, it was Ron who, on a late moonlit adventure (in which they all hoped the only adventure would be kicking Mrs. Norris, the caretakers cat) noticed that Harry had lost his shadow. And then, that he glided through a stair and went on again. In the magic world, at least, names have Power. Even -or maybe especially- nicknames. They are part of a identity, a identity self-chosen or chosen by others (in a way, Peter had always been doomed to rat out, just as Remus had been to be bitten). And Harry was (reluctantly) the Boy-who-Lived. He just wasn't alive anymore.
