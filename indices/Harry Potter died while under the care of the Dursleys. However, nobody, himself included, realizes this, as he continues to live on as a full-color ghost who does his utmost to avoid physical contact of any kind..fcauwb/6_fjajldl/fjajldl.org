Reminds me of The First in /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, who could take on the image of a dead person, but couldn't personally interact.

There was a thought for a while that Giles was maybe The First. No one had touched him, there was always some sort of buffer preventing it: someone stepping in the way of a hug or him asking someone else to hand something to some one, etc.
