  The sorting hat? It would be kinda obvious that he's a phantom when it falls right through him. The teachers especially would instantly know. for that matter, all other objects, like clothing and books and bags and potion ingredients?

Subconscious telekinesis?

  his wand? ghosts can't handle real objects, and peeves isn't a ghost, he's a poltergeist. Not a real soul, but an amagamation of chaotic forces given life by magic.
#+end_quote

Again, subconscious telekinesis?

  his magic? Even if he can hold a wand (perhaps the bond between wand and wizard is strong enough for the wand to join him in the spirit world, or the wand basically "dies" and harry picks up the ghost of his wand, god that's a weird concept), ghosts can't do magic. At least not on the real world. Don't think pretending to be extremely bad would work for long.

He could just be really bad at everything until he gets to Wingardium Leviosa, and then just TKs that?
