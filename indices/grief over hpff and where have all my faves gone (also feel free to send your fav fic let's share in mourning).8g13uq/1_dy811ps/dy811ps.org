Deathcrow linked to the backup of HPFF, but if you don't want to download that entire file, here are some of the fics I downloaded:

Aiedail's [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g869I1-Um-ARBEQI5BcxNz6oovwTYtid/view][It's Called Adventure]] and the unfinished sequel, [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/18fFIHV634v3dz1l6qlwXKOkYGMR7JytC/view][An Improbable Fiction]]

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw8o0RludA_Ka3JRS3k2ZU5jV1E][some of tehtarik's fics]] (I didn't save Background Noise, but there are some of their HPFF-exclusive works in this folder)

hedwidgeon's [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8o0RludA_KTmw4T3pkLXNYOFU/view][Hey, Fred]]

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ayN4ZEDGliYeWS7ZS-oFoLVMx3QxcsGr][some of celticbard's fics]]

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw8o0RludA_KNWYzb0FNUXVtVkk][Toujours Padfoot's fics]] (Run, Purgatory)

And you can always try the Wayback machine:
