I think I read one like that long time ago. He goes to Westeros and travles to YiTi(that's name of the place I think) and decides to help God Emperors daughter to overthrow her father. He wins war against all the nobles single handedly but when he returns to YiTi capital he learns the truth. I don't want to post spoilers. I don't remember the story name.
