I don't usually read gender-swap fics, but I'd seen enough buzz around this fic to try it. Still, I went in with limited enthusiasm and would not have if I hadn't been in a similar drought to yours :).

I read all the fics in the series, actually felt compelled to comment on each one, and am looking forward to each update. Seriously, it's a good series. I usually hate OC's but again this series is the exception. It's just really good writing with compelling character development, good original plots, and excellent pacing. I'm definitely a fan.
