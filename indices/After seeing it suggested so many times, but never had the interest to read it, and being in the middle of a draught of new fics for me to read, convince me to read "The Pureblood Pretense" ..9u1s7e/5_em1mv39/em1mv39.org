I think what did it for me was Violet's (the author) ability to keep track of so many world building elements that you're constantly caught by surprise, even when you sort of know how the books will end based on canon. It's the kind of story that has its own community of fans who discuss the plot lines in detail and try to predict what will happen next. It even has a ton of fanfiction of its own.

Some people find the whole switch ruse unbelievable but Violet does a good job at explaining how people will always believe what they see when the truth is too impossible to even consider. Additionally, Harry/Archie develop better magical ways to conceal their identities over time, and their friends and family eventually find the lie much easier to believe than the truth.

Those who complain that Harry/Rigel is a potions-obsessed squib have unfortunately not read far enough to learn the truth behind her control issues. It has nothing to do with a /lack/ of magic.

Harry/Rigel is a socially awkward girl pretending to be a boy who would like nothing more than to lock herself up in a potions lab and learn from Snape (her idol) until she earns her potions mastery. For reasons beyond her control, however, she's constantly dragged into situations that put her under the spotlight because she's anything but normal.

Aside from Harry herself, most of the characters are well developed at least to the point where you can't just replace Slytherin A with Slytherin B like they're the same person. Even the most likable characters have their flaws, and that includes Harry herself.
