  “canon but one thug is different” story

Yeah, I hate those fics where they swap Goyle for Nott or Zabini but keep everything else the same.

In all seriousness though it is a fun story. A bit different from anything else that's out there right now and quite a compelling read. Better than a lot of other stuff you might stumble upon.
