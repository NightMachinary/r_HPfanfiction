The first book was alright. From the second onward the author lost almost all sense of measure and restraint; 30k word chapters with huge, rambling paragraphs choke full of unnecessary detail. Unrealistic depiction of children and teenagers (this was my biggest peeve). In fact all character interaction feels... plastic.

Also, grimdark. I skimmed the later books quite a bit trying to salvage my reading of this story (I like the premise) and the world the author has created is a miserable place. And it only gets worse. (combine that with the rambling thing I mentioned, the end result is not pretty). So probably grimblue would be more accurate, cause it's just depressing.
