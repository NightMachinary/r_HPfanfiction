It has a sane Tom Riddle who is a politician, and the best execution of this idea that I've read. I absolutely love stories without Voldemort, because his absence alone frees the author to a large extent. It takes old overused cliches and uses them well. It gets better with each book. I was in the same position as you, but it really exceeded my expectations and is now easily in my top ten and number 1 fem Harry.

The plotlines come from both Song of The Lioness and HP, but the execution is quite different. The AU is well thought out, and the characterization makes you think, yeah, this is what they would probably be like in a world without Voldemort. The AU isn't *too* AU like Hell Eyes, and you don't need to know anything about Alanna the Lioness to be able to enjoy it.
