I had many of the same objections to it but honestly the fic outgrows most of what you mentioned.

1. The switch is sort of the core premise of the book the fusion is based on, and she's not outed in the first book like in the original source material, and is still not really outed. She goes to great lengths to protect it as the fic moves on.
2. Without too many spoilers, this is intended, has reasons that are explained later, is consistent with the worldbuilding and it is not a permanent state of affairs.
3. I'm assuming you're referring to the scene in the starting with Pansy, but honestly, that is the worst it gets. I dropped the fic at the same point but I went back to it and it was absolutely worth it. The political scenes that come later are more or less straightforward.
