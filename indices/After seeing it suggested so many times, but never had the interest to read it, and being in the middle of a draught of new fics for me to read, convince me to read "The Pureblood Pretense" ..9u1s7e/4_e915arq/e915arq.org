I'm not a fan personally. This is for three main reasons:

1. The story glosses over its own premise. The Harriet-Archie switch is executed far too easily, and Harriet has no real reaction to being a girl living among boys. I'm sure that later in the story she is outed and there's some fallout from that, but on a personal, /character/ level the story acts as if the only difference between boys and girls is long vs short hair.

2. The story makes Harriet a squib with a wand. Her ability with potions does not even come close to balancing this out. I also dislike what it implies about magical theory (and indeed the fic using intent-based magical theory for wand magic).

3. Political!Kids where they're all analysing each other's words for hidden meaning.
