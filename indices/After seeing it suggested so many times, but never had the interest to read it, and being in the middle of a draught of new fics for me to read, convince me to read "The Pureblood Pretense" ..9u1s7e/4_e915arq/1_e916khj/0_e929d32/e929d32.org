She's not a squib, but for reasons-that-could-probably-be-considered-spoilers, she has trouble using wand magic at first.

I didn't personally like the story, for many of the reasons already listed. Added to that is the fact that it has “magical cores” as a key plot element, which I despise as a trope (though, in fairness, it deals with them in a creative and wholly unique way so YMMV).
