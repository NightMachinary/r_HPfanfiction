Squib in the Neville sense, not in the literal sense. I don't know if it gets better in later chapters or not -- it was the "nope" moment for me where I quit the fic.

  Is it Political Kids for internal politics(house politics) or as if they're mini-Lords ? Cuz I usually dislike mini-Lords but don't mind house politics if its well done, kinda like in HP and PoS.

Neither, really. It's not even really "politics". It's more... Jane Austen type social interactions. Only turned up to 11. And they're 11.
