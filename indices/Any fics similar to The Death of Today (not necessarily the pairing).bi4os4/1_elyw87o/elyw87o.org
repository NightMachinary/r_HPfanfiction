I can think of three stories:

The Art of Hidden Personas by Whitedwarf linkffn(5675879), Salvation in Shadow by odev linkffn(9735652) and Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW linkao3(7040089).

The first two haven't been updated in a while, but I think Salvation in Shadow was almost finished. The Art of Hidden Personas has almost 200.000 words, so also quite a bit to read. Consuming Shadows is still being updated. Salvation is Shadows is not HP/LV but does have lots of Slytherin sneakiness and mystery.
