You can definitely tell an American wrote that, heh.

A fifteen year old dating a seventeen year old wouldn't cause anyone to bat an eye in the UK, so Alicia panicking like that was just strange to see from a fellow Brit.

Being 'lynched' from the likes of Romilda and other fangirls? Yeah, I could see that, though.

Hell, one of my friends was sixteen and she was dating a twenty-one year old, when I was younger.

Age gaps with people being in the same sort of generation as each other aren't really that big of a deal over here, unless they're ludicrous and/or there's something else going on (e.g. coercion).
