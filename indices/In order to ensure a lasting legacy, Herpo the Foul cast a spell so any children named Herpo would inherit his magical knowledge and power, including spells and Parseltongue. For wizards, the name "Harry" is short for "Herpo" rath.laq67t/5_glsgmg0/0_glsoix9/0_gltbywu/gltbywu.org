Huh, cool idea. So 'real' magic would be complex and difficult to perform, but the spells taught at Hogwarts with the wand-waving and magic words actually work to access different spell engines created a long while ago?\\
The specific construction of wands was added to most spell engines a while back to prevent accidents with uncontacted muggleborns, but there are still a few older engines and devices in different countries which can let people cast without a wand?\\

That has adventure potential; to try and cripple Voldemort's forces, Harry, Ron and Hermione, perhaps assisted by Bill Weasley, set out to try and track down and destroy the source of power for the Imperius, and other dark curses.
