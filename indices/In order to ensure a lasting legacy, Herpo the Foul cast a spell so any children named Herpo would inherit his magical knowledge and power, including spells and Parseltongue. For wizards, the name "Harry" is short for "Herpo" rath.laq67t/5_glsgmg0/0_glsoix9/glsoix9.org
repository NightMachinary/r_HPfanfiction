Why not both? I like the aesthetic this sort of thing adds to the setting. Just explain it by saying that any piece of magic designed to activate when certain conditions are met is recharged by taking some magical energy as payment whenever a magical person activates it, and so doesn't wear down over time.

This would also explain why all the incantations for spells sound like something a human might pick for the effects they have. All the spells people learn to cast at Hogwarts are the same kind of thing as the structure that empowers Herpo's heirs and squib-ifies people who try to sign for Archibald. The reason the summoning spell works is that someone put a variant of the Taboo Curse on the word "accio" that summons things instead of telling Voldemort where you are.

That might also be an explanation for where blood purism came from.

- Originally, there was a real hazard that muggleborn people would trip over some ancient cursed word or phrase or action and hurt someone, whereas magical parents taught their children what to avoid saying and doing
- So people were understandably cautious of having muggleborn people around
- But when you give some people an excuse to be bigots, they latch on with great enthusiasm and never let go
- And so even though most of the really bad curses on words and actions have been deactivated using modern cursebreaking techniques, the bigots still hate muggleborns.

Also, maybe magical society likes its traditions so much not because tradition is cool, but because they're not sure what some ancient dark wizard cursed, so it's better to keep doing what's been tested and found to be safe.
