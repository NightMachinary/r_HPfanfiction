Vile!Harry is best Harry. The Lesser Sandness, linkffn(10959046) sadly abandoned, has a similar premise, the souls of three truly vile dark magic masters stuck to his own, with full access to their personalities and knowledge, stunned Voldemort barely making it alive. And Harry developing a taste for sadistic violence.
