Perhaps the Herpo's Heir Phenomenon can only happen once a generation, or when the older Heir dies? The affected child will obviously keep what they inherited a secret, too.

Perhaps "Harry" is only close enough because noone actually names their child "Herpo" because of the stigma (the same way noone names their child "Emeric" or "Voldemort" or "Gellert"), so the magic jumped to the closest linguistic cousin and started afflicting that. Harry could conceivably be short for Herpo, which was enough for the spell to take effect.
