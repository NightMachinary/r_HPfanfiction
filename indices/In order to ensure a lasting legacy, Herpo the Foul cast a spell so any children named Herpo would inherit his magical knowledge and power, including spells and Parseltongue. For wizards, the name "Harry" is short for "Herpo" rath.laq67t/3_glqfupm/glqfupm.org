Tom Riddle wanted to pretend he had the power, so he gave himself the name "Foul, the Dead" and then translated it into French to sound cooler. Unfortunately, holding your first meeting with your followers in a windswept graveyard has some negative consequences, and what they heard was "Voldemort."

Tom shrugged and moved on with his life. It took several years before he figured out the anagram thing. He crapped his pants in surprise, and made sure to update his diary Horcrux's memories to make it seem like it was intentional. Everything was going good until he heard a prophecy that might lead to his downfall involving one of two children. One of them was named Neville, and Tom crapped his pants again when he saw the other one's name.
