/"The first mentions of the "Curse of Legacy" as it was later named, go as far back as the Battle of Actium, though there are unconfirmed rumours of it's effects starting with its creators demise. At the time, most have dismissed children going mad as the will of gods (more on the Council of Mount Olympus on page 10345) or exposure to cursed artifacts or even improperly stored potions ingredients./

/Herpesus Agrippa, the lesser known nephew of the muggle historical figure and a bearer of the curse, described it's effects as an insidious whisper, trying to seep into his mind and soul like poison, foreign concepts and eldritch knowledge promising untold power, while steadily eroding at his sense of self. To this day it remains a mystery if such was the prpose of the curse, or if it is merely a remnant of the vile one and the river of memories that smothered his youthful flames. No more of Herpesus' accounts survived, which might be connected to the fact that he'd taken his own life at age 12, overcome by madness and pain, covered in dark flame and bleeding from all orfices./

/Other accounts from that time state that the curse started affecting the boy the moment he was capable of recognizing his name and giving a coherent response, and grew in potency as the mental development of its host progressed./

/A curious bit of trivia is that there was another boy named Herpo at the time, a son of stable hand half a year older than the Agrippa, but slow as a result of a head injury while young. No other boys of that generation were affected, but the very next one the brightest of the blessed of Hecate was also cursed by the black flames of Herpo the Foul's legacy..."/
