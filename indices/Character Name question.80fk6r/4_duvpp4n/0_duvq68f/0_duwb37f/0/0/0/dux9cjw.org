I have Marius' son and his family move back to the UK in summer of 1994 after his wife dies.

I had the picture in my head that it would be Remus who finds them after Sirius who is staying with him. Since the uncle who gave Sirius the money when he ran away is dead. Although, I feel like Andromeda woukd probably be the one they would contact. since they were closer.
