You could have them try to contact Sirius as he is their head of house effectively. If they are wanting Marius's grandson to be one of the Blacks then it would make sense to go to Sirius. That's the route I am taking but slightly more convoluted. Borrow the idea if you want, all this is just a minor point of my story.
