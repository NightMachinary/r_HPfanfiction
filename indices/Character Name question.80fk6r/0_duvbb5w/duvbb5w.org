Marius is the name of a moon crater, so maybe look that up instead. There's a lot of 'normal' names there that would fit in with the Muggle world (Carol, Charles, Natasha, Mary, Mavis, Melissa, Michael, Robert, Rosa, Ruth, Stella, Susan, Walter... Yeah, there's a lot of possibilities). I'd also make sure those names were used in that time period.
