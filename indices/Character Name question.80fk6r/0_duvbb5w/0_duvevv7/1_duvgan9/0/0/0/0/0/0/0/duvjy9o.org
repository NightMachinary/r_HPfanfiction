My Marius is kicked out per usual. He is taken in by a well-off muggle family. They send him to Eton where he discovers his love of cooking. He graduates Eton and starts working his way up. He meets a muggle woman. They have a whirlwind romance and get married in 1949. She falls pregnant quite soon after their marriage. Their son much to Marius' relief doesn't show signs of magic.

The son meets a French woman in the mid-1970s like his parents before him they have a whirlwind romance and a quick pregnancy after marriage.
