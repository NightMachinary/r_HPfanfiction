Kicked out of the family for being a squib, moved away and tried to raise his family following the traditions of his family, only without magic. His son shows promise with many magical signs but is still classified as a squib. He gets a job in an Irish shopping district and meets a muggleborn witch. They move to Wales when she get ill as they are told she has a greater chance of living there but she dies, leaving behind her husband and son. Corvus's father tries to homeschool him using his wife school books as he doesn't like British Magical culture (or any culture as he's a loner) and he doesn't know French to teach Corvus enough to get into Beauxbatons.
