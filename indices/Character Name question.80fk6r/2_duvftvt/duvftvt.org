Okay so Blacks seem to like Astronomy based names. Keeping with that theme:

Simon Marius: he independently found the four major moons of Jupiter (days after Galileo. But his names for them are the ones we use: Io, Callisto, Ganymede and Europa.

Marius Hills are Volcanic domes found on the Moon. Names you could use associated with Marius Hills: Oceanus (where they are found), Clementine (A spacecraft that analysed them), Selene (another spacecraft).

Marius is also a crater on the moon: Rainer, Kepler, Bessarion, Milichius, Encke are all craters near Marius.
