I think the post meant their dreams, not the actual accomplishments. Like imagining Charlie's dream was to free the Gringotts dragon. Perhaps Percy's dream was to...um...win an Order of Merlin, and maybe Bill liked imagining himself as a dashing hero saving the day...or perhaps just his mum not making a fuss over his choice of wife ;) George could've dreamed of being the main hero in a Quidditch match, and Fred probably wanted to be a successful co-owner of a popular joke shop franchise...
