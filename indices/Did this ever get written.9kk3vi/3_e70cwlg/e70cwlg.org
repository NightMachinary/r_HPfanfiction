But come to think of it? Didn't Ron already achieve what most of his brothers did and eventually did even better than them? He was a Prefect and also a part of the Quidditch team and won the House Cup for them too when Harry wasn't playing in both fifth and sixth year. He rode a dragon, broke into Gringotts, helped fight Death Eaters and destroyed Horcruxes. That's more badass than all the Weasleys combined!
