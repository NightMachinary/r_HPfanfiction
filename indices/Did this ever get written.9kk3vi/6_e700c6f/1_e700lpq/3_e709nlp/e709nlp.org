I'm quite curious about why this is being downvoted when it's a valid point.

In my experience, and regarding polls, most slash is written by females. If you go into smut, the sex is incredibly dull, often forced and slanted, and the relationships fall into stereotypes. Harry is either feminine* to the core or bursts out in tears because someone, mainly his crush, said his hair looked messy.

I meant feminine as in he has the handwaving, flamboyant thing going on that I have not seen done in everyday life before.
