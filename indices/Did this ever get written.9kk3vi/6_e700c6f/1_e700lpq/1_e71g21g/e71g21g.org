YES! The reason i read slash is because the male characters in harry potter are so much more interesting and full of depth than the female characters in harry potter imo. And most if it doesn't have a lot of smut. Especially if you read the stuff on ffn rather than ao3. Unpopular opinion, but I'd much rather read something centered around Harry and Voldemort. Rather than Tonks or Fleur, who are practically OC's. And, most of them are pre-slash anyways, so it's about the relationship dynamic, not the sex. And again, unpopular opinion: But a working dynamic between complicated and opposing characters like Harry and Snape, Harry and Riddle, or Harry and Draco, has a lot more possibilities than Harry with veela Fleur.
