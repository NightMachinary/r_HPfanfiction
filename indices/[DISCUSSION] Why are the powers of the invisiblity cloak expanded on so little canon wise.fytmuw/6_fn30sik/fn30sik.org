As is always the case, J.K. Rowling is far better at writing an entertaining book than at producing a coherent plot. The Deathly Hallows are introduced as though they will be an interesting element of the story, but Rowling then goes on to violate the Chekhov's Gun rule by introducing them, making them seem like they'll be of enormous importance (especially the notion of the Master of Death) and then shoehorning them awkwardly in to the plot.

I don't want to give the impression I don't respect Rowling's ability to write. She's one of the best authors I've ever encountered; her commercial success is well deserved. She can't write a coherent plot, though. All the Harry Potter stories suffer from having idiotic plots in which huge elements make no sense. The fact that Rowling produces a wonderfully readable story in spite of this is a testament to her capacity to write well.
