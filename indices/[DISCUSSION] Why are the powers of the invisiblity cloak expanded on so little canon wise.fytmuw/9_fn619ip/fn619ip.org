It's a cloak that makes you invisible. That's a pretty useful power and is considered at length, including the limitations you bring up. It's a special invisibility cloak in that it doesn't degrade like other invisibility cloaks, but otherwise it doesn't prevent all detection or grant immortality or anything like that. If it did, it'd be called the Undetectability Cloak or the Immortality Cloak.

"Death itself" doesn't even exist in canon (or no more than the Easter bunny exists in the real world).

The only real plot hole around invisibility cloaks in canon is that we don't see any of the regular ones. They're just as useful and would be worthwhile in a major war, despite how expensive they are.
