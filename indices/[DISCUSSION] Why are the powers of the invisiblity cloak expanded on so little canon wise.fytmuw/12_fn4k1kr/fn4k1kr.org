Honestly I ignore JK's cannon when it comes to the cloak, among other things. I usually say that the cloak is able to fully conceal a fully grown wizard or witch, even from below. They can even stick their hand out and grab something without being seen. As long as it is properly fastened and worn, amd the user doesn't want to be seen, this applies, but if a bunch of young mages get under one cloak together, it has to reach down to all of their feet and cover their heads completely, along with all of them wishing not to be seen.
