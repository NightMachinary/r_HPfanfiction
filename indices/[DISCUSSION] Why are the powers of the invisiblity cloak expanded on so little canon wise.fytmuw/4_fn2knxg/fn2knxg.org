The story about Death was just a fairytale in canon. It arose because of the legend about three extremely talented brothers, who presumably all hand-crafted these objects. The wand and cloak are, possibly, the very best of their kind but not perfect. The stone is very clever but doesn't truly bring anyone back, which is part of the moral of the story.

The moral is that you can't beat death by outsmarting or being more skillful. The Peverell brothers were possibly the best inventors and craftsmen ever and they tried to beat Death and couldn't. You can only ''beat' Death by accepting your faith and coming quietly. That way you die a dignified death.

This is why Dumbledore thinks Harry truly was the right person to unite the objects (their unification carries a lit of symbolism especially for Dumbledore who once in the folly of youth believed in their powers and wanted to collect them all with Grindelwald). Harry did walk up to Death and let Voldemort kill him. And then of course he lived.

So that would be why lots of people like to think that it's the mastery of the three objects/death's equal that saved him, but that's not what the story meant at all. Equal to Death meant braving Death and not tryi g to find ways of being immortal. we know it's lily's sacrifice in Voldemort's blood that saves him, we know that the death thing is just a story and didn't make any difference.

It is very symbolic, though, and fits with the themes of the books.
