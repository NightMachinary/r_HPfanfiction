I mean, yes and no. What is good world-building? Is it all about consistency? If yes, then maybe she isn't the greatest.

But look at how many people say "I want to go to Hogwarts", assign themselves a house, have bought robes, ... vs. in LOTR. Crafting a world that people want to live in is a skill unto itself.

It's the same with George Lucas and Star Wars: maybe not the most consistent world, but light sabers and jedi are /cool/.

Which is why there is a Harry Potter world theme park, and why there's big Star Wars section at themeparks.

Compare this to the MCU, which has a world just as big if not bigger, also has urban fantasy elements, but is just way less cool, imo. What would you put in "MCU world"? The Stark tower?
