IMO, I think her approach is kind of like being a really good tour guide. You show the best and most interesting things in a place, make the people on the tour want to explore and do things in the place, but miss out a lot of the 'day-to-day' substance that actually makes a place work. No city tourist-tour will cover the sanitation plants, for example (though I'd really like to go on one that does :D), but they'd cover the cool castle and the government building and that place that singer lived that one time.

That's the kind of worldbuilding Rowling is truly phenomenal at - her world is a flimsy cardboard cutout coloured in on only one side by a mildly drunk six-year old, but she sells it incredibly well and makes it feel 'magic'. She's great at conveying emotive context, not so much the logic and structure.
