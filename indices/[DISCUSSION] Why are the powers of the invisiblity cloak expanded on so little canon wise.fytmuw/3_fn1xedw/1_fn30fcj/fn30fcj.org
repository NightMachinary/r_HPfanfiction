Yeah I think a lot of people don't realize that there's plenty of parts to writing and you can be excellent at some and suck at others. JK Rowling is an excellent storyteller HOWEVER she is not a very good worldbuilder. Those are two very different parts of writing, storytelling is what most people notice but world building is all about avoiding plot holes and many major writers aren't great at that. Her Twitter and pottermore site are attempts at world building but leave even bigger plot holes than the books did on their own.
