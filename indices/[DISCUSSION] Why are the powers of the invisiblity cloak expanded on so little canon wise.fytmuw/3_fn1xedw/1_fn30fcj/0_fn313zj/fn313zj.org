  HOWEVER she is not a very good worldbuilder. Those

Hm, I refer you to my [[https://gb.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fytmuw/discussion_why_are_the_powers_of_the_invisiblity/fn2wx3p/][what is good world-builing]] comment I just made.

  but world building is all about avoiding plot holes
#+end_quote

I mean, that's just wrong. Firstly, it's called "plot hole" not "worldbuiling hole" for a reason. And secondly, the only way to stay completely consistent is to not build any significant world at all -- no matter your skill. So a good world-builder needs at least some semblance of creativity, which Rowling has in spades.
