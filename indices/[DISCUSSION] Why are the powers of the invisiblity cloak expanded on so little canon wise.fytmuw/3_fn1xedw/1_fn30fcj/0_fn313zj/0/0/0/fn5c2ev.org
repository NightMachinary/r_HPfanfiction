Yes because whenever jk Rowling added rules to her creation she then later contradicted them. It's not like magic can't have rules, in fact she's claimed there are plenty of rules! But then she writes something that breaks those same rules. Every fictional universe has its own rules and laws but the better ones are consistent.
