I just listed two things that were stated to be hard rules, just because Rowling doesn't remember her own rules doesn't mean they don't exist.

Here's some hard rules that I can't think of a violation of:

-It's not possible to bring back the dead

-Food cannot be created from nothing

-You cannot go more than a day back in time

-You cannot use time travel to change the past

-Parseltongue can not be learned

There's probably plenty more but I don't feel like looking them up, however these are all HARD RULES even if Rowling struggles to explain a lot of them.

The world of Harry Potter is considered a fantasy with hard rules because they cast actual spells with consistent effects and their magic can be measured or predicted. In comparison, Lord of the Rings has soft rules because they just make vague comments and gestures about their magic and something unexpected happens.
