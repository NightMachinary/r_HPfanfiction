It is canonically questionable wether the cloak was a gift from death, or just made by one of three talented brothers.

And assuming the latter, it's an invisibility cloak that doesn't go bad with age, unlike any other. And that's worth something.

Also, from a storytelling perspective it makes it much better if Mrs. Norris can sense the presence, as it raises the stakes, and makes the scene more exciting for the 11 year olds reading the books.

Yes, this does mean that the world does appear to be not perfectly consistent in parts. But the cloak isn't part of some MMORPG where every artifact has to make sense and be balanced. It's job is to enable the telling of an exciting story, and it does fullfil that purpose.

To the guy that Rowling "isn't that good of a writer" and HP was just a fluke: of course there was a tremendous amount of luck involved in the success of the Harry Potter series. It had nice marketing, came at the right time, and had brilliant movies.

However, Rowling is good at writing stories, and building a world that feels real and exciting, and tells a great story in it. That takes skill. Maybe she isn't the best writer (whatever that means), but if you claim she's entirely unskilled, you just show your own ignorance.
