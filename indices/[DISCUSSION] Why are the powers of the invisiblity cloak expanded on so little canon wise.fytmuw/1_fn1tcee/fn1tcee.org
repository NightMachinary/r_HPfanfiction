Except it wasn't really a gift from Death itself, in reality it is a showcase of masterful enchantment and crafting on the part of the youngest Peverell brother. Dumbledore can see through it because of Homenium Revelio and Super-sensory Charms , Moody's eye doesn't see through but instead sees a gap that he identifies as Harry's cloak, and animals can smell people. Simple as that. As for the Accio, is that something shown in the books or that you read in fanfictions? Because the ones I read tell you can't use a number of spells and charms, including Accio, on it.
