I saw it as not being expanded on to play into the idea that nobody really knows much about the Hallows in general besides the wand.

In my head canon I always thought of it as one can literally avoid death (but just barely) by being under the cloak. Suffering from starvation and don't know if you'll be able to find food in the next month or so? Stay under the cloak and you'll live. You'll still be hungry, weak and miserable though. And if you take off the cloak before eating, you're on the train to the next great adventure.
