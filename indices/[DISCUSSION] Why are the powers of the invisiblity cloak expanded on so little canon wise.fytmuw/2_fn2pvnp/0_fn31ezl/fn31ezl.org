Exactly. Case in point, the introduction of side-along apparition in the 6th book introduces plot holes in the previous two books.

It's minor in the 4th because the Weasleys didn't need the portkey to travel to the World Cup (certainly the Diggorys didn't) but Rowling needed to introduce portkeys. It's much bigger in the 5th book since the Order could've transported Harry using side-along instead of brooms.
