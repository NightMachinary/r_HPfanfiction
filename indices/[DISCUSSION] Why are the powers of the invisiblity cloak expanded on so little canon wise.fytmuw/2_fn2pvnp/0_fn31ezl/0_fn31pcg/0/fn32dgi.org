The time turners could've been used better in the 3rd book itself if Dumbledore had gone back in time with Harry and Hermione. While the two did what they did in canon, Dumbledore could've disillusioned himself and recaptured Pettigrew after he transformed and escaped. But /no/, plot needed to happen so Dumbledore sends two teenagers to mess with time.
