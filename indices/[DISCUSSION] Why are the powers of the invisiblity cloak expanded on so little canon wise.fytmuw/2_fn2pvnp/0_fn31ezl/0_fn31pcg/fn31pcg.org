Yep! Another one that's obvious is time-turners - if Dumbledore could get one in 3rd year for Hermione to take extra classes, he could get one in 2nd year and use it to travel back after a student gets petrified, then watch it happen and know what the monster is early. And that's off the top of my head. But they were necessary to make Book 3 end properly, so they were introduced at the end of Book 3 and never used or explained again.
