I think it's worth noting that she's bad at worldbuilding because it's not her priority, rather than because she's a bad writer.

Rather than creating a world, and telling a story in it, she wanted to tell a story and so built the world to fit. This works, and because you're never expected to focus on the inconsistent or flawed world elements for too long you can still enjoy the story just fine in spite of them.

But of course, a fanfic community wants to tell new stories in the same world, so we are hypersensitive to world flaws that are papered over in the canon.
