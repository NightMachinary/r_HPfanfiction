Rowling's writing is all about the plot, and she will make contradictory or illogical changes and additions to characters and the world in order to make plot happen. This leads to loads of interesting concepts, like the cloak and horcruxes and portraits and rituals and time turners that never get explained in more detail than is absolutely necessary for story.

As one example, this is why in Philosopher's Stone, Harry nearly dies because he's waiting for Dumbledore to fly by broom from London, and then every single book after that mentions a faster and more efficient form of travel he would logically have used instead - Floo, Apparition, House Elf Travel, Phoenix Travel etc. Because in PS, she needed a means of transport that felt "wizardy" and allowed a sport for Harry to play, but also needed it to be slow enough that Dumbledore not being at Hogwarts made sense. In later books, she needed travel to be quicker and lead to things like Dobby rescuing the Trio in DH, the Knockturn Alley scenes in CoS etc, so she invented them and didn't care about the retroactive effect.

Over 7 books, this leads to worldbuilding which is incredibly wide and has loads of interesting things to pick out, but without real depth of understanding or logic to those things. They're window dressing or plot makers.

Like Love Potions, which are simultaneously portrayed (rightly) as essentially magic rape drugs, and their use factored into the main villain's tragic backstory but also Love Potions are a fun prank that the Weasley twins sell.

When they're relevant to the plot, they are highly powerfu,l dangerous and scary. Characters are rightly worried about being dosed with them and rightly angry when others are.

But when they're window dressing, they're just another item in Fred and George's shop and so the ethical and legal implications are unexplored.
