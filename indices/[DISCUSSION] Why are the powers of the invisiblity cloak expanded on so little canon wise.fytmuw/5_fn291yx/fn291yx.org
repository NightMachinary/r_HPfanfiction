Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

The second half of the story focuses on the Hallows and their powers are expanded. All three Hallows are somewhat sentient, indestructible and were initially created by the three Peverell brothers. The wand can deal death, the stone can reverse it and the cloak can prevent it.
