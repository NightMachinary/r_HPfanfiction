Because everything must serve the plot. There isn't a single scrap of knowledge, information, fact or magical guideline or law that doesn't in some way exist to further JK's plot. It's one of the major things I dislike about her writing. There are no cool moments that exist for the sake of being cool.

I read a fic once that had them experiment with the cloak, and they discovered that in the area the cloak covers and essentially "mimicks", light doesn't combine into other colors as it should.

You would never find something like that in JK's writings.

It extends to other things too, such as emotional moments.
