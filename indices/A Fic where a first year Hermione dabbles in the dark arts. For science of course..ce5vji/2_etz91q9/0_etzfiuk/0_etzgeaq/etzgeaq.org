I've been writing depressing replies for the last week. It's a little bit of fun I have, and takes a direction no one else takes. I did one with Ron smoking that I think I'll turn into a fic later.

I don't hate the character, I do dislike the character though. Mild dislike of her in the books, a dislike of her character in the movies, and a major dislike of Mary-Sue Hermione. All purely from a narrative perspective. It's not the idea, rather the execution of the character that bothers me.

But seriously, if she had asked for the cloak in the prompt, I would have gone for a very neat Dumbledore lecture. I might actually go for it.

Seriously though. If someone writes a Hermione that learns tact without being taken to task by Sinyk's +over-compensation+ Harry, I'd read it immediately.
