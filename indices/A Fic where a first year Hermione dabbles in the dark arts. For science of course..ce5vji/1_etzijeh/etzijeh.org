"Miss Granger, I'm very disappointed in you. You stole Mr. Potter's cloak, snuck into the restricted section, then proceeded to practice dark magic."

"I once knew a man in my youth. He was expelled from school for twisted experiments on the other youth. He was brilliant and came to me during a time of grief. We bonded instantly."

"I gave him a slogan in a debate we had, a motto he took to practice the dark arts and murder. It was the Greater Goodâ„¢."

"So let this be clear, if I ever catch you in the restricted section without permission again to practice the dark arts or violating another student's property, I will expel you and snap your wand. Are we clear Miss Granger?"

"Crystal, sir."

"Good. You have a month's detention between Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape, and Mr. Filch."
