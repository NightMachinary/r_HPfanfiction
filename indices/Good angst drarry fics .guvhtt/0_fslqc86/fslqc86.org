[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/GallaPlacidia/pseuds/GallaPlacidia/works?fandom_id=136512][GallaPlacidia]] has some fantastic angsty Drarry fics. My favourite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970/chapters/53596558][The Bucket List]], which also has dying Draco. I actually found you're the antidote for me through this fic, which the writer said inspired them. I also just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13826685][A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption]], which has a similar premise and is also fantastic. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4230765][Somebody to Love]], but it seems like it's hidden right now because of a challenge. These all have a Draco will die unless Harry loves him premise. General angst-wise, I also loved GallaPlacidia's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300][Dad says]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21650332/chapters/51627013][Lessons in Grace and Decorum]].

There was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/g8tc9w/fics_similar_to_the_bucket_list/][a post]] from [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] (where you're better off posting slash requests) with similar fics to ygtafm recced that you can check out!
