I kept passing over the Sacrifices arc because I didn't like the whole not the BWL thing or the Harry/Draco. I saw it recommended so many times and was super bored of everything I usually read so I started reading it. i thought I'd end up not reading the whole thing because it would be stupid. I was wrong. It was absolutely amazing and so worth the time.
