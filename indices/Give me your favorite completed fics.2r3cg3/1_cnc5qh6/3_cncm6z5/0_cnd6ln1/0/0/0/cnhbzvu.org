I remember that vaguely. I read these easily 8 years ago or so, so it's been quite a while. My idea of quality back then definitely isn't what it is now.

The main attraction of the series has to be its absolutely /absurd/ length, and that when it was being written, the author would update a 5k+ word chapter /every single day/.

To be honest, I've had no urge to go back and reread it, mostly because of exactly what you said. I hate when the MC is a pathetic bitch, and that's Harry for the first 5+ books.

The really annoying thing is that Harry is ridiculously powerful in this series magically. He's just got no fucking spine.
