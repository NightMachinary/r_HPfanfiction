dude i'm around halfway through the second book. There have been moments when i'm literally yelling in frustration at how much of a bitch Harry is. Aside from the fact he's not even treated like a member of the family and more of a bodyguard, Connor is such an absolute dickhead it's unreal. I hardly ever stop reading fics but if this carries on much longer I think i'm gonna have to with this one. It's just unrealistic how much shit he can take from his own brother. When he see's Harry standing by the first CoS message, the little shit has no thought processes of "wait a minute this guy has saved me from like 12 different things because i'm a little shit" - instead he just jumps straight to "so harry how long you been serving voldemort wah wah". God damn. I want him to die so bad. Haven't felt like this about a character since Suzaku from Code Geass.
