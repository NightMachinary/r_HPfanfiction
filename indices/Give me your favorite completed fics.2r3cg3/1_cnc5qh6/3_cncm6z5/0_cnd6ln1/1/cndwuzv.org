I read like 2 books of that fic a while ago, and from what I can remember, Harry was awesomely strong and competent, but that was evened out by his desperate need for psychotherapy, and no time to get it. Actually, pretty sure I stopped reading because it was getting depressing how the kid never got at clean victory at anything.
