I only read fics that are completed and >100k words, with a main character that is powerful (read: might not win every battle, but holds his own vs strong opponents. Strength progression - see denarian series- is ideal).

*In no particular order:*

A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles

#+begin_quote
  (/Unexpectedly outstanding/)
#+end_quote

A Black Comedy

#+begin_quote
  (/Didn't expect to actually laugh a lot, but I did. Great story/)
#+end_quote

Denarian Renegade/Knight/Lord

#+begin_quote
  (/read recently, this was stunning/)
#+end_quote

The Lie I've Lived

#+begin_quote
  (/Great bant, sorting hat my fav. character in fanfiction after this/)
#+end_quote

Delenda Est

#+begin_quote
  (/Fun read, all characters talk in the same way though but can be overlooked/)
#+end_quote

Wastelands of Time

#+begin_quote
  (/Excellent example of how to have an OP!Harry while making Voldemort even stronger/)
#+end_quote

Stages of Hope

#+begin_quote
  (/Strong MCs, dimension travel, bit of melodrama./)
#+end_quote

Innocent

#+begin_quote
  (/Hadn't read a Sirius raises harry fic before, I liked the great characterization. Has a sequel too/)
#+end_quote

Methods of Rationality

#+begin_quote
  (/flame shield/)
#+end_quote

Gryffindor's Never Die

#+begin_quote
  (/not 100k words, but I like time travel and I enjoyed the Harry/Ron bromance/)
#+end_quote

*For two fics that weren't as good, but were a fun read/guilty pleasure:*

The Darkness Within series

#+begin_quote
  (kinda angsty, tried a bit hard to be emotional)
#+end_quote

Harry Crow

#+begin_quote
  (gets repetitive and takes the Godlike!Harry a bit too far)
#+end_quote

Apparently the Sacrifices arc is good, although at 3.1 million words i'm not sure whether to start it. Would appreciate if anyone else could tell me if Harry is overpowered? Part of the fun of these stories is when everyone respects the MC for his abilities - if he's not the BWL then he had better be a badass.
