In terms of any completed fics, pairing and crossover irregardless?

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]]/ by Speechwiter: "Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH."

(Personal note: This is, hands down, /the best/ Harry Potter fanfic I have /ever/ read.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6113733/1/Have-a-Nice-Day][Have a Nice Day!]]/ by Speechwriter: "Tom Riddle: secret, brilliant heir to the biggest company in the world, VoldeMart. Hermione Granger: sent to his prestigious school on full scholarship because VoldeMart outsourced her parents' jobs to China. Bridges burn. Sparks fly. M for language."

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8618289/1/Nightmare][Nightmare]]/ by provocative-envy: "A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened."

(Personal note: Rated M for lemons/sex scenes and near-constant use of the 'F' word.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima Ratio]]/ by Winterblume: "Ultima ratio - the last resort. At last the day of the Final Battle against Lord Voldemort has come. Harry, Ron and Hermione fight bravely against their nemesis - but then something goes wrong. And Hermione finds herself alone in a precarious situation."

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2104141/1/The-Stag-and-the-Dragon][The Stag and the Dragon]]/ by Kenya Starflight: "Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader."
