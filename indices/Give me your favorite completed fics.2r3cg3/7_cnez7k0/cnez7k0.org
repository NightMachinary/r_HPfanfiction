Summary: When visiting Draco in Finist√®re, Harry disappears. Draco is sent to prison for his murder on circumstantial evidence. But Harry's body is never found, and whenever Draco is near the sea, he senses Harry's presence.

"In the dream Draco was gliding through glassy water, watching shoals of silvery fish turn and dart away as he approached. The brightness of the surface faded away as he descended into the green depths with smooth, effortless strokes. The water was silky and cool and there was no danger here, only hope."

This is one of my absolute favorites that I truly think everyone in the H/D fandom should read as it is the single most beautiful piece of fanfiction I have ever read. The imagery is so beautiful and rich that I feel like I can taste the saltwater. I've never had a story feel like that before. This story stuck with me so much that I hunted it down again four years after reading it (when I couldn't find it) because I never forgot it.
