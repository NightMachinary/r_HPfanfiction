Fantastic fic. Link here: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY.html][Beneath You by Cinnamon at FictionAlley]].

Summary:Draco had no idea that the repercussions of stealing Potter's journal and shoving it down the back of his trousers would be so extreme. Featuring nefarious plots, the mating rituals of Slytherins, double-crossing spells, Ron/Pansy, and Draco/Harry. Rated R.

Cinnamon's other fic, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]], is also very good if you want more H/D.

Summary: Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it. Rated R.
