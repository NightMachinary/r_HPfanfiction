Tread Softly ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly]]) It's Harry/Snape slash. I don't like this pairing, but this fic was sooo good.

Bottle-Specs ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10007867/1/Bottle-Specs]]) This is Sirus/OC het. I don't like this pairing either, but I think it really appealed to my adoration of cheesy romances, lol.

Give him love ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675149/1/Give-Him-Love]]) James S.P/Neville slash. So good.

Stages of Hope ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]) This one is also very good.

Okay, so I went through my favourite list. This is why my opinions for each fic sound the same. Hope you find something you like!
