That's just silly. We have more than a few paragraphs. We have a general idea of some of the cultural issues of the nation (Rappaport's Law, Grindlewald's activities), some of the highly regarded families there (the descendants of the original Aurors, like Percival Graves), respected people in the society (including those who attended Ilvermorny, like Queenie and her sister, famous wand makers) and the history of the school from its inception.

If you are seriously saying the canon information and role of Daphne - which is literally just her name, her blood status, school House and her sister) - are enough to build her character, your argument that Ilvermorny cannot be done because of lack of information is a contradiction. I agree the lack of certain kinds of information makes it harder, but I don't think it's much different than the fanon use of Daphne (making up her character whole cloth).
