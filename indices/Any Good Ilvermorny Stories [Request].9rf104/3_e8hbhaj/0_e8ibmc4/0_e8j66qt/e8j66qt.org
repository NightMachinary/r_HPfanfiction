Summary: Ginny died in the Chamber of Secrets, so that Tom Riddle could live. Ginny and the Chamber were never found; so, Hogwarts was closed. Five years have passed since then and Hermione has just started her 7th year at Ilvermorny. Her last year was supposed to be one to remember. It would be one to remember, because of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. [HG/TR, HG/DM]
