- Why would Dumbledore give Neville Harry's Invisibility Cloak?
- Why Harry still lives with the Dursleys? Why the Potters are dead if Voldemort chose the Longbottoms and why Sirius is in Azkaban?
- Why Dumbledore doesn't hire Lupin? He didn't do it in canon because of Harry but because of Sirius, and Sirius is still an Azkaban escapee in your version, so why the difference?
