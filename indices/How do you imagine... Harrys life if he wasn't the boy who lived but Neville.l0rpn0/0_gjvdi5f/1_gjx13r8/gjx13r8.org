Ok, so my belief regarding Dumbledore is that he is hyperfocused on keeping the BWL alive that's why he is handing Neville the invisibility cloak and doesn't hire Lupin. Black isn't after the BWL and because of that he isn't too concerned and doesn't hire Lupin as he has no connection to Neville. Of course, Lupin can be hired but I decided not to in this AU.

Neville is also a prodigy just concerning the offensive side of magic whilst Harry is more talented on the defensive side of it. Neville also unlike Harry has lived in the Magical world much longer and is therefore already trained a bit when he reaches Hogwarts. This is because of his Grandma, not Dumbledore.

Concerning the Patronus. Being surrounded by soul-sucking monsters seems like a good reason for learning the Patronus spell. He won't learn it until the end of the year and won't master (be able to summon it if a dementor is nearby) it until the 5th year DA.

I haven't given his circle of friends much thought but I don't think he would be friends with Ron and Hermione as they are plot-critical but not being friends does not mean hating each other. Harry is more focused on his studies and learning how to duel the first 5 years sure he plays the occasional games with his dormmates and talks with Hermione about Homework and school stuff but they are not friends more like colleagues.
