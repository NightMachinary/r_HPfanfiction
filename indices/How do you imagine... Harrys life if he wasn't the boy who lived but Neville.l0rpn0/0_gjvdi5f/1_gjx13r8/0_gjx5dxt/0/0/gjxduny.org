There wasn't that much difference in the movies and books with respect to Dumbledore. Just some rather off character acting with inconsequential bits.

Even then stealing is beneath him, but it's your story so ok cool. I'd advice against it because that trope has sailed.

Ok, as for this bit, black abandons his godson again. But who collects him? Why does he go to the dursleys and not a magical orphanage? Or a foster family? Why is he placed with muggles?

And so essentially it's canon, with Neville and Harry getting their places changed, but Harry gets screwed over by Dumbledore twice and Neville gets better treatment than Harry originally did.

Why is Harry the protagonist of the story and why doesn't black attempt to contact him? Also with respect to third year, how does it go? He breaks out, people believe he's after Harry - he attacks Gryffindor tower, then what? Why isn't Pettigrew caught? Only reason he escaped was Lupin transforming in the third book.

Who catches black? Neville or Harry?
