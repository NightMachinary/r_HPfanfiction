Ok, so this Dumbledore is about as manipulative as the one in the movies. He does what he believes is necessary to achieve Voldemorts downfall if that makes him a manipulative character in your eyes then that's your opinion.

I envisioned Black imprisonment like this: Pettigrew tells The Lestranges where the Potters are hiding. They torture them but when Sirius comes to the rescue they kill the Potters -Harry who is hidden upstairs. Sirius enters the house sees the corpses breaks down and then goes hunting for Pettigrew original plot kicks in Sirius is in Prison.
