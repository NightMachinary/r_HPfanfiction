Unless you want it to be a Dumbledore bashing or rather you want people to hate him, I'd really recommend you write that the potters don't have a cloak or you don't give it to Neville.

But from what I've gathered, it seems like it's geared towards manipulative/evil/ hate on Dumbledore fic - seeing that he is taking someone's property and giving it elsewhere without permission, pretty much stealing from an orphan, and he doesn't care a serial killer is after one of his students either.

I'm having serious doubts with respect to character growth of the characters because one prodigy has to work while the other doesn't seem to have to work as much. Neville didn't grow well under his grandma, she put so much pressure he was almost a squib for five years.

Also, being around dementors would be a good incentive, but unless you're a Voldemort-Dumbledore-Grindelwald level guy, you can't learn a spell like the patronus charm on your own. It's very difficult. If it was that easy, Hermione would've mastered it as well. She has the same incentive in canon as Harry in this fic, except she was more inclined towards studying.

Does Harry play Quidditch here or is he "Quidditch is lame"? If so, why?

Also you haven't answered any questions regarding black's imprisonment and what happens to Harry's parents.

Thus far it seems like a WBWL AU, except instead of an OC potter character, you have an OOC Neville.
