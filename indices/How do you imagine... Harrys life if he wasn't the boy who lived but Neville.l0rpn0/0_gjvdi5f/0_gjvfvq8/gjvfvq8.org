yeah, honestly I would say most of canon changes and happens differently not sure why it would stay the same. like what if Quirrell decides not to go to Albania and get a Dark lord attached to his head , or Pettigrew gets captured because James and Lily are not targeted so they survive. Sirius isn't in prison.

So much changes Snape doesn't give a Damn about Neville surviving either so he would still be a Death eater if Voldemort went for Neville.
