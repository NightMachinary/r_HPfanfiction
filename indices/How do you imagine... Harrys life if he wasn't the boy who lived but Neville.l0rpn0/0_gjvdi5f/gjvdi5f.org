I have a few questions. Is Dumbledore evil in this? Because if he isn't, I see no reason why he would give Harry's family heirloom to Neville? That makes no sense. You can just have it written off or Neville getting one of his own?

That also raises the question, if he isn't the BWL, what happens to his parents? Do they live? Die? Sick? Why is he with the dursleys?

Why couldn't he be adopted or sent to an orphanage?

Why was Sirius in Prison, why did he escape, and how is he connected with Harry in this universe? Sirius was in jail the first time around for killing muggles , which Pettigrew did, but yes. He escaped because he saw Pettigrew near Harry and the article said that Ron and Harry were good friends. And why would he be targetting Harry according to the public and why would the public care enough to gossip about it to a kid no one really knows or cares about?

Who are Harry's friends in this story? This is rather important.

How does Harry learn the patronus? Why does he learn it as well? Why can't Lupin be hired regardless of whom black is targetting?

The travelling bit is good, but if he studied or did a course somewhere else, wouldn't he have to take the exams there as well? If he went for a tournament, it wouldn't take a whole month.

Also if he was a prodigy, talented and as focused on duelling, as you've stated him to be, how is Neville his match or equal when he's trained for a fraction of how long Harry dedicated his time? Because then Harry isn't the prodigy, Neville is.
