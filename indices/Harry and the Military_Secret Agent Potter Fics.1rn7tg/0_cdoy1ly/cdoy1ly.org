Stories with a military Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] by DobbyElfLord.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][Old Soldiers Never Die]] by Rorschach's Blot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] by Kwan Li (the second half of the story).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquis Black. Also the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3561444/1/The-Dark-Wars-Empire-s-Plight][Dark Wars]] series by the same author. (Together, the two are about a million words.)

There are a couple of Secret Agent Hedwig stories out there (who would have thought that was a thing?):

With the exception of Emperor (which is 500k+ words), all are complete.
