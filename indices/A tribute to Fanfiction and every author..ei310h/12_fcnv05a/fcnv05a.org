I read my first fanfiction in 1997 at age 14. Now I'm a crazy old cat lady pushing full steam ahead to 40 and I'm still just as obsessed with this stuff. Lucky for me my hubby doesn't care what I get up to in the wee hours of the night lol. That's 23 years experience I've been reading fanfiction.... and I signed up to Reddit today just to tell you this: I know right now it feels like you've read all there is to read and there will never be anything else worth reading. I cannot tell you how many times I've thought this myself. The truth is that great fanfiction comes and goes in cycles. Some months there are SO many good stories to read, and other months the flow of great stories is dry as a desert. If I had a dollar for every time I told myself "Well that's it. There will never be any more great stories." But then, months down the road, something wonderful would happen. Maybe I would discover a great new show and discover new stories written for that fandom. Or maybe a new fanfic writer would appear on the scene and come up with something wonderful. It never fails. My trick is this: When I feel like the pool of good fanfic is drying up I'll step away from the computer for a while and focus on other things. I'll watch more TV or spend more time harassing (er, I mean loving) my hubby, or I'll switch to reading actual novels for a while. I'll let time go by. Months, usually. Then I'll head on back to AO3 or [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and find all the awesome new stuff I missed. I could go on and on about the marvels of fanfiction but I won't. Just trust me. The best is yet to come. Happy New Year, ya'll.
