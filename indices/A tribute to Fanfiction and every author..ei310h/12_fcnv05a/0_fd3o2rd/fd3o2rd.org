Sorry, for some reason Reddit only showed me your comment now. Thank you, I guess I just have to be more patient sometimes. I've actually switched back to reading normal books now that I can't find anything good for the time being. Read 2 books within a few days. I have to wait till Monday for the sequel to arrive so I'm just sitting wasting time somehow.
