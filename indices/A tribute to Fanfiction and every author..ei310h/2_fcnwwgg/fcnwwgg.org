I'm 31 and I've been reading Harry Potter fan fiction for over 15 years.

Conservative estimate - I've read over 10 million words of Hp fanfiction. I'm still discovering works that I adore. I love this fandom - Its such a rich world that authors can take it in hundreds of different ways.

I love this sub, and thank you so much for everyone who contributes to discussions, thoughts, writing, and debating this fandom.

Hope you all have a fantastic 2020.

Much love <3
