I did try to. Wrote about 30k I think until I had no motivation left. I grew up bilingual but instead of speaking good German and English I feel like I'm bad at both. I've always had an interest in writing, ever since I was 7 years old, but due to my language difficulties (or lacking self confidence, I'm not too sure) I never really bothered to continue.
