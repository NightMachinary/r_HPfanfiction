I can definitely relate, the only recommendation I can give if your looking for some new fanfiction is giving "worm" a try. I read the HP crossover done by Darth Marrs (which wasn't half bad) and got sucked into the fandom. Which you can mostly find on spacebattles or sufficientvelocity.

Ps. Have you read the (completed) stories by jbern? They are the oldest ones I regularly go back to and are still my favorites. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern]]
