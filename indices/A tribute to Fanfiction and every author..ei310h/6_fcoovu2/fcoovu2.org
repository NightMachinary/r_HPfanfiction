i discovered fanfiction when i was 12 or 13. i turn 31 in a couple of months, and i'm still reading. i stumbled across fanfiction while trying to find info on when Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the book, not the movie) was going to be released, and been reading ever since.

i don't read quite as much HP fanfics as i used to (at least, ones not by authors who i'm already familiar with), but i still read. Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossovers are probably what's exposed me to the largest number of fandoms, heh. HP and BtVS are still my primary fandoms though, with a few others thrown in.
