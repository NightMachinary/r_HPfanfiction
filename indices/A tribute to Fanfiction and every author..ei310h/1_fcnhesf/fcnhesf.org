I'm the opposite - I can't find fics on FFnet worth reading. I'm Ao3 only these days.

Edit: Copying/pasting a comment I left somewhere else a few days ago. This is how I find fics worth reading on Ao3. It rarely fails to net me something good.

Go to the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search][Search -> Works]]" link.

Scroll down to the "Work Tags" section. Type in some things you're interested in by character (under "character"), pairing under "relationships", or plot element such as "Slytherin Harry Potter" (under "additional tags"). Existing tags will prompt you to autofill, so when you start typing click on the one that pops up that is relevant to your interests.

Now that you have your tag(s) selected, you can start sorting things out. If you want only completed fics or no crossovers (or ONLY crossovers), scroll back up to "Work Info" and select the relevant filters. You can also use this section to find one shots or longgggg fics (under "word count" - typing in <5000 will net you short fics, >100000 will net you long fics).

At the bottom of the search page, under "Search," here are my pro-tips for finding good reads:

For fics that people enjoyed, change the "sort by" to *kudos*. This tends to get me a good mix of good one-shots and plotty things. Sometimes it'll return the hilarious joke fics as the top result, but there will still like be some good reads.

For fics that people tend to re-read or recommend to others, change the "sort by" to *bookmarks*. This tends to return more longfics than one-shots.

If you're there for smutty shit, change the "sort by" to *hits*. Scroll back up to "Work Info" and check the "single chapter" box. This will return porny one-shots that people return to again and again for /reasons/.

You can also use these same methods in filtering tags. Click on a character tag, relationship tag, or additional tag (one that's fandom specific tends to work best), then click on "filter works" if it doesn't automatically take you to a page full of fic. This page is most useful for filtering OUT things you don't want to read (for example, if you want to read "Slytherin Harry Potter" but not "Dark Harry" fics, go to the Slytherin Harry Potter tag and go to "exclude" on the filters). Filtering tags is one of my FAVORITE Ao3 features.
