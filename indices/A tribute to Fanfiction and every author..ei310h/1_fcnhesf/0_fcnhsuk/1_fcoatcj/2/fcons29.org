Not OP but I read a lot of SW as well - I primarily find fics these days through the tags and filtering architecture that vichan described. The tags I start in are usually either fandom tags (e.g. SW Sequel Trilogy/Original Trilogy/Prequel Trilogy), or a pairing tag. Then I sort by kudos or comments, set to complete works usually, and optionally add a ratings filter. I use exclusions pretty liberally, usually pairings I'm not interested in seeing. Another good way, once you find an author you like, is to look at their other works or their bookmarks.

It might help to post what sort of stuff you're interested in so that people can get you started with recs! I can help if you're interested in Sequel or Prequel stuff, mostly, since that's what I've bookmarked.
