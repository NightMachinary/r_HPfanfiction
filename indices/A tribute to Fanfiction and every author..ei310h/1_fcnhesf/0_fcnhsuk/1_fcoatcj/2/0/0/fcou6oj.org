Also not OP, but in the star wars fandom I'd recommend Fialleril's "Double Agent Verse" (ongoing series, ot au) and esama's "Lost Reflections" (pt slice of life, dead in the water but what is there is good) to just about anyone. For the Kotor fans I'd add "Face of a Sith Lord" (oneshot), "Enemies and Allies" (oneshot), and " Apathetic Revan gets a surprising amount done" (completed series).
