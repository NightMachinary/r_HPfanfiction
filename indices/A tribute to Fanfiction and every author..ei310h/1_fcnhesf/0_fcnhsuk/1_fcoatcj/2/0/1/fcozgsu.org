Agree with [[/u/MelonyBerolVisconti/][u/MelonyBerolVisconti/]], DAV is an exceptional series and Fialleril is an excellent author; their other stories, like the unfinished Heretic Pride and The One Where Anakin and Padme are Pen Pals, are lovely as well. Really good at worldbuilding! [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Fialleril/pseuds/Fialleril/works][Works here.]]

Prequel/OT stories:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6252790/chapters/14326897][Fundamental Force Carriers]]: ~90k and first in a small series. Anakin/Vader, at the moment of his death, is sent back in time. Things go differently. I think this has some stuff from Clone Wars but I'm not certain because I haven't seen it.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12465699][you're not the only one]]: Oneshot. "She is a gift to Lord Vader from the Emperor. Her name is Padme Skywalker." Another exceptional author with lots of great SW works.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/930435][Skywalker Swap]]: 2-part series, the first one is an incredible graphic novel telling ANH if it was Leia Skywalker and Luke Organa.

Sequel stories:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5648131][Tomorrow (there'll be more of us)]]: Oneshot, one of the first (if not the first) Stormtrooper Revolution stories.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5798602/chapters/13364887][have you heard]]: ~40k. One of the many stories inspired by the above, a really multifaceted, nuanced take on a Stormtrooper Revolution.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8468581][Rey's Feast]]: Oneshot, one of my favourite stories about Rey told through exploring food.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6743011][We'll All Float On Okay]]: Oneshot, Leia and Rey bonding.
