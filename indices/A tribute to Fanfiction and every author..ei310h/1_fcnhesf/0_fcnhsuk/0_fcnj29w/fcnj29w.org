My favorite is actually gen, followed by slash/femslash. (I'm bi, so I'm fond of it. Sue me.) Then het. I'm mainly there for good writing above all else. If it's written well and has a tight plot, I'll probably read it. (Although I tend to avoid fics that are purely focused on romance. I like romance on the side, not as the focus.)

If there's a grammar or spelling error in the summary, I won't even click. That's honestly my main issue with FFnet - it's a LOT of crap to wade through, whereas it's easier to filter out the crap on Ao3.
