Cheers! As a (admittedly poor) writer it's people like you that encourage me to keep trying. If you're really struggling to find a fic that's your cup of tea, TV tropes has a fanfiction recommendation page for just about every fandom out there. It's a good way to see what other people are reading and interested in, and at least filters out the worst stories. Here's the Harry Potter one.
