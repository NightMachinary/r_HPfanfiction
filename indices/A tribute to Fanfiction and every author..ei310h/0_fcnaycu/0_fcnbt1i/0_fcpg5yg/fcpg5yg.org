Have you delved into the My Hero Academia fandom? The fanfic community is really growing (especially on ao3) and there are many fantastic ones! Also, I've really gotten into the newer avenger fics that heavily include spiderman. There are some really wholesome ones out there, and also some amazing ones that offer and alternate to Endgame and center around Spidey. Dunno if either of those would be your cup of tea, but thought I'd mention it in case you wanted to find something new.

Trust me, I've been reading about 5 hours of fanfic almost everyday too for the past 10 years, i know the pain of feeling like you have exhausted every good fic in a fandom and the extreme joy of finally finding another super good one. What are some of your favorite hp and naruto ones? Those were my OGs as well :]
