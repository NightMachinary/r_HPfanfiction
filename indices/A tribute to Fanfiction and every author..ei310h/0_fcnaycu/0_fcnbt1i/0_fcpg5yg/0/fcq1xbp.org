Yeah, I've already exhausted the My Hero Academia fandom on ffnet and I'm getting tired of reading similar stories every time. After reading most, all of them aren't that different at all. I tried looking for My Hero Academia stories on Ao3 but most were slash or just focused on pairings which I'm not too interested in. As for my favourites... That's a really difficult question, sorry. I've recommended A Bet of a Lifetime [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12567696]] (Naruto) in this thread before because it's my favourite one currently updating.
