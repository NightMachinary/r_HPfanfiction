Thanks man! You have no idea how much this means to me! I'm only about the age that you we're when you began and I now write Fanfiction on Ao3. Like you I read and write so much Fanfiction a day. To all the writers and readers, of both my fics and everyone else's, Happy New Year, heres to another 10 years of Fanfiction.
