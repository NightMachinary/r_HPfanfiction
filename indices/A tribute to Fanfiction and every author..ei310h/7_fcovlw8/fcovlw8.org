  I read around five hours of fanfiction a day and due to my picky "taste" I've pretty much read every fic worth reading.

As someone who's been reading fanfiction for over a decade, I can assure you that there's more that you're missing, somewhere.

Every time I think I've read every fic worth reading, I see a rec or something on here that pulls me down another rabbit hole.

God speed.
