Part II

--------------

The scene inside the hospital wing was the worst Cedric could ever remember.

His parents, Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Harry's friends Ron and Hermione sat in chairs surrounding the two beds.

"Word will be given to his family," Madame Pomfrey said quietly. "They'll decide what to do with Harry's body..."

Ron made a noise somewhere between a sob and a howl. Hermione cried harder.

"Molly..." Dad was saying. "I'm so...tremendously sorry."

"It wasn't your fault, Amos...It wasn't your fault, either, Cedric dear."

Good old Mrs. Weasley. So kind and generous. Cedric turned his head as he saw her caresses Harry's face, the way a mother might comfort a sick child.

Cedric had related everything to Dumbledore in the Headmaster's office. His parents had been there. And Professor Sprout.

The imposter Moody had been restrained in McGonagall's office. Hagrid was standing guard with his crossbow.

And now, Cedric was supposed to sleep? How could he? Harry was /dead./ Cedric should have done more--that louse Pettigrew couldn't have been much. He should have dodged the spell and smashed that rat's head in. He was even shorter than Harry and Cedric was big and strong--one solid punch to the skull would have been enough to kill that bastard.

Madame Pomfrey handed Cedric a potion for Dreamless Sleep. Cedric mulled it over...the idea of sleep without dreams, without having to see Harry's broken little body was nothing short of intoxicating...but no...he had to live with his failure...hiding from it would be an insult to Harry's memory.

"You're all mad! This is a ploy to get me out of power!" Fudge shouted. "I will not see the peace

"Your winnings," Fudge said shortly, as he handed Cedric a bag. "One thousand Galleons. Ordinarily, there would be a ceremony, with the other champions accepting you as their superior but, in light of the circumstances..."

Cedric took the bag and felt a great rage bubble inside him. Winnings? Ceremony? Even now, Fudge was concerned with appearances? The damn dirty coward...

"I don't want this damn blood money!" With every bit of strength he could muster, Cedric threw the bag across the hospital wing, showering Galleons everywhere. "I want Harry back! I want my friend back! I want to find Voldemort and Pettigrew and make them pay!"

"Peter Pettigrew is dead. Voldemort is dead. Harry Potter is dead," Fudge said quietly. "Do take care to make sure you don't meet the same fate, Cedric."

"COWARD!" Cedric shouted and he thought he heard Ron shout it as well.

Cedric was too consumed with rage to be able to even feign sleep anymore. He grabbed the potion from his nightstand, the one for Dreamless Sleep, and downed it in one gulp.
