Here is my attempt. I could go longer with it but I have a two-hour drive I have to start in about 20 minutes.

All he had to do was grab the cup while holding on to the lifeless and cold body of his fellow classmate. He had to stay low, avoid the horde of spellfire, survive, grab the body and get the cup.

But his limbs felt heavy.

As if they were slowly turning to stone as the seconds painfully passed him.

He laid on top of the body, the one that was still and unmoving on the torched grass. Wrapping his left arm under the head of his younger friend, he accio'd the cup to his outstretched hand. It slammed painfully into his palm from overpowering the spell but he didn't mind a little pain.

At least he was still alive.

When the portkey dumped his body in front of the maze, music instantly started. Cheering filled the air, and fireworks set off by the Weasley twins exploded against the black of the sky.

He made his heart compress painfully and pushed all the air out of his lungs in a single breath. He pulled his face away from the matted and dirty hair he hid in while traveling.

He found his father's face first. It was split into a bright grin. White teeth gleamed in the night. Wrinkles surrounded his hazel eyes in a joyous manner. He was nearly bouncing in excitement as he clasped his hands to gather in front of his chest. It made bile start to rise in Cedric's chest.

Amos must have noticed something was off because the smile slowly slipped off his face. With joy gone, it appeared that years had taken place in a matter of minutes. His father rushed towards him when he saw the tear streaks formed in the caked dirt in his face.

“He,” The choked as soon as he tried to speak. The words stuck in his throat. “He-He killed him.”

Cedric's focus was on his father, missing the group of teachers and officials circling around him. Several were shouting questions at him over the roaring of instruments behind them. Others were just watching confused at the two boys on the ground.

Minerva noticed the open and dead eyes of Harry Potter first.

It was followed by a choked sob and she nearly dropped to her knees. She darted to the other side of Cedric to grab at her student. She pulled the top half of Harry into her lap trying to desperately find a pulse. Tears started to fall when she couldn't.

“What?” Amos asked staring at the dead body.

“He's dead!” Cedric roared at his father frustrated. “He used him for a ritual and then disposed of him!”

“Sprout, Flitwick, Snape,” Amelia stated sharply catching their attention, “Get the students out of here. Don't let them see him.” Once the turned to the stands she turned her attention to her Aurors. “Dawlish, Tonks, keep us hidden.”

The Aurors went to start casting privacy spells. They had erected large slabs of rough rock to hide the scene from wandering eyes. This caused the whispers to become louder. Several students try to look past the forming walls and adults to no avail.

One person was brave enough to run past teachers, Aurors and ministry officials to find out what had happened. Her efforts rewarded her with the sight of her best friend's dead body. She dropped to her knee while wet wails escaped her body. She was quickly whisked away by Sprout and Pomphrey.

“Who did this?” Fudge asked. He wanted a clear answer.

“Voldemort,” Cedric croaked out from beside Harry's body. Tonks had brought a black cloak to drape over the boy. When she had started to cover at him, Cedric shrieked and ripped the fabric away from her before tossing it away.

“Impossible!” Fudge cried, “You're just trying to get out of Azkaban!”

“Minister!” Amelia admonished behind him.

“It's true!”

“That man is dead!” The Minster words slipped between his teeth in a growl.

“Take my memories! Or better yet, talk to Lucius Malfoy who stunned him before Voldemort cast the killing curse on him.”

“Lies!”

“Minister,” Minerva hissed from her place on the ground, “Shut. Up.” The words came out cold and sent shivers down the spines of everyone who heard it. “My student is dead,” she had choked on the last word, “Another witnessed said death. Maybe now isn't the best time to be pointing fingers.”

“What Mr. Diggory is saying is the truth,” Snape slowly spoke next to the Headmaster who had turned an ashen color. He rolled the sleeve of his robes up to reveal the black mark that was surrounded by red angry skin.

Behind Amelia, Moody was cackling. This drew the eyes of everyone present. His face bubbled and morphed into that of a man thought to be dead. Once the disguise of Alastor was completely gone, he cackled even louder at their stunned faces. He stopped only for a moment to inform them that they had lost.
