I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but Slytherin Squad by Halfblooddragon explores Slytherin culture post-war and how Draco is working to change its reputation and attitudes. It's a Draco x Ginny story about a squad of aurors from Slytherins and it features Blaise, Daphne, Cassius Warrington, Theodore Nott. It explores the culture and attitudes they've been raised with and contrasts them against the other auror squads. It's also just really, really good.
