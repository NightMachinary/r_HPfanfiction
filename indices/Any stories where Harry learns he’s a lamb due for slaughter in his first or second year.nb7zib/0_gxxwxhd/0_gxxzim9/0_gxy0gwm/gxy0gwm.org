He might in the state he was in canon. But I imagine a Dumbledore who tells him about the prophecy a year earlier at least has the decency of ensuring Harry is in the right place before getting the news. Which would mean, no Dumbledore shunning him away and proper help to deal with the fallout of Cedric's death.

Let's face it, Dumbledore's greatest fail was not waiting until Harry was almost 16 to tell him of the prophecy, but throwing him with no psychological help to the Dursleys after what he went through at the graveyard.
