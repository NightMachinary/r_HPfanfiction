In my book he could have told him about the prophecy after the Triwizard Tournament and Goldie's return, I would have done it sooner and Harry already had faced plenty of shit by then. By after I don't mean immediately after of course, like wait a few weeks for things to settle a bit.

About the scarcrux, it was really shitty to wait until the last moment, but I can see where he was coming from. Harry might not have done it as it was supposed to happen if he had not been told at the right moment.
