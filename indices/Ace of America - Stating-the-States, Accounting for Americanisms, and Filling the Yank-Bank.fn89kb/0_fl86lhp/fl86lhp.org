Are yearbooks a thing in England like they are/were in the U.S.? From what I hear they're waning in the U.S., but in the timeline of Harry Potter, they would have been super popular. Yearbook signing is a huge thing that happens at the end of the school year. Also, like Field Day? It's like...in-school olympics mixed with a festival kind of?
