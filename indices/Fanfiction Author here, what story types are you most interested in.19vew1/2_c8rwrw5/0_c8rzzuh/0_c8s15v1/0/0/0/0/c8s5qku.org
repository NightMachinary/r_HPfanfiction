Main point of snipers is that there is no time for reaction - bullet is faster even than its sound. Equipped with teleportation support (portkeys, side-along apparition) they may completely avoid detection. And I doubt that DE are constantly under notice-me-not (and this one may be solved by finding squib snipers). Shielding charm against bullets - it depend on author, it may range from "in century or two we will find spell for this", through "it worked once, or twice then everybody spend X time to layer protection charms" to "it is not working because guns stop working near magic".
