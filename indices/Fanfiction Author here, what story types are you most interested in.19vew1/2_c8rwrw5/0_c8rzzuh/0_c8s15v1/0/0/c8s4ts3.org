I am pretty sure that nuking Tom would result in second disembodiment (though there are good reasons to not do this) - anything else would be cheating. I think that snipers would be quite efficient in DE removal. And I would love to see Malfoy Manor destroyed by artillery/air strike, just for pure hilarity.

Obviously it would not fit canon style, plot and themes - but I would like to see more of this in fanfiction (I have seen attempts at this but it was either pure humor ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die]]) or total failure (trench warfare would no happen with at least one side able to teleport around)).
