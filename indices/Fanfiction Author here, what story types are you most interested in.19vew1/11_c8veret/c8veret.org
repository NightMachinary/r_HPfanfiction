I perfer fics that aren't x hates y but then z comes along and x starts to fall in love with y. Dear god can you stop it? I want to read adventure/mystery. I want to read a story which is not about any hp characters, not set in Britain, set in the 18th century for all I care. I want something different. Most, if not all, of us got into the books because of the adventures/setting/characters. We did not get into the books because of the sexual tension between Draco and Harry, because there isn't one.
