I've only found one series following Harry through Auror school and while it's really great, it deviates from canon after book 5 because it was started before HBP was published.

It starts with year 6 and while there are some Potter fic cliches at the beginning, (Poor!Harry, Powerful!Harry, NotaTotalBastard!Snape) it really overcomes that with improved characterizations, fantastic relationships, Rowling-esque levels of important detail and a strong, driving plot.

The total is something like 1.7 million words, so if you start to read this, you'll be at it a long time.

If I ever find one that picks right up from DH and follows canon as JKR has said in interviews, I'll be recc'ing it all over the place.
