I'm such a canon-whore that I pretty much stick to Harry-centric stories that take place after GoF. I like long (novel-length) plotty stuff the best and really appreciate magic that follows the rules of JKR's world.

Ideally, I would love a series of fics that follow Harry through the years after the war into his magical crime-fighting Auror career.
