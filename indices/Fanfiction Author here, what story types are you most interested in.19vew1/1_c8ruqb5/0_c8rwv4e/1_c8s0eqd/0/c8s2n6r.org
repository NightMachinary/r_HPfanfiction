It certainly gets points for noticing the fact that Hogwarts is magical castle, I think that only HPMOR and "A Study in Magic" used this so well.

EDIT: And for starting as decent AU - not too close to canon, but without overkill.

EDIT2: This story is great, well done and unfinished. Well, nothing is perfect.
