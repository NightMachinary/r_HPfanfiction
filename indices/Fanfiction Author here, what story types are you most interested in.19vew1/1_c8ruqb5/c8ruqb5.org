I like the 'fics where things are more... realistic, for lack of a better word. Where Harry acts like the emotionally stunted and damaged child he would be, after being raised, unloved, by the Dursleys; where Hermione is as callous and calculating as she is hinted to be (the 'SNEAK' incident; Obliviating her own parents); where the Imperius curse is used intelligently, by intelligent people.

Stuff like that.
