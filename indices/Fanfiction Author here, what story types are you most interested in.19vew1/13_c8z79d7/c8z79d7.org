Maybe I'm a bit late, but I just found this sub. My favorite stories are set during GoF and have Harry in a different Triwizard tournament. More tasks, harder tasks, etc. Also, those where he is intelligent. But I'm tired of reading stories where intelligent!Harry means readsalotofbooks!Harry. Sure, reading is part of learning, but testing is more important. I'd like to see a fic where instead of buying a new wand and new trunk to live in and a truckload of spell books from knockturn alley, he makes what he needs, using runes, charms, transfig, potions, woodcarving, whatever. Sure, some of those need to be learned from books, but trial and error, learning by doing, and small projects leading on to bigger ones would be nice.

There are very few fics that do any of that very well. The sorting hat's stand and temporal beacon do a pretty awesome Triwizard tournament. Methods of rationality does okay with intelligence and has an alternative to the Triwizard. There was another that did well with intelligence and self sufficiency, but its plot was horrid.
