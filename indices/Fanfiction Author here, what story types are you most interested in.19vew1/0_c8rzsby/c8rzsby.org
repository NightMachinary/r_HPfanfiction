TL. DR:Novel length, twisty combinations of multiple plot lines, smart and capable main characters facing smart and capable opponents, reasonably developed characterizations for everyone involved.

I've mostly found myself interested in fics where characters are on the smarter side and consistent to themselves and at least reasonable in behaviour. Reading about dumb and dumber gets boring very fast. Deviations from canon characterization is fine if such is explained in the story in a plausible way.

When reading about younger years when characters are aged 11 to 14 it helps if the author quietly upgrades everyone involved by several years in terms of maturity. Fanbase of Harry Potter grew up and writers should take this into account.

Angst and drama is boring - I prefer to read about heroes who struggle with and handle difficult situations instead of whine and brood about everything life throws at them. Moments of weakness is one thing, but reading about stupid fights and hysterics for an entire chapter usually kills the story for me. It may not be "realistic" behaviour for young teens, but frankly real teens are boring.

Twisty and multi-threaded plots are a big bonus.
