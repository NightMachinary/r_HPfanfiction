Not much! I like canon for the most part. A few small things I would add in though:

I'd give Parvati and Lavender a redemption arc and not leave Hermione with no female friends apart from Ginny who she's forced together with. JKR quite obviously had a chip on her shoulder when writing about all kinds of girls - Lavender and Parvati are described disparagingly, but so is Pansy, and Millicent, and even Fleur - all for different reasons.

Harry has an interest in Lily's life too, not just James's, and broadly Harry's teachers go more out of their way to stick up for and look out for him - it's a little absurd in canon how people who were both mentors /and/ colleagues of his parents don't make even the slightest attempt to reach out to their long-lost kid when given the chance. Obv JKR probably avoided this in canon to preserve the twist of the Snape-Lily relationship, but that could have been avoided by skilfully plotting around having to reveal anything - for an in-verse example, Slughorn doesn't reveal anything about the friendship despite both Lily /and/ Harry being his prize students.

I wouldn't write out Mrs Figg after book 5, she would make sporadic appearances as comic relief.

I'd make sure a note was thrown in about Hagrid and Madame Maxime's future at some point instead of giving them an extended sideplot over two books and then dropping it out of the blue. And I might nix Grawp because that plot really didn't go anywhere and imo it wasn't really needed, given that giants didn't come to otherwise play any role.

Lupin and Tonks would be canonically queer even if they did end up together at the end. I both like and don't like the pairing so I might also adjust the ages or flesh out the relationship a bit to smooth over the parts I find offputting. (currently it has a vibe of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares][Pair the Spares]])

I'd like Hermione to introduce Neville to muggle medicine and leave it open-ended but with a note of hope that Frank and Alice were able to be helped back towards some of their previous capabilities and selfhood.

And generally on that note, I'd include muggles more positively, because canon as-is treads an uncomfortable line between being pro-muggle and muggleborn /vocally/, but not so much in practice. I don't think that was intentional on JKR's part and I think a more switched-on editor would have been able to catch that and drop in instances or examples of /why/ muggles and muggleborns should be included - or shouldn't - rather than broadly leaving it as blind prejudice because the bad guys are just bad.

E: and also, because I forgot at first - there should be more Weasleys! Ron sets them up as a /huge/ family in book 1, so where are all the cousins? There should be something like 15 or more Weasleys in the school at any one time if they're so prolific.
