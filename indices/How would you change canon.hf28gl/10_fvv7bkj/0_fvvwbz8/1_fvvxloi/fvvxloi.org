I disagree. Why would it be so lame? Ron is Harry's best friend, and his death would have the biggest impact on Harry. It would hurt Harry the most, and as much as I hate to say it, Ron wasn't /that/ needed during the search for Horcruxes. I don't think Ron and Harry would be successful without Hermione. She was the one who made plans and prepared for the hunt, so killing her would probably ruin the chances of destroying Voldemort. Harry knows Voldemort well, but it would be difficult to accomplish his task if Hermione didn't research Horcruxes or packed the essentials they would need.
