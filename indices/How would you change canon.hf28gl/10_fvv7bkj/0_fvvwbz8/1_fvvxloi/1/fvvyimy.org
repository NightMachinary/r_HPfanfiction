Okay, first you are augmenting using a ridiculous soft plothole.

The entire horcrux hunt was ridiculous. Anyone can destroy a horcrux and three teenagers are the best all of magic Britain has to offer? Seriously, just how bad are the adults in HP?

" much as I hate to say it, Ron wasn't that needed during the search for Horcruxes"

And that is exactly WHY it is lame, why Ron is the spare, why this would be boring writing.
