I would probably make it a little darker and remove the epilogue (the whole "all was well" crap makes me cringe even now, the same as "Albus Severus").

​

I think I would make some changes about the Unforgivable Curses; Crucio and Imperio are cool, but Avada Kedavra makes things weird. If such a spell existed, every death eater should use it, but in canon, they use a bunch of different spells. And it takes so much magic from, well, magic. I mean, the Battle of Hogwarts was great because we saw all those cool things wizards can do. Neville and Sprout used dangerous plants, McGonagall led a charge of desks to the battle, bewitched suits of armour fought death eaters, Hagrid's creatures joined the battle and many more. It was amazing, but if Avada Kedavra exists in the way it did in canon, then it all comes to shouting and waving a wand. I think I would make Avada Kedavra either so difficult no one could use it, or make it have some serious consequences so no one would want to use it.

​

As much as it hurts me, I would kill more Weasleys. It's a little unbelievable that only Fred died. I mean, Arthur and Percy worked at the Ministry when it was under Voldemort's control, and Ginny went to Hogwarts! I think I would kill at least 3 of them.

​

I would kill one of the Golden Trio. I've read somewhere that when JKR was depressed after her mother's death, she wanted to kill Ron, and I think HBP is a great moment to do this. So yeah, Harry would probably take too much time to find bezoar and Ron would die. It would give Harry a serious push to fight, and make it really sink that they are at war.

​

I like the scar they gave Hermione in the movies, so I would make it happen in the books too.

​

Instead of Sirius, I would kill Remus in OOTP. I loved them both, but I kind of don't see the point of Remus staying alive till the BOH except for giving him a child he would orphan in a matter of days, and I have no feelings about Teddy, so yeah. And it would hurt so much more if Sirius died in HBP or the beginning of DH or even during BOH.

​

I think I would like to add a little bit to JKR world-building; patch a few plotholes, explain a bit more in certain aspects, and include a little more about Lily and James. I always find it so weird that Harry never tried to find out more about his family. He was at Hogwarts, surrounded by people who knew Lily and James, but he doesn't really ask questions or search for things about them in school records, papers, books, whatever.

​

Also, I would remove the roaring monster in Harry's chest. I blame JKR's poor romance-writing skill for my dislike of Harry and Ginny together. So yeah, I would probably change the pairings too, though I would not make it as permanent as JKR. The ending should be open so the reader could fill the gaps with his vision of what happened next.
