I would make Horcrux's actually split the Soul in half each time. 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%... 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16... it would explain why Tom was so bat shit insane, if he only had 0.78125% or 1/128 of a soul, by the end.

No cucking wonder, he didn't look human.

And I'd make a majority the minimum amount of a Soul you can have, and still be sane. 50% is too little, 51% is more than enough. So, unless you take some extensive measures to re-merge with some of them, you'll always go off the deep end after making a single Crux.

Secondly, I'd make the Hollows actually useful. The Wand should grant Living Magic to it's master that will defend and attack on it's own, and let them use the magic of their opponents as well as their own, and you should have to steal it to gain it's mastery, but it should encourage you to take unhealthy risks. The Stone should let you command the dead and control your own soul, as well as pull/push others between life and death at will, and it should need to be Found by accident on your part to be mastered, but it should depress you as you use it, in an “On the scale of Totality, I am nought but dust” kind of way. And the Cloak should make you Unkillable, so that Death Can Not Find You, as well as grant complete undetectability as a side effect, not just invisibility, and it should need to be Inherited to master, but soon after you pass it on you die, Death catches up to everyone eventually.

If you become the MoD, you should get Wandless Magic and the ability to call the Wand anywhere and use it to kill anything, a Phoenix Animagus Form and the ability to travel to the afterlife and back yourself making physical death only a mild annoyance, and the ability to be anyone (any age, any race, any sex, any species, speak any language, never forget anything) and the ability to grant a lesser death-aversion to others. As well, the physical Hollows would become shadows of themselves, projections of your magic; while the Real power would be a part of you.

Why did Harry survive the Killing Curse? His father was dead. He was the Cloaks Master. He Could Not Be Killed. How did be survive the Dursley's? The Basilisk? The Dragon? The Maze? He Could Not Be Killed! Not until he produced a legitimate Heir to inherit the Cloak. Tricks don't work. Rape, Slavery, Adoption, Abortion; you name it, it's been tried. The Potters have had the Cloak for close to a thousand years, they've tried Everything at one point or another to be rid of it, and there's a self-translating-book around here somewhere with all that they've learnt (ask the goblins, I'm sure they're holding a copy. You don't piss off the un-endable Bloodline, after all). You die soon after you pass it on, but you must legitimately pass it on first.
