Nah, I like that the Potter Bloodline can't be extinguished. It would mean that Death had always intended to have a Master that didn't want to be so. If the Potters spent forever trying to get rid of the thing because you died as soon as you passed it on, then whoever finally brought them together would then be doomed to watch their family grow old and die without them. They could protect them from accidents, but not old age.

They could visit their family, yes, but if they couldn't forget anything then eventually they'd have thousands of ‘best friends' and ‘lovers' and life would become meaningless. But still, they would be forced to live it.

If the Bloodline could be extinguished, then it wouldn't be a descendant of that oh-so-clever youngest Peverell to be cursed in such a way, but with the bloodline dead the Cloak wouldn't be Inheritable any more, which would mean it'd need another way to gain Mastery, which would make a MoD vastly more likely in the long run. Death is ‘all of human history is an eye blink' kind of long minded, a slightly stronger Cloak per human life is meaningless, when they each don't even live 200 years. Each passing death bringing that eventual conclusion ever closer, but if only a Peverell (and so, a Potter) can be the MoD, and the Cloak designates the next possible choice, then Death can influence the Master. Death would always know the Only possibility for the MoD, and all the stupid humans fighting over it would be meaningless.
