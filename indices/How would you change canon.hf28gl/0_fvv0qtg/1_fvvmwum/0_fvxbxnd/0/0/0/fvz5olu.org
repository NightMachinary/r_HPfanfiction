Because negative emotions weaken a wizards magic to the point that they can straight up become unable to use it after sufficiently traumatic events.

here are the examples we see

Magic gets weaker in a Dementors presence

  “Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible... *Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...”*

After Remus rejected Tonks she couldn't control her shapeshifting anymore

  "It's survivor's guilt," said Hermione. "I know Lupin's tried to talk her round, but she's still really down. She's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!"

  "With her...?"

  *"She can't change her appearance like she used to," explained Hermione.* *"I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something."*

  *"I didn't know that could happen," said Harry.*

  *"Nor did I," said Hermione, "but I suppose if you're really depressed..."*

And Merope Gaunt lost her Powers after her Husband rejected her for enslaving him.

#+begin_quote
  "But she could do magic!" said Harry impatiently. "She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn't she?"

  "Ah," said Dumbledore, "perhaps she could. But it is my belief---I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right --- that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. *Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen.* In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life."
