Most things suggested here make sense, but I would add two of my pet-peeves:

1. Do something about liberating Sirius Black post-PoA. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hei4op/dumbledore_bashing_not_making_sense/fvrujba/][this thread]]

2. What is the most important lesson for Weasleys and Trio from CoS? That they were bunch of jerks when they completely ignored Ginny in troubles whole year? And what is the next thing they do? They ignore Ginny for another two years (until the middle of OotP). Just don't. And please include [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f67nlv/exploding_snap_from_the_cursed_child/][this scene]].
