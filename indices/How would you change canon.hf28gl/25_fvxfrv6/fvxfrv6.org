I would give as much more classes scenes as possible. More of Hogwarts exploration, more of friendship bonding, more of animals and another types of magic and how they are used to solve routine problems of the group.

I Would make harry's and hermione's friendship more solid too. i think its just too much focused on harry and ron on a lot of the time.

I would have shown more of how magic people interact with muggle people using the weasley father as the shining light of these moments.

I would finally give more motive for harry to be with ginny besides from "lol i just like her now, shes heroic and plays very well".
