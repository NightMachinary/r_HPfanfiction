I wouldn't really change much of the plot, since I doubt I could do much better. I also happen to like Canon(there are still a couple things that annoy me).

Mostly I would just add a little more foreshadowing for future plot points, like the Hallows or the significance of wand allegiances.

I'd also specify a couple things that were mentioned in the books, but were apparently not clear enough, like Time Turners being able to change the past, or the purpose of Occlumency being to magically protect the mind instead of just protecting against Legilimency. In general explanations why 'obvious solutions' dont work.

Remove things that didn't make sense with later introduced Plot points, like Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using apparition. And use terms that weren't even invented until later books like Squib.

Another thing would be to to get numbers a little bit better sorted out to be more consistent, so stuff like the value of money and the number of wizards in the story makes more sense, but also stuff like how old they were at certain moment and dates in general.

One bigger change I would make is having Harry and Ron show more talent at magic and use it more often, since Deathly Hallows shows them as very competent compared to other wizards, when they only looked a little above average before with Harry even seeming to struggle quite a bit in sixth year.

I'd like to say that I would change the romance in the books, but I actually like that there wasn't a very big focus of it, and dont really mind the pairings.

And by far the biggest change I would make is to the Epilogue, where I change the name of Albus Severus to Albus Rubeus or something like that. Also remove the mention of the Malfoys, because it didn't make any sense that Draco didn't end up in prison after the war.
