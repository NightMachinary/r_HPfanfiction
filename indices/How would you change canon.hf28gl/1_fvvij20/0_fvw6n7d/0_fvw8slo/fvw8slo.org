  what do you think about the idea of slipping in mentions of Beedle the Bard, the Peverell brothers, or the Deathly Hallows into earlier books?

Thats what I meant with this.

  Mostly I would just add a little more foreshadowing for future plot points, like the Hallows or the significance of wand allegiances.

I think you could easily do this for the Deathly Hallows since two were at Hogwarts for most of the books, Ron for example knew about the fairytale and him making a remark or just telling it Harry when first seeing the invisibility cloak wouldn't be out of place. For Dumbledore you could just be subtle and a casual mention by him how he's not wielding his first wand would be enough.

Slipping by a mention of Beedle in general is even easier, since you don't even have to connect the Tale of the Three Brothers to it, just have Ron make a remark about Babbitty Rabbitty when interacting with Sirius and it would make sense.

And because of Chocolate frog Cards introducing old powerful wizards like the Perevells isn't a problem either.

  I always felt that there were great seeds planted in earlier books for the big plot points, except for the DH. (Examples being the silver locket mentioned in OotP, Snape's first bullying of Harry in SS, etc.)

I agree, Horcruxes in particular seemed to have been planned from the beginning quite well, just reading the scene where Harry dreams of wearing Quirrel's turban shows that Harry was always meant to be one.
