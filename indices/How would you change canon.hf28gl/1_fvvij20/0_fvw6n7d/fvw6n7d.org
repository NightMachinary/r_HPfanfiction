I like your list quite a bit. Along the lines of "smoothing out" later introduced plot points, what do you think about the idea of slipping in mentions of Beedle the Bard, the Peverell brothers, or the Deathly Hallows into earlier books?

I always felt that there were great seeds planted in earlier books for the big plot points, except for the DH. (Examples being the silver locket mentioned in OotP, Snape's first bullying of Harry in SS, etc.)
