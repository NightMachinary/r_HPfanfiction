- No Epilogue

- Remove the demonization of some of the more benign methods of Immortality like the philosopher's stone. I found that really preachy and annoying.

- Keep magic more whimsical and fanciful in later books.

- Remove the divination bashing.

- The Book I would make major changes to is seventh book.( Its the one I dislike the most.)
