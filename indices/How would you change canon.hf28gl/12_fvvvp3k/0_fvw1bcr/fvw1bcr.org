I agree the snitch shouldn't be worth 150 points (15 goals) but I think I would still have it slightly more than 20 maybe 30 - 50 points. You want to find the balance where you need to keep the game close/to slightly dominant but you also need to catch the snitch. So having the snitch be worth 3-5 times more than a goal is probably about right. But definitely get rid of the 150 points.
