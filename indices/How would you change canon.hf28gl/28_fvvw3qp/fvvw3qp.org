By now? Oh man, almost everything.

First, erase the hard plotholes. Time turners is ofc the first thing that comes to mind.

Then, erase the soft plotholes. Like holy f what kind of absolute dickhead does not check up on his dead friend's child? (Remus)

Then, erase the moral holes. The disgusting romanticizing abuse for example.

Has anyone here actually read canon as an adult? I did, and I wish I hadn't, canon is so bad. Like so, so bad.

I even stopped reading HP ff, because of it.
