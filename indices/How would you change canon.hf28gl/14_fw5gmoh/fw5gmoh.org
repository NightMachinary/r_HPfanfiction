- Give Horcruxes actual weaknesses. Like if I destroy one, Voldemort loses some of his magic. Or I can use a horcrux in a ritual to weaken/torture Voldemort. Or the act of having horcruxes makes you weak to unicorns and/or phoenix tears/song.
- Shave off 95% of the Dursley Abuse. It only makes Dumbledore look bad. just make them indifferent to him.
- Not have Dumbledore give out 47 chances to everybody. Because 47 is a nice even number.
- Give Harry some victories that actually mean something without the "one step forward, three steps back" that happens all through the books.
- Get rid of the Hallows. Those things are a crappy gimmick that only existed for dues ex machina.
- Not destroy Magical britain with your victory.
- Not make the wizarding world populated with mindless sheep.
- Get rid of Umbridge.
- Have Sirius actually freed.
- Have Harry defeat Voldemort in a duel and not some shitty trope filled luck-induced dues ex machina.

EDIT: Remove the Ron bugging about the scar and "remembering the night your parents were brutally murdered in front of me and almost getting murdered myself". 99% of kids would tell him to fuck off.
