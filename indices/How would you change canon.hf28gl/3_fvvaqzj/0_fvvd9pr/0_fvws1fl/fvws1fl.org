I thought [[/u/SirYabas][u/SirYabas]] meant that as a separate point to the first - because there isn't really much female friendship positively portrayed in the books in any depth. Ginny-Hermione and Ginny-Luna take place mostly offscreen, as does Parvati-Lavender and any close friendship between Alicia-Angelina-Katie.
