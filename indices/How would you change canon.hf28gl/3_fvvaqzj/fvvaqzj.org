Harry would have some friends in other houses. Some good female friendships. Goblet of Fire is a fun read but doesn't make a lot of narrative sense. Harry realises there is a pattern with almost dying/his life being in danger when he gets informed there is a mass murderer after him, he starts taking magic a little more serious. He doesn't get on Voldemort/Dumbledore level, but he is good enough at the fighting aspect that luck can play a realistic role.

Order of the Phoenix Harry would be taking the occlumemcy training seriously. He informs adults when he sees Arthur getting attacked by Nagini. Adults don't head his warning because it wasnt Arthur's turn to guard the prophecy, turns out Arthur traded shifts with someone without informing Dumbledore. Arthur gets maimed (loses and arm/leg) for life. Ron gets to realise that this shit is serious and grows up a little. Harry was already mad at adults for having to solve all their problems and feels he can't trust them anymore. He never had trustworthy aduls in his life. He 'rebels' and thinks he can do a better job. Dumbledore Army starts. Harry stops blocking Voldemort and tries to see what's up to instead. He gets a few success out of it, but it bites him in the ass when Sirius dies. He tries to blame adults around him like but realises it's his fault.
