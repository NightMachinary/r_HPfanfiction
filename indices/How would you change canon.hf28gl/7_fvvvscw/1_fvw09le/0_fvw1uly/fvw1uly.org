I've thought about that a lot on how if spells could be improved like how someone would improve a piece of machinery or computer code.

We know that people at the very least spend time to improve potions and potion ingredients. Ie snape and i think dumbledore wrote an essay about dragons blood.

And I think dumbledore did figure out how to send messages through a patronus.

Like maybe wand movements and incantations could be slightly changed for more complicated spells.

The second theory is pretty interesting. It kind of reminds me of vampire lore like getting uninvited from a house like in true blood.

But also doesn't Hermione directly say Harry and all the order members are SK for grimmauld place? And harry lived there for a couple months.
