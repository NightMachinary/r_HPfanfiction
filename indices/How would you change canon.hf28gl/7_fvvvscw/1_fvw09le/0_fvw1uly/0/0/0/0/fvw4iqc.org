No it was when Dumbledore died. He was SK for grimmauld place.

Hermione in book 7 says that they are all Secret Keepers. And they think they accidently let in that death eater so they are not sure if they can go back after the ministry mission. Although to me that also seems like a plot hole unless the DE also became SL because in Rowlings write up it says you have to deliberately tell the secret, not just accidently grab on when apparating.
