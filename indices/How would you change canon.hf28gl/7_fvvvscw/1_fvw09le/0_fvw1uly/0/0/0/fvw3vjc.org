Had to edit the previous post. Now (realizing that canon and fanon are melding together) when Sirius died Harry as well as everyone else who knew the secret became the secret keepers for Grimmauld Place. If I remember correctly at no time in canon was the fidelius recast over Grimmauld Place with only Harry as the Secret keeper. So the "restriction" of ownership and fidelius holds.

Of course if I'm wrong (ie., fidelius recast with Harry as the secret keeper) it just means we've identified another plot hole.
