Sorry right. IMO it's a plot hole. However we can simply claim that when multiple people become the secret keeper because the original secret keeper has died the magic doesn't care that one of the new secret keepers is the owner.

On the DE Yaxley? I always thought that you had to know the secret in order to apparate into a fidelius charmed property. So the DE shouldn't have been able to "tag along". And 2 since the DE wouldn't know where they were at as soon as he left the fidelius charmed property he wouldn't know where he had been.

So this fell through the cracks for JKR
