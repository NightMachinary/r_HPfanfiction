I think the last part is due to canon where if the secret keeper of a fidelius charmed property dies then everyone who knew the secret becomes the secret keeper. Which means any of them can give away the secret. So maybe once you get into a multiple secret keeper arena the magic doesn't care if an owner is one of those multiples.

So you would think that one desired improvement would be the ability to transfer secret keepers. Eg you already removed the knowledge of the property from everyone else (which is why the power needed may be high if lots of people know the information you are trying to hide) and stored that knowledge in one person. Now you're just switching where the knowledge is kept.
