I received two responses (well besides "plot reasons") to a similar question I posed about the Fidelius.

One response said that the Fidelius charm had been improved between 1981 and 1997 that now allowed the owner of the property to be the Secret keeper.

The second response postulated that Arthur and Bill didn't own the Burrow and Shell Cottage and that Aunt Muriel did which allowed Arthur and Bill to be their respective secret keepers.

Nothing in canon that even hints that these are true but at least they are a little better than just plot hole/plot reasons.
