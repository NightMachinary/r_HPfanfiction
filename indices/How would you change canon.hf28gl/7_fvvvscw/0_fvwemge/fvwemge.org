I always liked the idea that they technically could, as in the spell would let them do that, but who they were wouldn't allow it. Both of them defied Voldemort personally three times and were pretty decently involved in the war. They were also both highly stubborn and brave, determined people. My interpretation of the characters would mean they wouldn't fort up and let everything else burn, they'd try do something, and that something was a trick. Flush out the spy with bait and try ambush whoever it was (I believe it's canon that the Order knew there was a spy, they just didn't know who) and they just got overconfident and fucked up.

Elevates the Potters up a little in a heroic sense, but makes their fate a little more sad as well, I think.
