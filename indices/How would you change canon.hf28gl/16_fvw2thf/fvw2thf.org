Among obvious things (more diverse, avoiding clear anti-Semitic tropes, having Harry be less abused and making Dumbledore less manipulative), I'd want to build up a lot of supporting characters. Oliver Wood serves like an elder brother to Harry in my headcanon, since he takes Harry under his wing from the start of his first year. I'd want to see them stay in touch over the next few years (maybe Oliver convinces Harry to play professional quidditch instead of being an auror)

Honestly, more development for background characters in other houses, even giving firm numbers on HOW MANY Hogwarts students there are.

Also, re:Weasley family.... utilize Percy Weasley. Was he a sleeper agent in the Ministry who isolated his family to keep them out of harm's way? What was it like being a blood traitor from a prominent order family, trapped in ministry employment? I would AT LEAST have the trio interact with Percy during the ministry break in, show that he doesn't want to be there and he wants a way out. I think it would be brilliant if one of the trio managed to make contact with Percy during that day and gives him a dumbledores army coin and that's how he gets to the battle of Hogwarts. Also, just make Percy seem like less of an arse in the series --- he's a teenager who got into an argument with his father and stormed out!

For couples who end up together.... I keep most of the core ones. Keep the epilogue. Replace Lupin/Tonks with Charlie Weasley/Tonks (young couple, same age, orphan child who wouldn't have as close a connection to Harry but he'd still see a lot of suffering from it. Obviously, Bill raises Charlie's son). Percy Weasley is bi, put him with Oliver Wood.

I'd have to debate this a LOT but POSSIBLY kill Ron at battle of Hogwarts. In a parallel to first year, he sacrifices himself so Harry and hermione can keep going. In that scenario, hermione ends up with either Viktor Krum or George Weasley.
