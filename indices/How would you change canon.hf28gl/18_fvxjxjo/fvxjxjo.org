- No expilliarmus. I would make my main character respect his uncle/godfather/parents enough to actually fight back against their murderer.

- no Deathly Hallows. It was a cheap deus ex machina that JKR was forced to invent once she realized she'd written 6.5 books about a powerful villain who can only be killed by a prophesized child, and that she'd done nothing the whole series to give the hero a chance at winning.

- i would have not had the main characters all marry into the same family. Weird.

- i would have explained horcruxes more. Almost no mechanics provided about this super important plot device.

- Either Dumbledore is the MC/protagonist, or Harry has some independence. Book 7 really kind of revealed Harry has almost no agency, and just followed Dumbledore's orders - even from the grave - like a particularly well-trained dog.

- i would have acknowledged love isn't a "chest monster", and it doesn't happen with people that ruin big nights in horribly public fashion (R/HR Yule Ball).

And that's just for starters. I genuinely love books 1-4, when Harry and co. are children. But JKR had no idea how to transition from "children's story" to "young adult fiction". Romance, action, believable plot resolution: all of these things were missing from the HP canon. That's the real reason the fanfic community is still going strong, a decade later.
