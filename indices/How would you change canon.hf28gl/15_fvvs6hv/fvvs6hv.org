Many changes:

- The Dursleys tried their best with Harry, but were overwhelmed with raising a magical child (imagine tantrums with accidental magic!). They did lose their temper a few times, but never abused Harry. This change will remove the overused "abusive childhood" trope that has become formulaic in children's literature. It will also make Dumbledore not into a negligent shithead in this case.
- Year 1 plot can remain mostly the same. But the detention in the Forbidden Forest makes no sense and should be deleted. Voldemort didn't flee for Albania after being stopped. He tried to seek out other followers.
- In Year 2, once the first attack on students happened, they figured out it was a Basilisk, and Dumbledore locked down the school accordingly. Lucius however would stir much bigger trouble here (such as trying to send Ginny to Azkaban).
- There will be NO time turners in my version of the story. They got Wormtail and exonerated Sirius, but Voldemort found Barty Jr, he broke free, and began impersonating his father. Harry moved into Grimmauld Place and began receiving training.
- Barty Jr ala Barty Sr hacked the Goblet and got Harry in. The whole Trio was accused by the school of cheating. Barty Jr recruited more Death Eaters (Carrows or Macnair or Avery). Only Harry turned up in the Graveyard and was subdued by multiple Death Eaters after a reasonable fight. Barty Jr, still present at Hogwarts, easily put Fudge under Imperius.
- Barty Jr, through imperiused Fudge, began populating Ministry with their minions. Actions against Dumbledore and Harry went on as in canon. Harry, however, was relatively well trained at this time quickly turned the table on Umbridge when she tried to pull the blood quill trick. Dumbledore then memory charmed Umbridge into believing she had won, but asked Harry to stay low this time.
- In the background, the Order was running a covert op for the control of the Ministry and losing. Voldemort however was fixated on getting the prophecy, against the advice by Barty and Lucius. Dumbledore decided to lure him into the Ministry using the prophecy (already replaced with a fake at this time) and expose him.
- DA was still formed. Hermione cursed contract with much more severe penalty than in canon, but told everyone upfront. This DA met much more frequently and was further guided by Dumbledore, Remus, and Sirius. When they were exposed, Dumbledore went rogue and kidnapped Umbridge.
- Voldemort pulled the same trick of torturing Sirius, which Harry saw through immediately. Sirius on the other hand suggested that this was their chance of luring Voldemort into the open and spring a huge reverse trap on Death Eaters. In the ensuing battle, Voldemort was exposed, several Death Eaters were killed, but they lost Arthur Weasley. The Weasleys became radicalized, especially Ron and Ginny. When Fudge was ousted as Minister, Barty Jr made him commit suicide. He continued to sabotage and infiltrate the Ministry from within.
- Dumbledore was mortally injured on the Horcrux Hunt. Throughout the entire Year 6, they were gearing up for the coming war. There would be lots of training, magical theory, logistic, political, and strategy scenes, interspersed with a few teenager drama and romance. It was the calm before the storm.
