Honestly, I feel like anyone growing up in a house with that many siblings wouldn't be such a colossal dunce during first year. He's watching his parents use magic for damn near everything. We assume that the older children also used magic fairly frequently. Yes, it's not the same as doing, but he'd have heard the levitation spell at least a few hundred dozen times by the time his letter to hogwarts arrived.

Edit: it would be like an 11 year old kid not knowing how to ask Siri to set a timer, or change the ring tone on your cell phone. Young kids pick up on stuff really fast.
