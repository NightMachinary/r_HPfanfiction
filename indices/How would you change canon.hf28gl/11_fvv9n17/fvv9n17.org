1. Use the real-world calendar- 1st September isn't always Sunday. Or dump the use of weekdays as a reference- perhaps the wizarding world operates on moon cycles: "See you Sunday!" "What?" "She means second Gibbous descending."

2. Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; her use of it wouldn't be approved (though it wouldn't need to be since /there is no reason any of the third year classes should conflict/); she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.

3. Lily invented the Wolfsbane draught for Remus and published the formula anonymously at James' suggestion (and Sirius' protestations) -- because Lily was awesome, and that would be evidence of it.

4. The Goblet of Fire is the tournament trophy. It has unique divining properties valued by all three schools. Throughout the fourth book Harry has nightmares of the Cup, always feeling its presence threatening his future.

5. The Order of the Phoenix is heard to implement several operations of mixed outcome; they're there when Voldemort opens up Azkaban and are involved with tracking recruited Death Eaters based upon Harry's memories of the graveyard.

6. During Half-Blood Prince, Harry goes out of Hogwarts on day-trips with Order members, particularly Albus as he hunts for evidence of Riddle's method for immortality. Sometimes it's Harry's lonely upbringing which helps him identify with Riddle and find key clues; other times it just proves painfully educational

7. Redo the Battle of Seven Potters to not use ridiculous tactics and instead display Harry's talent for improvisation during battle; I would have set up a reason why returning to Privet drive was necessary. I would have had Moody, Tonks and Lupin show up at his door a week early of a sudden and have them shuffle Harry and the Dursleys out, creating a running battle where Harry is pursued on a broom. Vernon protests too long and gets murdered despite Petunia urging him to go along, then the surviving two Dursleys get disapparated to a safe place. All sorts of hijinks could ensue as Harry tries to find a quiet place to get a breath and escape to safety, knowing that any spell or attempt at apparation would be detected.

Hedwig would have died saving him from a killing curse as in the movie- because that's the right way to do it. Hedwig's death was the symbol of Harry's departure from childhood, but she deserved a better death than being treated like an action figure accessory.

Similarly, the end battle is a bit too much of a cartoonish showdown with bad dialogue between Harry and Voldemort.

In the realm of overall changes, I would have made certain Ron was more than comedic relief- he should have been a paragon of loyalty as he demonstrated in the early books. It would make the turn in book seven more of a surprise instead of 'Really? Again?' Also, he ought to make regular comments of 'Of course that's the way it works in magical society', particularly about things that aren't purely factual, like biases and tendencies and grooming habits. In particular, Ron should have been the cook during the last book, and his departure really a blow to Harry and Hermione's ability to endure the camping.
