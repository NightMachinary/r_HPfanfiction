oh hell, that is a dream! I would make so many changes. (I still love HP, but...)

1.  Dumbledore would be a rooster whom everyone except Harry understands, and Harry is just looking weird at everybody... "but... but he is just a chicken!".
2.  with that, there will be no Dumbledore and Harry would have to find out about everything by himself. I personally don't think Dumbles was necessary to the plot. he can still be taken as the feared and wise Dumbledore. Just not to harry. even order could have been led by someone else, like Shacklebolt or Moody, Harry could have known about the horcruxes from Hermione who couldn't help but research that weird diary. "but it's impossible for a memory to be contained in an object. that must have been a very dark magic. I must find out more about it!"
3.  that means, no manipulative Dumbles, or all-knowing, all-powerfull etc. just there having a role of a headmaster, nothing else. also the gargoyle doesn't have a password so any student can actually go to him if they need help. wth was Dumbledore's job anyway? what was he doing all day long?
4.  even if I wouldn't go with a rooster, and normal wizard. I would not make him a Harry mentor for sure. he will just be a regular headmaster, maybe powerful so Voldy still won't try to take down the school. he also wouldn't be the one to take Harry to the Dursleys. it will be the ministry, because... only known relatives. and they won't leave him at the doorstep. they would talk to them. Dumbles will also not be order leader.
5.  I don't think I would want a prophecy there either. just the concept of the chosen one is...
6.  quidditch is out and instead we have dueling. there can still be quidditch, just like gobstones and other clubs. hell, Harry can even still be a seeker, it's just not a super important part of the story and not the whole school attends the matches.
7.  agree about slytherin having other characters than bullies. and also other houses. the whole series was completely gryffindor. the only exception was Luna and she didn't have such a big role anyway. more interhouse friendships and other houses could visit themselves in different dormitories. or sit at their tables etc.
8.  JK wanted to make Dean/Seamus, so I would def. do that.
9.  more magical spells. not just shooting. this especially in the movies, but even books didn't have much. the only duel that was exciting was Dumbles/Voldy in fifth book. otherwise it was meh. why couldn't the kids learn to make a globe out of water in charms? and generally more magical element, other weird magicks, maybe other animals understanding talents, other than snakes.
10. No Hinny. I like Romione though, they would stay. but Ginny was like... a fan.
11. not killing Fred!!! omg! I have a twin, that seriously struck me way too much.
12. before the seventh book was out there was this theory that McGonnagal was a hidden death eater and it made so much sense. from her calling muggles stupid to not helping Harry... ever, caring about quidditch more than rules (Harry was 1st year), being angry at the trio when they just defended themselves against the troll, etc. I wonder if I can still find that site somewhere. it was a solid theory.
13. no epilogue. just make it end when the battle ends. or maybe having a chapter or two healing or rebuilding so that it truly ends with their 7th year ending.
14. being a hufflepuff, badgers are pretty lame in comparison to a snake, lion and eagle. ... so hufflepuff mascot is obviously a bear.
15. the children will actually learn stuff. all the books are either adventure or writing essays. way too little time given to classes. essays don't do much. they can also practice the charms in some classrooms when lessons are out. including having a potions room where they can brew. this was in a couple of fics, but I'm pretty sure that's only fanon and not canon. otherwise, Hermione would use that in the books. they could still brew polyjuice in bathroom, since that is illegal.
16. Harry will get a snake after all the parsletounge drama.
17. having Dursleys not so evil. I mean, they kept him in a cupboard. without food. it would be fine if they just liked Dudley more, but Harry was truly abused. just giving him a normal room from the start and maybe some presents too. way less than to Dudley still, maybe a book and colored pencils, that's not much.
