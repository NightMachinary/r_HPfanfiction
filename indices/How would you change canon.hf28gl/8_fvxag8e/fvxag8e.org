I would give Draco a redemption arc that starts early in the series, I would change the house dynamics and make good Slytherins prominent too. I would change some names around (Cho Chang stands out). I would kill off more Weasley's because it isn't logical that only 1/9 of them died -- definitely kill Arthur and let Ron have a maturity moment with that, probably keep Fred dead and maybe kill George too, possibly kill Molly so that its poetic to leave the golden trio all orphaned at the end of the war (Hermione's parents count as orphaned). Let Neville, Ginny, Luna, and Hermione all battle Bellatrix and they kill her together because Bellatrix directly harmed them the most (let's assume Bellatrix is the one who killed Molly in my new universe). On that note, definitely make the mudblood carving book canon. Let Fleur and Krum have a bigger part in the last books and I would honestly have Hermione date Krum long term (maybe not marry, idk). With Draco's redemption arc he could easily end up with Harry or Hermione or some random person I don't care too much.
