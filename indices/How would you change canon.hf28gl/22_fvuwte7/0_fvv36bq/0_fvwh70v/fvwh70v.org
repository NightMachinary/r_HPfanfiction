You say that, but Hogwarts is the only school in Britain and Ireland - it's not like there are loads of suitable partners waiting who went to another school. While I can see many people getting together outside of school, like after working together or whatnot, from what we see it is something of a cultural norm for wizards to pair off young and stay that way.

The British and Irish wizarding world is in many ways a closed, small, community - I like to think of it as effectively a small town (relative to Muggle standards), but decentralised because magic means you don't need to be in close physical proximity.

It reminds me a lot of the situation historically in the real world in small and relatively isolated communities - people tend not to date very many people over the course of a lifetime, with relationships generally carrying on until/unless something very bad happens. My grandparents and most people they knew got married young, stayed married, and are now basically all dead in pairs. But to be fair they had a small, largely static, set of options.

My parents' generation was much less like that, and mine not at all - almost everyone I know within 5 years of 30 in either direction has had multiple 'serious' relationships and barely any of us have kids, have been married yet etc.

Tldr: I think some of it can be explained by cultural differences, since although the books are set parallel to the real world, wizards aren't muggles.

I do agree narratively it seems a bit too 'neat' the way it was done though.
