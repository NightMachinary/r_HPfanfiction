Honestly, I'd cut the long term-ness of the pairings all together. Post war, there should necessarily be less focus on blood purity (because the assholes who were the biggest jerks about it are all a gibbering mess on the floor, or past the veil, according to your cannon), and have /maybe/ a couple of people pair up from the school. Real life is such that not everyone marries whom they were with in high school. You travel (especially as a wizard who can go freaking anywhere), you figure out what region works for you, you make friends, and eventually love happens. I think because the series was written as a children's book, they needed to pair everyone off and have a tidy ending.
