There would be several things.

1st would be the pairings. The first 4 books I only saw Harry and Hermione building a romance so I never liked the canon pairings. So my books would Have Harry/Hermione, I would put Ginny with an OMC quidditch player, Ron/Lavender, and Neville/Hannah. If I make Headship more of a thing then I would have Hermione as Lady Potter and Luna as Lady Black.

2nd big change would be Sirius living I mean come on How much misery does Harry have to suffer that every possible family figure has to die leaving him alone.

3rd big change Deatheaters truly get punished. I by that I mean permanently eg Dementor's kiss or the veil. I don't need some future dark lord have a ready made cadre by breaking folks out of Azkaban. So Draco and Lucius would be toast.

4th change not sure what I would do. Keep both Remus and Tonks alive, have Remus die, or have them both die and have Harry and Hermione (also Luna if I set that up) raising Teddy. It depends on where i want to take the story. Right now it's a tie between both living or both dying.

Edit: I've always wondered why folks would downvote a post/response but not comment on what they didn't like about it.. I've never downvoted anything though I have commented on what I disagreed with.
