Uh....

Given how small and isolated the British magical community is, and the rarity of muggleborns, I'd say that Hogwarts is extremely diverse. The UK isn't America (which is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world) - if 1/4 of Hogwarts had been BAME, it would have felt like absurd woke-ism.

Most social scientific research I've come across lists ~10% of the population as not being heterosexual. I agree that one old man is not much representation. However, see my above point, RE: small, insular community. I think a few throwaway lines about non-conforming sexual orientations being "unacceptable" to purebloods should have been included if there were not going to be any LGBT characters.
