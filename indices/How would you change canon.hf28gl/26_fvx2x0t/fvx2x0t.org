I would have more queer characters since there is none, (Dumbledore does NOT count, that is not representation), as far as characters who I think could be queer I think Ginny would be a powerful bisexual and maybe McGonagall a lesbian (she would be the ultimate lesbian, she literally can turn into a cat). There are more but I'll stop listing, I would also include more POC. As far as major plot points, I would keep Siruis alive at least until the final book. I think there was so much room there for them (Sirius and Harry) to develop such a wonderful relationship. I would also include Slytherin's that are good so it isn't as easy to dismiss the entire house as evil but it doesn't really make sense to me for every single Slytherin to be evil. I would also show that Harry and Ron while not as academic as Hermione still both very good wizards, they were played out to be a bit stupid which doesn't make sense considering they go on to help save the wizarding world. One major thing though is I would make Neville more of a prominent character, to me at least he is such an important character to the plot. It was possible that he was the wizard in the prophecy but that was glossed over, I also think his character arc from going from being very scared to showing a lot of courage in the final book wasn't very good. I mean it made sense that he got to that point but it didn't show how he got to that point so much, like what were his major turning points. I suppose you could say the battle of the department of ministries and staying at Hogwarts on the 7th year but it wasn't articulated much.
