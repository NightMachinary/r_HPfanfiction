First things first, I'd keep the Dursleys' abuse but change Harry's emotional stability. He was way, /way/ too emotionally stable in the books.

I'd also make Snape not be such a bully because it would make no sense for him to treat the love of his life's son like such a dirtbag as well as other students. The man's supposed to have good self-control since he's a mastered Occlumens! I'd also keep him alive and actually make him the master of the Elder Wand (meaning that Snape would Disarm Draco /before/ he fires the Killing Curse). I also would make him mean at first, but then I'd make him slowly realize that Harry is more like his mother.

I would keep Remus alive, of course, but I'd make Sirius die a more heroic death in HBP or DH.

I like the canon pairings, so I woudn't change anything about that, but I also would make Harry be a little smarter when it came to dating. His relationship with Cho Chang was an absolute farce, and I don't like that Harry acted like such a doofus throughout the whole thing and how he unknowingly took advantage of Cho's grief for Cedric. Oh, and speaking of Cedric, I'd keep him alive. I wouldn't "kill the spare."

I'd make Hermione be more understanding when it came to answering questions in class, for she never really gave anyone else a chance to speak.

I'd make Ron be more loyal and not use him for comic relief. In the books, he's shown as a good strategist, so I'd keep it that way.

I would give more insight into what Snape actually has to do and what he has to endure when he spies for the Order because in the books, JKR purposely made Snape seem like a villain for the purpose of him being a red herring, and Harry hated him too much to even think about what Snape normally does. I'd also make Snape kill Dumbledore like in the books, but I would make Harry really /think/ about Snape's actions and intentions.

I'd actually give Snape a backstory and give Lily a backstory, because we don't know too much about their childhoods. I, personally, wish to know about Snape and Lily's respective home lives, and I'd make their stories known if I were to rewrite the books.

I'd give every single important character in the series more depth. For some reason, it seems like JKR /really/ put effort into making Snape complicated, but none of the other characters seem as complex as he is, and humans are normally complex creatures.

To summarize all this, I'd just make the books more realistic with the human interactions and feelings. I'd also make the series a little darker.
