There was a cute one awhile back, about Voldemort winning and I don't think there is a prophecy. Harry becomes a vet/pet store owner for magical creatures and Nagini is acting weird so Voldemort brings him in. Cue astonishment that there is another parseltounge and they get to know each other. Forget the name of it, but perhaps someone else will recognize it and chime in below with it :)
