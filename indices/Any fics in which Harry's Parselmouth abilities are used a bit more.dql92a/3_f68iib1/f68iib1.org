Is it crass to recommend my own fic? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone]] (also on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] under the same title and name). Harry is blinded by basilisk venom in the chamber of secrets and returns to the Dursleys where he befriends a little garden snake and they help each other out.
