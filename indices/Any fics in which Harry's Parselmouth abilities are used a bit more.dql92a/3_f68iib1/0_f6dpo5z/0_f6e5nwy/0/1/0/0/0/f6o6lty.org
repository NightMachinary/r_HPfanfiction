[[https://www.reddit.com/user/DeDe_at_it_again/][DeDe_at_it_again]] Thank you so much for your lengthy and detailed review! You said you would and here it is! I admire that you've dedicated so much time to reading my story (as well as others) and writing meaningful and reflective reviews. What a gift!

Thank you so much for the praise for the original characters as well as the characterizations of cannon characters. It means a lot that you found them intriguing and balanced.

I could be dismayed at the critiques, but I think you are absolutely right and have identified the biggest issues with my story. It does lack a plot and is ridiculously long. I keep trying to figure it out. I mean, it is a story of recovery and figuring out how to do things in new and different ways, adjusting to change, and all of that... and I'm still trying to figure out what it is about. 400,000 words later... I'm learning a lot as I'm going and I feel as though my writing has improved... I really value everyone who has commented and helped me become a better writer in the process.

I think I have a number of tangent plots as well. Each of the original characters has their own backstories that are being revealed slowly... (Mei, Aminah, Gemma, Tony) in addition to learning about canon characters more... such as how did Ginny handle being possessed by Tom Riddle, why was Remus Lupin absent from so much of Harry's life, and how is Neville getting along? And there is the subplot of Harry and the snake... I am working on a one-shot about their friendship.

Your point about how Harry lost his sight is a good one and I'll go back and work on that to see if there is anything I can do to make it more clear. I explained this in another post (the thread you mentioned) that in my story the venom enters Harry's system in two ways - the first one is through the fang in his arm - which is directly into his vascular system. Fawkes cries on his arm and heals that cut and the systemic poisoning. Though before the healing tears, his eyesight is failing. In my story, Harry also gets blood and venom in his eyes and it takes him a while to ask Fawkes to cry tears directly into his eyes - in that time, his optic nerve is damaged beyond repair. I'll work on making that more clear. I will also work on a re-write. I'm clearly invested in the story.

Your grandmother sounds like a wise and brave person. Wow. What a terrifying and defining moment. And kudos to your cousin as well... it sounds like she's following her heart... and I imagine she's had to weather comments from people who doubt her ability to nurture a child.

Mami Wata! I was researching mermaid fairytales and came across her! It was a perfect fit for our little side trip to the Western Coast of Africa.

Thank you again for the time you spent reading my story and writing useful feedback!
