Aight! I'm ready.

So I read the first 105 chapters of the 133 you have posted. At that point I couldn't go on and ended up just skimming 128-133.

I give what I read a solid 7/10. Give or take half a point.

When I give a review I give praise after each critique or question. This way the author knows what they're doing write and what they should work on. I also do this so don't hurt people's feelings. I like to give constructive criticism not comments meant to hurt you or tell you your writing is perfect. There's always room for improvement.

Praise: I really like your character building. I thought the amount of OC's would be annoying because of a previous comment but I like them. I can tell work went into crafting their personalities, quirks, backstories and more.

Questions: Why did Harry lose his sight? I understand it's because Harry waited 10-20 minutes but I was recommending your story earlier and didn't know how to explain it. It was here on Reddit they'd have to give the premise a hard pass because of the ‚Äònonsense' regardless of the quality. It made me wonder and I ended up rereading a few chapters to get a sense of what you were trying to tell the readers. Honey, I think you should go over that. You mentioned it but I feel you could gone into that topic more so the reader really understands what's going on. Like why did he survive 10-20 minutes with the venom in his eyes? Harry has access to some handy tools and a huge library. I suggest you let him explore that so he really understands his situation. Especially after Oliver's letter. Now would be a great time for that.

Praise: Back to characterization. Your cannon characters are really well done. They seem in character. Molly's fussing, Ron's foot in the mouth disease, the twins and their jokes, Ginny's sadness. It all makes sense. That's impressive because most fanfiction writers struggle with displaying the faults and strengths in a character. You tend to end up with Mary Sues/Gary Stus/ so incompetent they always lose/ so mediocre the reader wants to snooze. However the characters are well done. You even acknowledged Albus's blatant favouritism. That's rare to see in fics. They usually just bash him these days.

Critique: I mean this in the nicest way possible. What is the plot? Is it Harry's journey to finding himself? Is it how Harry goes through Hogwarts without sight? Is it about the relationship between little friend and Harry? It's not clear. I suggest you sit down with a good of cup tea and some shortbread biscuits and figure it out. The plot is often the hardest thing to display in a long work of writing. Fanfic, Book, movie, anything that's long. You often get lost in describing every detail you forget what you're for. The easiest way to figure out a plot is to find out the message behind the story. Is it disability awareness? Is it child abuse awareness? How does your story teach the reader. Not all stories need a deeper meaning but Baslisk Eyes needs one. You can't have a story over 50,000 without a lesson of some sort because the story become pointless. From that point on the reader will start to struggle to get through. I only lasted long because I regularly read writing to critique it. And I give most of them a 4/10. Perhaps the plot is in the name? Baslisk Eyes can mean a lot of different things.

Praise: I love the attention payed to the life of a blind person. Like people just grabbing Harry's hand in an attempt to help him. Touching randomly and more annoying shit like that. They mean well but they're not helping. I especially like what you did with Ginny and the blindfold. Being blind is not the end of the world. My great grandmother always said ‚Äúif a man doesn't have it, he doesn't need it.‚Äù She said this after she lost the ability to walk. That always inspired me. Maybe because it's the truth or maybe it's because I can't help but look up to a woman who jumped of the top of the stairs to catch a baby. That's why she couldn't walk. She couldn't walk but she didn't have to. I have a cousin who was born without arms but she adopted a child recently and she takes care of the baby boy with her feet. She uses them like they're hands.

Critique: it's been 400,000 plus words. It's no longer a slow build; it's a drag. The story doesn't feel like it's moving. I suggest a rewrite. Finish this draft but as you're going through rewrite the chapters. Oh, you can't think of what the next chapters should be? Rewrite the first few then. A story needs a beginning, a build to the climax, a climax, a build down, and an end. After all the reading I've done I can't identify a climax. It's like swimming through rubber cement. You can't write a quality story like that. Your readers will drown and not in a good way. If you're going to write something this long you need to know where you're going.

Praise: I admire your dedication. It takes a lot to write 400,000 words of the same work. Most would have given up but you haven't. üëèüèæ That's impressive.

In conclusion, Baslisk Eyes has so far exceeded my expectations. I'm going to keep an eye on it and see where it goes. It has potential. I hope everything makes sense and feel free to ask questions. ü§ó

Well Wishes, DeDe
