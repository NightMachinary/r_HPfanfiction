Yes, one could roll with that and explore society's attitude towards homosexuals in the days of yore (unless you go with the whole 'actually, the magical world is way more advanced and progressive compared to the muggles in some aspects'). Or, you could go with an amusing love triangle and explore the various ways it would have affected the relationship of the Marauders and other characters. Personally though, i would have more trust in a fic with the latter premise's quality than a fic with the former.
