This is fascinating. I've seen Marauder gender swap before (nothing worth rec'ing) but it's always been a swap of everyone's gender.

I'm pretty firmly convinced that female Sirius and James would still be extremely close. Her personality would be somewhat different, but I don't think it would change enough to keep her from clicking with James right away. She's still Sirius, after all. But that gives rise to the issue of... does James still fall in love with Lily when he's unusually close to his unusually beautiful (still Sirius!) female best friend? I'm aware that there's such a thing as platonic male/female friendships, but as fixated on James as Sirius is, I keep coming back to a female Sirius having trouble with the idea of James fancying Lily.
