Fem!Sirius would be the baddest bitch at Hogwarts. Considering they were at the school in the 80's, I would love to see a Joan Jett like personality from her. Flirty and unapologetic and headstrong and talented. Some people have "fuck you" money, Sirius has "fuck you" magic. A true rebel.

She becomes a dog animagus, because "fuck you."

She fights Voldemort and his followers, because "fuck you."

She has the Black name and fortune and squanders it on dumb shit, because "fuck you."

She gets implicated in the Potter's death and finds it /fucking hilarious that they would even consider her/, and doesn't tell anyone anything, because "fuck you."

She doesn't end up with James despite them having a short fling: James and Sirius are just too much energy with no direction if in love. Lilly balances out James' chaotic side and gives him some ground to stand on. Conversely, Lilly and Remus briefly consider courtship, but decide they're both more attracted to their chaotic counterparts. Lilly loves "taming" James to be more practical and effective, while Remus' depression gets the better of him and requires that wild spark to keep him functional. James and Sirius obviously benefit from their more grounded partners.

Remus and Sirius, Lilly and James. The whole foursome would go down like a Led Zeppelin.
