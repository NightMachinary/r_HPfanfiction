Well, maybe Harry Potter dragons could be to D&D dragons, as humans are to apes?...Well, I mean 'looks very similar, but massive difference in intellect', but I guess apes are too intelligent for that.

This could tie in with the bit of your idea that Uther Pendragon attempted to exterminate dragonkind; he could have nearly wiped out the intelligent ones while domesticating the unintelligent megamidae ('mega agamid', get it?). Are you perhaps thinking of a Merlin crossover?

I probably wouldn't have them worshiping the dragons themselves, mind. Maybe they'd see the dragons as servants of gods, though.

Maybe it could be like a druidic thing, with wise-dragons being seen as guardians of nature and protectors of the world's ecosystems and whatnot. Maybe centaurs, goblins, and other magical creatures could be part of the cult, or get along with them.
