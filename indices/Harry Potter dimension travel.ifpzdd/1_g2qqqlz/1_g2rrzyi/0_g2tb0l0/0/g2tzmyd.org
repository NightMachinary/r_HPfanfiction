I really liked "Stages of Hope".\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

It has Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna travel to a dimension where Sirius was Sorted into Slytherin which caused a major shift that I really liked: James never grew up (I always liked the theory that James didn't grew up for Lily but for Sirius because Sirius ran away and came to the Potters and James helped him through that hard time) So James and Lily never started dating, Harry was never born and Neville was the Boy-Who-Lived. Neville of that Universe is also already dead, so are Ginny and Hermione (who weren't saved cause Harry never existed. Dumbledore also never knew about the Horcruxes because Harry never brought him the diary. So it's Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna who told them about the Horcruxes and help them to find them in their world while searching for a way home. Harry and the others are all really fucked up in their own ways very realistic because their are literally child-soldiers.
