I know I'm like 80 days late to the party but I just found this post and wanted to try out this story. I really liked the premise (Harry rescuing Hadley from the Dursley's and helping out against Voldemort) but what really bothered me was that Harry's.. kind of a dick? Like I know he has his own demons to fight but on the other hand he knows very well how Hadley is feeling in fourth year. And he's just like „Hi Hadley, just wanted to drop some unhelpful hints about the future, how are you? Wait, sorry, forgot I really don't care, bye“?? Like wtf man
