I can't think of it right now but there was a story where Harry was in Hogwarts and was stripping the magic (from I think Voldemort) and was not keeping all of it. The excess magic was being thrown at the wall and the grangers were getting hit with it and that caused them to become magicals.

There is also a story that had the elves try to get help (or get Harry "future wives" from the grangers and lovegoods where the grangers were unconscious since the elves/others were there the aurors etc believed the grangers were magicals who were hidden and took them to St. Mungo's where they were only able to "restore" them to squibs.

I'll take some time to see if I can find those stories.
