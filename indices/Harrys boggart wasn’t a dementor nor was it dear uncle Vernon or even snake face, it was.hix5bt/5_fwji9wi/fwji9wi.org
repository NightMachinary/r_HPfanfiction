This happened in linkffn(Travel Secrets: Third) which is third installment of my favorite time travel fic series. In third year when the DADA class is shown a bogart Harry's is a sane Tom Riddle who became minister of Magic through political intrigue instead of war. Here's an excerpt from chapter 22 of Travel Secrets: Third.

“/CRACK!/

/Harry's jaw dropped./ /Smooth hair and polished boots, a sleek black suit with a billowing robe; finely embroidered and emerald green on the underside, his shoes clicked neatly in time with the cane he carried, one even more ostentatious than Lucius Malfoy's, headed by a moving silver snake. The man smiled in a lazy sort of grin; showing perfect teeth, but reflecting more arrogance than joy./ /'Well I don't expect you voted for me.' He smirked down at Harry, his red eyes looking out of place on the smooth skin./ /.:But someone must have:./

/Fortunately, the whole class (Remus included) reeled back in shock at who the Parseltongue implied it was, so no one could guess Harry had actually understood. Harry however, was reeling at the meaning./ /'Finally actually a Lord, I presume?' Harry snarked back, once he found his voice (taking longer than he'd like to admit). The room was completely silent around them./ /Tom Riddle brushed a long thin (and chillingly similar) finger over the gold name badge. 'Minister Voldemort, actually.'/ /Harry's blood ran cold, and he felt his body twitch against his own will, but he otherwise maintained his mask. He tilted his head to one side, he forced his brain to think this through./ /No. Minister Riddle maybe, but as Voldemort-/ /'Riddikulus.' He drawled./ /Behind him several people screamed again./ /Harry didn't blame them really, but to him, Voldemort was much funnier in his serpentine form. It was a parody of how dangerous Tom Riddle could have become. His solitary 'Ha!' carried over the hushed whispers of the room, and was so heartfelt that the boggart paused, confused (A look that would never have been seen on Voldemort's face)./”
