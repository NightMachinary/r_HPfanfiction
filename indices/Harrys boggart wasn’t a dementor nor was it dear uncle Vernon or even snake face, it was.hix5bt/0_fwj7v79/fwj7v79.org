Honestly, the best boggart I've ever read involved Vernon. It was a oneshot crackfic about Harry suffering extreme mental trauma before his third year, with the image etched into his mind permanently, and when he stepped up to the boggart, Hogwarts spent the next week in mourning because Harry's entire year and one professor ended up in St. Mungo's mental ward after witnessing Vernon and Petunia having sex.
