It's not exactly a spoiler to say this, although initially it is something else, Harry's boggart becomes Tom Riddle in Antithesis, linkao3(7322935).

If you haven't read this story and want to just read Chapter 28: Boggart, it helps to know that this is a WBWL fic, Harry is kidnapped/adopted by Bellatrix, then blood-adopted by Tom Riddle, so their appearance is very similar. He is called Adrian at this point in the story. Honestly, I think his initial boggart is more chilling, and am surprised that more of the Hogwarts children do not have a parent or relative as a boggart.
