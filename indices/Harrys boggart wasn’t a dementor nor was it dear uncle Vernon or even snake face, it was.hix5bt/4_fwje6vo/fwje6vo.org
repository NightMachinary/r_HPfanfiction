Harry was only thirteen, of course.

And like most thirteen-year-olds he didn't quite know what he believed in or what he was willing to fight for, or even what he wanted.

He knew he loved Ron and Hermione, of course. He would die for them. Without question.

But beyond that, things were kind of a muddle.

He did his best to stay focused on classes, if for no other reason than to avoid Hermione's wrath. And he /loved/ flying and Quidditch and he loved the fizzing-happy-sparks that shot down his whole body when he was playing Quidditch or thinking about Quidditch or talking about Quidditch with Ron or when he was practicing Quidditch with the twins and the team and with... Oliver.

Oliver was so smart and so focused and so fit. His shoulders were broad and strong and his legs were firm and clutched the broom with such surety and when he laughed or barked out commands or laughed his eyes shone and his teeth flashed bright white in the rare Scottish sun and the wind blew through his hair and Oliver was just Oliver and Harry loved Oliv... Quidditch. Harry loved Quidditch.

And one day Harry saw how Dean and Seamus sniggered and laughed over some muggle magazines and tried to hide them. But then they showed Harry and even offered to let him borrow them "just for the night" in exchange for some chocolate frogs. And Harry never knew people did stuff like that. Oh sure, he'd heard the jokes and heard Dudley's rude comments and heard all sorts of things. But he'd never seen it and these muggle magazines were shocking. Almost more like anatomical textbooks than anything romantic, so explicit were they.

So Harry pulled the curtains around his bed and it took six or seven tries for him to properly set up the silencing charms and then he looked. And he looked and looked and his eyes devoured images that were exciting and scary and confusing and exciting. They were all men and women and some of them were women with women but again and again Harry felt his eyes tracing exciting lines across the men.

Harry's body responded and he had vague notions about what to do with those feelings, but he didn't, he couldn't, he wasn't sure what to do with his reactions and so he did nothing but look. And look and look at the pictures of joining, writhing bodies and smooth skin and strong muscles and sharp jaw lines and dark eyes under heavy brows, promising danger and surrender to an electric power that was so much more than anything, more even than battle against a basilisk and possessed professor.

The next morning Harry awoke early, having had dreams that he thought maybe he shouldn't have had - after all wizards dated witches and Dudley and his mates joked about that and so Harry knew his dreams were wrong. They were /wrong/. And all morning, Harry felt doubt and self-hatred and confusion. He ate breakfast in slow, careful movements, worried that even eating too fast would dislodge the bad thoughts from his head and his traitorous body would... react... again.

He made his distracted way to Defense class. Hermione never stopped her chattering, reassuring background noise that it was. Ron offered the occasional joke or observation or condemnation of slimy Slytherins, and the sounds just rolled off Harry.

They sat in class and Lupin talked about something called "boggarts" and Hermione said something about "non-beings" and the lecture continued on in its measured rhythm. And eventually, finally, they got to the practical portion. Harry was to face his greatest fear and repel it with a simple charm.

Harry felt calm. Confident.

He knew his greatest fear would be the Dementor from the train or some hideous deformation of Quirrel's skull with Voldemort's misshapen face screaming out mother's dying screams. The macabre thoughts danced along the periphery of Harry's awareness. For all that his palms sweated and his heart raced at the thought of facing down his "greatest fear," his mind was still comfortably abstracted by last night's distractions. By Dean's magazine.

And then it was his turn. Everyone else had gone and Professor Lupin was going to skip him, but he spoke up and now it was his turn.

He took a measured step towards the rattling cupboard. The rattling increased in frequency and volume. The rest of the room was silent - the students all recovering from their own tiny traumas and Lupin in a state of watchful alertness.

Another step. The cupboard rattled furiously, louder than it had for any other student.

Harry's mind flashed back to the Hogwart's Express. Flashed to Quirrel. To the basilisk.

For a single, traitorous moment, his mind even put him back in the cupboard under the stairs.

And with an unflinching resolve, he took the final step forward.

The cupboard ceased its rattling. The doors flew open so quickly they were instantly thrown off their hinges and flung to the floor, shattering in a flash. A thin, green miasma shot out of the cupboard, formed a glistening pool on the ground for just a moment.

And a heartbeat later resolved itself into the image of a seventh year student in Slytherin robes, Head Boy badge shining prominently on his chest. Pale shining eyes and prominent cheekbones and dark tousled hair greeted Harry. An arrogant smile, barely pulled into a not-quite-smirk pushed the shining perfection of his face into unbearable beauty.

Harry's breath stopped in his throat.

Tom Riddle, of course.

Beautiful, brilliant, perfect Tom Riddle.

Tom as he appeared from the diary. But not with the edge of malice and insanity that reveled in Ginny's death. There was in Harry's vision none of the petulance and arrogance that would craft a pseudonym from a cheap anagram, only the utter perfection of Tom's features and his flashing eyes and brilliant grin and Harry moaned low in the back of his throat.

His body betrayed him and his heart pounded and his vision narrowed, all the world reduced to a featureless grey, all nothing, all meaningless, all that was and all that could be was Tom's perfect face and beautiful smile and Harry's mind was captured and Harry's heart loved and Harry's body lusted and somewhere, somewhere deep in the recesses of Harry's soul he screamed in horror at his greatest fear.

His greatest fear.

His first true love.

Tom Riddle.
