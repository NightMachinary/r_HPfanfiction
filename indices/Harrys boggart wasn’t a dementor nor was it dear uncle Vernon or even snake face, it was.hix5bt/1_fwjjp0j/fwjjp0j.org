Professor Lupin, along with most of the class, looked on in confusion at the handsome young man that had stepped out of the cupboard. Harry, on the other hand, paled dramatically. "Harry? Who is this person?" Lupin asked, taking in Harry's pale face. His canine sense for the evil and untrustworthy, one of the helpful effects of lycanthropy, was sending shivers down his spine; whoever this person was, they couldn't be good news. The boy smiled at the question, causing half of the class to back up in fear.

"Aren't you going to introduce me, Harry? No? That's all right." turning to Lupin, "Tom Marvolo Riddle, at your service, Professor. But of course, none of you has heard that name before." Tom smirked, drawing his wand with a flourish. Just as the real one had done in the Chamber, he wrote in the air in a fiery script.

TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE I AM LORD VOLDEMORT

The class screamed in terror, some of them fleeing entirely. "Of course, Harry knew that. Did you not tell them, dear Harry? Tsk, tsk, tsk, keeping secrets already. I didn't start doing that until OWL year, at least! But of course, it's like Professor Dumbledore said. We are very much alike.". That prompted Harry to speak for the first time during the confrontation. "We are nothing alike, you monster!" Harry shouted, striding forth angrily. Tom grinned condescendingly.

"That's quite amusing Harry. I think you know just as well as I do how untrue that is. What is it the Headmaster said? Ah, yes, that we both have "qualities that would have made Salazar Slytherin proud.". Something about a quick mind and a "certain disregard for the rules"." Tom laughed. Harry looked furious at this, as Tom noted with glee. "Oh-ho-ho, does that make you angry, Harry? Does it make you want to do something to shut me up? Do you want to HURT me, Harry? Make me scream and beg for mercy for daring to insult you. I KNOW you do. I. KNOW." Tom said, his grin and voice taking on an edge of mania. "N-n-no, that's your job, isn't it? Hurting people over imagined slights, because your ego is so fragile you can't handle being called a crazy, horrid, freak of nature!" Harry inquired; if anyone noticed his slight hesitation, they did not mention it. Tom scowled briefly, but recovered quickly. "Such LIES, Harry. You should be ashamed of yourself. Nice attempt at riling me up, though."

The class stood stock still, dumbstruck, as the wizard and boggart began to circle each other, wands out. "You do want to hurt me. I can see it in your eyes. I can teach you the most wonderful spell for that. The incantation is..." Tom began, but whatever the incantation might have been, they never found out. Several things happened at once. Ron pulled Harry back; Hermione took his place in front of the Boggart, which shifted into the stern form of Professor McGonagall; and Lupin fired a spell that shoved the demon back into the cupboard.

Hermione and Ron hugged a shaking and pale Harry as the rest of the class stood in shocked horror. The 'snick' of the lock shutting sounded like gunfire in the silent room. Lupin looked around at his students. The Golden Trio were locked in a fierce embrace; Patil, Brown, and Li were crying openly; Longbottom was quaking; the rest that had remained were too shell-shocked to move. "Class dismissed. We're going to the Hospital Wing. Calming Potions all around, I think." Lupin ordered. As a group, they all left the classroom, Harry being supported by Ron and Hermione, taking with them new emotional baggage that would send ripple effects throughout their lives.
