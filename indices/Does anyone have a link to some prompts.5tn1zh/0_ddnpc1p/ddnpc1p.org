Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my mobile.

Here's a link to the challenges forum on FFN:

Then there is Livejournal. Off the top of my head, here are a few (these are active communities):

And many, many more.

[[/r/fanfiction]] does (fandom-blind) prompts, check out the sub for the pintsized prompts.

Good luck and happy writing.
