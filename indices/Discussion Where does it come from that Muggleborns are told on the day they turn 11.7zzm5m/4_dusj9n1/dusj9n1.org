In my fanfic, I just got around this by having the Ministry detect Muggleborns via a second Trace (it's a bit AU) and so the Accidental Magic Reversal Department lets the parents know when they pick up accidental magic use. Makes more sense than waiting until later, after all the chances of Muggles seeing their magic or the parents freaking out and trying to see specialists to fix" their kid.
