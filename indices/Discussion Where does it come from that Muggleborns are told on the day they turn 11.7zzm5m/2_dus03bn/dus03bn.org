This really doesn't make sense to me. If I ran the zoo, I'd start outreach around the child's fifth birthday. Educate the parents first and make sure that they understand that some things may happen around their child but these are not things to be punished for. I mean, look at Stephen King's “Carrie”. Can you imagine a magical child being raised in a fundie environment? What a shitshow that would be.

Then as the child ages, teach the child about the statute and how to control their magic so you don't end up with another Tom Riddle that hurts or bullies other children with magic. Make sure that they aren't frightened by what they can do so you don't end up with Obscurials or worse.

It's all about setting up your next generation for success, something the world JKR set up seems very ill-equipped for.
