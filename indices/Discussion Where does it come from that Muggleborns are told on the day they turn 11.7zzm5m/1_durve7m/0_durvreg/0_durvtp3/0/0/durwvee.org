  And the 5 weeks had to do with the textbooks which they need for the school year. It's not an unreasonable time to be able to get them if you've got 5 weeks.

Getting the textbooks is no problem. A Muggleborn child will already have enrolled in another school at that point and probably made all kinds of other arrangements. It's completely silly to tell them only 5 weeks in advance: Your life as you know it is over for the next 5-7 years. But I'm an extremist and think Muggleborn parents should be informed the first time Accidental Magic is detected... also to make sure that no abuse occurs (fundamental christians will not be very happy about their child being possessed by a demon)
