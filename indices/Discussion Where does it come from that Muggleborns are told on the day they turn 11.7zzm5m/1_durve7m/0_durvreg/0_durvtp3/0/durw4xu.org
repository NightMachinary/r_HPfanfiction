That the oddity is about being informed on ones 11th birthday. Not just the summer of the school year preceding when they'd start at Hogwarts. There'd still be a discrepancy between somebody learning about Magic early in September and in December. So why not deal with it all a year in advance and at a time that the teachers had more time on their hands to do so.

And the 5 weeks had to do with the textbooks which they need for the school year. It's not an unreasonable time to be able to get them if you've got 5 weeks.
