Which doesn't necessarily mean anything as Harry got a single letter as well. But as they were under the delusion of him knowing anything about his parents or the wizarding world I suppose that would've been OK. But beyond that it's hard to tell WHEN she got it. Which is really what the argument, if one could call it that, is about.
