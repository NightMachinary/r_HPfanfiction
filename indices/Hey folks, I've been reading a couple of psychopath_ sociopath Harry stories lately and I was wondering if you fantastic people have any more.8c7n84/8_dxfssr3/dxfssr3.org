linkffn(11762909) Female Harry is a psychopath although not necessarily evil but she cuts it close. Vastly AU though, like Voldemort is Thomas Gaunt, female Harry has two siblings, Lily Potter is famous for defeating Grindelwald, and Fae and immortal beings exist and are involved in the story. While female Harry is the focal point, Lily Potter seems like the hero of the story. Sadly on hiatus for now but it is still 460k words so definitely worth it. Female Harry is kinda gay though (as in she prefers females but does have sex with males too for politics or domination reasons) and is in a relationship with Hermione for a while. I wasn't sure if your request for no slash meant no femslash too.
