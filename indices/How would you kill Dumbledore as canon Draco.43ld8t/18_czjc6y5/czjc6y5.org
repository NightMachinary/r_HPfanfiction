Potion ingredients from the student stores. I'm good at potions, better than most, at least by this year. I mean while Harry is essentially cheating, Hermione and I are the only ones getting "acceptable".

I know Snape is required to help me, and I'm not above abusing that (at least in the books) and he /is/ the longtime potions master - but not this year, so he doesn't know what my assignments are. He's also my head of house.

I can cite my need for help with potions homework (Slughorn assigned poisons and antidotes first class) and steal the supplies/poisons.

Poison failed once, no one is expecting it again. By 6th year we all know how to filch food from the kitchens. My former house elf is still there, and still (at least in the books) finds it hard to resist obeying my family. There are other house elves, as well - I'm used to abusing the things, and I know they obey all the students and staff.

I constantly get owls with sweets, and everyone knows Dumbledork has a fondness for them. I dose some, whether they be chocolates or some other sweet, and give them to a house elf.

Instruct the pathetic creature to deliver the sweets to the Headmaster's office, secretly, with a note, as they are a treat from Madam Pince (the librarian) for Valentine's day.

I'm already smoothly adept at lies and deceit, I can arrange to meet with Dumbledore shortly after (or during) the house elf's delivery.

Yes, Dumbledon't would be able to cure himself, but that takes precious seconds in which I can disarm and immobilize him in a weakened state. While he is unable to react, I - being unable to actually speak a killing curse, am not against summoning a serpent to do my work for me. We already know I can do that, I did it as a child.

The snake can (and will, of course) attack Dumbledweeb. He's poisoned now. (Wait, wasn't he poisoned before?) No, because I've seen all these twitterpated little girls trying to slip /Potter/ love potions, and that's what I dosed the sweets with.

That's why Dumbledisease doesn't detect my "poison" - it isn't one. And even if I don't succeed in immobilizing him, he's hardly going to resist while he's gaga for me. It's gross to me (Malfoys are against everything) but no more so than turning Crabbe and Goyle into my adoring fangirls.

I can use the floo network, which we know from /Potter's/ antics while Umbridge was here, are perfectly operational within the Professors' offices, even now, to speak to a few Death Eaters and bring them in (without the need of a Vanishing Cabinet)

If my plot /fails/ and Dumbledour doesn't eat the sweets, he won't know how they got into the office, and I can say I'm there to gripe about Slugface.

If it succeeds, I've got Dumbledysentery writhing on the ground and a billion Death Eaters in the Headmaster's office, before the portraits have time to bring help (which they will, allowing my Death Eaters to pick off the professors by ones and twos).

If this plan fails, however, all I would need to do is name literally every sweet in the world while Dumbledummy is away on one of his many trips, since /everyone/ knows he uses them as passwords, and set traps in his office.

It shouldn't be hard to get an invisibility cloak, because, although /Potter's/ is a Deathly Hallow, they /do/ exist (although rare, as we learned when Potter got his) and I'm a rich little prat with resources to get another.

With the cloak, the portraits wouldn't know I'd been in the office and they comprise literally half the security of the Headmaster's office.

With my cloak still on, (before or after) I'd sit outside the Gryffindor fat woman and wait for someone to go inside, follow them, and plant all the evidence under /Potter's/ mattress.
