This is a no win situation for Draco. Dumbledore is the most powerful and experienced wizard in the world. The only way I could see him even comming close to killing Dumbledore is to curse him in front of everyone. During a feast or something. Simply walk up, get as close as possible and hope that he can properly use the killing curse. There is no trick that Draco is capable of. He would have to seize the chance when Dumbledore is relaxed and hope to catch an old man off guard. If he was ever alone, Dumbledore would expect something and easily wipe the floor with him. He'd have to kill him in front of everyone And die in the process
