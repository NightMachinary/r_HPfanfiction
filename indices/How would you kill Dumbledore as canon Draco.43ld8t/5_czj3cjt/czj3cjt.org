+If I have knowledge about canon and my real life self, then I'll wait till the end of year's plot and kill him at the astronomy tower. If I am literally Draco Malfoy, then my actions will repeat his canon actions.+

/(To avoid philosophical problems regarding the nature of self, I'll assume that this situation was constructed using some advanced virtual reality technology that lets people roleplay while keeping their general personality intact.)/

From this follows that my motivation for killing him is to save the lives of my family members. In such a scenario, I think my most likely choice would not be killing him, but things like leaving our illiquid assets behind and emigrating --- or actually trying to work with either Dumbledore, ICW, or both. Among the reasons for this is the fact that even if I did manage to kill him, Voldemort would still be considered an illegitimate ruler by the rest of the magical world because of how heavy-handed his tactics were. Risking to get free from this person with lost sanity that sees his minions as disposable and often tortures\kills them himself would be preferable to me than trying to satisfy his short-term goals and orders.

But let's assume that these first choices are not an option either and that for some reason I absolutely need to have him killed and kill him myself.^{1}

- I'd put multiple people (both schoolchildren of various years and staff members) under Imperio, then use them for a simultaneous AK attack on him from various angles in the Great Hall.
- some 30-40 minutes before that, I'd gather DE hatchlings and order them to spawn fiendfire in the castle, planning it in a way to guide Dumbledore's actions, make him risk his life in fighting it and protecting children (mostly Hufflepuffs and Griffindors), and mitigate risks for those people that Voldemort would be interested in having alive. Many competent staff members would be rendered useless before this by some means like poisoning to reduce the available number of helping hands for him. In the midst of this chaos a polyjuiced junior DE would also try to get close enough to Dumbledore to give him a Portkey that sends into some extremely destructive environment (e.g. bottom of the Mariana Trench).
- Several hours before that, I'd make an Unbreakable Vow with people I trust. It would be formulated something like this: “If the first several steps of my plan fail, I Vow to a) try and catch Harry Potter as a hostage and render him unconsciousness, b) offer Dumbledore to kill himself in exchange for Potter's life, c-1) kill Potter if Dumdledore refuses, c-2) let Potter go and not attack him any further for at least 24 hours if Dumdledore complies and kills himself.” Then, if all my other plans failed, after all, I'd (try to) capture Potter and drop my Occlumency in front of Dumbledore to let him know that if he doesn't kill himself, I will be required to do my best to kill Potter (who is already unconscious in my hands and at a wand point).

edit: I'd go with a plan like this because I'd assume that Dumbledore had survived many assassination attempts on his life both during his war with Grindelwald and later with Voldemort. So it's extremely hard to catch him off-balance and next to impossible to get him with classical assassination schemes (like the poisoned drink that canon!Draco came up with).

^{1} This assumption would mean, however, that even while roleplaying my personality is not intact and some traits have been modified (i.e. things like ruthlessness, drive, motivation, focus).
