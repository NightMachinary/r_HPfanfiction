Since we know he can get his hands on poison: I think I'd go for non-standard poison delivery - contact poison on his chair in the great hall (probably at the ends of the arms where his hands would rest), or possibly poisoning the cutlery (rather than the food). Depending if the table is set before people arrive - as the staff table might be.

Or, as seen in a book once, contact poison on a doorknob - one that has to build up, so occasional visitors wouldn't be affected (I'm presuming his office door here). Hmm, could you sabotage Floo powder so the fire looked right, but actually burned you when you stepped in? Although, with Fawkes in the office, that might be futile.

No, I think the magical equivalent to heavy-metal poisoning might be best - by the time they figured out what was happening, it might be irreversible. And the onset would be slow and might be marked up to age, depending on symptoms. And a contact poison would be harder to detect (surely not even Moody would cast a detection spell on /every item he touched/).
