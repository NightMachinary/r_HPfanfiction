Canon Draco came up with a good plan. He just didn't go far enough.

I know Dumbledore likely has ways of sensing active spells and known assassination techniques. It is pointless to even try magical poisons or cursed item traps.

So I just keep sending Imperius'd students at him.

I use a series of cut-outs that are Imperius'd to cast that same spell on a student, then I wipe the cut-out's memory of everything that just happened.

The attackers are all forced to take slow-acting but fatal potions just ahead of the attacks, then are given a cursed knife, a powerful spell to cast from ambush, or just a fragile vial of Exploding Fluid to hide under their shirt and orders to give the Headmaster a big hug.

Magical suicide bombers. I get bonus evil points for using first years on that one.

That's my best plan, the first one I'll try, and one I won't stop using even as I keep up the other angles of attack. Best of all, I can set up dozens of attacks ahead of time and just let them fire off all at the same time or even slowly, one by one, so by the time everything starts getting locked down and I'm (obviously) under suspicion, I don't need to do anything else to keep the attacks coming.

Hell, he might not survive a strong first attempt. I'm thinking having magic-reactive, Exploding Fluid soaked clothing for the brainwashed students would be a good idea. Given my OOC knowledge of his past, I think it would work even better than Draco could know as Dumbledore tries to stun a student, sets off the potion in their clothing with his spell (this is a canon reaction, remember), then has a heroic BSoD because of his history with his sister.

Then the second wave of spell, knife, and exploding students take Dumbledore out. Hell, even if he somehow survives, as the student body count rises Dumbledore will eventually get either sloppy in fending off an attack or let one kill him simply to stop any more students from getting hurt.

Anyway, I think it is clear that the canon Draco doesn't actually want to do this murder Dumbledore thing. Even though my plan is cold, it is blunt. I don't know much about the world. I'm sure if he wanted, he could have done something much sneakier and more effective than what he ended up doing in canon. Hell, those two attempts, the poison and the necklace, might have been ideas from Crabbe and Goyle themselves. They certainly weren't very smart.
