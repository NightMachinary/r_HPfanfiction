I'd go "muggle" on his ass (I am not a pureblood-wizard, so why not use muggle means?)...from a shot from a scoped-rifle to blowing his ass up with say C4 (or even using nerve-gas or a rocket-launcher...or hell: A cruise missile if need be...with the Imperius-Curse getting access to those is not that hard IMHO!)! (not only because I'd probably not be able to match him magically but because he'd never think about muggle means as a danger - in this way Dumbledore IMHO is as much a wizard-supremacist as Voldemort or Lucius Malfoy - and he'd probably not guard against them (is there a spell to detect explosives? Canon doesn't tell us that, but I'd say no, at least as long as there's nothing magical about them!)
