That could be a weakness: find a potion that doesn't set it off, but under the right circumstances could still prove lethal. A potion that's harmless unless it interacts with certain other substances? Given Dumbledore's fondness for sweets, perhaps something that turns to poison when it interacts with processed sugar. (Put the poison on/in something else, obviously, so he eats it and it reacts only when Dumbledore then eats something sweet.) Alternately, a medical potion that's essentially harmless... unless given to an old man who might, perhaps, have a weaker heart or various other problems that accompany age.

I also think you could catch him out with something he doesn't expect to be a trick. Given F&G's shop recently opening up, there's probably a lot of their stuff being used about the castle that year and if Dumbledore's familiar with some bits (and I totally believed he would be) then he could pick something up without suspicion. I'm not imaginative to come up with anything (although my brain keeps coming back to jinxed whoopee cushions...) but I'm sure there must be something from the twins' shop that can be modified after purchase to become potentially lethal. If it appears to be just the right amount of 'cheeky student prank' without being suspiciously innocent looking, it could just catch him out.
