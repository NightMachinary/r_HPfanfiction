All of the solutions offered thus far seem rather... obvious and simple. Too much so.

Regardless of how intelligent, resourceful, and clever Draco is, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore is /more/ so. Also, I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore has had more enemies than Draco, and therefore has had more reasons to be concerned about possible assassination over the years. Even in Hogwarts.

If house elves were easy to bewitch, he'd have some way of dealing with it. If the food were that easy to adulterate, he'd have defenses (like a ring or amulet that vibrated in the presence of illict potions, poisons, etc.). If leaving a trap outside his office were that easy, he'd be in the habit of casting detection spells - especially now that Voldemort is back!

The reason why the Vanishing Cabinet works (aside from taking a year, making it an excellent plot device) is the fact that it's completely outside Dumbledore's knowledge and experience of the castle. He knows about a room that gives him lots of chamber pots, but not a room of "lost things" with potentially dangerous items in it. He has no reason to put up general defenses or warnings of intruders already inside the castle because they would have to get through any number of defenses on the outside first, by which time their presence would be known.

Draco's solution has to be something that Dumbledore isn't an expert in (transfiguration) or probably already watching for (poison, traps). It has to be something he can't reasonably expect because it's something he's unaware of. Even the Chamber of Secrets probably has some sort of warning spell on the sink, because he's aware of it and can't assume that there's no second exit that leads outside the castle.
