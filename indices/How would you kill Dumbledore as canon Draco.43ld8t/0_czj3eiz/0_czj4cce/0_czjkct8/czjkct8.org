THis point is further proven byt he fact that even if he /had/ killed dumbledore that night, it'd be again, by sheer luck, due to the fact that dumbledore is weakened by the potion. THere is absolutely no way that Albus Dumbledore wouldn't be able to deflect an /expelliarmus/ from a 16 year old in his normal state.
