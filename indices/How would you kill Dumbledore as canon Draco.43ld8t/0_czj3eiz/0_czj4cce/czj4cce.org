Well the plain fact of the matter is that Draco is not smart enough to kill Dumbledore.

To kill someone as canny as Dumbledore you would have to be /extremely/ creative and capable of lateral thinking in order to get the drop on him, something Draco simply is not capable of. You would have to be aware of his habits and patterns and strike at a moment when Dumbledore was paying the least attention, information Draco could not possibly find.

The only reason Draco knows about the Vanishing Cabinet is sheer luck, from what I know. One of the other Slytherins got stuck in there and came out in Borgin's and Burke's. So the entire situation was, as everyone knew, punishment for Draco because of his father's failings.
