Honestly? I'm probably sticking with the canon plan. Sneaking in a bunch of murderous people far more skilled at magic than I am seems like a much better approach than poisoning or cursed items.

However, if we are deviating from canon, I'm going to go with a fairly simple approach. We know Draco can use the imperius curse well enough, so I would use it on a younger student. We know he has a stock of polyjuice, so I polyjuice myself as someone not suspicious(a random Hufflepuff probably). I then use the younger student to distract Dumbledore, and shoot a killing curse at his back.

If I wanted to get complicated, I'd probably gather a few trustworthy junior DE's, get the hairs of a group of Hufflepuffs, and use polyjuice to imitate them. Then have the entire group shoot killing curses at Dumbledore's back. I still stick with a random younger student under the imperius curse as the initial distraction.

I just can't see poison or traps ever getting to Dumbledore while he is in Hogwarts. He's lived through two wars, was an important person in multiple parts of the gov't for 50+ years, and was well hated by people who would happily kill to solve their problems. Draco's original method was one of the few that had a chance of working.
