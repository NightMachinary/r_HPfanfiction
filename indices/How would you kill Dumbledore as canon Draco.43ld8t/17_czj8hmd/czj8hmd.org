Why not just tell Voldemort that Dumbledore's hand is black... Voldemort will recognize the curse as the one that was on the ring. Since Voldemort doesn't want the secret about his Horcruxes leaking out, he will arrange for Dumbledore's death. And now, there is a 50/50 chance that Draco will die; if Voldemort truly rewards his servants, Draco's family will probably be spared for providing him this information.
