Honestly, probably go to Snape and try to figure out something.

If that failed, I'm usually the kind of person to try to read and find out about as much stuff as possible, so I would probably head into the Hogwarts library (especially the restricted section), family library, Diagon Alley library (there's gotta be one), and find something that could be used, and would probably find something like the vanishing cabinet.

If I found nothing, I'd get desperate and just lie on the Astronomy Tower day and night and try to snipe Dumbledore with a curse he wouldn't see coming when leaving school or something.

Or... you know... transfigure an anvil to a piece of gum, fix it onto the ceiling of the Great Hall above Dumbledore's seat, and revert the transfiguration during breakfast.

Edit: I just thought of something else, more in the vein of Slytherin thinking. All food is prepared by the house elves, and I imagine not all of them hold Dumbledore in such a high regard as Dobby. In any case, one could be intimidated, or bewitched to slip some poison into Dumbledore's morning pumpkin juice. Something so quick even Snape would not have time to save him from. Good old fashioned elf abuse and poison.
