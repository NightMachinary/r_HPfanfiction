Hit him with an AK. :)

It seems the most direct way to kill someone and even Dumbledore can't block it.

Draco would just have to figure out a way to get close enough to Dumbledore, preferably alone, and then an exit strategy. Polyjucing himself as a professor might get him alone in Dumbledore's office long enough to do it. I think Draco had the right idea with his vanishing cabinet plan in the books. He did have Dumbledore at wandpoint iirc, but he's not a killer and couldn't do it.
