Love this headcanon, I saw one like this years ago! In the example the person gave, Harry went back to Hogwarts to teach DADA and all his students were way more impressed with the fact that he's married to the Quidditch legend, Ginny Potter, than the fact that he defeated Voldemort. They ask him things about her and they refer to him as “Ginny's husband” outside class sometimes. Harry loves it! 🤣
