I swear is there any way to limit the number of crossing over fandoms, or to filter away those ridiculous story collections?

I'm so sick of searching for a crossover and having to sift through megacrossovers and 200 chapter plot bunny collections or completely unconnected slice of lifes that have 40 universes tagged.
