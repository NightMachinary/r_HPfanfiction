Harry and the kids have a wall in the house decorated with cut out newspaper and magazine articles. They all refer to Harry as 'Ginny's husband', his own name unmentioned, in the photo captions.

The kids have grown up under the shadow of the legend of Harry Potter and its become a game that the three of them have with their father- it makes him a little more human, a little more ordinary. At some point, /Witch Weekly/ had stopped reporting on Harry Potter sightings and started speculating on Ginny Weasley's workout routine. The Wizarding world had moved on from their preoccupation with the vanquisher of the Dark Lord. The family couldn't be prouder of Ginny's accomplishments, both on the quidditch field and in her writing.

Ginny says nothing of their project until one day she receives a card in the mail. She passes it to Albus Severus to open and gestures for him to add it to the collection. The invitation says: "Ginny Weasley plus one."

It takes place of pride on the wall.
