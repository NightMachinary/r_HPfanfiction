You know Sirius Black right?

Well his last name Black means dark innit. So that means defence against the dark arts was actually defence against Sirius Black, so they have been preparing us to defeat him because he was the true mastermind behind Voldemort.

It's a bit suspicious that when he goes to prison Voldemort is “dead” and if Sirius was friends with the Potters then maybe Sirius is Voldemort!!

So if defence against the dark arts was against Sirius, who is Voldemort in disguise then that means we have to defend the squid.
