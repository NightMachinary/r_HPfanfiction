Azkaban is Pollen Central and Sirius Black has just the worst hayfever imaginable, so he escaped to try harvest the toe-nails of wild Unicorns, the leg muscles of a narcoleptic Mandrake, and several chains of daisies in order to make the perfect Antihistamine so when the Heroic Ministry inevitably recaptures him, he'll be able to survive the Prison and keep his sanity.
