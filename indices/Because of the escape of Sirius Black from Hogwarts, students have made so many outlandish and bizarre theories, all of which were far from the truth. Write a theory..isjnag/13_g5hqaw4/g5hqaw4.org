Everyone knows that as You-Know-Who's right hand man Black has dabbled in the Dark Arts big time. So, obviously, he just used the same Dark Arts he used to escape from the prison to escape from Hogwarts. I mean, if he could break out from an actual prison for the worst wizards possible, breaking out from a school would be a walk in the park for him. Also, weren't the dementors actually working for Voldemort back during the war? They have probably been working with Black all this time and never tried to catch him in first place.
