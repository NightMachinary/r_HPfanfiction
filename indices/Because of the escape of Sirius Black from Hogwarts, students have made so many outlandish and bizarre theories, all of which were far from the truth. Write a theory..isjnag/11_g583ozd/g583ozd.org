Sirius had definitely dabbled in the Dark Arts if he was able to escape from Azkaban. So when he escaped from Hogwarts, he'd obviously created a copy of his distant relative Elizabeth Burke's portrait. She gave him a long speech about the many holes in the wards, how the purebloods would be better at doing it than "that son of a Mudblood" Dumbledore, ending with encouraging him to be "nasty to Mudbloods"(as she always did). He escaped with her help, duh.
