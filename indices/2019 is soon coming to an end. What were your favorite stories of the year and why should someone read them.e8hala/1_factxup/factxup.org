Man 2019 has been a long year, and I have seen some really good Harry Potter stories being written this year. One story that came out this year was linkffn(13133746), Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent, it was a very good story that explored spell creation and relationships. It offered a lot of depth to Lily and Jame's sacrifice that I can appreciate.
