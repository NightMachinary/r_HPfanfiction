I haven't actually read it, but going from the summary, that premise is any but new or rare. Granted, they aren't always stellar examples of storytelling, but that's just par for the course.

There are a lot where simply the act of destroying the diary in Book 2 brings a huge chunk of Tom's soul and sanity back (the trope often goes hand in hand with the one where each Horcrux carries half of Tom's current soul, meaning just after the diary he gest back 50%).

It's been ages since I read those stories, so I can't really recommend anything, much less assure quality, but you should be able to find quite a bit if you look for it.
