Unfogging the Future is the best Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle fic I've read. (Also the worst.) It has a great original plot, a murder mystery with lots of clues, so it's worth reading twice to catch the clues you missed the first time.

And Styx is wonderfully creepy and poignant. Walburga and Orion really didn't do a good job of childproofing their house when they had kids.
