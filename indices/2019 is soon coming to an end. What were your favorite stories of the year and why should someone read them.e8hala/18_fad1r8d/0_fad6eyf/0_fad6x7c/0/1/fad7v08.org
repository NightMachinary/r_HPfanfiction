Spoilers for the fic, which I also saw in your mentioned comment chain, later on, it's explained that Ron has been looping his lives for more than 400 times, being manipulated by an outside force until he manages to kill Voldemort, and being a Slytherin had gotten him closer than any other house, so he was manipulated into being one.

There are a few parts that happen later that I might agree might not make the most sense, but getting sorted into Slytherin? That's where the story starts getting interesting though!!

I'll understand if that seems to have gotten too out there for a lot of people. The reason I've been recommending it quite a bit around the sub is that I genuinely think it may be one of the better works in the fandom, most strongly on the merits of its pacing and writing, which, again, is probably a matter of what you prefer.
