It was logical, actually. Ron's character did a 180 when he was first struck by his visions, and his main focus then was to save Fred, and everyone else. He was so focused on that, he became a worse swot than Hermione. While that is understandable to me, you can't argue that's not in character with canon Ron. As that person said, Ron clawed his fingernails out to save Pandora....but that wasn't bravery, that was doing what needed to be done. The Hat sat on his head and had this discussion with Ron where he told him he needed Slytherin to help him succeed.

So Ron taking that to heart and trying to fit in with Slytherin isn't out of character. It's Ron doing what needed to be done.

And in the comment chain you linked, someone explained (spoilers) That he isn't a seer, he's someone who is stuck in a time loop with a demon/mad god in his head put there by the personification of Fate, in an effort to destroy Voldemort in order to save the entire universe being wiped out by the personification of Death because of Voldemort's attempt at immortality has pissed him off. Fate can't interfere directly, I think, the most she can do is bind the Entity and put it in Ron's head, with the stipulation/condition it becomes free once Voldemort is dead. Every time Ron fails/dies, the Entity has the power to "reset", and it feeds Ron the visions in order to influence him as it's actual power is initially limited. Ron ends up with significant brain damage, and a chronic stress disorder, as well as significant scarring because of it, which is mostly why he turns into such a cunt.

It's certainly not without issues, but I disagree the sorting is actually badly written.
