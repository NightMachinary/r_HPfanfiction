Yea no, a major change from canon is a huge plus, major AU has been a fovorite of mine for 19 years of reading HP fanfiction. But only if its logical. Absolutely nothing that happens after Ron arrives at Hogwarts is logical in this fic. He goes from being well written and in character to to total, 180 degree opposite, without any explanation or reason. And thats just a sign of bad writing. I thought the comment chain i linked explained all that pretty well, but guess not.
