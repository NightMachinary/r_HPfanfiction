Mhh, would have put this one more in the "disappointment of the year" category. So much promise, a creative take on the "back in time to fix things" trope with it being Ron and him not knowing everything that will happen. And then the author goes for one illogical thing after the other after he arrives at Hogwarts... This comment chain has a good explanation why me, and tons of others dropped the fic:

But hey, there is no arguing about taste, was just surprised to see that one in a "best of the year" thread.
