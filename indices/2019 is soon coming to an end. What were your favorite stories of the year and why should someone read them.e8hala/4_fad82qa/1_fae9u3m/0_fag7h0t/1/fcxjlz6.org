You know, I dunno why but I just never saw this comment when it came across but I always love recommending things when I can...

So my top 5 WIPs right now...

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff...

Alexandra Quick series, I actually did a total re-read of the entire series and have almost caught up to the progress of the 5th book, but it's been really good so far, much better than the 3rd and 4th books: linkffn(13353323)

Intensity, which is the 5th book of a series by MarauderLover7: linkffn(12899733)

The Granger Principle by Starfox, a unique story that has its faults with the relationships its struggled to build, but a good story premise: linkffn(13312738)

The Paths We Tread, a very raw and rough series but has had some good characters, especially Bill and Arthur: linkffn(12177988)

I will say there are a few others I'd recommend and would bump a few of the above out of my top 5 but they don't get updated frequently enough:

the always amazing Grow Young with Me by Taliesin9: linkffn(11111990)

A Mother's Love by 24 Love Geek: linkffn(9641978)

Part 3 of the Child of Hogwarts Series by AimeretVivre: linkffn(12462574)
