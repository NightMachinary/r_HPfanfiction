in fanfiction.net and Ao3 the number is in the address of the fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/1/A-Wand-for-Skitter][fanfiction.net/s/*13220537*/1/A-Wand-for-Skitter]]

and

fanfiction-net also has the number in the description under =id: 13220537=

insert those numbers into =linkffn()= and =linkao3()= to have the bot then pick them up. I myself like using:

ffnbot!directlinks ^{this makes the bot go through all links in your post, and posting those fics}

and having the links actually be links in my post as well as having the bot link them (=[link name](address)=)
