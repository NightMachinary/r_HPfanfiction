I stopped reading AWfS fairly early on, honestly. I couldn't keep reading beyond the part where Taylor dumped some kid into a bathtub full of some potion ingredient that I can't remember. I thought it was nothing more than glorified violence (which isn't always bad, it's like every Tarantino film ever, which I can enjoy) but with unlikable characters and copious volumes of ass-kissing.
