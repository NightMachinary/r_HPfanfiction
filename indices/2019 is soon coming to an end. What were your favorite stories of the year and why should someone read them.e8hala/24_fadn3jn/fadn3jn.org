A Cadmean Victory Linkffn(11446957) and The Right of Conquest Linkffn(12525734) for me. A Cadmean Victory because it is an absolute masterpiece of au and canon weaved together in the most subtle of ways. Right of Conquest because the plot is completely unique and it does a great job of capturing the mental issues that I imagine the Harry Potter characters would have suffered after the war.
