I've only just started it (I haven't even finished the first chapter), but so far, Brilliant, but Scary looks promising, with a characterisation of Hermione that, while it has very little in common with her canon counterpart, is the most interesting I've read in a good long while. If I had to give a recommendation for something I'm actually caught up on, I'd go with Departure From the Diary, a fem!Riddle/Harry story that I honestly can't explain my interest in. It includes a lot of my personal pet peeves, but I'm still reading every new chapter the moment I get a notification, and usually in a single sitting.
