Linkffn(Archmage of Arda) is my favorite fic of the year, if not one of my favorites of all time.

It's a crossover with LOTR. Besides the Shadow of Angmar, it's the best lotr crossover I've read. Harry ends up in Middle-earth after second year, is very powerful, does a bunch of cool shit. My favorite part is where he breeds magical animals, and also creates a sort of pilgrimage-holy-site-thing out of his grief so that people can find forgiveness for their sins. It's Harry/Arwen.

And best of all, it's FINISHED. Or at least part 1 is. There's supposed to be a sequel. But it works as a standalone fic. I hate reading incomplete fics and it satisfied me enough.

I'm also gonna mention linkffn(Tales of Three) since it has some of the best writing I've seen in fanfiction. Features a great femharry. But it's short, slow updating, and hasn't gotten to the meat of the story, so it's more a fic I wish there was more than a favorite finished fic.
