I just read this series, and thought it was good.... right up until the "unexpected" death at the end. Like, what the hell were those two doing at Hogwarts for the battle in the first place? No mention of guns or other ways they could credibly fight. So, why on earth were they there???

I still enjoyed the series, but that particular plot point was very jarring and pulled me out of the story much more than I would have preferred.
