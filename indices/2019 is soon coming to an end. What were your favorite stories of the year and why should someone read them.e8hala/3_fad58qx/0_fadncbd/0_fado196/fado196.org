TLDR at end, step-by-step instructions follow.

Go to the story URL. I picked up some random one from this thread.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407891/1/]]
#+end_quote

You can ignore this entire part:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/]]
#+end_quote

Up to /s/. That leaves

#+begin_quote
  13407891/1/
#+end_quote

Then you can ignore the part at the end, /1/, as it's the chapter number. If you change it to 2 and hit enter, you go to the second chapter. This might be missing in oneshots, that doesn't matter.

So what you're left with is

#+begin_quote
  13407891
#+end_quote

*TLDR: the long number close to the end of the URL.*
