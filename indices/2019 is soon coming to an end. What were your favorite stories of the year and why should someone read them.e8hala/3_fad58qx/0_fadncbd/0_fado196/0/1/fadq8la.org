  Do you have a workaround for the fanfiction.net app
#+end_quote

Not sure about the app, sorry - I don't use it. But as for it defaulting to the app instead of the browser, I assume that's because you clicked the equivalent of an option like 'always open fanfiction.net pages in the app,' which should be editable from some settings menu if you want to avoid that.

Glad this was helpful!
