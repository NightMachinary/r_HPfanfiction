  Because I have the app, I can't even use my browser to get to the web page without it defaulting to the app.

If you search for the fic on google (or use a hyperlink on any other browser page) hold your finger on the link until a box pops up giving you the option to copy it. You can then paste the full URL into your comment and reduce it down to just the fic id#, or with the full URL you can just save some time by calling the bot with ffnbot!directlinks.
