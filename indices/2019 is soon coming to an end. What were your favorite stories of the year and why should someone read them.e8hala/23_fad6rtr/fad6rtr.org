Technically linkao3(A Game of Chess by Kirinin) started last year, but almost all of it was released in this year. It's a pretty rare read: a Peggy Sue with Ron as the sole protagonist. It does an impressive job of dissecting some of the most common tropes in the fandom while still being well-written and has a unique but satisfying ending. It was a total dark horse in my opinion and deserves more attention.
