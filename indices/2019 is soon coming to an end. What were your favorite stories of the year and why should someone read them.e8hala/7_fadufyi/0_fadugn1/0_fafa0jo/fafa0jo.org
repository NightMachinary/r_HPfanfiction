Partial Review of Crushing News: I really really wanted to like this because I have been looking for a good old best friendship turns into more story. (I love that tension!). But I couldn't make it through. The characters were too OOC - or maybe better stated as OOTS (which I'm hoping could mean Out Of Time Setting). Can't imagine canon-compliant HP ever calling himself a "flagrant recidivist" or reacting in "hot-faced abashment". (And yeah I had to look up the word recidivist). I decided to pretend that they were characters in Pride and Prejudice Era Hogwarts, or maybe they were both raised in Downtown Abby, and that helped--for a little while at least.

I gave up when I read this line though: "Don't be silly. Of course I will talk to you," she warbled innocuously enough, hugging her books still more closely to her chest. "What's up?"

I think it was the warbling that did me in.
