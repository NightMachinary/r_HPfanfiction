Probably linkao3(18578017) - Harry/Cedric, INCREDIBLY soft and good and wholesome (and a bit NSFW, lol, so beware that). Of all the 2019-posted fics I read this year (admittedly not THAT many, I tend to read back in tags rather than reading newer stuff) this is the only one I bookmarked, because the characterization is good, the dialogue is well-written, and the writing is solid. There's even some decently well-written smut! It's genuinely heartwarming and if you like Hedric and feeling soft about stuff, I highly recommend reading it.
