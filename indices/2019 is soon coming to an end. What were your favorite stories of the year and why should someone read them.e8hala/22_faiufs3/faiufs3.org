linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]]) is really good. It's a WIP, but currently there are updates guaranteed from a week to three weeks. I've been following this story since the summer and everything about it is amazing. I love the characterization, how the author writes, pretty much everything that happened in this fic. It's a Harry/Draco slowburn, and the drarry hasn't started yet, but the lead up to it is great, and you can see the formation of a strong friendship from early chapters. The story has Dark!Harry, but focuses on the differences between dark and evil, how being a Slytherin doesn't make you evil, how changes can be good sometimes, and so many more things. Harry is resorted in his early fifth year in a genius incorporation of canon and comes to term with his new placement in Slytherin. I won't tell you much about what happens after that, but it's really great and I've been loving it since the first chapter. I will tell you, however, that there are so many plot twists that you'll never get bored. Happy early new year!
