I know what you mean about dialogue. God knows I've read too many stories that consisted of too much dialogue.

The reality is that you need a balance. People talk in real life, all the damn time. So you need dialogue. People notice their environments, and perform actions all the time. So you need description of the active moment. Yet, you can't show every single active moment. Sometimes, you just need to skip some of these moments, and get to your story. So you need exposition.

Thus, balance. If the entire story's exposition, then what's the point of writing? You may as well just publish an outline. If the entire story's dialogue, then nothing happens, and all people do is chat, so what's the point? If the entire story's active actions and description of the moment, you're never going to finish your story, and it's going to be fucking boring and never get to the action.

I was just calling out the imbalance where I saw one, same as you, and same as the author, even if the imbalance is in different directions. Part of the problem, I think, that I could tell from the author's notes, is that the author hated dialogue too much. They just developed an aversion to it, from reading prior imbalances, I think, which has overly affected the story.

Which sucks. Some solid revision could make it far more of the enjoyable. The plot and what not was super solid. It's just the actual writing itself really needs an editor.

There was a reason I was able to get through it. I just wanted to warn some people that they might get bored, really fast, if they were particularly adverse to that type of writing.
