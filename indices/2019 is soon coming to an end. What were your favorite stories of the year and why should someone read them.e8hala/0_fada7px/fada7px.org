A quick review for /The Archeologist/, after quickly binge-reading it:

It was a decent story. Neat premise, neat execution, and compete, which is very nice.

However, the author doesn't really like dialogue, apparently, as they state in an author's note. So the story ends up feeling a lot more of a summary of what's happening, rather actual descriptions of what's happening, a lot of the time.

In addition, the author exposits Harry's backstory, /a lot/. One third to a half of the fic is probably just exposition on the backstory. It's a good backstory, mind you, but it's a bit annoying to read a several paragraph tangent before getting back to the real story for a few paragraphs. Before going on a backstory tangent, /again/.

Should you read it? Maybe. The mild Bloodborne cross is tastefully done (really so that the the author didn't have to invent someone for Harry to go from scratch), and Harry's OP without it actually ruining the story. Getting power balance right is very difficult, so it was nice seeing the author pull that off.

I would try a chapter or two, to see if it's for you. But if you get excessively annoyed by the exposition, you might end up not liking it. I get really annoyed about this, so the only reason I finished the story was because of how short it is.
