i'm surprised no one's mentioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13795605?view_full_work=true][Victoria Potter]] by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]

-it's probably one of, if not /the/ best fem!harry fic i've ever read.

-the dialogue, worldbuilding, characterizations-so good

Also i now realize that's it was started in 2018, but i'm counting it for this year, as it's still ongoing

a naruto crossover, also fem!harry called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17241749?view_full_work=true][Breathe (Don't Falter)]]

- does naruto crossover the right way

again this was started in late 2018, but is ongoing: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16405130?view_full_work=true][Grow Young with Me]]

- +a very good+ the best Harry/OC fic

Harry/Ginny fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15936890?view_full_work=true][Noticing]]

- pretty good
