Because it is one of the rare crossovers with amazing writing. Crossovers have a reputation of being bad, which mostly stems from the fact that often they are just born out of an idea like "hey, I bet putting Harry into the whatever universe would be fun" by random, not very talented people who then just start writing. Nothing wrong with that, being creative is for everyone and should always be encouraged. Everybody starts somewhere.

So anyways, because of that I did not have a lot of hope seeing this fic being the first and only story by the author. But they went on to prove me wrong. Great writing, interesting plot and good pacing. And it is very different to most other HP/MCU crossovers. The author has written 417k words in just over 5 months, and updates every few days.

EDIT: Archmage of Arda, already suggested by another comment, is definitely seconded by me.
