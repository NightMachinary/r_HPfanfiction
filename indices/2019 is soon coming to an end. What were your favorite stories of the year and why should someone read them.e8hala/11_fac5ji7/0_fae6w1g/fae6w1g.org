I disagree with this recommendation - the writing is quite stilted and awkward, but the biggest thing is way too much telling instead of showing. I basically stopped reading after I saw

- "Harry then proceeded to make small talk with the two men, like he was simply catching up with some old buddies. "

Like, why not just include the dialogue? There's only one reason I can think of, and it's that they can't write it, and that's not promising for the rest of the story.

Also there's this incredible line that had me dying -

- "And that's when the food arrived. Harry started working on the serious business of mastication (chewing)."

Edit: unrelated to this is that I hate any interpretations of prophecy as binding and immutable, it's without question my least favorite fanon invention.
