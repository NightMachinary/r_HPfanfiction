Huh, tastes differ I guess, everybody else I heard from thought the writing was great. I mean, can't be liked by everybody, but I think 95%+ is still a good rate.

And if you stop reading everything that has something like what you describe, you won't read any book till its finished. I mean, first example that comes to mind, you would have stopped reading the LOTR trilogy before they arrived in Bree, because the dialogue during their meal was shortened to just a description of topics instead of writing the actual dialogue.

Hell, I am pretty sure I would have had to abandon like 90% of the HP fics I read in the last 18 years if I made this a rule :D
