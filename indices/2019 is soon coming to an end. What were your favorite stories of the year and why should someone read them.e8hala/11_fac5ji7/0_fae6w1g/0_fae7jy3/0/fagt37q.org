Unfortunately I have to second what he said. I'm only at chapter 7 and this is far from the worst I have ever read. Also, seeing that this is apparently the author's first work and the have stuck through it for 400k words makes me hopeful.

But there are quite a few issues with the writing, like how Harry emoted in a way that carried forward the plot or gave out a lot of information to characters or the reader, but that felt more often than not totally unbelievable. Big parts of his talk with the ancient one were between cringy and eyer-rolling.

That's not to say that I don't see where the author was going with it and there is potential in it, as the plot itself (or the little that I have seen from it) doesn't look bad. But he does quite a few missteps along the way and some of them can take you out of the story.
