It should also be mentioned that Tolkien was intentionally writing in a classical style, and was inspired by epics of the likes of Beowulf, which generally (having started out as oral storytelling, which has a heavy emphasis on showmanship) will have very flowery and exaggerated language. The old-fashioned language probably turns off a lot of contemporary readers as a result.
