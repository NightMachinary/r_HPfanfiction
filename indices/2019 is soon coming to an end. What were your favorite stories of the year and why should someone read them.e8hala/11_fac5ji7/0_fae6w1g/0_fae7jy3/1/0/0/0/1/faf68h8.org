The point I'm trying to make is that the prose isn't exceptional, merely sufficient. I think most people have an idealized perception of his writing due to the popularity of the franchise in other media, and don't actually remember what the source material was like.

Amusingly, that latter point is extremely the case for hpfanfic as well, as many...creative recollections of canon show.
