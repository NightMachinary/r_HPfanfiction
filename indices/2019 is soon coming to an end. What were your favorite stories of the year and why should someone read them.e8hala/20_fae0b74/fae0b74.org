Bloodborne you say? Well I have a new story to read. (Bloodborne is my favourite game of all time, I even got to new game + 9 I was so into it.)

Anyway, for me it would be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132670/1/][The Stag and The Flower by ReluctantSidekick]] a post war Harry/Fleur romance fic (still in progress). It technically started in 2018, but it was at the end of November and majority of the story was written this year. It has a few story elements that bring the concept of Character bashing to mind in reference to Bill and Ginny, but it does so in as unobtrusive a way as possible, and manages to have it not seem to extreme by having appear in the story very infrequently. The characters are well written, the relationship is believable (always crucial in romance) and the plot is thought out and well paced. It has elements of the more tropey wish fulfillment fics as a part of it, but manages to avoid being cringe-worthy by not taking itself super seriously. The fate of the world doesnt rest on Harry and Fleur picking the right Bouquet, and as such it preserves the suspension of disbelief through the more unlikely sections and maintains immersion.

On the whole, Id say the story is a 9.5/10, and I 100% recommend it.
