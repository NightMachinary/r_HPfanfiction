There was one time -- mind you, only one time out of all the fics I've ever read -- that I thought the author did Avada Kedavra eyes well. iirc, the villian, or some other antagonist was in a face off with Harry and had the chilling realization that Harry's eyes weren't green like Lily's as they originally thought, but rather the exact shade of Avada Kedavra.
