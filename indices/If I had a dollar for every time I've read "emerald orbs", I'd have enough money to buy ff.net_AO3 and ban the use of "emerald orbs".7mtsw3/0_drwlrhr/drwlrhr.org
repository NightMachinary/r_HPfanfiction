Harry's emerald orbs were sparkling.

Ron looked at the narration above, then back at Harry's eyes, "Huh. They don't look sparkly to me."

"Ron, it's not talking about his eyes," Hermione pointed downwards, "it means those down there."

Ron looked down at Harry's pants and raised a confused eyebrow.

"No, I mean the gobstones on the floor!"

"Ohh..." Ron said with dawning realisation, before turning his (and the narrative's) attention to the ground in front of them; Harry was engaged in a simple game of gobstones with another of the (unnamed) Gryffindors, and his shining green emerald gobstones were easily distinguished from the gold-and-scarlet ones of his opponent's.
