I discovered Harry Potter fanfiction about eighteen months ago, and it's given my writing a purpose and made me feel welcomed. I'm a bit of a social outcast at school, and fanfiction communties just make me feel as though I'm part of a big family - especially Murder Most Unladylike fanfiction, where you recognise the authors who write several oneshots.

I just feel so much more happier with fanfiction in my life - I don't know what I did without it.
