I started with Lord of the Rings fan fiction - and that helped me with my elvish. Then I discovered Harry Potter fan fiction and I learned the...mechanics of being gay. I knew what homosexuality was but I didn't know how it worked physically. I also started reading fanfiction pre 2002- before OotP came out and pre horcruxes - mainly prediction based and now is not canon. What awesome times.
