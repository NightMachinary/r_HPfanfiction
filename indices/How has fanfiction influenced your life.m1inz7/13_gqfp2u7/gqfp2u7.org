I started reading fanfiction 8 years ago. At that time, Becky G was up and coming and I learned that G stands for Gomez. So I googled if she was related to Selena Gomez and ended up on Movelas. I read a bunch of Becky G fanfics then 1D fics even though I barely listened to their music. This was how I was introduced to erotica and how gay sex works. And how sex works in general.

I didn't want to make an account on Wattpad so I was unable to read some fics I wanted. (Don't read fanfiction on Wattpad, it's rarely good. If it is, it's almost always cross posted on another website)

Anyway one day I googled Ron/Hermione erotica and that started my journey into Harry Potter fanfiction.

I read the fic (the [[/r/hr][r/hr]] erotica one) on Harry Potter fanfiction. Then I started using ffn.

This was my first forage into actual fics. Not necessarily good ones but ones that weren't pwp.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and The Mystic Knights;Forest of Mystery;Harry Crow; Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality)

And many more. I loved them. Although now 7 years later, I hate them. My tastes has drastically changed.

Soon enough I started reading Drarry. Which lead me to adult ffn. Anyway, this is where my undying love for Lucius comes from. I hadn't read deathly hallows or even hbp yet. So Narcissa wasn't really a character in my mind. Lucius was though. Going through my sexuality crisis I wanted nothing more than an accepting family. Fics where Lucius was an accepting and supporting father made him my favourite character. Despite his flaws he was still a good dad. Something I wanted out of my own dad. Years later and he's still my fav.

One day I came across linkffn(Runaway Wizard) which inspired me to read Lucius centric fics. I'm always down for some well written Lucissa, Snucius and Lumione. I've even read a few good Larry fics.

I can't think of any Snucius or Lucissa fics off the top of my head but there are so many.

As for Lumione well I love linkffn(Hungry, Thirsty, Crazy) to the point I made my suicide note a poem with that title. I also love linkao3(Anyone On The Line).

That last fic led me to ao3. I started reading it the moment the first chapter was posted on adult ffn but my new school had a wall that blocked that site. So I moved to ao3 and I fell in love.

Anyway fanfiction has become my main coping mechanism and I'm probably addicted. The only time I've ever gone an extended period of time (it was 7 days the first time and 5 the next) without it was when I was hospitalised. And I spent 50% of the time dreaming of fics and the rest convincing them I'm not a danger to myself or society and they can discharge me.

It's improved my reading skills, my comprehension levels, my trivia knowledge, my history knowledge etc.

Now when I read fics, I automatically beta them in my head. Although I never give my work to the authors.
