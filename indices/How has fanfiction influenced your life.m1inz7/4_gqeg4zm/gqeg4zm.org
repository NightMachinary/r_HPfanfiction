The works of Dorothea Greengrass (on FFN) inspired me to start writing again after going to University to learn how to write cured me of wanting to write more than 20 years ago.

I have 7 novel-size stories on the go, a list of 16 more I haven't started, and I look forward to each day because writing makes me happy. Happiness I didn't have for more than 20 years because someone was paid to teach something they had no business talking about.

Don't believe what you're told. Believe in yourself. Write what you want to write because you want to write it.
