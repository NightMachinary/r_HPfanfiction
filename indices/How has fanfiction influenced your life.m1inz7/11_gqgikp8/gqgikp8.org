I grew up in a religious family. So reading fanfics was kind of my gateway to learning about how to be more open and accepting of people from other religions, sexual orientations, politics... read a lot of Star Trek fanfics back in the day. It also got me into a reading habit. I began to read more books including classics which I used to really hate before.
