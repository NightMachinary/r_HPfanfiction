For me it was a great help in improving my English. When I was a teenager I read Harry Potter series in my native language and later, I don't remember how, I found out about the concept of fanfiction and read the few good fanfictions written in my language. But the thirst for more fanfiction never subsided and later, when I began to learn English the thought of reading so many fanfictions available in English was a wonderful motivation for me. The first actual, non-textbook thing I read in English was fanfiction. These days I can't find anything good though, I have read so many fics that there aren't many good ones left. I'm really picky, so I have a hard time finding anything worth reading.
