  I have uploaded the remaining chapters to the story. In a day or two I'll post a message giving a brief synopsis of what I had planned.

  I wish I could have finished this for everyone. Since I posted my original message the only news I've had is bad news. First lung cancer, then they found spots on my brain resulting in radiation treatments. Finally I fell getting into the tub and hurt my hip. X-rays of the hip showed no fracture thank god, but they did find a spot on the bone which is now also scheduled for radiation treatment.

  If I sound depressed, it's because I am. It seems like I haven't been able to catch a break at all this past month.

  A lot of people have sent me messages of support and I do appreciate them even if I don't reply to each one.

  Enjoy those final chapters, I just wish there was more of them.
