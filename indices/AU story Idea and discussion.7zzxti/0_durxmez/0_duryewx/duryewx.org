  Neville born a squib --> Voldemort can confirm that Harry is the baby of the "prophecy". Why on earth would his conqueror and killer be a squib?

They can't tell whether Neville is a squib or not. The whole point about Neville's character is that they weren't sure whether he's a squib or not for a long time.
