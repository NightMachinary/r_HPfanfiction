Well two things to think about:

1. While Neville's grandmother is harsh on paper, she does love Neville. No one's a perfect parent/grandparent, and she makes her share of mistakes. That's what makes her human. But, she passes the biggest requirement - she loves Neville, and he's all she has left. Squib or not, I doubt she'll abandon him if his parents die.

2. I'm going to preface this with I love Neville. He's the inner bullied kid in all of us. But, he doesn't play a role that's so unique that it can't exist without Neville. At first he's comic relief, the bullied kid, and eventually he's Harry-lite. His role could honestly be played by an entirely different face and character and it wouldn't make a difference. So, if Neville's a squib, and canon occurs, someone steps up to fill his role, and canon just happens.
