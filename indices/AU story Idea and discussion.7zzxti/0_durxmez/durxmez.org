Well if you want to get seriously crazy we can go down this road:

- Neville born a squib --> Voldemort can confirm that Harry is the baby of the "prophecy". Why on earth would his conqueror and killer be a squib?
- This means that he lets his followers know that Potter is the boy that he goes after. He never once has anything to do with the Longbottoms other than in encounters
- This give no reason for Bellatrix and the others to go searching for the Longbottoms after Voldemort's downfall.
- The Longbottoms will probably want to have more kids. Neville may or may not get shunted aside. Even families like the Weasleys hide their squibs ("Mum's got a second cousin who's a banker or something... but we don't talk about him" (Philosopher's Stone).
- The Lestranges + Junior never actually get captured? So where do we go from here?
