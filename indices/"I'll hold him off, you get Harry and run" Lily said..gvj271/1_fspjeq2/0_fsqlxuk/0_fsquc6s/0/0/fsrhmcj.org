If I had a childhood friend who I cared very deeply for and loved (whether romantically or platonically) and was black, I would not, nor do I know anyone who would in this same situation, call them a nigger (unless, you know, it was a joke between us and there was no malice involved, but that's not the case here). That's what Snape did to Lily. Whatever his feelings may have been, he clearly didn't actually care for her as much as you think he did.
