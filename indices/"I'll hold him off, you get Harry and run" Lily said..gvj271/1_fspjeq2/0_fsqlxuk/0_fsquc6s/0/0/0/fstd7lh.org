First, let me say that what he did in that scene was completely f*cked up; I understand why she never forgave him, and don't blame her a bit.

That said, I can't agree that it necessarily follows that he didn't really care for her, because people are *stupid* that way. Even assuming that he had drunk /all/ the death eater anti-muggle kool-aide, it's a surprisingly common thing for people to do: "All of [group X] are scum-sucking troglodytes! (Except my friend Alex, who is cool */* the exception */* a credit to their [race, religion, people, whatever]." It is something you will see all the time if you look around (although usually, it's not quite that overt).

People /often/ don't reconcile the immediate to the larger picture. If they did, the world might be a better place as people would have to start pulling their heads out of their nether regions.

tl;dr: He may well have cared, but at the same time had his head up his *ss.
