What do you make of the *action* of conspiring to murder someone's toddler son and their husband? That's canon.

That's what you call "caring deeply, but not very wisely or well"?

Yikes. Look - totally fine to just like villains. Magneto was my favorite X-Men character when I was a kid. But I still recognized that he was a bad guy. That's different from what you're doing, which is excusing unambiguously *evil* behavior as good.

It's like the authors that pair up Hermione with Death Eaters, because they like to fantasize about 'redeeming' edgy bad boys. In reality, it's the equivalent of writing a romance story about a Nazi who spent years happily working at Auschwitz, then falls in love with a Jewish woman after the war. Gross.
