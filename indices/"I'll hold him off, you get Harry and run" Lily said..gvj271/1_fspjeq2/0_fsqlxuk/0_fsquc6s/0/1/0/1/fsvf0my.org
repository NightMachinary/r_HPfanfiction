I'm not a Snape fan either, but thought you might benefit from actually seeing what canon (hp-lexicon) says: "Dumbledore found it repulsive that Snape had asked Voldemort to spare Lily but not Harry or James Potter".

When even Dumbledore is disgusted by how horrible of a person Snape is, it's pretty fair to say that you are projecting your fandom onto Snape.

But I saw a fic the other day where Hermione was banging Lucius Malfoy, so it's pretty clear that a lot of fanfic readers/authors use what's between their legs more than what's between their ears lol..
