Conspiring to murder someone's toddler son and their husband? When did the subject change to Voldermort, or were you talking about Pettigrew?

Snape is the one who passed on the warning that the Potters and Longbottoms were in danger. Yes, they were in danger because of him in the first place, but he'd hardly be the first person who regretted their actions once faced with the actual human consequence.

And I am not "excusing unambiguously *evil* behavior as good." I'm pointing out that *some* of his actions can be interpreted in different ways.

If you can't accept that people can interpret a scene in different ways, I don't think there is anything left for us to talk about.
