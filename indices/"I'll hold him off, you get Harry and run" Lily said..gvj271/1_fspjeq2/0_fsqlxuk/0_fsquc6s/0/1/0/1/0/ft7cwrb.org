I'm aware of the canon, thank you, but I don't decide my take on a subject based on what a particular character thinks, regardless of which character it is.

Let me ask you a question. Given, first, that Voldemort considers Harry a threat to himself, and second that Snape is known to hate James, what argument could Snape have made to Voldemort that could save one or both of them? This isn't a rhetorical question - if there's something apparent to others that I'm missing, I want to know.

That I don't see a way he *could* save either James or Harry, and thus better not to try in favor of trying to protect the one person he had a chance to save, doesn't mean I'm projecting anything. If it implies anything, it might indicate that I'm more cynical than the average reader.

Finally, you seem to imply that my opinion is in part or entirely influenced by "what's between [my] legs." Given that I'm asexual, maybe you should reserve that kind of pot-shot for someone who gives a d*am about that sort of thing? I don't even like the character.
