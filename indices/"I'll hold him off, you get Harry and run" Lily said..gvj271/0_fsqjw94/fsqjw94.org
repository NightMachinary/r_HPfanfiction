* "I'll hold him off, you get Harry and run!" Lily shouted.

James barely had a moment to think, and then he was off. He ran, like he had never ran before. He almost bounced off the walls trying to get up the stairs as fast as possible. In the nursery was his son, and he would be damned if he allowed Harry to be harmed, especially after Lily's sacrifice.

He grabbed a spare blanket and quickly tied the corners together, creating a crude carrier for the toddler. In went Harry. In went his covers. In went that plushie that always made him sleep. Hearing footsteps on the stairs, James grabbed the now empty wooden cradle and threw it at the window. It broke with a spray of glass shards and noise, but James didn't care.\\
A path was now open - he wouldn't waste the chance.

Without his wand and with the motivated Dark Lord about to break down he door he could only do one thing, use one advantage Lily did not have. James changed into his Animagus form, took a running start and jumped out of the window with the precious bundle hanging from his muzzle.

Lord Voldemort bit back a scream as he arrived to an empty room. He ran to the broken window just in time to see a stag gore Petter Pettigrew on his horns and clear the edge of anti-apparition wards. Its form blurred, and with a crack of Apparition the boy and his father were gone, beyond his reach.

Lord Voldemort screamed. He was still screaming when the house's magical protections, activated by the unconscious woman on her way to their duel, finally overloaded and turned everything in the perimeter into fire and dust. Voldemort's vessel, constrained by his own anti-Apparition enchantments, didn't survive the explosion.
