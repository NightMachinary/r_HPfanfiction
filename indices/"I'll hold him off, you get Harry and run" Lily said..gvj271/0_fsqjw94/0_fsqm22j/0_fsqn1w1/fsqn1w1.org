Nope, vaped. She was unconscious and at the centre of the explosion.

Both her and Voldemort, and she didn't have a Horcrux. Of course, this means no scar Horcrux for Voldemort- Harry was away, and everything there was destroyed. This means that Voldemort either was saved by his Horcruxes, or his soul destabilized in a storm of chaotic magic without that anchor. Either would make a good narrative, with James on the warpath and firmly in the "Family First" mindstate. No Boy Who Lived anyway, which is as good a source of butterflies as any. Additionally, we have clear evidence that a muggleborn nuked the Dark Lord, which has interesting implications as well.
