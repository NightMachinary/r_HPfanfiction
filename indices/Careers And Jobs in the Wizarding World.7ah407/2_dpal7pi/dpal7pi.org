I liked the random summer jobs that Harry does in linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). At one point, he has to do lots of hiking in the forest and remote land to put up warding posts (that are sticks that you put in the ground that expand to warding posts when you put them in) among a perimeter to seperate werewolf colony territory from non werewolf territory.

Then he acts as a parseltongue translator for a bunch of researchers who study and take care of various animals and creatures.

He is also an office clerk to an international affairs/wizarding office and has to act as a German translator and Britain ambassator at some point.
