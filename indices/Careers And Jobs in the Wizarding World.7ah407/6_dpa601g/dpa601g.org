My feeling is that "idle businessman", "reporter", "Hogwarts professor", "curse-breaker", "dragon-handler", "law enforcement", "Healer", "shop owner" and "ministry worker" about sum it up. There /isn't/ a lot of career options in the Wizarding World because the community is essentially rather small. At the same time, I also imagine there are quite a few "idle" wizards.
