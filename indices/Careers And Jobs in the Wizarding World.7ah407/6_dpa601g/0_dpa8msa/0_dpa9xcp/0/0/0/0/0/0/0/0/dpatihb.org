I honestly find it unlikely such a successful schemer and eminent Slytherin as Lucius Malfoy would be unaware of the money to be made from exploiting muggle labor. I'm not saying he has any idea what a computer is, but muggles were already farming the lands before the Statute of Secrecy even existed (and in those days, I'm sure most wizards either bought fair and square from the farmers, or Imperiused them into giving them what they wanted; certainly no proud wizard would have lowered himself to working the land). Actively wanting to bridge the technological gap, and knowing muggles produce stuff and it's easy to use magic to steal it from them, are two different things.
