I don't really understand why they'd buy stuff from Muggles, though. Like, firstly, many wizards would NOT be cool with that - they don't even want Muggleborn MAGICALS in their community, let alone forcing an actual business relationship with Muggles.

Besides, Muggles wouldn't farm most of the things wizards would need. Pumpkins, for example, seem pretty damn huge with wizards, and just look at potions ingredients or the bizarre things people need for other stuff, and I imagine they have very different standards for butchery and farming than Muggles do.

Wizard farms wouldn't have the same constraints when it came to space or volume, and it makes a lot of sense to me that they'd have their own farms very separate from Muggle taints, like. Even if the farms are worked by Squibs or wizards with very little magic, I can see them being preferable to Muggle things.
