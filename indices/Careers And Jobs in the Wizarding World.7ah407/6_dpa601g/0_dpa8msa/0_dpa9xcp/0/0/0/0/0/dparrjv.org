But Muggles are dirty.

Like, that's genuinely what a lot of the pureblood wizards would think - Muggles are filthy and stupid. They don't want a tiered world with Muggles being their slaves, because Muggles are genuinely worthless to them; they want to be completely /separate/ from Muggles.

These people don't even know what Muggle money looks like, why the Hell are they going to care about the prices they can get for things?

Food and raw materials are not "another matter" from potions ingredients. For a big jaw of a beetle eyes, think about how many beetles you would need to breed, given how beetles have /two eyes/ each. You can't do that in the back of an apothecary. That would need to be done somewhere specialized in a farming facility. Potions ingredients /are/ raw materials.

And okay, stupid wizards, then. The idiots who barely come out of Hogwarts with 2 O.W.L.s, if that's how you want to look at it. Not everybody is going to be able to be a super-duper-magical-special-hitwizard. Not everybody is even able to be a clerk in a government job.

Like, you can't brush off the wizarding world as something where only great wizards who're very intelligent exist - that would be a fucking dystopia.
