  Like, that's genuinely what a lot of the pureblood wizards would think - Muggles are filthy and stupid. They don't want a tiered world with Muggles being their slaves, because Muggles are genuinely worthless to them; they want to be completely separate from Muggles. These people don't even know what Muggle money looks like, why the Hell are they going to care about the prices they can get for things?

What information do we have to support your view of the pureblood mind? Sure, that's how the /Gaunts/ thought, but they were inbred extremists who were also cut off from wizarding society as a whole (I'm not sure any of them ever even went to Hogwarts). Voldemort's agenda, and by extension the Death Eaters', did seem to be taking over the muggles rather than exterminating them --- mass murder and pillage being a perks during the war that the large "population" of muggles could handle. But even ignoring that, I'm not saying the average Knockturn Alley resident would be okay with what I'm talking about. But I'm saying someone like Lucius Malfoy definitely would be. And once one Slytherin smartarse started smuggling ill-gotten muggle goods for cheap, wizarding competition couldn't handle it.

  Food and raw materials are not "another matter" from potions ingredients. For a big jaw of a beetle eyes, think about how many beetles you would need to breed, given how beetles have two eyes each. You can't do that in the back of an apothecary.

But according to Rowling, while you cannot /transfigure/ edible food (and that would presumably extend to potion ingredients as well), it is possible to increase its quantity. Starting with two beetle eyes, a wizard could easily get a jar of them.
