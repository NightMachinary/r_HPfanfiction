I was coming from the opposite point of view --- "What is this? Wizards, forced to do /manual labor/?!? You're out of your mind, Dumbledore! Do you realize what a few selected compulsion charms can do on those muggles? Do you have any idea at what price we can get the materials from those idiots?".

Potions ingredient are another matter entirely; I was talking about food and raw materials.

Also, wizards with "little magic" = not a thing. As Rowlign put it, "you're magical or you're not" and there's no such thing as "not very magical"; it's all a matter of knowledge and skill with a wand.
