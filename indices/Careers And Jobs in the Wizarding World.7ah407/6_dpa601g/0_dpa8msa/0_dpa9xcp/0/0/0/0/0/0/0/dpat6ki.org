I don't think duplicating a potion ingredient would replicate its magical qualities, for the same reason one can take a broom, and then cast charms on it to make it fly, but one cannot conjure from nowhere a flying broomstick.

And moreover, Lucius Malfoy is exactly who I'm thinking of. These people don't know what trousers are, or what Muggle money looks like, or anything similar - if they wanted to bridge the gap between Muggles and wizards, they WOULD. There'd be evidence of it. Sure, the wizarding radio exists, and we have stuff like the train and the camera, but for all we know wizards genuinely think /they/ invented those things.

The majority of wizards, even those that work closely with Muggles like Arthur Weasley, don't seem to know the simplest, most basic things. They couldn't possibly scheme to take advantage of Muggle resources - they don't even realize the Muggles have any!
