But a shop owner might need employees for managing finances (secretary) or assisting in making the products (craftsmen). If they don't make their own materials, then they need someone to make those. If they sell internationally, they need someone to ship the goods. If they need specialized tools for their craft, they need someone to make those. They probably didn't build their shop. They didn't make the floo powder their customers use to get there.

Also, we know that some transfigurations undo when the caster dies - Slughorn's fish from Lily comes to mind. Whether or not this applies to all transfigured items is unknown, but the fact that an item is transfigured leaves them vulnerable to untransfiguration. It is very likely that the highest-quality products are those made of real, non-transfigured material assembled in magical ways (e.g. you use an enchanted needle to sew real thread into real cloth).
