Interestingly, in canon, the British Wizarding World is simultaneously the size of a large town or small city, yet has such diversity in its range of possible careers (despite what fanon says about everyone being a ministry bureacrat), and almost all of its people pass through such a small school with fairly generalised education that acts as their secondary education.

But more on topic, I find the idea of spellcrafters a fascinating profession.
