I have to wonder what wizarding entertainment is like, too.

We know that they unsuccessfully tried to do a play of the Fountain of Fair Fortune at Hogwarts, but I wonder if the wizarding theatre is any good? Musicals, operas, radio plays?

What about zoos or circuses?

A magizoologist might happily study in the wild, but I have to wonder if there are any conservationist efforts - a la Brandon Mull's Fablehaven, perhaps!
