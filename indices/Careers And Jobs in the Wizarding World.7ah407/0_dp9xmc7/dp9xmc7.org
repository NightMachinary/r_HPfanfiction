I didn't want to put a huge wall of text in the main post, but these are just a few thoughts I've had already:

- /Writing/. We see journalists and a fair few textbook writers. Flourish and Blotts is a business doing very well, with book-signings and all sorts.
- /Law Enforcement./ The Magical Law Enforcement Office seems fairly big, as they cover both Aurors and Hitwizards and will likely have people internally too.
- /Government Employees./ The Ministry has dozens of offices under its purview.
- /Unspeakable Things./
- /Music/. The Weird Sisters and Celestina Warbeck both come immediately to mind.
- /Agriculture/. Food is coming from somewhere, as we know that food cannot be conjured from nowhere. Are wizarding farms different to Muggle farms? Is the technique different, or is the food produced drastically different? What about potions ingredients?
- /Animal breeding./ This is really a subset of agriculture in some ways, but we also have to look at the pet industry.
- /Herbology./ People love to have a flourishing garden - are private gardens important? Do people often want to improve as herbologists or hire people to come in and sort out their gardens? What about invasive species and magical pest control?
- /Brewing/. Somebody has to put together the potions people buy, whether they be cleaning products, Sleek-Eazy shampoo or medications. Are they done in big labs with huge cauldrons, or is that for some reason infeasible? Perhaps the jobs are privately contracted out?
- /Education./ We know that Hogwarts is the big boarding school, but there are probably tutors as well - particularly for disciplines not covered at Hogwarts, such as language acquisition and music, which seems to be covered as an extra curricular.
- /Religious Leadership./ According to JKR, all kinds of religions exist within the HP universe, but I imagine magical religious leaders are quite different to their Muggle counterparts. How do the magical leaders fit in with their framework? Wizarding Catholics, for example - is the Pope in on the Statute of Secrecy? Is there a separate branch of the church? How are teachings different for wizards - would we recognize a wizarding rabbi or imam or priest, or would they look drastically different?
- /Transport./ So, who designs brooms? Is the Knight Bus an independent business, or is it run by a framework? What about the Floo Network, who governs that? Who maintains it?
- /Banking./ Gringotts is obviously the main wizarding bank, but how many humans do they hire? We know Bill Weasley was a cursebreaker for them, but Gringotts get hold of Muggle money and presumably have to have /some/ connection with the Muggle world for that, etc.
- /Sports./ The sports industry seems heavily centred on Quidditch, but there are a lot of elements to that - advertising, management, training, branding, pitch care, etc.
- /Radio./ The Wizarding Wireless Network seems relatively important in the war, but even before then it's often in the background - Molly listens to it, for example. What sort of programming do they have? Are people salaried, or is it all voluntary? Is it international, or within the UK?
- /Building./ The Weasleys seem to have added a lot of bits to their own house, but what about wizarding houses in general? Are there builders who specialize in extensions or warding or the like? How long does it take to add to a home or build one? How big is the industry? What sort of materials do they need? Is there a lot of Ministry oversight?
