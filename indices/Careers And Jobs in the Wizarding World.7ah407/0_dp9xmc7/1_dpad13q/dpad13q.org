You forgot things like art, enchanting, and the various craftsmanship disciplines like metalworking, leatherworking, woodworking, weaving, sewing, cobbling, etc. We know that magic can give a single worker the production ability of a team of muggles for complex objects, and a small factory for simpler objects. Thus any job that requires even the slightest bit of creativity or allows even a drop of artistic liberty is a wizard's dream.

Also, to transport, you should add shipping. No doubt English wizards are too lazy to wait for their fancy international goods to be shipped to them via normal muggle means. There are probably people who spend all day portkeying crates of goods around the world or carrying enchanted cases (like Newt Scamander's briefcase) with an ungodly amount of goods inside.
