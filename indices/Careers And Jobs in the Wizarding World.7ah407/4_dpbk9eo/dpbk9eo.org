odd potion ingredients have to come from somewhere. I like to imagine things like "Essence of X" requires a lot of work.

Essence of Death : hide jugs of binding agent the the attics or basements of convalescent homes and hospitals. visit annually to test the saturation levels. once a binding agent is saturated it needs to be refined with catalysts and separation rituals on specific days of the year or locations on the planet and you end up with small amounts of other essences and industrial 'taint'.

similar levels of convolution exist for all kinds of ingredients. each step of the process requires people who can do their specific task competently. there are so many varied tasks that can be focused on that they all just get group together under the job title of "Artisan".
