In one of my fanfictions my Harry becomes a diagon alley clothing store assistant after the war. :) Because Harry always does go on about how he is JUST HARRY and wants to be normal and hates his fame in canon, so yes to me it makes way more sense than how he became an Auror in canon!!! He just went through a war and a destiny that he HATED and NEVER WANTED, so why would he get a job where he has to face death and trauma even more???
