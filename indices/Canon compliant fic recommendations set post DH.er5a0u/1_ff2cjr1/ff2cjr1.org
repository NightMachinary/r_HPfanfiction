FloreatCastellum is the only canon compliant author I unreservedly recommend.

Northumbrian's pretty good but I feel like they didn't get the main characters. Their Luna, Lavender, and OCs are great and the stories are great but I just couldn't jibe with their HHrR and found myself skimming when they were given focus.
