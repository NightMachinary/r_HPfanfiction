"Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Old friendships broken, new ones formed. Sticks to canon at first but will tread to AU territory. M rating because I'm paranoid. Harry/Fleur.
