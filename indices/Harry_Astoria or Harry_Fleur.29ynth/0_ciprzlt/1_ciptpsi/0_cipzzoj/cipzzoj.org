I've read about half of both.

Both have gigantic issues with sentence structure, dialogue, characterization, and just writing in general. Heart and Soul gets better as it goes along (I think I got about 50 chapters in), but His Angel doesn't really improve in terms of writing quality. His Angel has quite a bit of character bashing (specifically the Weasleys), and in particular Molly might as well an OC.

Heart and Soul might be worth reading if that's your thing. His Angel is my go-to example of a terrible fic that somehow manages to accrue a huge audience.
