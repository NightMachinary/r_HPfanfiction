Harry/Fleur is my favorite ship. Some of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived by jbern]]: Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters by TheEndless7]]: Students are required to write to a pen pal in the spirit of 'International Cooperation.' New friendships and a new romance arise going into the fourth year at Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger%20and%20Rose][Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity]]: Dumbledore doesn't ignore the 2nd prophecy! He apprentices Harry and teaches him a rare form of magic, but draws the ire of a secret society who seek to guard this knowledge and do Harry in. Assassination attempts on multiple fronts. H/F, Yr. 4 GoF AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation][The British Reformation by kb0]]: After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.
