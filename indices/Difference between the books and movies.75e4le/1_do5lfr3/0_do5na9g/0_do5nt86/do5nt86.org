Maybe those Hollywood types presented her with a detailed market analysis that showed if the main two movie characters received the greatest emphasis, the NPV (Net Present Value) of the project would increase by 77% in their proprietary DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis.

For hundreds millions of Pounds, she should have no problem sacrificing a few of her characters.
