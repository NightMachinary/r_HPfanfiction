Perhaps. But the first film made $974.7 million at the global box office ($317.5 million in North America + $657.2 million overseas). It was actually the second-highest grossing film ever on a worldwide basis at the time, not adjusted for inflation, only behind Titanic's mammoth $1.8 billion record. Fun fact: Outside of the United States, Japan was Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone biggest market from a box office perspective.
