In reference to Order of the Phoenix, Michael Goldenberg wrote its screenplay. Anyway, I believe I read in an interview somewhere that Steve Kloves believed (especially in the beginning) that Harry and Hermione would end up together, and even championed the pairing after Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows was released. I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate but whatever was put to screen by either Kloves or Goldenberg was passed by JK Rowling, so she obviously didn't have much of a problem of how badly Ginny got bashed in the movies. Then again, she didn't give much character development to her in the books so that argument may not carry much weight, if any.
