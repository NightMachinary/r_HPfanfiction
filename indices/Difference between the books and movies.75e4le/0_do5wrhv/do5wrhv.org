The movies are very simplified and streamlined; there's a lot of characters and plot threads that plain don't make it from the page to the screen.

Some characters have been altered and given a lot less depth -- Ginny is one of them; while she's a minor character for the first four books, starting with book five she really steps up as a character. While I wouldn't say she's THAT deeply-explored in the books, she does get a lot more development than she does in the movie.

Another thing the movies do is pretty much botch Ron and Hermione. In the books the two are a lot more complex and nuanced characters, their separate goals and desires coming across more clearly.

The movies have a tendency to remove Hermione's flaws, while enhancing Ron's flaws -- which not only makes both of them shallower and less interesting, but also tends to alter the character dynamic. The movies aren't about Harry, Ron and Hermione; they're about Harry and Hermione, and this doofus named Ron whom they sometimes let tag along.
