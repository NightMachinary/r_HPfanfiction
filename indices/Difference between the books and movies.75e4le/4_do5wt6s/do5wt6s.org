Well, the books portray Ginny a bit better than the movies as they show /some/ interactions between her and Harry, and those do show that they are potentially compatible as a couple, but ultimately she does not have a lot of screen (or script) time and a lot of her character development takes place completely off-screen (or off-line).

The thing with the people ranting is that, contrary to how it is in real life when a lot of character development of our own love interests happens “off-screen” (for us anyway) and compatibility is or at least should be a real concern, in media it's generally accepted that no matter the personality differences and whatever other stuff that may divide them, if the hero and a character of the opposite sex (or gender, I suppose, let's not limit ourselves here) interact a lot then they very much can be a couple and often end up as one.

Combine these two and it's /very/ easy for people to reject Ginny as a viable love interest for Harry.
