Re-reading it I see that it is. But what I mean is that most of the bashing fanfics tends to have quite a few grammatical errors and generally write either the Weasley's as bad people or write Ginny as some useless character. The fics I read weren't like that but well written and when I say "rants or state their opinion" I mean that they write an A/N giving their thoughts on Harry/Ginny or why they chose the pairing they did because they think it doesn't really make sense have Harry/GInny.
