linkffn(the injunction by justcourbeau) that's Hermione/George with a handful of other ships. I read it recently and enjoyed it. I'll edit in some more later when I'm on my computer :)

Oh! How do you feel about soul bonds or mates? It doesn't exactly force marriage, but it's the same theme. I'll put two I liked at the very bottom.

Remus/Hermione: linkao3(of weddings and warfare) linkffn(a higher law by nynaeve80) linkffn(shared destinies by amightypenguin)

Severus/Hermione: linkffn(denial by little beloved) linkffn(his draught of delicate poison by subversa)

Hermione/Sirius: linkffn(I solemnly swear by hufflepuffpower93) linkffn(innocence by ceredwen) linkffn(necessary by the order by ladyseradereturns) linkffn(happily ever after by igobumpinthedark) linkffn(a hidden agenda by kia maro)

Hermione/Fred: linkffn(meant for each other by jamcreynolds) (I couldn't get through this one)

Soul Bond: linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie)

Bond: linkffn(bond by Anna fugazzi)

Um. Yeah. I've read all of these, they're of varying quality (probably a preference thing more than actual good or bad). I really haven't seen many slash marriage law/breeding law fics, a lot of what I end up seeing there are bonds and/or mates.
