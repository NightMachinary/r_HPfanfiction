Yeah, that was a super disappointing fic. I got through a handful of chapters before dropping it - Harry's change of character was far too sudden for me, and the way he was raging at Hermione and Ron just seemed incredibly childish (whereas the fic seemed to want us to think of it as something super serious).

The few Fleur interludes just made me heavily dislike the author's characterization of her - as smug, arrogant, and hated by everyone, IIRC. Which I imagine some people like, but it was coming across to me as just building up for her to be harry's armcandy.
