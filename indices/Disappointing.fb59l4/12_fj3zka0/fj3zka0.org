I loved the fic when I first read it. I honestly don't know what you're going on about. It's better than most other fics. If you don't like it, then maybe you should look at some professional writing? Most fics are written by amateur writers just for fun in between going to school and/ or work. I don't understand why people expect to find the next Shakespeare or Tolkien on sites like fanfiction.net and AO3.
