IME, soulbond/soulmate is a trope that needs to be the focus for the fic to be any good. This does not mean it will be good, just that it becomes any other trope. Casual/off-hand use of it is basically “I can't write romance, but I need an excuse to write my terrible smut/live out my fantasies” Same as Lord Potter, really. It's either a dedicated Political!Harry story or “I don't want my OC wearing a Harry suit to face consequences, so he needs money and a Malfoy-like level of power”.
