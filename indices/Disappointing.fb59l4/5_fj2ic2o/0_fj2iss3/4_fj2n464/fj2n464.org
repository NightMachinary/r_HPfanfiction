She was the worst performing because of two understandable reasons. Firstly, while this isn't confirmed, I suspect she has a natural disadvantage at the very least and huge impairment in the second task as it is water task due to her Veela heritage. I wouldn't be surprised if this means she has a worse time then most people in water easily. That and the emotional response to a loved one being taking. This all causes her to lose faith in herself and believe she doesn't deserve to win. Victor, Cedric, and Fleur see that Harry is indeed in mortal peril, in which they seem to make a pact to protect Harry as much as possible. Didn't see get out of the last task because she was being tortured by Victor? In which case probably is out of her control. I'd like to add in canon the first task performance was easily hers.
