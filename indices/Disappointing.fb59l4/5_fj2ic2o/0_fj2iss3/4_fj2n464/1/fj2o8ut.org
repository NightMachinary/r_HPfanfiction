The Veela heritage thing is fanon and the other champions have done nothing to suggest they made a pact to protect Harry. I think you're confused between the books and fan fiction. Both Cedric and Viktor left Harry at the bottom of the lake without looking back after getting their hostages, while Harry was the only one concerned about them. Cedric left Harry to go his own way even after being held under the Crucio curse and speculating Viktor got to Fleur too. Neither one of those actions screams "hey, we should look out for this kid!" to me. They didn't make a pact.
