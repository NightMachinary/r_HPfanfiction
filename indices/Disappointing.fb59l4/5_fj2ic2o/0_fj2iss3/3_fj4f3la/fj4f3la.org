Canon is a mix of good and bad, and you can't look at specific actions/performances to judge the capabilities of the characters. For instance, Dumbledore in canon can easily be seen as a complete idiot and incompetent, whereas the character is clearly meant to be much better than that - because the plot (particularly the early ones) needs to deliberately end up with Harry & his friends solving everything.

Fleur and the other champions are a victim of that - we see very little of them, and they can't be any better than Harry, because then he wouldn't have a chance and it'd be boring.

What we /do/ know from Fleur is that she's smart & competent, good with charms (enough to put a dragon to sleep), and a bit full of herself. The most common fanon perspective of her that I've seen, far more than anything else, is to turn her into a complete meme that just throws her allure around and is incompetent at everything else, which is just boring and shit.

Fleur's a character I've always wanted to read good characterizations of (and not just because she's the only french character around Harry's age :P ), but it's hard to find.
