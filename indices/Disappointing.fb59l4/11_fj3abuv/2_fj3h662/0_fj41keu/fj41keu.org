Not entirely sure what you just said but I'm pretty sure it's 99% better than the other things out there.

Some of the 'clich√©s' actually came from this fic. There's a new fic called International tri-wiz tournament or something that's quite popular. It's an almost copy of a cadmean victory, not that that's a bad thing. What with Slytherin's mentoring Harry (though here it's through books rather than a portrait, I believe)/the rituals being done/delving into spell theory and creation, the whole retreating into the CoS,...

I feel like the fic is quite original and I'm pretty sure it's better than anything WE could put out there.
