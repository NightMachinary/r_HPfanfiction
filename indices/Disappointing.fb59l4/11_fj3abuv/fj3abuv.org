How f'ing dare you. That fic will always hold a special place in my heart since it's the first serious and completed HP fanfic I've eve read.

The quality of the writing gets a lot better the farther you get in. I guess you can actually see the author's skills improving the longer you read.

Are there some clich√©s? Yes. But take a look at the age of the fic and that won't surprise you.

What's so awesome about this fic to me is Harry's character progression. His maturity, magic, feelings, ... I love how you can read about him becoming more powerful every chapter through study and experience untill that final duel with Voldemort. Not to say the other fights aren't good because they are, they're incredible.

This fic has a lot of pro's imo: believable romance, character progression, exciting action, ...

The author also dared to take these ballsy decisions that I haven't seen in any other fic and go his complete seperate direction.

But it's one of those fics that you either love or hate. Personally I can't read methods of rationality or emperor.
