How the hell am I being salty xD? I literally just outlined why I like the fic while acknowledging its flaws. I'm sorry I was under te impression that this was a thread where we can argue about the fic's quality not just a 'everyone shit on this fic' thread.

While the fic isn't superb like 'the lie I've lived' or 'a black comedy' it's definetly in that 1% of fics category that have actual decent writing, is finished and imo quite good.
