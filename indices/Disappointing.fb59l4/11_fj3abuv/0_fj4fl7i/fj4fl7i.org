Don't start with 'how f'ing dare you' if you want to have a reasonable discussion, I'd suggest.

Anyways, I really struggle to see Harry's 'maturity' as a pro of that story. Because at the start? He's far less mature than canon. I remember this one had Ron do some soul searching, go up to Harry to honestly apologize for being an ass, and then Harry freaking out.

Like, "'You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.'" is /not/ something mature to say to a friend lol. It's a super immature way of handling things.
