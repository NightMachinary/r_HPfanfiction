You're right. When I mentioned his maturity I was speaking about the 'progression' of his maturity. I failed to clarify that. From the angsty kid that said things like you quoted to someone who sacrificed himself for someone he loved the most. Or sacrificing the consciousness of his mentor for the school he loves and protect those inside it. Even if he feels the majority of its inhabitants have slighted him at some point.

Not sure if you expect a 14-year old to act mature though? When I was 14 I didn't speak to my parents for 3 days and I can't even remember why. Probably something stupidly trivial.

But since Harry has been through abuse maybe he should be mature before his time?

Then again if you haven't bothered reading past the beginning phases of the story you won't have read those parts. I feel like this story is a good example of an author getting better the more he/she writes.

Also the reason I started like that was to open with a 'lighthearted joke'. Next time I'll add an 'xD' or 'lol' for all you sour lots. I didn't anticipate the amount of toxicity there'd be though. Seems like when someone starts a thread for the sole reason of bashing a fic they can't handle a different opinion.

Whatever though. Let's drop the subject.
