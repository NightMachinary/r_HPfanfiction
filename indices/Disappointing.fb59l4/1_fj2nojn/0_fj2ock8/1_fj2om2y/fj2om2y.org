Here's the ffn description “The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.”

And the first chapter or so is him being angry about wormtail. It seems like the author quite literally “lost the plot”. I wanted to like it because it's a novel length slow-burn Harry/fleur, which is my favorite fan fiction thing ever. But nope. It was just too shit. The reason people like it I think is because it's long and finished. Do yourself a favor, read linkffn(when a Veela cries) instead. It's not finished but it's ducking amazing.
