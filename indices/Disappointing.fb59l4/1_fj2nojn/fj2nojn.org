Love Harry/fleur, I actually like her characterization in that fic. I couldn't finish it either though. Like, the whole premise is “Harry is pissed that wormtail got away, and vows to get wormtail back and prove serious innocent next time” and then he runs into wormtail, and JUST FUCKING KILLS HIM! Like, any other death eater he could have killed, but he just fucked the whole reason for the story
