You will sadly find that many of the most reviewed, bookmarked, recommended stories to be quite crap. There is lot of bad writing that just seems to appeal to many.

Strangely, very often (but not always) better the story, less popularity it has. Good writing is slow, takes time to build up the plot, flesh out characters, avoids the usual popular tropes / cliches. And therefore tend to be more boring at the start.
