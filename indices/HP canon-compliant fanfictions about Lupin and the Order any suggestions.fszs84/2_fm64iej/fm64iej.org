I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279/][Still Life With Skull]] by TheDivineComedian, and I think it's one of the best canon-compliant interpretations of Lupin's ride in on the Hogwarts Express at the start of Harry's third year.

TheDivineComedian has written many great Lupin-centric fics. I second the recommendation for their fic "Calibration".
