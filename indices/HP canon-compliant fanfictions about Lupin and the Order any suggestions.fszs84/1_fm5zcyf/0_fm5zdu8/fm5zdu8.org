  Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and werewolves can't be trusted to fall in love. He's always believed that. As the Second Wizarding War begins to play out around him, he begins to have feelings for a clever, funny and talented Auror. And she has feelings for him too. Follow Remus through the gathering storm of war as he tries to piece together a life for himself despite the dangers around him, the death of his last best friend, and the effects of being in love for the very first time.This is not going to be a traditional romance. It is a story of love and werewolves, of learning to fight like a Muggle and to trust in himself. The story follows Remus from halfway through Order of the Phoenix to the end of Deathly Hallows. It's canon-compliant. I skim over the scenes we see from Remus in the books, but they can all be assumed to happen exactly as written. Major character death is for those already described in the books.
