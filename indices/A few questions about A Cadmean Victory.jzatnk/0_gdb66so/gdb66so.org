I read it earlier this year and my advice to all who are wavering on whether or not to read it is: do not. I guess it's a decent story if you're really interested in romance, but if you've got any quality requirements, it's mediocre at best.

Here is a list of the worst flaws:

1. The only surprise the plot offers is how unoriginal it is. It's as if a divine force makes the plot follow the Stations of the Canon so that not even the biggest changes in characters' actions have consequences.

2. There are so many anticlimaxes that all tension evaporates.

3. The main characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable.

4. A very large portion of the text is simply filler that exists just because the writer wanted to give the readers something to read even when nothing important happens. I guess it was tolerable when the chapters were posted one by one, but reading the whole story in one go becomes quite a nightmare.

So, if you absolutely want to read the A Cadmean Victory, read the remastered version, because the original needs remastering so badly, and apparently the writer agrees.

To answer your second question, A Cadmean Victory begins at the same time as GoF and (if I remember correctly) ends around the same time as HBP, that's 521k words in three years.
