It is a completed story. Meaning you can expect that at whatever point it ends it will make sense to end it. Be that 2 weeks after it started or 300 years. Measuring it by if all Hogwarts years are written about is a very weird approach in my opinion. I mean, there are very high quality fics with 300k+ words that play in a couple weeks...

To the other question: it had its lengths from what I remember, so I can see how a remastered version could be nice. But not to a point where I would wait like a year for it to be finished.
