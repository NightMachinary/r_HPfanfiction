I'm measuring in number of years covered because stories that stretch such short periods of time over so many words generally have an incredibly large amount of inane detail (or philosophising) to them that I don't care to read.

This could be different for some romance or angst or thriller fics but I'm here for adventure and world building and those kinds of things evolve over a larger period of time. I'm also looking for the characters learning magic and if they can match Dumbledore after 1 year then the sorry just strikes me as ridiculous.
