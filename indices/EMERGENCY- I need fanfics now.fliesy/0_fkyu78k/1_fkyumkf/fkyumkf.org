Its only 2.2 million which isnt as bad as the total word count of the Xcom series by Xabiar (check that stuff up i got so attached to those characters. This man is basically R.R.Martin) so when i wake up at like 11 tomorrow ill read it and finish it by midnight. Just asking but is it complete as i dont want to read all of that to be left on a cliff hanger.
