The writing in this series (as in certain specific turns of phrase) is so so good that I almost couldn't stand it - Im reading it for the second time and I'm a quarter way through the final one and I've actually stepped away from it for a bit because I don't want it to end. It also has quite possibly my all time favorite depiction of Pansy Parkinson.
