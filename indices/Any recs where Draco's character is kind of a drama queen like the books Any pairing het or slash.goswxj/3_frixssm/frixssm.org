For Drama Draco, I have to recommend /The Secret Language of Plants/. Linkao3(9323225)

From the author's notes:

#+begin_quote
  The file for this fic is called “Depressed Harry and socialist Draco.docx” because all I wanted at first was to write an angry blonde anarchist Draco. I have no idea how it took me so long to reach this point.

From part 3 of the series:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, Draco” Sirius said [...] “It has been said, and I believe it is a gross exaggeration, but nevertheless it has been said that we the Blacks have a certain tendency towards uncontrolled emotionality.”

  Who said that? What kind of vermin would say that? Draco was the Master of Temperance! He was Restrain and Control. He knew just how to keep a cool head at all times! He would show them! Aaargahffg.

This is the quintessential Drama Draco, as far as I'm concerned.
