Okay well.... That depends. I have one going that's a dramione. It's only on 56k but I have another 68k written and awaiting edits. So it'll be a while until it's finished. It's updated on the weekend and mid week. I have been told they both act true to their character in reviews by a couple of people so you can give it a shot.

Takes place after the battle of Hogwarts. Hermione tricks Draco into a deal as her potions apprentice. It focuses mainly on world building and their new lives. No grand evil so not overly exciting. More slice of life feeling.

The other one I can think of is linkffn(isolation by Bex-Chan) but most people have read it.

My dark horse is linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina)

Edit: I hope it's kosher to suggest my own.
