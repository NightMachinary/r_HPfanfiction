There's no loneliness any more in [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]]; Harry and Ginny share their minds and senses and memories. I initially thought that the soul-bond premise threatened to be too saccharine, but the author actually did quite a good job of making it two-edged. For example, Mr and Mrs Weasley struggle for a long time with the idea that their ten-year-old daughter is essentially married (since her entire life is shared with Harry now), and it puts a lot of strain on their relationship with both Ginny and Harry. Not to mention that the children have /too much magic/ when they hold hands, putting them in danger of seriously hurting or even killing someone if they lose their temper; they come within a hair's breadth of unintentionally reducing Draco to a pile of ash.

Also, I lied; they can still feel isolated if magic knocks one of them unconscious... (BIG spoiler alert) or petrifies one of them.
