"Welcome class. Unfortunately, we are short on teachers, especially muggle knowledgeable ones. Voldemort killed a good number of them las year, including our dear Professor Burbage," Professor McGonagall lowered her head, "So, rest assured, we got what we could. Without more to add, I want you to give a warm welcome to your new Muggle Studies teacher, Professor Dursleys," professor McGonagall sighed.

A beefy man stood in the Great Hall, twitching his walrus moustache.

"But, he's a muggle!" A voice wailed from the Gryffindor table. It was Hermione.

"And one of the few who can come here without breaking the Statute of Secrecy, for Professor Dursley is quite aware of the existence of wizardkind and has been so for many years."

"He's a horrible man!" Hermione yelled.

"Meh, We've had worse," said Seamus, with a shrug.

"That's debatable," protested Ginny.

"Enough! Mr Dursley is now a member of this staff and should be treated with respect." Said Professor McGonagall. "Now, Professor, some words?"

Vernon Dursley cleared his throat, "Ehm, Yeah. Listen, you, I don't like you and you won't like me. But they promised to pay me well to tell you about drills and some gubbins, so here I am. I will have anything... funny... going on in my class, or I'll see to discipline. The caretaker already offered to help me with that, a good man, ugly as he is."

Filch nodded in the back, a wide smile came to him.
