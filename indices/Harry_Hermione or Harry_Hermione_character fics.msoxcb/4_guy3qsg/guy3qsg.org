It has a Harry/Hermione/+pairing, though that isn't a big part of the plot. (In fact, it's actually rather small, all things considered.) Fic is mostly about Harry coming into his own, throwing off the effects of a childhood with the Durselys and the machinations of the Elder Wand and its puppet, Albus Dumbledore. (Chapter 19 has my self-contained origin story for the hallows, also a good spot to see if you like my writing style.)
