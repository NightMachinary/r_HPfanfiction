I usually really don't comment on the language or spelling of a post because I am hardly perfect in english writing either. But this time it is impossible to ignore it. There is a reason why languages have punctuation marks. The reason is so that a text becomes readable. You should really use them.

I tried three times to understand what the heck you mean with your prompt. It was impossible because half of the time it doesn't make any sense with how your sentences are.
