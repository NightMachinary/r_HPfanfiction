Prophecy, mainly. Possibly Snape, if his mark reacted to Voldemort's death. If you're asking how Dumbledore knew it was the Killing Curse specifically, well, there's a couple logical reasons. Spell residue, priori incantatem if the wand was left behind, just plain assumption because that was Voldemort's trademark spell.

Of course none of these are actually canon, because we don't GET an answer in canon, aside from Harry's dreams. We as readers know it was the killing curse from Harry's dreams, with the flash of green.

Aside from that, anyone looking for certainty is SOOL.

EDIT: there's also the idea that it was contextual. Lily and James were killed by the Killing Curse, Voldemort wasn't likely to change spells on a whim when one was working so well for him.
