  In the woods at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in Dartmoor, England, this effect was invoked by Amos Diggory by incantation on Harry Potter's wand, which had been wielded by Winky the house-elf, in order to determine who had conjured the Dark Mark over the campsite. - Harry Potter Wiki

It's an actual spell, it's just that brother cores amplify the effect tenfold, for whatever reason.

As for Voldemort's wand, well I have no idea. Another thing not mentioned in canon at all. If they had any sense they would have snapped the damn thing. Honestly never seen an object get plot armor before.
