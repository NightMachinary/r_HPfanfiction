Snape is the most likely explanation of how Dumbledore knew something happened, but not why he sent Hagrid to check on things rather than go himself. Though he could have gone later and seen how Harry's parents were killed to somehow guess that Lilly sacrificed herself trying to save Harry and caused Voldemort's spell to backfire creating the explosion.

Nothing really explains the missing day, why Dumbledore only left a letter for the Dursleys, and knew that blood magic would mysteriously protect Harry as long as he called their place home.

We simply have to face the fact that Rowling sacrificed explanations for symbolism.
