I think that Dumbledore, being nearly 100 years old at the time, had seen a great deal of inexplicable magic and given that he knew the prophecy, he might not have assumed that Harry was a corpse.

Not that he could have foreseen an infant surviving the killing curse, but that he'd been around and knew better than to assume anything.

ETA: That device in his office that was the subject of "in essence divided" in book 5. Was that something he put in place when Harry was an infant because of the prophecy?

ETA2: The trace was on baby Harry - did the Ministry know the magic was happening in the house?
