  has some... questionable qualities.

Thats a preference, which /will/ differ from person to person.

  Second, GRRM's books are rich in detail, but half of it is red herrings or simply irrelevant detail, while almost all small detail in Harry Potter foreshadowed an unfolding plot. I simply can't believe that GRRM is going to wrap up all the subplots he introduced in the series, many of which indeed led nowhere. He admitted that he wasted a lot of time trying to solve the "Meereenese Knot". And then you have subplots springing out of nowhere, like Aegon in ADWD.

I agree wholeheartedly, but atleast he doesn't have illogical institutions, ie Snape being a dick and still getting away with it. This could still be attributed to a racist and barbaric world of her creation, so I can't say much about this.

  To be honest, I seriously doubt GRRM is going to finish ASOIAF at all. Rowling, at the very least, knew how to meet deadlines. GRRM prefers writing about Handegg than writing ASOIAF - the last I heard he barely completed 200 pages of TWOW, and it has been four years since ADWD was released.

Fair concern, no doubt about it.

  but he is not a good writer.

Now, you are just running out of reasons to hate him. If he's not a "good writer", why do we even know his name as an author of a great book series?
