I just mentioned him because [[/r/asoiaf][r/asoiaf]] discover tiny details hinting at future events all the time. Sometimes it is full on tinfoil but other times they have some logical base.

I thought it would be a good comparison to show, forgetting to plan something and planning something books in advance.

And why I chose GRRM and not another author, is probably because I haven't read a popular book series except these two.

P.S. I may have leaked off some fanboy earlier and I must apologize for that.
