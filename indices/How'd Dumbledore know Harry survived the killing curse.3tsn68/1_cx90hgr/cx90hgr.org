I have a theory that Harry's room had a portrait which connected to another portrait in Dumbledore's office - or, alternatively, St. Mungo's (since Harry's ancestors invented some important healing potions). So, the portrait may have spread the story quickly. We see this usage of portraits at least twice in OotP.
