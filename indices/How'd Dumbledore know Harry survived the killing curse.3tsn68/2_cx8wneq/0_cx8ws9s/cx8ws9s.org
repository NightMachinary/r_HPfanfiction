That whole time line is messed up. My headcanon is that Dumbledore went first and checked things out, then called Hagrid in to attend to Harry. For this to be logical I assume that you don't use magical transport with babies, which I don't think is much of a stretch, seeing as how unpleasant it is for grownups. So Hagrid comes in to take him a more mundane way, til Sirius gives him his motorbike.

Also in a more logical world, Harry wasn't taken directly to the Dursleys, he was taken somewhere else for a day, which would account for the story spreading and everyone celebrating while McG is just chilling on a fence as a cat.
