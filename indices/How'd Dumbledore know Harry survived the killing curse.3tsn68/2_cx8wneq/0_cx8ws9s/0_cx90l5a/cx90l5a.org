  Also in a more logical world, Harry wasn't taken directly to the Dursleys, he was taken somewhere else for a day, which would account for the story spreading and everyone celebrating while McG is just chilling on a fence as a cat.

This is canon. Godric's Hollow isn't west of Bristol (which Hagrid passed on his way to Surrey), so I'd say Hagrid took Harry to a safehouse somewhere in Wales or West England - probably the Forest of Dean, where Hagrid (and Rowling) was raised. Yes, the same forest they returned to in DH - a book which had a recurring motif of returning to places previously visited in the series.
