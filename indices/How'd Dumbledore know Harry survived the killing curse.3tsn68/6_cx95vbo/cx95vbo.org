I'd imagine its just inferring. Voldemort primarily uses the Killing Curse to kill (that's pretty much all he uses in the books). Because of the prophecy, Dumbledore knew that LV was after Harry to kill him. After the whole debacle, he entered the Potter house to see James dead on the floor due to the killing curse. Up the stairs, Lily's dead from it too. But Harry isn't, and he's got a bleeding scar on his forehead. Also, magic leaves traces. I don't know exactly what that means, but perhaps Dumbledore could tell that the killing curse was used on Harry, or that Voldemort cast three killing curses in that home (and he's too good to miss). Maybe Dumbledore even got the memory of the attack from Harry and viewed in in a pensieve -- or viewed it straight via legilimency.
