Would it matter if he didn't disable the curse? Surely as an immortal with Mastery over Death it would be a non-issue.

Anyway, I hypothesize that merely having possession of the Cloak wouldn't be enough. The Wand has to be won, so I doubt the Cloak would change ownership to whoever picked it up. Either he'd have to purpose to keep it intentionally, thus being aware that he is stealing it from Harry, or James would have to have gifted, not loaned it.
