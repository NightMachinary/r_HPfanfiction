  Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain and discovers his human horcrux. Harry is allowed to live under the new regime. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
