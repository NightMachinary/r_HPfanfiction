The scene you described sounds similar to scenes in the following two fics:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - Harry discovers that he can affect the Dark Marks in chapter 5, and it becomes plot relevant on multiple occasions later on. linkao3(832559)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/][Blood Crest]] - Harry discovers that he can activate Dark Marks in the latest chapter. linkao3(22022296)

As for fics in which Harry himself is branded, here are two in which he eventually gets Marked after accidentally traveling back in time to the 1970s:
