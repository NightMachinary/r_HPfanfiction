[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089/chapters/16011331][Consuming Shadows]] has Harry getting marked by the dark lord, but it's not the dark mark. Lily Potter is also alive and Harry goes to Beauxbatons. It was recommend recently as a Harry-goes-to-other-schools fic, is why I'm reading it. It's currently up to chapter 45, I believe, and is getting updated roughly monthly. Edit: Harry is blackmailed into getting the mark around the 41st chapter. The end pairing is Harry/Voldemort but so far they hate each other.
