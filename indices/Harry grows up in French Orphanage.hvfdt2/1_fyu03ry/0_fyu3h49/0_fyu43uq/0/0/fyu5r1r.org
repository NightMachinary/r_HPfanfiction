Lol, putting him in an orphanage would just make him more vulnerable and you just contradicted your own comment. If they dont know anyone outside so why'd they put him there? What guarantees he wont be abused or killed on another reason? Or run away in his own accord and get killed in the process. If you're telling me theyll be sending someone to guard him in there, why not send someone to be his guardian and just grow up decently in another country? Lol
