That's a lot of assumptions. Why would you care if something is legal when you're trying for survival in a time of war? And if the French ministry does do an investigation. What are they gonna do about it? Send a boy back to a war torn country? Try to locate his parents who may or may not be alive by then? And when I said who would they trust I mean who would they trust to take him in? I thought you meant a friend already in the UK that will take him to another country. You need to clarify more as do I. I never said they'd know someone already there.
