I wasn't being sarcastic. I'm was actually curious how we would go around these things. And in the implication that they do charm the staff. What's to say they don't charm their own child to stay at the orphanage. Even yet place a protection that prevents certain malice around him?

I was using France as an example never said we couldn't pick any other nation.

And when you say send him back. Would another nation really risk sending their own to transport an orphan back to their country in the middle of a civil war? I would assume they wait it out. But then that begs to wonder what would happen with voldemort since harry is no longer there to rebound the curse. It pops up a long of questions. Where people just through in WBWL to at it. But in this case would Voldemort be the ruler or would it still be a draw between him a Dumbledore?

Some fics I've read had them already make a port key to another country before it got really bad. Even then, what's to stop them from discretely taking a ship or a plane? But then at that point. What's stopping them from staying in another country as refugees or saying that they are on an extended vacation?

I still don't know why you keep saying abuse or running away when I made it clear that they could use magic to stop that.
