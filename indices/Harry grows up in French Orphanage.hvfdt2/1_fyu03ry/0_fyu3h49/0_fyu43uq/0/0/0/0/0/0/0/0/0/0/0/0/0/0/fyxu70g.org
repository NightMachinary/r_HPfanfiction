Lol, i told you in the previous comments, you are overpowering protection charms. Certain other charms may be long, but its not fully to protect the person. Rarely the person. Now lets get back to your example, shall we? Blood wards doesnt protect harry, but home. Fidelis, secret, not harry but knowledge. Curse on the DADA, not person. For stronger charms, theyre usually shorter and abrupt, leaving the charmed in an after state after the spell is cast. Now if you are telling me such protection charm, will ever exist to protect harry prolly enough for a decade, then you should prolly look for another life to sacrifice for it. XD
