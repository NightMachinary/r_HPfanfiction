Lol, im just saying implications. Im clearly just asking but you decide to be sarcastic with me so hence im dropping you decent details you're clearly missing.

If they will be alerted, more so theyd be assigning anyone to guard the boy same time if they find it dangerous, more so theyd send him back surely. I think you dont know how politics work not to think to this extent.

Why france, not same country? Given they have more people to secure him in the same country and same time French ministry will highly be alerted with this actions. Either theyll help hiding him or will send him back. They wont even be able to bring Harry in france without notifiying its ministry unless ofcourse illegal ways which i highly doubt they will do or can do. Same time you mention how'd they transport, so back to you how should they transport him to france then?

Same case if theyd be able to send him to another country with some help, and if French ministry will help, its safer farther so why not somewhere farther? Japan has a decent magical school and is decently far he could get schooled there with help fron their ministry.

Case with him in an orphanage. How safe will he be? He gets charmed sure but what guarantees he wont overcomplicate things running away from orphanage. I think you can search enough that there is a high number of children who runaway from orphanages, gets abused in and after adoption.

And for asking why i care, i write few short stories in publication (although in another language) and a few fanfiction and do research before writing hence my question. But seems like you dont do much critical thinking. Lol
