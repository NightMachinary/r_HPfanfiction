Ahahhahahah which point? I pretty much think yours is drowning than standing. I never sited charms or jinxes itself wouldnt last long, i cited that if there was such a protection charm that could possibly last long, dumbledore would have put it with harry or Lily and James would have put it with him in canon. Even bloodwards from bond of bond was limited.

As for my previous comment: " For magic, you should clearly remember harry running away on book 3. If the bus didnt show up, who knows where harry would have been. Same as charming, howd you expect a charm for him to be forever protected and what charm would that be? Even dumbledore didnt think of that even with him in the dursleys." If you are referring to this comment then you plainly assumed by yourself without fully understanding the context here.

Im saying it never was an option in canon so how'd it be in FF? Im stating facts here however you're fully ignoring all my discussions cos you think i said such. XD
