You still haven't answer why magic protection wouldn't last that long. If you're so keen on details. Where does it say there's a limit on how long a protection spell could last. If any spell could last at least a few decades. I never even said it had to be forever.

And still just because I don't consider Fantastic Beast canon doesn't mean I'm missing a few details. It's in the same vein as people don't consider the Cursed Child canon. I enjoyed the books and the original movies. That's all the information I need for the stories I seek.
