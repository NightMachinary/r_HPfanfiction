Yes, portkeys are usable and illegal which i did explain that maybe another way but same time who will be bring him there? Which puts us into an explaining for the other details.

Fidelis isnt a protection charm. It is a concealment charm that no one will know the secret unless divulge by the keeper.

For that charm dumbledore did was just another enhancement charm ONLY to add to the already existing blood of bond. Also you are over powering that charm. The charm dumbledore used with the dursleys was only for additional protection on the blood of bond which already exists in the first place after petunia accepted harry into their home and only adds protection to the home. Not Harry, only the house. Harry wont be harmed by death eaters within those 4 walls as long as he treats it his home for 17 years. It prevents death eaters going to their doorstep but it doesnt precent him from non death eaters like magical creatures, other wizards or even muggles killers.

At the same time, blood of bond is an ancient magic which requires a sacrifice of life in which lilys had to be sacrificed for that to happen. In this case, someone who loves harry deeply has to die for it to even happen. Unless ofcourse him being given in france also requires lily or james to kill themselves for it to happen.

Dumbledore also knew how abusive that home will be, he only chose it for the bloodwards nothing else.

Pretty much you should watch fantastic beasts for additional knowledge. You are lacking quite the details there. Lol.
