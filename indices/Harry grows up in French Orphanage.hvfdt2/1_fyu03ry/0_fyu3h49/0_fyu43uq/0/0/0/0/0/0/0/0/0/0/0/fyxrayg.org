Dude where does it say he put the Dursleys under Fidelis. We just establish that Dumbledore let it only to the blood wards and nothing else. I'm fully aware of what Lily's blood sacrifice does. I was using it as an example that we shouldn't be limiting the capabilities of magics. All those magics I had listed were examples of why we shouldn't be limiting it. I know Fidelis isn't a protection spell, never said it was. I was just point out that the charm could last for eons. So I ask again why wouldn't a protection charm last at least a few decades?

Back to the detail of who would transport him. We both established we don't know who would they trust. So since this is fanfiction we could say they could have a multitude of friends and or family in various parts of the world. The author then would have to establish why they are trusted with this role.

I had just said I don't consider Fantastic Beast canon. Why would I want those details like Nagini the snake woman? I'm sticking to books at the moment.
