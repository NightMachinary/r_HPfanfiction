I think you should redefine your own understanding of sarcasm.

Also saying he'd be sent back, first how do they send him first. Portkeys distanced in separate countries are clearly illegal but incase theyd be sending someone there with him to bring him. Next, muggle transpo, they'll need t be changing their names to travel and ofcourse with someone to bring him there, but who? If you've watched fantastic beasts, you'd clearly know travelling even in muggle way will still notify the ministry. Same thing with why settle on orphanage if that person who'd sent him can stay with him? And if he gets figured out, you clearly dont understand that certain ministry would like their business from themselves and not involve another unless completely agreed by both ministries.

For magic, you should clearly remember harry running away on book 3. If the bus didnt show up, who knows where harry would have been. Same as charming, howd you expect a charm for him to be forever protected and what charm would that be? Even dumbledore didnt think of that even with him in the dursleys.
