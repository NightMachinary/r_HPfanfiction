Well why can't we have a charm work for long lengths of time? We have Fidelis. The original blood protection harry had. The curse on the DADA position that lasted decades. You also keep confusing illegal with no ability to do. Death Eaters themselves can have portkeys even though they are supposed to be regulated. So really what's stopping them from making a portkey anywhere aside from legalities.

Dumbledore put a lot of stock in the Blood Wards being full proof. Maybe he thought if he added charms of his own it might interfere. Maybe he thought his own relatives would care for him like they should. Dumbledore didn't even bat an eye or ask Harry about life at home. So either he was very trusting of the Dursleys or he just cared that he was only alive and nothing else. This is the same man that thought it was better to fly a broom to a meeting instead of take the floo. The only real answer is JKR didn't think that far and this is a children's book.

I've never watch Fantastic Beasts. So as far as my own head canon is concerned it does not exist in this scenario.
