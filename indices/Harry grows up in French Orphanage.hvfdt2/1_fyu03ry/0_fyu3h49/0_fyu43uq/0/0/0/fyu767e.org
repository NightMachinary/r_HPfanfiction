How did I contradict the orphanage comment. Aside from the difficulties of transport. If they are gonna go through that much trouble what's to stop them from putting a few charms and compulsions to aid their son's survival? And still you're not addressing what friend will they fully trust. From that stand point charming the staff of a normal orphanage would be more safe. It'd be anonymous.
