Ahahahahah you should fix the way you commented then, its confusing. Same time as to why wouldnt a charm last long, there is but no such thing as forever protection charm. If it already exists, then they wouldnt have needed to put harry hiding in the first place.

Same thing if the author will put to bring harry to the orphanage, if such will ever exist, why put harry into an orphanage, not bring him and raise him decently while hiding.

Also if you dont wanna consider Fantastic beast canon, thats fine with me but even if the story is mutilating some facts, you can learn about cross ministry business and precautions for witch travel. Then you'd understand most of my point. XD
