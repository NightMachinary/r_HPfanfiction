I always envisioned that there would be some international competition between the schools. For example, magic schools competing to see which schools were the best with academic games. I am not sure if North, Central and South American schools would be able to compete with the European schools for the Triwizard tournament. Just because that seems to be something that is more traditional with the three biggest magic schools in Europe.

But I suppose for fanfic that is exploring the possibility, that you could make some sort of magical method for the American school to get to England. Beauxbatons used a huge carriage pulled by Abraxan horses and Durmstrang had a magic ship. I tend to find that Americans are very showy... and I don't mean that in a bad way.

They would definitely want to leave a good impression, but they would also like to show off.

I always imagined that there would always be some light competition between the Americans and Canadians, though. And my head canon dictates that there would be a magic school in Canada... And I feel that North American schools would have some sort of games to play against Central or even South American schools.
