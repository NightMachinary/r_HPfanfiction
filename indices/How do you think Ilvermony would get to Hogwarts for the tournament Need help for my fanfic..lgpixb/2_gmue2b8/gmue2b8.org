I think you can honestly justify basically anything - a carriage is not /really/ particularly french to me, nor is a ship German/Scandinavian/Balkan/Eastern European (depending on how one views Durmstrang). So from canon, not really a huge deal to go with whatever you think would make for a fun entrance.

If you want it to be particularly american, a bus or car would make some sense. Otherwise, you can work it inot what you think Ilvermony is compared to Hogwarts (eg - what's your major differences between the two? Then pick a mode of transport that emphasizes that the most).
