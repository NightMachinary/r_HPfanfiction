My initial thought is that they would arrive in flying cars. I feel like when Rappaport's Law was lifted, the wizards of America would be very interested in No-Majs and their inventions, and would probably adapt quite a few to magic. And since we've already seen magically enhanced cars in the series, why not?

But do I think Ilvermorny would be part for the Triwizard Tournament? Probably not.

The Triwizard Torunament has historically been held between Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons, which is stated many times throughout the books. It seems like it's a very European thing. That, and you have the name Triwizard (a trio of wizards), so even the name would have to be changed, which feels unlikely for something that has been around for centuries. Europe is big on traditions, after all.

There is however the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship, which is the setting of the Wonderbook: Potions game. In the game the competing schools are Hogwarts, Mahoutokoro, Koldovdtoretz, and Uagadou, but is never mentioned that it's only those schools competing. Maybe that could be something?

Alternatively, maybe create a whole new sort of competition? Maybe something between just Hogwarts and Ilvermorny, like an Old World vs New World sort of thing?
