[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]], sort of. Harry can, later on, eat magic. At the same time, he's smart enough and can see magic well enough that he can memorize the effects of a potion and apply the effects to water, thus giving him the ability to replicate any potion he's analyzed with a non-toxic substance. He can do similar things with enchanted items and spells.

If anything, it's more like he has a magical sharingan than the absorption ability.
