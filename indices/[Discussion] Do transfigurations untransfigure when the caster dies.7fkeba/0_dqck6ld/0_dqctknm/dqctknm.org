This is the answer for Transfiguration. As for Charms...

Contrary to most fanon, canon doesn't seem to distinguish between "enchanted" and "Charmed", treating them largely as synonyms. However, given that magically constructed buildings don't randomly fall down, and given that magical objects can be passed down through the generations, one assumes that there is a way to make Charms last long enough to outlive their caster.

That said, from the fact that the school brooms are faulty, we also know that Charms can deteriorate over time/with heavy use.

Making Charms last longer could just be casting them with superior skill. But equally there may be some special requirements.
