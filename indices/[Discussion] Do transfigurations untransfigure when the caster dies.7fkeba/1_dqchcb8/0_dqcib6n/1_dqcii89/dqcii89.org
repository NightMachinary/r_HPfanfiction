  If a wizards spell fails after death, does this mean they've got a constant connection to the spell while alive? Like, even after casting it, they're sort of... still pushing magic into it? Or do they just leave a sort of invisible layer of magic that maintains/is the charm and that magic disperses on death?

It likely depends on the spell. I doubt something like a Stunner or Body-Bind Curse require constant concentration. The Levitation Charm or Patronus, for example, likely require concentration.
