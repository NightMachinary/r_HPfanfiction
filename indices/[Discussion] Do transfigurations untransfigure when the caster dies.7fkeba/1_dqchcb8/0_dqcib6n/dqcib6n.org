I didn't think they did. I did recall the Slughorn story, but I'm always a bit wary of movie-verse titbits.

It does make me wonder, though. If a wizards spell fails after death, does this mean they've got a constant connection to the spell while alive? Like, even after casting it, they're sort of... still pushing magic into it? Or do they just leave a sort of invisible layer of magic that maintains/is the charm and that magic disperses on death? What other circumstances could make it fail? Loss of intention? Unconsciousness? Pure lack of will?

Also, I am now imagining some cheapskate who furnished their whole home with transfigured objects, and then they die suddenly and their unfortunate SO ends up suddenly sitting on a bare floor with a lapfull of tea and a few cheap odds ends because they were drinking out of a transfigured teacup, sitting on a transfigured chair, and had transfigured carpets.
