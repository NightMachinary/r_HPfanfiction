Some spells do seem to have a sustained effect, as opposed to a one-off one. For example, a stunner is a one-off effect, it stuns, whereas a levitation charm is a sustained effect, for obvious reasons.

I have no idea how exactly enchanted items tie into it, but at a guess they are made via a one-off spell that ties/binds/whatevs other spells or effects to them, and the enchantments failing with extended use may be about the binding becoming too loose for some reason (like because of energy flow, what with the fact that such items probably use ambient magic to work so it has to flow into them when they are used).
