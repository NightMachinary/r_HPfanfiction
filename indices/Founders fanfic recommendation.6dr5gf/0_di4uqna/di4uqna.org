Lol I practically live in that subfandom now! Some of my favourite short founder-era fics are:

- Letters of the Four Founders by Iris Chmal. This is a short, super hilarious, sort-of romance (RR/SS) story told through a bunch of letters and diaries. linkffn(1608189)

- The Fat Lady by Belldere, a funny one-shot describing the origin of the Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry and the portrait "Fat Lady". linkffn(9943175)

- Frozen Over by TheNextFolchart, which is also a funny one-shot. It features the origin of... well, you'll see :) linkffn(11436471)

- Some Strange Affliction by shadesofmidnightsun. This one-shot is THE fic that converted me to a GG/SS shipper. It focuses on the emotional developments of falling in love rather than physical admiration, and I think it totally deserves more attention. linkffn(11505141)

And then there are the longer founder stories like the ones by Izzyaro or Preciousann, but those are usually easier to find
