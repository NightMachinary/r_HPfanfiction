  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  The Dusley family, who value normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard. They treated him not amazingly well, no. But they treated him as a human being, a family member who had some kind of value, even if they didn't want him. And in that environment of not-love but not-hate, Harry grew. A Harry Gets Things Done fic.

  Why is it when you're drunk you come up with the greatest ideas! Well they aren't really great, especially when your father and his best friend, forget they did this and it comes back to bite you squarely in the ass. Thanks James, thanks Sirius. Marriage is a beautiful thing, when you are aware of it. But what happens when you're 15? HP/NM/AB Response to a whitetigerwolf challenge

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.
