Don't you think if Dumbledore really ate babies, he would have eaten baby Harry instead of setting him on the Dursleys' doorstep? I mean, /DUUUUH!/ That was just a waste of perfectly good baby meat (that is to say, it /would/ be, if you /were/, in fact, a baby-eater).

But knowing this fandom, a fic like that almost certainly exists somewhere. And, believe it or not, baby-eating stories are actually not against our sub's new rules.
