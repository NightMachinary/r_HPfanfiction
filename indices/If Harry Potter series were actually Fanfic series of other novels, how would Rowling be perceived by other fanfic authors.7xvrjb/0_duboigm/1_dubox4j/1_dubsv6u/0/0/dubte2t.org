Oh, right, I forgot about that Horcrux. Although I'm not sure Dumbledore yet realized that that's what Harry was.

Wow, I wonder what it would feel like to eat a Horcrux. I know most of them are inedible objects, but for those that /aren't/... like, let's say you ate Nagini. Let's say you fried 'er up into a nice juicy snake kebab. What would that taste like?
