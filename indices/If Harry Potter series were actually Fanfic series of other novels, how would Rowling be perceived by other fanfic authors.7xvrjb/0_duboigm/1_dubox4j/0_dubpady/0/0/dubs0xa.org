I wouldn't say that, if you think about it. He's extremely manipulative, everything he's done was to end Voldemort, and one of the only plans he actually failed was the one of him losing the Elder wand ownership to Draco. He's actually really fucking cunning and used Harry as a puppet all along and acomplished his goals, which was ending Voldemort.

Yes, he can be called a disgusting old manipulative man, but you can't say he wasn't capable of following and orchestrating and executing his plans. Remember everytime he gives Harry advice that will come in handy just later on the year, where you know Harry would be fucked otherwise. The Mirror, Fawkes, The Time Turner, his knowing that the blood Voldy took from Harry would be his undoing (if you don't remember that passage, it goes along these lines "And Dumbledore's eyes twinkled when he heard that" or smth like that, during Harry tale of the Third Task, you can check the books. Also, he knew from the get go that the only way to get the Ministry believe Voldy was back, was by shoving him to their faces, so he manipulated the events, somewhat, to generate a trap at the DoM, because if you think about it, why not simply destroy the prophecy and be done with it ? If only Harry NEEDED to hear, he could've told him whenever he wanted, but he needed Voldy to show up. And the rest is just his plans regarding the DH and ofc Harry's assisted suicide/sacrifice, his best manipulation ever, fucking over with Snape's mind and using guilt as his weapon, and forcing Harry to be the "good guy" and die for everyone.

If you really think about it, Dumbledore is a phenomenal character, but he's a disgusting manipulative person. Also, his "flawed philosophy" was followed perfectly, "The Greater Good" was actually achieved by sacrificing Harry's childhood and most of his life for killing Voldy. So yeah, I hate Dumbledore, but he's, in my opinion, the best character Rowling made.
