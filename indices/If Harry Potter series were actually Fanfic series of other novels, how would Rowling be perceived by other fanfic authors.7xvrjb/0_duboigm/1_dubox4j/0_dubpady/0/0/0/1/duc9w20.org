I didn't say that he should've told Harry as soon as possible, just that, if he didn't want to use the orb as a bait, he could've destroyed it, and tell Harry whenever he wanted. But he needed it for Voldy to show his ugly face to the world. IMO, he should've told everything to Harry as soon as possible, but then again, that wouldn't make sense with his plans, and would probably fuck everything up.
