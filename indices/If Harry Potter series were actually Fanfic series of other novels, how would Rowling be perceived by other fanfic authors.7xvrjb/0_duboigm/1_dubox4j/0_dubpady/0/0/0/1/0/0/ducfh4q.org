To be honest, its really hard to know what should've been done, if we were in Dumbledore's shoes, simply because hindsight is 20/20. We know how the story ends, so we know what should've been done, but we can't know what we would've done if we didn't. About the prophecy, I think telling him about after either second year or fourth year would've been the ideal, but definately not later, because just then Voldy was back, he was gunning to Harry (he fucking orchestrated Harry's inclusion in a tournament, with a 8-month plan just to kidnapp the kid, he's pretty obsessed) and he wasn't going to stop, so idk. There's argument to be made that he shouldn't ever tell him the prophecy because Voldy could've read from his mind, but like I said, its really hard to know how one would've acted in Dumbledore's shoes.
