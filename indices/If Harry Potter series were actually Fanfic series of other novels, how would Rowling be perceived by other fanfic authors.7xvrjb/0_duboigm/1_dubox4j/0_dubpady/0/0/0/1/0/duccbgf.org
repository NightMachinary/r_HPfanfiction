Telling a kid "hey, a maniac wants to kill you and you are going to be out savior by killing him!" seems both nonsensical and counter-productive.

I think he should have put some good watchers (Figgs is useless) for Harry's safety. Also, he should have trained him from young age under the pretense of "hero make-believe play" so that Harry gets strong without under the pressure of Voldemort. Yes, he might feel deceived when(or if) Dumbledore tells him the truth, but hey, Greater good, right?
