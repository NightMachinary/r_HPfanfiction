I assumed Dumbledore was scared about how much he thought he influenced Riddle, and was scared of making the same mistake.

He wasn't evil though, JK Rowling made a sure point in thr last few books to humanise Snape and Dumbledore, to be perceived as not bad or good caricatures, but instead human characters.
