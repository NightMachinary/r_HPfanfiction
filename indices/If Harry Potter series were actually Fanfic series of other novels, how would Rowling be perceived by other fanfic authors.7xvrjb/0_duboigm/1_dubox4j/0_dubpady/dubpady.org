Don't you know??? Dumbles is obviously the most evil character. He set up Harry to fight Voldemort at the age of 1 so that he could land the final blow and secure access to the never before mentioned Potter family vault, as well as enduring fame, nvm the fact he single handedly defeated grindalwald, head of the countries most prestigious school, and is the head of the chief judicial bunch of local government, which he obviously uses his powers to get away with blantent abuse of poor orphan children. /s
