  “You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”

  “Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”

  “Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” /[that moment, when even Severus fucking Snape is your moral superior]/

  “Meaning?”

  “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter ---”

  "But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”

  Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, “well ... I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry's best interests at heart ---”

  “He's not your son,” said Sirius quietly.

  “He's as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?”

  “He's got me!”

  “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?”

  “Fred --- George --- NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley shrieked.

  Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.

  “FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE WAS NO NEED --- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS --- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!”

  “Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. “Should've realized you didn't want to be disturbed. I'll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.”

If the books came out as fanfiction today people would complain about all the Dumbledore and Weasley bashing in them.
