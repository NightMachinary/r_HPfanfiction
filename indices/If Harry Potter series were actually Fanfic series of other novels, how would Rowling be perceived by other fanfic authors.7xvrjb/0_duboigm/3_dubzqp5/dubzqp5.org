Since when is Molly likeable, or Arthur for that matter? Molly suspected that Harry was abused in CoS and considered rescuing himself but afterwards, all is forgotten besides a few empty words and she watches as Harry is sent back to abusive relatives, bemoaning them occasionally and yet never doing anything of consequence. As a victim of an abusive half-brother, let me tell you that saying you care and not backing it up hurts a lot more than simple indifference. All Molly did was sent food when Harry was starved, instead of you know, actually doing anything about it.

And Arthur is the incarnation of incompetence. Hogwarts has a library so independent study is a known concept in the magical world. And yet, in a decade of working with Muggle Artifacts, he never even got a basic tome to look things up. I know that it was supposed to be funny, but Rowling overdid things and funny became moronic.
