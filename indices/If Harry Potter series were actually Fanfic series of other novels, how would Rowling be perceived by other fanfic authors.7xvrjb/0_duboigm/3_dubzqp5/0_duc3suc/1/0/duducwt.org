A shrieking harpy who infantilizes her adult children doesn't seem much better. Maybe Harry should pick the unreliable werewolf who eventually almost leaves his pregnant wife behind or the manipulative old geezer that ruins Harry's life as role models? Let's face it, Harry is shit out of luck when it comes to adult role models, they are all trash... At least Sirius has some legitimacy and is not just forcing himself into Harry's life.
