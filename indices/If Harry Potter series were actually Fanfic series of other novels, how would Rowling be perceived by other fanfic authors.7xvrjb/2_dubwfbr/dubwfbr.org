  I have seen many fics that I honestly feel much better written than Rowling herself.

Do you have a rec for this? Because while I have liked certain fics better than canon, they're a matter of preference than actually feeling like they were of higher quality. I've never actually come across a fic that captures the magic and whimsy of Rowling's HP.
