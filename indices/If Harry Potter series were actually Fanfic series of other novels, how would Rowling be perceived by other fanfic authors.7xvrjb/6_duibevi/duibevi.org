There are fanfics that address and satisfy Rowling's plotholes and weaknesses better. Making them appear better than the actual canon novel. But "appear" is key. Cus they are based off of Rowling's character/setting/world foundations and their strengths based off Rowling's weaknesses. Thus, without the original canon, these fanfics wouldnt make sense.

Example 1 would be fics that fix the triwizard tournament to something that would actually be enjoyable to watch. ie not staring at the surface of a lake for an hour. But a lot of these fics are working off the base knowledge and interest the readers already have in the triwizard tournament. Many fanfics will also throw in jokes referencing the canon tournament's faults that wouldnt make sense or be funny without the reader's interest in the canon tournament.

Example 2 would be fics that brilliantly point out Dumbledore's manipulations and do an exceptional job of having the fanfic characters confront Dumbledore's negative sides. A fanfic would be considered higher quality if it did this in a better fashion than a less-well written fanfic pointing out the same flaws. However, readers enjoy this cus they see the wrongs of canon righted. Without canon's mistakes, they wouldnt care about Dumbledore being brought to justice

Although, i think those invested in the fanfic world develop a whole set of fanon characterization/background/setting/magical world. Thus, they can appreciate references to the fanon world rather than the canon world. Such as fics that dont really establish Evil!Dumbledore, but readers are still able to follow and sympathize with anti-dumble characters due to having read previous fics where Evil!Dumbledore is better developed and established
