Well, that is hard to say since what many appreciate most is not her writing, but the world she built for us to dive in. I would like her "fics" for including a lot of everyday life and for having plot lines that are independent from the main plot. I would not love her characters however, since many lack depth and the plot holes (time turners...cough) would make me a little crazy.
