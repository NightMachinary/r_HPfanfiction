  I have seen many fics that I honestly feel much better written than Rowling herself.

Not "much better", but better. Rowling's series would still be a very good fanfic: The books are well edited (pacing!), there's no typos and grammatical errors, they are finished (not abandoned) and have some semblance of plot, characters and themes.

If a Fanfic hits all these points it's probably already way above average... maybe >80%?

And then there's the fact that it is easy to forget all the groundwork those fics that may be "better" rely on. Would they be just as good without all those established characters and worldbuilding to fall back to? It's a very iterative process and very doable to just omit some of Rowling's mistakes to become better, but it's a bit unfair competition.
