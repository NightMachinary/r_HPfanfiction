2 things that I feel she is great at. Characters that are well built and overall realistic. (not perfect but believable. The characters grow, are memorable and are not perfect.)

Second, a world that is fun and brings out the wonder that is the strong point of the booka. The world is really cool.

Not as good stuff, the systems are flawed. Quidditch makes near 0 sense as many of us know. Magic system is not perfect. Parts of school don't make sense etc.

The plots are not perfect as well. It well written and fast enough but something are just too perfect. Like voldermort not putting a horcrux in some mad impossible to find place or overseas or something. The plots could be better.
