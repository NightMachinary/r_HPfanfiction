Hmm, tough to say.

Personally, I think Rowling would be viewed as an overall good writer, though terrible at large-scale world-building, forming a coherent and consistent magic system, and biased against Slytherin. Rowling's Universe would feel too small, even if the magical world is much smaller than the non-magical. There would also be a lack of nuance for many topics, especially for the first two or three instalments. People would criticise the minute details as well - some harsher than others.
