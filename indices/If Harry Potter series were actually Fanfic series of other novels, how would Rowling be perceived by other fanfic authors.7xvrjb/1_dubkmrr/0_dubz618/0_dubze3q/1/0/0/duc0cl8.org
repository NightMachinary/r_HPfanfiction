Snape being on the good side was not some sudden out of place decision. It was foreshadowed from Book 1 itself. Draco also not being as bad as he seemed was a plot point in Book 6. Both their turn-arounds are also important to Rowling's overarching themes of love and choice.

As for the pairings, I don't like them either but the groundwork for both was also present well before DH.

So none of these are sudden developments. They were all culminations of clues Rowling had scattered throughout the books. They're also YA novels, and a lot of stuff (eg: incompetent adults) are tropes; you're reading it like it's dystopian fiction.
