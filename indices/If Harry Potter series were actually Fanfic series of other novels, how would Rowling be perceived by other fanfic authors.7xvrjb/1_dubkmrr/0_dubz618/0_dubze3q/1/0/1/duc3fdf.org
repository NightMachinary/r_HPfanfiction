Right. Rowling paints a pretty grim picture of the Magical World (biases, corrpution, backwardness) and ends with a scene where it is shown and told that /nothing/ has changed, except that everyone is older and has children. Slytherin's are still evil scum (though Harry doesn't care if Albus ends up there!!1111), Magicals disregard Muggles (and probably Muggleborns too), Draco smirks and the steam engine makes "toot toot".

I wouldn't even have blinked an eye if they somehow re-elected Fudge, now that the Dark Lord crisis is over.
