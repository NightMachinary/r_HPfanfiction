Lets see, Snape is a hero (one good deed does not wash away half one and a half decades of bad ones) , Draco is not locked up, Ron can assault muggles and commit fraud Scots free and neither of the main pairings has sufficient buildup to be believable (it could have been done better, but as it stands there is very little to make Ron/Hermione come across as believable since their shown characterisations do not match well).
