Everyone in DH was a moron. The Good side rarely fighting to kill, the whole camping trip, abandoning Grimmauld in the first place, not killing Voldemort before all Horcruxes were gone (invisibly cloak and a simple dagger would do), a married man needing a seventeen year old virgin to save his marriage, not showing a single indication that Ron/Hermione would work (there was one in HBP), having a frontal assault against a fortified hilltop position work, Draco is let off free for at least three counts of attempted murder, terrorism and war crimes while Snape is suddenly a hero.

If the final installment of your series has everyone taking moron pills in order for the plot to work, you are doing something wrong.
