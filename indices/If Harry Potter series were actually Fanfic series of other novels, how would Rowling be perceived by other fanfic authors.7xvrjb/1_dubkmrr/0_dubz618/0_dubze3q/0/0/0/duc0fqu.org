So you think solving any of the logistical problems you have with the 'realism' of the book would be made it a better story.

Not that I'm ceding any of those points to you. I'm just curious if you think, for example, having a full on insurrection in the main part of society in the background of the plot about the trio would make the book better? Ignore that that's not how people act during the rise of fascist governments which is what this book parallels. Do you think the book would be better with that?

Edit: Hell, forget that. Do you really think it would be a better book if there was a successful assassination attempt against the primary antagonist before the climax? Even if you go by internal logic alone, who the hell is supposed to think up the plan "I'm gonna put on an invisibility cloak and stab Voldemort in the chest."? The only person crazy enough was mad-eye and he'd kill someone for a plan that stupid. Voldemort is evil and powerful and scary, and he's discovered and performed magic that nobody else understands. Are you willing to bet your life that he cant see through invisibility cloaks, that his skin can be penetrated by knives, that he doesn't have super hearing, that Nagini can't sense you, that he doesn't have a body double and that he doesn't have some people standing by with some bone of the father, flesh of the servant and blood of the enemy?
