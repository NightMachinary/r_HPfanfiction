I think you'll find I didn't say you couldn't make a story about that. But a satisfying ending to the Harry Potter series is Harry defeating Voldemort. An entirely separate story could be crafted around that premise, but it's not the story that starts with "yer a wizard, Harry." That beginning makes a promise to the reader that the protagonist will defeat his enemy or die trying.
