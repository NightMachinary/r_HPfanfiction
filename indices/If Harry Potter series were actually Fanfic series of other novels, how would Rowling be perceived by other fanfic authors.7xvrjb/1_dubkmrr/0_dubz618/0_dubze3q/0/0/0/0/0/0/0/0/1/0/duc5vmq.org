I feel like being strawmanned a little bit. I'm not saying that a story absolutely *has* to go this route. Simple stories can be great! I primarily objected to the notion that a (popular) fantasy story has to do the whole 'defeat the big bad' thing as the final conclusion.

In particular in Harry Potter it was a mistake because the narrative isn't framed in a way where Voldemort can be blamed for everything. For example in LOTR Sauron is a corrupting influence and everything and defeating him basically fixes most of the problems. It makes sense and is satisfying. Killing Voldemort for good fixes none of the big substantial problems, just some of the immediate and most pressing ones.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters are most often compared to WW2 and it seems as if that comparison was intended by JKR. Imagine if Germany had no Nuremberg Trials, no radical change in society and culture and just returned to the Weimarer Republic as it was before Hitler came around. Germany was ripe for the taking by Hitler and just assassinating Hitler wouldn't have magically solved all the problems Germany (or the rest of Europe - it's not as if just Germany was somewhat unstable) was facing.
