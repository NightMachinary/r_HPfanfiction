That's not a plot twist. It doesn't change the plot. It lowers the stakes for the protagonist if you don't bring him back for the final battle. And if you bring him back, it was just an unnecessary subplot. Any editor would tell you to cut it. There's more to story craft than describing a series of events. Rowling gets that, and I don't think you do.
