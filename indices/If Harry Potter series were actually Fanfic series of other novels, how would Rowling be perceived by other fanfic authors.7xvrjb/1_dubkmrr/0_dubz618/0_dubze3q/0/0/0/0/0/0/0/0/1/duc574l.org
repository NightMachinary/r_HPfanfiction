The Thrawn trilogy is "popular" at best. Now, "Return of the Jedi" (in fact, the whole OT) is /extremely/ popular.

And that is the story with the satisfying narrative. "Realistic" fiction doesn't appeal to everyone as much, and also often is better in the context of another work - say maybe the Star Wars OT?

Which is why a lot of fanfiction is popular in the first place, for example robst is immensely popular - but I doubt he would succeed in writing original fiction, because his works are enjoyed mostly in the context of the original books

To make my point more clear: "Realism" appeals to certain people, yes. But it often isn't narratively satisfying.

Rowling will sacrifice everything (worldbuilding, characterization, realism, ...) for a good story if she feels like it helps her story.

And if you don't like that, that's fine! Try other authors, GRRM comes to mind, and many other authors as well - but it simply not the focus of JKR. She prefers her neat wrapping up with "realistic" (grimdark) endings.
