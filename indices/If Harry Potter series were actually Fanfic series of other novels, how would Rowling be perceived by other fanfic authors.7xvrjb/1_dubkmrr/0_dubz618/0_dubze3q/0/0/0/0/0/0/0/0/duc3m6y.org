  if you avoid all the tropes of fantasy, the readers who came for fantasy won't stick around too long

Isn't the Thrawn Trilogy in Star Wars extremely popular? Isn't it exactly about how not everything will magically be okay just because the Imperator and Darth Vader are gone?

I think it's extremely interesting to think about systemic issues instead of focusing on getting rid of the big bad. Magical Britain is a very dystopic society and ripe for the taking by anyone devious enough to take advantage (Fudge, Crouch, Malfoy, Voldemort). Voldemort is a symptom, not the problem. There's no reason to leave fantasy tropes behind...
