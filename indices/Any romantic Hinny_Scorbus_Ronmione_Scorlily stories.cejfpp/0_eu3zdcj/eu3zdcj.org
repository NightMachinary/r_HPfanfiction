for some great Scorbus, id recommend starlightpeddler's The Quietly series, starting at Hogwarts and going through to wedding and kids. And LittleRose13 has a series called I Knew It All Along, currently 2 stories but shes writing a third. As for Hinny, id recomend jenoramas California Dreamin', or anything Floreat Castellum and gryffindormischief writes, the latter esp for one shots. Enjoy!!
