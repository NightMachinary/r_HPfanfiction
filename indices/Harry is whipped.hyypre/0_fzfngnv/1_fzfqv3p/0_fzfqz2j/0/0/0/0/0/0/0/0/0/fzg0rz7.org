"I asked you not to bring her here," Ron said to his best man.

"She's my girlfriend, and this is a wedding. Who was I supposed to bring? Rit Skeeter?" Harry complained.

"You know what mate? You might think that sounds like way more awful than this, but it doesn't really."

"Oh, come on, Ron."

"It's Dolores fucking Umbridge, Harry!" Ron shouted, "You brought Dolores Umbridge to my wedding!"

"You said I could bring a date,"

"Not her! It's Hermione's wedding too! And people are telling me Umbridge kept mumbling '/Here comes the Mudblood, here comes to Mudblood/' through the entire bridal march!"

"Well, it sounds bad if you say it like that!"

"And how did it sound to you?"

"Oh forget it. She's happy because I announced that she's officially my girlfriend, and that's all that matters," Harry said, "Besides, I'm so getting it tonight!" he said giddily.

"IT. IS. MY. WEDDING!"

"And what? It's not like you and Hermione have the monopoly on sex or whatever. Besides, we already had a head start, earlier, on the banquet table!"

Ron was dumbfounded, "YOU WHAT?! I ate from there already!"
