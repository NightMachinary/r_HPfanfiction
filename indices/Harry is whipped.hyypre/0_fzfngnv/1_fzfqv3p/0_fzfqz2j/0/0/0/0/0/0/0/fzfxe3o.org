"I'm telling you, Ron, the cats on the walls were too distracting. I almost lost the mood," Harry said as they made their way to Potions class.

"I told you I didn't want details."

Harry seemed not to hear him, "It was intense though. Sweaty. Moist and squishy too, like a toad actually."

"Quidditch practice again?" Hermione asked.

"Sort of. It was definitely exhausting. Had to keep a good grip of the broom..."

Hermione raised an eyebrow as she went on to her desk.

"You prick," Ron said. "She doesn't get what you're talking about."

"And what are you talking about in my class. If you please be so kind to share, Mr. Potter." said Snape.

"Oh nothing, professor. I was just telling Ron about my detention with Professor Umbridge last night."

"I imagine you earned that one," sneered Snape.

"Oh, yes. But she did punish me, Professor. It's all good now. She got me scrubbing an old pink cauldron all night,"

Ron almost hit his head when he realized no one understood what his friend was on about.
