Hermione comes in, "What are you two talking about. One of those long Quidditch conversations?"

"Well, it was more big than long," Ron said.

"And perky, very perky conversation. Rosy pink conversation," Harry added daydreaming.

"Whatever... As long is it is not Umbridge, It's alright," Hermione said, "Merlin, I can't stand that woman!"

"She is very..." Harry started.

"Hellish?"

"Insufferable?"

"Congruent," Harry said.

"Congruent? How so?" Hermione asked.

"Well, she has this... how do I say it. All around pinkness to her. And is not only on the outfit you see of her..."

"I reckon she does like pink," Hermione replied thoughtfully, as Ron looked greenish at her side. "But... congruent is hardly just clothing---"

"Her personality is congruent as well. In a way, you can say the carpet matches the drapes," Harry ventured with a mischievous smile.

Hermione looked puzzled, as Ron excused himself, for he had had enough of that conversation.
