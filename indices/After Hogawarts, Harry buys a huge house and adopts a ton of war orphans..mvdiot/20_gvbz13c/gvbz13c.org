Idk why but reading this gave a really random idea of Harry becoming the master of death changing his personality. Maybe some remnent of Voldemort? Maybe Grindlewald had left an impression of himself on the Elder wand and it imprints Harry. Some bullshit. Taking in a lot of kids, giving him influence of many future wizards, and his good image in society combined to give himself a personal army and a way to wreck chaos. Idk I'm weird, I wouldn't even read this type of fic lol.
