A Floo call this early? That's odd - I wonder if Arthur forgot something and can't pop back to get it? Well, it's still restricted, so it'll be someone we know - there, the kettle's on if someone needs to come through.

Oh, it's Harry! He was always a bit of an early riser, although I suppose the children are getting him up as well. They must be excited to get settled in and explore their new home.

"Good morning Harry, it's lovely to see you!"

"Hi Mrs. Weasley-"

"Now Harry, dear, I've told you you can call me Molly. But it's good to see you Harry, how are you doing this morning? Are the children off to a good start today?"

"Ah yes Mrs. Weasley - sorry, Molly - most of them are fine, but Albert seems a bit off? He's not crying, but I feel like something's not quite right with him since breakfast. And I checked his nappy and he's dry and he doesn't have a fever but what if he's sick? What if it's something that started yesterday? Or before? How do I check for something like this, all the spells I know are for specific symptoms, and I haven't noticed anything, he only got here early this morning, he was still sleeping. Should I take him to St. Mungo's? It seems a bit silly to do all that, but I don't know what to do, and I tried everything I could think of and Ron and Hermione are out so there's no one to watch the others and what if it's something serious like, like cancer - Ah, do wizards get cancer? Or maybe it's this dragon pox thing everyone keeps mentioning, or -"

Harry looks like he might start hyperventilating, which is especially dangerous during a Floo call. Best to nip those "new parent" worries in the bud then.

"Harry! Breathe, Harry, it'll be alright. Babies are more resilient than we give them credit for, and there's no sense in working yourself up like this when we still need more to go on. Now, you said you fed him? Did he eat enough? Did you have to coax him to eat more? How did he sound when you burped him?"

A blank look and a long pause. "When I burped him?"

"Oh dear. Alright, Harry, let me turn of the kettle and then I'll be through..."
