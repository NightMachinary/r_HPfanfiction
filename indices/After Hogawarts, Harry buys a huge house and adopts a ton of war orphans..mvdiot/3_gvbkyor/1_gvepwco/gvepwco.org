Molly sighed as she walked towards the dark house.

/"Look after Harry when we're in Australia, okay mum?"/ Had been the last words Ron had said to her before he and Hermione activated the portkey. Hermione had added: /"He might do something ... stupid when he's alone. I mean, he doesn't/ always /look for trouble, but he usually finds it anyway."/

The first two weeks everything had been well. Harry had reported to the fireplace every night and talked to her, or Arthur, or Ginny. Harry started working at the Ministry and began his auror training. Then, a week ago, Robards had taken him for his first field assignment. It wasn't supposed to be a dangerous mission. A standard job.

But after the assignment, Kingsley had sent them worried a message that informed them about Harry resigning from the department. That same evening, Harry had called them as normal and assured them that everything was fine. He just had realized that auror wasn't the job he wanted. Molly, who had raised seven children and for whom Harry and Hermione were practically part of the family, had immediately known that he was hiding something from her. She hadn't probed. He was an adult after all. If he needed help, he would ask.

Of course Harry didn't ask for help. She should have known. No, instead of asking for help, he looked more tired every time he called them... and yesterday he didn't call at all. So she decided to pay him a visit. Of course she wouldn't just burst through the fireplace, that would be rude.

She walked up the stairs and pressed the bell. There was no reaction - not even Mrs. Black started screaming. There was however a loud bang. Now she was concerned. Molly pulled out her wand and and stormed the house. She couldn't believe her eyes when she stood in the entrance hall. The house was barely recognizable. The elven heads and other strange things that had been here a short while ago were gone. Instead, a whole bunch of children ran down the stairs. Four girls and two boys, ages three to ten, stared at her.

They saw her wand and began to scream loudly. Then the chaos really began. Several of the old portraits fell from the wall with a loud bang. The carpet under Molly's feet came to life. The windows rattled. One of the girls took on the colour of her surroundings behind. /Accidental magic./ Less than ten seconds after the mayhem began, Harry came running out of the kitchen... with a baby in his arms. His hair was even wilder than usual, there was a little bit of vomit on his shoulder and the baby in his arms screamed as loudly as the older children.

"Mrs Weasley?“, he asked tired. "What are you doing here?“

When the children saw that Harry didn't attack her they relaxed. /They trust him/, she realized. The windows stopped rattling, the carpet stopped moving and wall-girl got her original colours back. Before she could answer - and ask her own questions - the baby started crying again. Harry looked like he would start crying any moment now himself.

"Why are you still crying?“, he asked the baby. Molly was forgotten. "I fed you, your nappies are clean and you just woke up.“

The baby only wailed louder. "Oh dear“, said Molly, went to Harry and took the baby from him. He didn't resist. She rocked the child in her arms and hummed a sound that had always calmed her children too. Slowly the baby stopped crying and looked at her with big blue eyes. It sucked on its thumb and leaned its head against her chest. Molly immediately knew what the problem was and used her wand to conjure up a chew toy.

"The little one here is teething“, Molly explained. Before she could ask Harry why there were seven children in his house, one of the girls asked: "Can we eat now?“

"I am hungry!“, wailed the youngest boy.

"I want burger. And fries!“, said the eldest boy.

"I just want to eat“, wall-girl said.

All eyes went to Harry. "Is there food in the kitchen?“, Molly asked a little bit worried. Harrys shoulders slumped. "There is food in the kitchen. It's just not ready yet.“

"Do the children have their own rooms?“, asked Molly. Harry nodded. Then she said: „Who likes spaghetti with tomato sauce?“ The children cheered. Of course they liked spaghetti with tomato sauce, she hadn't met a child yet who didn't. She handed Harry the baby back, conjured some toys - the toys wouldn't stay long but they would do now - and levitated the them into the children's hands.

"Well then. You go up and play. Harry and I will call you when lunch is ready.“

The children hurried away. Harry asked exhausted: "How did you know that would work?“

"Oh Harry, after seven children that wasn't really a hard guess“, Molly said smiling. "Let's go to the kitchen and talk about your guests.“

They walked down the kitchen. Molly put a pot with water onto the stove and asked: "Anything you want to tell me, dear?“

Harry shifted uneasily. "So there was this assignment in the auror department.“

"I figured it had to do something with that.“

"We searched an old Death Eater hideout... it should have been an easy job. I was supposed to catalogize the dark objects there and then get out. There shouldn't have been any trouble...“

At once Molly remembered Hermiones words. "Let me guess. You found trouble anyway?“

Harry looked sheepish while rocking the baby in his arms.

"Turned out some Death Eaters still used the old hideout. I caught Rookwood and Rowle that afternoon.“

"Oh Harry... but that doesn't explain your little house guests.“

"Uhm they aren't exactly house guests...“

"And what would you say they are?“

Harrys ears became red. "They are kind of my wards now?“

Whatever Molly had been expecting, that wasn't it.

"Your wards? Harry, dear - you are barely eighteen years old...“

"I know... but - the Death Eaters found them with the Hogwarts Book of Admittance. They are muggleborn and their parents were murdered. There were more... so many more“, Harry said, his eyes hollow. He shook himself out of his stupor. "I... they experimented on the children ... why they have magic while squibs do not. We brought most of them back to their families. Told them about magic and explained what happened to the missing kids. But this bunch here? They don't have anyone. They are war orphans.“

Molly was beginning to understand. She couldn't help but grab his arm and squeeze him. Before she could get another word in he started babbling.

"The magical society has no orphanages ... nobody knew what to do with them. The ministry planned to send them back to the muggle world - but after all they've seen? Their magic is not stable. You saw what happened when they are scared. In the muggle world, they'd be outcasts, freaks ... I know what that feels like. I couldn't just send them away. I have enough money to send all of them to Hogwarts without working a single day. Sirius left me quite a fortune. I think he would like it if the Black fortune was used to help muggleborns.“

Molly sighed. "Harry...“, she started, but Harry hadn't finished yet.

"I mean, I know that I'm hardly an adult myself. But having them here is definitely better than having them in a muggle foster family or a group home were nobody would understand them... would think, they are crazy if they told what they have seen. Here at least they have someone who will always have their backs.“

"Harry...“

"And I know that everything still seems a bit chaotic. But I can learn... I will do everything in my power to ensure that they'll have a good childhood and...“

"Harry, will you let me finish?“

Harry flustered.

"I understand why you did it. What I don't understand is why you didn't ask for help. Arthur and I are kind of experts at raising children.“

Harry stared for a long time.

"The thought didn't even occur you, didn't it?“, Molly asked with a sad smile. "Okay, here is what you need to now if you want to raise a family with seven children...“
