I saw a story where after they arrested the muggle born last from the Hogwarts Express, they followed the families home and killed them. It made a lot of sense to me. I'd imagine that Hogwarts had some orphans just by virtue of them being at school. There probably weren't a lot of young orphans but at least a few teenage ones.
