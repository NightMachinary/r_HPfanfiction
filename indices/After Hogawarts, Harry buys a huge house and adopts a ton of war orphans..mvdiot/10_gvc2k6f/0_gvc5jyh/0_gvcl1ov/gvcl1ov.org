That made me go on a tangent, that it doesn't have to be war orphans, necessarily.

Muggles aren't that good with what is different. There must be a few muggle-borns in the foster system that aren't adopted because they're too weird, too many issues around them, etc.

Between Harry's connections at the Ministry and Hogwarts, he could have a way to watch out and find them, and adopt them as well.
