Realistically, I don't think there would be many war orphans. The Death Eaters weren't sparing the kids of any families they attacked, and unlike in the first war, there wasn't anyone really fighting back against them until the final battle.

So unless there were a lot of situations like with Remus and Tonks, which seems unlikely, there probably weren't many orphaned kids by the end.
