Okay, I hadn't considered the children of Death Eaters, and they do make the situation a lot more plausible. Even without the Wizengamot getting involved, the Death Eater side of the final battle probably was more likely to have both parents there, even if they had young kids, so there could easily be several families that lost both parents.
