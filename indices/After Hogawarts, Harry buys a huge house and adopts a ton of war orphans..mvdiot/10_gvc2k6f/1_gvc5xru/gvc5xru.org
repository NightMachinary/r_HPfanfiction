Easy to work around. Maybe the Wizengamot (you'd think I would know how to spell that by now) passes a law that convicted Death Eaters lose custody of any children they have, so as to prevent the raising up of yet another generation of malcontents. Plenty of canon fodder to base that idea off of. Anyway you'd end up with a bunch of kids who have two parents still living, but convicted and in Azkaban for the rest of their lives and legally unable to be parents. And presto, effectively orphaned kids.
