Yes, Harry helping them all, together with Ginny and later on even Teddy, and sometimes some kids have nightmares so he goes and helps them in the middle of the night, but ends up sleeping on the ground next to their bed. Or another time when he is reading a book to all the kids, some just listen without understanding a word, others sleep in his lap. The older ones are on the couch and as the night falls they all slowly doze off one by one. In the morning Ginny finds Harry sleeping with his back on the ground, literally draped in children of all ages, with the smaller ones resting against his sides or using his torso as pillow, one even on his chest safely tucked under his shirt while his head is resting under Harry's chin. Some toddlers are are cuddled to the side again using his arm as pillow. One might think the floor is uncomfortable or hard to sleep on, but since this isn't a rare even Harry has cushioning charms all over the house, the living room, besides the beds of the children, so they are all reasonably comfortable, but of course the children think that papa Harry is the best pillow or even sleeping bag for the really small ones, although sometimes mama Ginny joins as well and of course the children love her almost as much.
