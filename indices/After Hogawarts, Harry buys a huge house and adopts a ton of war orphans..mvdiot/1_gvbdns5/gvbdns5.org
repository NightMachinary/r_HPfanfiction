Oh I would love to read a fic like that. I imagine it would be total chaos in the beginning, with Harry not knowing s*** about taking care of one baby, let alone dozen of them. Then he has to deal with restless toddlers and moody teenagers on top of it. It would make for a totally cute scene if Harry sleeps in the room where all the babies are and the younger kids come to him to cuddle because they had a nightmare, and then the older kids also join just because, so they all end up sleeping in one big cuddle pile.
