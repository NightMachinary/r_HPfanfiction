Your prompt remind me of *The FitzPotter Scandal* fanfiction by /Ramos/ linkffn(4023872) where Harry befriends a Healer while staying at St-Mungo after the final battle and donate some of his sperm to him for his research, not knowing that the Healer would use it as a donor for women who couldn't conceive the normal way. He doesn't learn about that fact until years later when someone from the Department of Child Welfare knock on his door with a baby in her hands, telling him that he's the biological father. During the story, Harry end up adopting more and more of his biological children, to the point where he's raising about thirty to forty at the same time. His house is basically an orphanage, in a way.
