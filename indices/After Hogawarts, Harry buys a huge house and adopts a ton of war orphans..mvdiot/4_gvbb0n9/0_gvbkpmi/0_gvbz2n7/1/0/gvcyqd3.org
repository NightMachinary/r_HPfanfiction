Do they typically call them "professor"? I don't recall.

Anyways, I always viewed the Unspeakables as researchers, but academia isn't the only place research happens. There's plenty of researchers that work as consultants in a ton of fields in real life, I'd assume it's the same in HP, especially since, as far as we know, there are no higher education institutions.
