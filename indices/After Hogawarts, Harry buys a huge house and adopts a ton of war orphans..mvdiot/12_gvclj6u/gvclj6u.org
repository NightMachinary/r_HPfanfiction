Thats why i love Teddy Lupin so much, he is the embodiment of the horrors of the war, with both his parents being killed in it, just like Harry was for the first war, Teddy is for the second war. Also the fact that Harry, orphan of the war himself, helps and is a part of Teddy's, orphan of war, life is so poetic and so beautiful... love it.
