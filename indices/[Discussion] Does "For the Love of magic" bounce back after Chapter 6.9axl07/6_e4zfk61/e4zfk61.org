Honestly, the whole fic is a trainwreck. There will be some more consequences to come with Harry's runes, his morality will degrade over time in part because of them. This consequence is mostly meaningless because the people whose opinion he cares about have their morality degrade with him, and of course, everyone else is either too weak or too scared to oppose him in any meaningful way.

Everything else I have to say about this fic has already been said by someone here so, I won't repeat it.
