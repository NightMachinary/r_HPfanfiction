The fic continues to include lots of little bits and pieces which are interesting. The author is clearly imaginative when it comes to magic. However, the story becomes massively bogged down in smut and Harry's pursuit of women to add to his "collection". You could probably trim the wordcount by over 50% without losing any of the plot. Also, it becomes increasingly clear as the fic goes on that Harry is acting as an authorial mouthpiece for the broadcasting of real life political views, which is never fun.
