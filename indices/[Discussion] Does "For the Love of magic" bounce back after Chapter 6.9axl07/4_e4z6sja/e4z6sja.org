I was ok for about 80% - not great, but some interesting ideas.

Then the author turned Harry into a Islamophobic, mysongistic asshole. He was cramming his own insane political beliefs into it - like women crashing the economy because people can pay us less, or that any Muslim in power insanity dangerous - and then he got upset when people called him on his bullshit.

Honestly, I wish I could delete my previous good reviews of his story.
