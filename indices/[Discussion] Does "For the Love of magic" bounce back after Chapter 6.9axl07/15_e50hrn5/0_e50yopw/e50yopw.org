[[/spoiler][Well the vampires apparently figured out that there is going to be a Societal collapse on a global scale so they were trying to save as many Humans as possible so they don't run out of blood, but not saving enough that mankind could survive on their own. So hey give this info to Harry and Harry decides to Magic nuke the world and kill 7 billion people. Now all Humans will probably be born with magic. He told the vampires to act as predators to humans so humans can actually become strong. Then Harry and vampires are mostly chummy-buddies. The whole line about "nothing short of a god can stop whats coming" referred to that]]
