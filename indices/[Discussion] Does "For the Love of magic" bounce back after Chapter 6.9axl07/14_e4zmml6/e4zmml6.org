I take why it gets so much hate, I really do, but I really enjoy the smut and really don't get why people get so angry at it, as far as Harry "godmoding" well yes he does, but I think it's a lot more rewarding than the usual "He has a very BIG magical core, his power is over 9000!!!" bullshit we usually get, of course he has the boon that his runes get him but his power comes from his understanding of magic and it is actually shown in the fic, not just "he practiced for months in the room of requirement and got out overpowered"

as far as consequences from the runes, not really, he becomes emotionally stunted somewhat incapable of caring too much for people besides his 3 "main" girls and he start shoeing a great disregard for the life of those he doesn't care about to the point of doing rather gross human experiments with his enemies, mainly death eaters
