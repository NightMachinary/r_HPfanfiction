It would depend on what vibe of horror you're going for. Personally, I love the more psychological side of the genre with a dash of creature or monster.

I'd likely do something like these:

- A family, alone and isolated in the middle of the woods, is hunted by werewolves. Just as they think they've beaten them out, one of them starts having strange reactions after an attack.

  - Could be a muggle family to up the strength of the werewolves; they might not even know of magic or their only magic user is a first year with limited knowledge.

- A falsely accused and incarcerated inmate of Azkaban struggles to remain themselves amongst the vilest of the wizarding kind.

  - The character would be facing, not only dementors, but the other inmates, themselves, and, likely, human guards (if you decide to add them).

- A muggle, with no knowledge of magic, has their memory altered by a magical folk with an unhealthy interest in the mind.

  - Think mad scientist experimenting on an unconsenting party.
