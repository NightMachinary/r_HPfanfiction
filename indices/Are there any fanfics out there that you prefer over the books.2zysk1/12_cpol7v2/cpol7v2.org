No. It's apples and oranges. Fanfiction - to me - is nothing like published fiction. I look at it as something that helps me get better at a hobby I enjoy: writing. Like practicing a tennis serve or a golf swing. Nothing more than that.

Professionally written and published literature is entirely different. If I want to go read Finnegan's Wake I'll go read it. Same with the original series of HP books.
