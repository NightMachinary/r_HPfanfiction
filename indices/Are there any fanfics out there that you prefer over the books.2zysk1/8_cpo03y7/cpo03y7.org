It's dated now, and I would no longer think so having seen the series (and its larger themes) through the eyes of my son as I read him the books when he was very young, but for years I'd have preferred Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] to canon's book 6. No Horcruxes, Harry moves up (plausibly) in the power stakes, factions in the Goblin world, the economic implications of a world with a Philosopher's Stone, believable Harry/Ginny romance, and arguably the best Harry/Dumbledore duel in fanfiction.

Of course, this isn't what the /Harry Potter/ series was about at all, but it might have been had JKR been a more formulaic (and less romantic) genre writer. For example, Jim Butcher of /Dresden Files/ fame or Patrick Rothfuss, author of /Name of the Wind/, would have written /Harry Potter/ as a series of magical and character-building plus-ups leading ultimately to protags who could go toe-to-toe with the Big Bads while pulling off a crowning moment or two of awesome. JKR was more Tolkein-esque in her grounding her novels in family and love, not power and theatrics.

I also probably enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity's]] exceptional (and oft-linked) /Alexandra Quick/ series nearly as much as I did Harry Potter canon.
