No, this was Sarah Rees Brennan. I loved the idea behind her first series, but something just felt off about it, so I never finished. I loved Unspoken though, and plan on finishing that series when I get a chance

I actually wasn't a big fan of Cassie's fic. Didn't see what all the hype was about. I do enjoy her books though, they're fun. Not great, but fun.
