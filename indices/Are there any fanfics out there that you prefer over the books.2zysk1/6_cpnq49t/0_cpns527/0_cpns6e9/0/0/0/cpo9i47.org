Yeah, that happened with my fanfic writers turned professional writers too. They stop writing and then they take everything down.

I remember being so excited for my favorite fic author's first published book...only to be really underwhelmed by it. Her second series was better than the first, but man, I still prefer her HP fics over the original stuff.
