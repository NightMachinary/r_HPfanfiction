You missed the point that being published is far from an indicator of quality so much as marketability, luck, assiduity, and connections within the traditional publishing business (itself rapidly becoming an anachronism with the rise of self-publishing).

Moreover, you appear not to have read much fanfiction if you lump it all together as substandard, unimaginative dross. Any objective reading of the best fanfiction indicates that the form allows just as much imaginative creation and expression as original fiction. Also, as many fanfiction writers have published original fiction professionally as well (I can think of at least a dozen, including myself), your claims that we are all not "inventive enough for an original plot" ring hollow at best.

Shakespeare and T. H. White penned what would be called fanfiction were it written today. It's not unreasonable to wonder what of today's fanfiction may be held up generations from now as literary classics.
