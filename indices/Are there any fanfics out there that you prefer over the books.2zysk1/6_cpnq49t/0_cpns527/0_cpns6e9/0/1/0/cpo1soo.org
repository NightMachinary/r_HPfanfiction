There's bound to be a few but there's thousands that don't and there's a very good reason. Also fanfiction back there was a much different game because the internet wasn't as big a thing and you couldn't just write a story and stick it up. There are two well known authors that have been widely published since the modernisation of fanfiction and thats E.L James and Cassandra Clare. So not quite the level of Azimov.
