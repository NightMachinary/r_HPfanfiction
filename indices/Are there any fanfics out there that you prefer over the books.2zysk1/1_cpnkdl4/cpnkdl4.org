Since you invited other fandoms--probably my all-time favorite fic is [[http://rosa-acicularis.livejournal.com/30916.html][The Anatomist]], a BBC Sherlock fic that I rec by calling it better than canon. Would've made for such a good S2.

  James Joseph Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976. His birth certificate no longer exists.

  If it did, it would list his father's name (Dr. Joseph Arthur), his mother's (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne), and his birth weight (2.7kg). It would not tell you that his eyes were blue, or that he entered this world as he will leave it -- howling.

  It would not tell you that five minutes later his mother (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne) gave birth to a daughter, his sister. His twin. The records of her birth burned with his, but if they hadn't, you would know her name.

  Mary Elizabeth Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976.

  They will call her Molly.
