There have definitely been fic authors I've stumbled upon that I prefer their writing style over JKR's. That's not to mean they are better than she is, but because they have their own writing qualities that I really like. They just really have a knack for writing drama or comedy or suspense, and it makes their stories so much better for it. They are authors who I stop midway through their fic and think "shit, I'd buy their books if they had them. I love how they write!"

But that doesn't mean I'd give up the original books for those fic or choose their fic over the books, because no way. It's one thing to write fic based on someone else's characters and world, but another thing completely to create those said characters and world from scratch. It doesn't matter how good someone's fic is, I'll still prefer the books over them. Since, without the books, there wouldn't have been any fics to begin with.
