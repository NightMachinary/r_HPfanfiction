The *Promises*-trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/22909/Robin4][Robin4]] - /Promises Unbroken/ - /Promises Remembered/ - /Promises Defended/

It's a story about The Marauders. Harry is merely a side character. It's a tale about how Sirius remained the Secret Keeper, was kidnapped and tortured by Voldemort and everyone thinks he's dead -until he reappears. The most amazing thing in this fic is that it takes Peter Pettigrew and makes it an actual person, not just a one dimensional bad guy.
