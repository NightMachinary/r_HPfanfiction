For Harry Potter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging The Sword]] gets my vote. It takes the series to a slightly darker place and it does it well. Harry Potter and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][The Forests of Valbone]] is an interesting one as well.

Wastelands of Time and Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived are both worth mentioning, but are so drastically different from canon, it's almost original fiction.

For Buffy: I'm very fond of anything by [[http://liz-marcs.livejournal.com/239724.html][Liz Marcs]] and I think her view of life past Season 7 is superior to the comics. [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120429044006/http://www.echonyc.com/%7Estax/Buffy/nwhepcat/index.htm][Nwhepcat]] is also an excellent writer.

For Pokemon: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][Game of Champions]] is easily one of the best fanfictions around. For another good read, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5808527/1/Regret][Regret]].

For EVA: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470043/1/Evangelion-Genocide-Extended][Evangelion Genocide]]. Highly enjoyable and manages to keep the tone and pain of the original series. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4140913/1/Orchestrating-the-Silence][Orchestrating The Silence]] is another story that works well here.

For The Hunger Games: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10256002/1/These-Are-The-Names][These Are The Names]] acts as a prequel to the books and does a damn good job of fleshing out Haymitch and Effie beyond the books.
