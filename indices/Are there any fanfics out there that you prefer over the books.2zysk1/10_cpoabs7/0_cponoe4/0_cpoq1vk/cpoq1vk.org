There aren't that many good stories out there, but I'm fairly picky about what I'll read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5615/FernWithy][Fernwithy]]'s stories are well-written and are worth reading.

The only other good story I've read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7996957/1/The-Asking-Price][The Asking Price]], an AU where Prim gets sent to The Games told from Peeta's point of view.
