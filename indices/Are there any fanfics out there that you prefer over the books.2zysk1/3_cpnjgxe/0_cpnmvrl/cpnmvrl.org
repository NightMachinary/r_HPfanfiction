I loved this one when u first read it, but about halfway through the politics and the gushing about family magicks gets to be a bit much for me... Also, while it does the whole lordship thing way more tastefully (and more believable) than most, I still cringe whenever it trails off into the proverbial tall grass of aristocracy. But this is, of course, a matter of preference and doesn't reflect on the quality of the fic, which is excellent.
