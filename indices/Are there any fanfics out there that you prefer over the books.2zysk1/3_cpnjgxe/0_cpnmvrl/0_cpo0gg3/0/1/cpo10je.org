For me it's Peter, sure he is a terrible person, but he is a terrible three dimensional person. Also, as awefull as it is I can relate to him the most, he is terrified, has made terrible decisions, and lives in regret of those decisions. Yet he still sticks with his chosen path. Plus I have never read him calling Harry Pup or Prongslet.
