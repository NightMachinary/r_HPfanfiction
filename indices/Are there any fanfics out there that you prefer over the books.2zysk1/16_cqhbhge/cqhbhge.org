[[http://fanfiction.net/u/4314892/]] - Colubrina (Author page)

The Die (and it's polyamorous alternate ending, After The Sea) are likely OOC, but I find myself drawn to Hermione dealing with the post-war, particularly with in a Harmony or Dramione ship.

Also, Vera Rozalsky's Amends, Or Truth and Reconciliation.

I don't think they SURPASS JKR, but I like that they try to world-build (Vera) or deal with the consequences of the DA as traumatized child soldiers (Vera's reprisals, Colubrina and her treatment if the Trio as triggering for each other) in a way that JKR seemed to handwave with the epilogue.

Also, both authors are aggressively well-read. I don't actually think Draco and Hermione would quote Edna St. Vincent Millay to each other in bed, but the sheer amount of references both back in just tickles the history and literature majors I've buried in my heart.
