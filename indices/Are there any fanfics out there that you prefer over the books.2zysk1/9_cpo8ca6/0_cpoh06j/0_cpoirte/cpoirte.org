Read the first few ones when i was too young to fully understand it, English is my second language and my parents thought it would be a perfect oppertunity to practice my english, so i spent the first books focusing almost entirely on reading instead of the plot. The rest was compleatly spoiled for me, and i was biased against certain charactors because of other people opinions.

Edit: TL;dr Don't make your children practice english by reading good book when they aren't ready.
