Not that there aren't plenty of unexplored avenues in the actual canon, but AH is where it's at. I lost track of the number of fics that disappeared because the author had turned it into an actual novel. Which is a "problem" in a lot of fandoms, but Twilight was particularly prone to it because all you really had to do was do find-and-replace on the names and because a lot of the writers were older (read: "twimoms") would could competently write adult relationships.
