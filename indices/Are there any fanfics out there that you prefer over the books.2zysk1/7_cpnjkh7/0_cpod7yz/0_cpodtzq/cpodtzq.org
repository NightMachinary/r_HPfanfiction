I don't disagree. There are a lot of really interesting backstories in Twilight that never were explored and fanfiction is the perfect place to do it. I don't even read AH. My favorite character is Jasper because the idea of a person who can feel others' pain being driven to kill others is rife with opportunity. Add in the fact that he fought in the Confederate Army in the Civil War but now has to cope with the modern world, and you've got some exciting possibilities.
