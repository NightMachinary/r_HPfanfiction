Twilight fanfic is inexplicably good. I think it's because the stories/characterization is bad rather than in spite of. Basically it's a ready-made set of characters to convert into humans and throw into any situation you chose.

My personal favorite is Hydraulic Level 5, in which Edward and Bella are childhood friends and high school sweethearts who got married just out of college. The story picks up when they're both 30, and she's still trying to understand what drove him to abruptly divorce her a year into the marriage. It's incredibly moving and wonderful from start to finish. Other gems include There Will Be Blood (Edward is the neurotic son of a mob family and Bella is a college freshman who gets in too deep), This is Not My Life (Bella is kidnapped along with Edward's 5-year-old daughter and Bella does her best to keep them both alive/sane), The Cullen Campaign (Edward and Bella are members of rival DC political families who exchange sharp political barbs in between fucking each other senseless), Faking It (Edward is a scandal-plagued actor, Bella is the fresh-faced lead singer who needs to raise her profile, and they enter into a mutually beneficial fake celebrity relationship). Not to mention the whole genre of high school all-human fics with lots of ennui and underage drinking.
