I would say that there are definitely some that are unique enough to be standalone stories. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866813/1/A-Whiff-of-Competition][A Whiff of Competition]] has an amazing and unique structure for the world of professional Quidditch. I won't say it's better than the original series, but it measures up certainly.

I'm not totally sure what you mean by other fandom, but I did randomly stumble upon a fanfiction that is better than/fixes the abusive relationship in Twilight. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6555315/1/Leaves-of-Grass][Leaves of Grass]] is mind-blowing. Essentially, Bella begins questioning the nature of her relationship with Edward and his control and ends up being transported to 1862 Texas where she meets Jasper as a human. The writer manages to make Bella a developed character and give her a healthy relationship, two things Stephenie Meyer fails to do. Even if you don't care much for Twilight/have only a passing familiarity, this story is worth it for the US Civil War alone.
