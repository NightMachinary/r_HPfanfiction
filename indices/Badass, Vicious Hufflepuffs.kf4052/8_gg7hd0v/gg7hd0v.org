So Helga was a viking... whose animagus form was a badger... a relative of the wolverine, the most vicious animal known. How about just having her take a pounding and then get up bloodied and utterly devastate her attackers, taunting them all the while. Like Tyler Durden in Fight Club. Gets cut up and blood everywhere and then the real fun starts.
