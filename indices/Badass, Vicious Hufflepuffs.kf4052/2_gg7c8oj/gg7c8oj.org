The thing about Hufflepuffs is... they should be scary. Close knit and hard working in a magical world were if you work hard you can become deadly. No one fights harder than for their loved ones. Slytherins would weigh cost and risk against personal benefit, Ravenclaws hide behind their books, Griffindors seek glory impulsively (if they have an audience). But Hufflepuffs will die for their friends. And they are united and disciplined. So yeah...
