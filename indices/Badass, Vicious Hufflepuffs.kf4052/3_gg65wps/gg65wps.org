One series I read pointed out that Helga Hufflepuff was a Viking. You can extrapolate from there.

There's also the very fun The Price Is Right by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel unfinished but recently got another chapter), in which Harry finds the forgotten Hufflepuff obstacle course that includes such things as swinging over a lake of piranhas and decides they want people to underestimate them. In this fic it's played for laughs but you can make it serious. linkffn(9894129) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1070691][Also on AO3]].
