Helga's true fame is (mostly) lost to history. Her reputation for teaching the leftovers comes from the fact that she was teaching in retirement from a career that made a /lot/ of enemies so she didn't dare advertise her presence, and the fact that Hogwarts is fortified to this day is part of her legacy as a founder.

Y'see, of the four founders, she was the one who was unarguably a Dark Witch by modern standards. Helga of the Rheintal (lower Rhine, 'of valley broad' as the hat sings it) was also known as Black Helga, the most terrifying mercenary sorceress of late 9th/early 10th century Europe. She carved her name in blood, fire and fell sorceries from the low countries to the shores of the Black Sea, only learning the value of loyalty to anything other than coin in her later career, when she stopped taking contracts from the invading Magyars. From that point on - shortly before the Battle of Lechfeld, after which the Magyar knew only reverses - the blood she shed mortared the foundations of the Holy Roman Empire.

Her legacy persists in Hogwarts' massive financial endowment. Helga spent the pillage of half a continent on land whose rents still fund the school she helped found - the ministry subsidy is still only nominal even by the 20th century, even after the whopping 'honoraria' the school Governors take.

Every newly sorted Hufflepuff is taken aside and quietly instructed that the high standard of courtesy and fair play expected of every Hufflepuff is part of their centuries-long atonement for their Founder's dark deeds.
