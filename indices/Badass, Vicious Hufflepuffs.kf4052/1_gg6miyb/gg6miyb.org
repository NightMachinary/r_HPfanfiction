Well, you could write them a bit "uncanny valley" where they would be unnaturally coordinated, (WE ARE THE LEGION), you could write a few scenes where a Hufflepuff needs a thing and then they suddenly have the thing because they know a guy who knows a guy, who knows a guy.... You could play them as a Cosa Nostra type organization...

Or you could write them as the 'normal people'... Who somehow manage to be completely unmoved by the insanity of the world around them, an immovable object. No special quirks, just trucking on.... Regrdless of what's happening, because everything is all right in the Hufflepuff Zone.
