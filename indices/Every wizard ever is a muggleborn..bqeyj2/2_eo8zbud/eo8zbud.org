Just to clarify, by "wizard" do you mean all magical humans? Or only the male magicals? Well, I suppose it's irrelevant. I just had this interesting thought of what if all of the pureblood men were killed or something and for the first time in centuries, the old pureblood families don't have the option to marry their cousin. Instead, their only options are halfbloods. (Oh, the horror!)
