They marched.

None daring to stop the movement of their procession when it was Alastor Moody likoing ahead of them all, both eyes focussed only on the path ahead of them.

The office of newly minted Minister of Magic: Shiev Palpatine.

The door slid open with a hiss, the man's gaze rising up from the leaf of parchment between his fingers to take note of them. Minute surprise falling away to unveil that mild smile only a politician could muster,

"Auror Moody! I trust Lestrange has been dealt with. I must say you're here sooner than I expected."

Alastor lead the way, flicking his wand into his grasp from his pocket which encouraged the rest of his quintet to do the same as he spoke,

"In the name of the Ministry of Magic, you are under arrest."

Gone was any semblance of pleasantry from Palpatine,

"Are you threatening me, Auror." He spat his title back at Mad-Eye with venom. Vitriol and hatred twisting old mans features into a mask most foul, unperturbed, Mad-Eye continued,

"The Wizagmot will decide your fate."

"I AM the Wizagmot."

"Not yet."

A calm fell over the Ministers office, the building tension having reached it's apex as the red robed man rose to his feet.

He flexed his wrist and a long, pale wand fell into his grip from within his sleeves,

"It's treason then..." Slow, cold,

MOTION. He was across the desk, wand a blur before anyone could blink.

They'd been prepared for a struggle, to have to bring him down by force. Hell, they'd even determined he wouldn't go down easy. But in a second, spears of light proceeded Palpatine instantly closing the distance between he and the members of the Order. Hestia Jones and Emmaline Vance falling prey to the onslaught as they failed to react in time.

Having barely touched the ground before Palpatine swung about to cleave Kingslet Shacklebolt from shoulder to hip and finish off Daedalus Diggle with a curse that tunnelled a hole through his skull.

In seconds, Moody was alone, his own walking stick forgotten as his own wand flashed. The duel of his life awaiting him as Palpatine returned fire.
