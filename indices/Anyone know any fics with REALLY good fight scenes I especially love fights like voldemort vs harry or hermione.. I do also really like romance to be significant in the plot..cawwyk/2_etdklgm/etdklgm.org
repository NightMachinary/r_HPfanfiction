None is Hermione-centric (I hate her, so I don't read her, so no recs about it, sorry) but in a few she's quite important and is pretty badass in Hogwarts Battle School.

In order of awesome battle scenes, not necessarily against Voldemort, the top 5 of my rec would be, in no particular order: Realignment, Eclipse of the Sky, Beyond the Curtain, Battle School and Echoes in the Fog. Though Echoes can be really confusing if you haven't read any of the other author's work.

My favourite fic all time is Eclipse (besides Grow Young with me, which is a completely different genre) so I'm a bit biased. Amazing battle scenes though, and the plot is SOOOO much bigger than canon that it isn't even fair. Not to mention the humorous parts that fit so right in it, and I'm a sucker for romance, so there's that.
