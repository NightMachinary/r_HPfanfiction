I don't think so.

I think Dumbledore was attracted to Grindalwald because he was his intellectual and magical equal first and all other factors were secondary to those two things.(close seconds but always behind the intellectual and magical equal factors)

If Grindalwald had been a girl who was Dumbledore intellectual and magical equal I think he would have been just as attracted to them.(But that is just how I read Dumbledore's Attraction to Grindalwald.)
