I just got caught up on this one yesterday, and it's one of those fics that leaves you almost hurting for more:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]]: Sirius decides to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and makes protecting Harry his priority. AU GOF.

It hits all your criteria, enjoy!
