On the other hand I have personally been part of several slash recommendation threads. And level-headed discussions about why some slash and most mpreg fics are just plain bad - but some people (for example the gays /gasp/) still like to read the better ones from time to time.

Also there was the "like robst but better" thread were nobody was chased away by an angry mob.

Sure, noone here will treat you like a special snowflake, but I have never felt disrespected here. And I HAVE been banned from some places for my homosexual ways so yeah - if you are upfront about what you want and why and not a complete ninny this sub is rather accepting :D
