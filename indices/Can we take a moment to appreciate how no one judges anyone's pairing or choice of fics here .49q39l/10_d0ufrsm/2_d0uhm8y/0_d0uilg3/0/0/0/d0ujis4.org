As long as this is the biggest problem I have because I'm gay I am pretty happy. There is still a lot to cover but at least where I live I have never had a problem with it in real life. By now even mainstream entertainment is catching up, it is starting to be shown as more of a genuine character trait instead of a gimmick, everything ist going well. Except for horrible slash fics :P
