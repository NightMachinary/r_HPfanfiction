Exactly. Also one of the biggest reasons most mpreg is garbage. If it is a minor point in some well-written stuff it doesn't phase me much because magic, but mostly it just is the icing on the "he's actually just a girl" cake -.-

Gen and het fiction ist just so much more abundant that it is far easier to find ones where any relationships are not the whole plot and tastefully/well done. To the point that I often like them more but, you know, sometimes you like reading about /people like you/ even if it is cringy in places...
