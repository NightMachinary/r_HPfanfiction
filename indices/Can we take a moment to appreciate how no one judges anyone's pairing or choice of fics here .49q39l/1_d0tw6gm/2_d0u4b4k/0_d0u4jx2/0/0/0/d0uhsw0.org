If I have the choice between reading a story where the protagonists have plot armor and the bad guys get their due in a timely manner, and a story where teenagers are tortured for months or years, with the bad guys getting (mostly) away with it, and the protagonist is drowning in angst and sorrow, I'll pick the former. He does have good ideas, but (sadly) seems to turn them often into very similar stories. I loved the hook for his latest story, an adult Hermione tracking down a Harry who has been mind-wiped of all magical knowledge in a dark future, and filling him in about his history, and was quite disappointed when they then went back in time to 1st year.

Plus, Robst writes with good grammar and spelling, updates quickly and so far has finished every story he started. Those are rather significant qualities in a fanfiction writer.
