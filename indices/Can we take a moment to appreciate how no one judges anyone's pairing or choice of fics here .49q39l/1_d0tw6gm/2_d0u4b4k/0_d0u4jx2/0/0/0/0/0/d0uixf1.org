Meh, I'm German. I once wrote a term paper with a sentence covering four or five lines on a4 paper. I cut that up of course but run-on sentences really go under the radar for me. And the endless fluff can definitely be too much, but sometimes when I'm a bit down and not up to dusting off my all-time favourite humor fics I like some senseless fluff with some length and regard for grammar. Definitely a rare guilty pleasure though :D (And most times I only read part if the fic I chose because once my mood goes up it can get rather bland)
