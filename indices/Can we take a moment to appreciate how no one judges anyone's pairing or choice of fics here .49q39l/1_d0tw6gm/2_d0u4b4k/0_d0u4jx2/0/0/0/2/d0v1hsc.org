  If I have the choice between reading a story where the protagonists have plot armor and the bad guys get their due in a timely manner, and a story where teenagers are tortured for months or years, with the bad guys getting (mostly) away with it, and the protagonist is drowning in angst and sorrow, I'll pick the former.

That's not a good choice. That's not even the choice between a half-decent and a bad story. That's a choice between brown and green shit. Whatever you choose, you'll be eating shit either way.

Thing is, you don't need to /choose/ either. You can walk away from both and find a good story instead.
