Since I consider the canon ending far too dark, I am rather certain that my definition of a good story doesn't overlap that much with yours. A happy ending in a story is very important for me. And that means an ending where (most of) the good guys have a happily ever after, and the bad guys either die or get punished for their crimes. I don't want a story where good characters die just so we can see how dangerous the challenges are, and how much the protagonist suffers.
