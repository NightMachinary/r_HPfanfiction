And I on the other hand consider such "a happy end, no matter what" stories, stories where antagonists are nothing but set pieces to be easily overcome, where the protagonist isn't allowed to face any difficulties that actually /challenge/ them and must under no circumstances face failure nothing but self-indulgent wastes of words.

To give an example out of the left field, "Flowers for Algernon" is not a happy story by a long shot, but it is a damn good one.
