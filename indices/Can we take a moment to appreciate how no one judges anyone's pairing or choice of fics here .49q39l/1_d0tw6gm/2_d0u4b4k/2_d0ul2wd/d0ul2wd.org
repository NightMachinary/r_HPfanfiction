I read robst's stuff when i was barely a teen ; I assume younger audiences still enjoy it.

The magic wears off when you realise there's no point to the conflicts because the characters have the strongest case of plot armor-itis in recorded history.

Atleast he's still writing though , that brings a nostalgia smile to my face.
