Indeed (I've had very few bad comments (but they do exist, still people seem less judgy on here than in a lot of other forums etc.), despite having asked for a fanfiction shipping Harry and Gabrielle (unfortunately the damned author made her 9 years old and explained it away by saying: Veela, so it doesn't count) and others (even an OC and it was those scenes that made me look for it because I love sex in libraries (haven't had it myself, too shy, but I love reading about it) and while being watched (well at least reading about that...Ravenclaw common-room and invisibility cloak, enough said!))
