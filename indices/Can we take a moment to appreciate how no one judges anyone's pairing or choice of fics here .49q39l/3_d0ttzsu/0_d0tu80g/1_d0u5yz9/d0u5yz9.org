Wasn't that Sugar Quill? Their policy was basically only the main canon ships and Remus/Sirius. So that's understandable, given that there would be lots of potential for H/Hr shippers trolling the forum with things like "RON AND GINNY ARE EVUL!!!!1".

Talking of H/Hr, where has Portkey gone? They've been gone since 2010, and now their shippers are roaming around, with nowhere to go, lol. Since you seem to be quite deep into fandom history, could you explain?

There's also a difference between fanfiction and general fandom circles. Harry/Hermione is more popular in fanfiction, while H/G is much more popular generally. Dramione is an exception though, because it's very popular in both segments (because of the bad boy/good girl trope that so many people like). So part of the reason why there is so much acceptance for different ships here is because people realize that it's kept to the fanon arena.
