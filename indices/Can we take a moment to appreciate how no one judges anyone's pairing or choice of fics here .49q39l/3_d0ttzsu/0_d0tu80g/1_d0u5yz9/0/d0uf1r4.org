I just never saw Dramione as steaming from the Bad boy/Good girl trope, which I love. Draco is anything but a bad boy: he obeys his parents unfailingly, is part of a nice little fascist club to "cleanse the society", and has someone he calls "Master". I don't mean that Dramione is EVIL or shouldn't exist (if some people enjoy reading and writing it, good for them), I just mean that Sirius is a textbook example of a Bad boy (He even has a motorcycle for Godric's sake!), which is why I LOVE Hermione/Sirius as a ship, with or without the age difference.
