Gonna have to disagree with you there. There have been many times where I've seen someone make a particular request or explain why they like a certain pairing/trope and I've responded by bashing myself with a lamp. I don't say anything, but be sure that I have many lumps in my head thanks to lamps.

Yeah, we're pretty cool though.
