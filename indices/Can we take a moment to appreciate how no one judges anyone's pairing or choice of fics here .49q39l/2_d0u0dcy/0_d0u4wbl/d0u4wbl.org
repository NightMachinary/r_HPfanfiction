I totally agree. There are a lot of ships I don't agree with but I never actually say anything to people who request them cause I don't want people to attack me for what I like. I probably shouldn't, but if someone is already attacking me or someone else for a certain ship I'll get into argument. *Example:* Some (AND I SAID SOME) H/Hr shippers who attack H/G as a pairing and go on and on about how she must have love potioned Harry in canon or thrust their "evidence" in people's faces that JK Rowling admitted she made a mistake from an article that was taken totally out of context. I read Harry/Hermione stories myself, just like I read Harry/Ginny, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harry Susan, etc... I just don't like people who go nuts on how other people's opinions are wrong but luckily like OP is saying, this sub is really good in that regard. Once and a while I'll see someone make a single comment about how they don't like something or don't understand the attraction to something but nothing overly rude. Comparing this to another forum I've been on its pretty much perfect. This other group had two people last weekend get into a 100+ comment argument over James/Lily vs Snape/Lily. Anyway... rant over. *TLDR:* Yes I agree, this sub is amazing... it's not perfect but a lot better than many other forums.
