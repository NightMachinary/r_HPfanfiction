I'm indifferent when I see people requesting people specific shipping, whether it's slash, May/December, teacher/student, bestiality, incest or whatever relationships. But as soon as I see specific tropes I dislike (e.g. harems, indy!Harry, noble!Harry) it takes a lot of will power not to go in there and tell the thread creator to stop ruining fanfiction with crappy tastes.
