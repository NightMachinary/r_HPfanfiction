The only ships I disagree on and cringe whenever they come up is any teenager with an older character, for example, Hermione & Snape, Hermione and McGonagall (WHY?!?)

Not only are you throwing any realism out (a teacher, especially a stickler for the rules like McGonagall would /NEVER/ date a student) but it's just weird and not relate able at all.

And don't give me that "love conquers all" bullshit, that argument can be applied to pedophiles, so it's automatically thrown out of the window as far as I'm concerned.
