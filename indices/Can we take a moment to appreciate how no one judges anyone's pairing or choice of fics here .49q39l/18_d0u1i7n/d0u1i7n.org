People are free to ship however they want. If their OTP makes sense to them, then great. The only time I have a problem with a pairing is when its supporters either insult 'non-believers' or diverge from canon to the point that their characters are no longer recognizable.

It's the same with popular/infamous stories. >90% of the HPMoR and Robst fans are probably really great users who make fantastic contributions. It's the small percentage who argue that their fandoms are better than canon that cause [[/r/hpfanfiction]] to collectively lose their marbles.
