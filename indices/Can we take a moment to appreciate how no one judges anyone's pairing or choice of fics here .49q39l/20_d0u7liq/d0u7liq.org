This literally just happened to me the other day when I posted a request for Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing fics. I get that it's not everyone's thing. But from the comments, apparently I like lazy writing or some shit like that. A couple great people didn't comment too much on it and focused on reccing some fics. But I'd definitely disagree with "no one".
