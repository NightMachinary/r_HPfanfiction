Fair enough. I get you though, I was turned off it after the first chapter. It wasn't that it was bad, per se. I just wasn't all that into it. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't they say in the first chapter to rebel against the death eaters with their homemade/cultural magic? So you had a bunch of non-canon stereotypical magic spells being thrown around? I don't even know. Point of the ramble? I agree that it wasn't strictly canon. But whatever floats people's boats, right?
