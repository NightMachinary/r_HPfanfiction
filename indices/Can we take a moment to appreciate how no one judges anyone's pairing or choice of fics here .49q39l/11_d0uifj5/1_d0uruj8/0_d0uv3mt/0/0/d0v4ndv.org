The author basically ran a batshit insane cult: [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Thanfiction]]

The story itself is super dark and has appalling depictions of women and ethnic minorities, which, fine, loads of people like ridiculous over the top angst, but it grinds my gears that something so wildly out of sync with the series is hailed as canon. When you read the story within the context of his bonkers real life you kind of get the impression that he's psychotic, and suddenly the gratuitous violence and pathetic women become a little disturbing, not in an entertaining way.
