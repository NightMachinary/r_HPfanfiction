Pick any one or multiple from:

- There is an ongoing war that only Harry can end and the stress is getting to him a bit.

- Harry might have wanted to bang Tonks and is jealous.

- Harry resents Lupin for never caring for him when he was younger

- Harry is sick and tired of being told what to do in the way oh so many teenagers are

- Lupin represents the adults of the Harry Potter world always claiming that they want to help Harry but never actually doing anything to help and often making things worse

- Harry always blames himself for everything. Lupin telling him something was his fault would feel redundant to Harry and therefore frustrating. He knows that somehow he as good as killed Hedwig with his actions and then Lupin comes and tells him how he killed Hedwig.

- Lupin can't help. Harry feels frustrated in his own inability to do anything and just vents at someone who he feels should be more help but is equally unable. Lupin taught Harry but he never taught him how to hunt horcruxes and that's what he needs right now.

- Harry's a fucking mess. Understandably so. It isn't just Lupin that he vents at, see his horcrux induced blow up with Ron. Lupin appears multiple times so he gets shouted at multiple times. The more shit that happens the more messed up Harry gets so the worse he takes it out on people.
