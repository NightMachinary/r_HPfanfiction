I don't think Harry did resent Lupin.

In the first incident you mentioned, Harry was frustrated by the situation. He didn't want to kill Stan Shunpike. He didn't want to be in a war at all. He never chose any of these things, people were dying around him, and here was this teacher he respected telling him to go further than he was ready to go. Harry's anger was situational, not personal.

In the second incident you mentioned, the anger was personal... because Lupin was on the verge of making a terrible decision. Leaving your pregnant wife isn't a good look even when your lifetime of fears and insecurities are telling you it's for the best. Harry kicked Lupin's ass because Lupin needed his ass kicked. Lupin realized that Harry was right and made Harry godfather, and things were fine between them. The explosion at Grimmauld Place was an isolated incident, not part of a pattern of Harry resenting Lupin in general.
