I gave as examples the moment it begun and the moment it reached its peak. Harry is ashamed of how he treated Lupin when he meets him again at the Shell Cottage. But throughout the whole first half of DH, he is annoyed by him. He is annoyed by the fact that Lupin criticizes him from using the Disarming Spell instead of a Stunning Spell or a Killing Curse against Stan Shunpike. He is then annoyed by Lupin for feeling judged because he stated he trusted everyone in the Advanced Guard. He is also annoyed by Lupin because he doesn't take him seriously when he claims that he didn't do anything but it was his wand that defeated Voldemort during the Battle of the Seven Potters. Finally, he is completely ruthless against Lupin when he says that he wants to join the trio in their Horcrux hunt.

Edit: he doesn't feel that way towards anyone else in the Order. Not even Mrs. Weasley who is really annoying.
