I would doubt it that Lupin would have been of any use to the trio. He didn't know about the Horcruxes and Harry had no intention of telling him. He might have known a lot about the Dark Arts and he might have been a skilled duelist in his prime, but a lot of the trio's adventures in DH were successful because they outsmarted the enemy rather than dueling them to death.
