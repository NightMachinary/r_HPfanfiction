  ( Fleur was, in Harry's opinion, the worst type of good person. If she was any worse than she was, she'd certainly be a bad person, someone who took glee from the suffering of others, but she doesn't, not really.She was just very fond of taking the mickey out of people.Which isn't much better, honestly. Harry had thought he'd gotten rid of the groomed pigeon after fourth year, after his inability to feel her allure became apparent. She got real fucking fascinated then, started taking on worryingly fox-like smiles and a too-focused interest in his day-to-day life.It was how she caught him snogging Ludlow St John - a lovable, if somewhat dim fifth year in Hufflepuff - after he and Parvati had finished mechanically going through the motions of being dates, the girl in question going off to no doubt kiss Lavender in a broom closet or something. Fleur had been, of course, smug as she had ever been, and from then on in the girl had just not stopped when it came to nosing her way into his business and teasing him. )In which the visit to the Burrow before Harry's sixth year goes quite differently.
