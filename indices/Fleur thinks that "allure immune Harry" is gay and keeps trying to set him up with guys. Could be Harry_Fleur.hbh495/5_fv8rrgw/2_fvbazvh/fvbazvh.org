Honestly I could see many ''resisting'' her allure simply because they are not into her exact looks. Perhaps Harry really does not like blondes, as they seem to be the people that cause the most trouble in his life. (Malfoy, Dudley, Petunia)

Or he does not want someone that will forever be taller than him. (Fleur is mentioned to be tall)

I could see a lot of strongly held personal preferences overriding the allure.
