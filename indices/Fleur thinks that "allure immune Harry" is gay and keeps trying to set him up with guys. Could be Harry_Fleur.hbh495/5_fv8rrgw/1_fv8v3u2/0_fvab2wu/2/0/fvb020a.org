A poor one at that.

The number of half-decent fics I've read with the "allure" is zero. All of them reduce Fleur to "Oh woe is me, all the baays want saxx and all the grills hate moi for stealing their baays, boohoo".

That's a far cry from the confident, popular Fleur we see in canon.

Avoid the allure. Write something decent.
