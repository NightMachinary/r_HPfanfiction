This entire point of OP's post was to come up with something to amuse people based on a common fanon trope. This is a good thing. A fun thing. And it would actually allow someone to write Fleur in the manner that you have deemed acceptable.

You bemoaning the fact that you've never found a decent fic that used the trope is irrelevant to the topic and your other post was dumb and unnecessary. Besides, for someone so disgusted by the mere thought of allure stories you seem to be quite the expert on the subject. So either you are a liar or a hypocrite.

Either way, let OP have their fun.
