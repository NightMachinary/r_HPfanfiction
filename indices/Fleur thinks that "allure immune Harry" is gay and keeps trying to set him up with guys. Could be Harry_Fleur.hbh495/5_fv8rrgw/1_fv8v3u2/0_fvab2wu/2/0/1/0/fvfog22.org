  write Fleur in the manner that you have deemed acceptable

The veela allure trope is a bad trope, nearly as bad as the Lord Potter trope. If you like reading the same trash over and over again, that's up to you. The allure trope turns Fleur into a single dimensional character - if you like reading about that all the time, then do so. But don't blame anyone else for having some standards.

I was responding to a comment thread where a person was talking about Fleur's ego - "if he doesn't find me attractive, he has to be gay!" reeks of an ego the size of the moon - when someone else said that it was a natural response to this shit allure. That's when you barged in with your bull.

  Besides, for someone so disgusted by the mere thought of allure stories you seem to be quite the expert on the subject.

The stories where Fleur isn't a single dimensional character, the good ones, you won't find this allure shit there. Try reading those instead
