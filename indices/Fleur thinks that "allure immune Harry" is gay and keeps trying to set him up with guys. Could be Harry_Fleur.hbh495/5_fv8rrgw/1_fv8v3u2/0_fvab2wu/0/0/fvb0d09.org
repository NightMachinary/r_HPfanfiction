At the finals, it takes an entire group of Veela singing and dancing to cause that effect. When they stop, so does the effect. This effect is never seen again, even in scenes where multiple veela are present, such as the chase after the finals, at Hogwarts before the final task, or at Fleur's wedding.

Taking that effect and giving it to every single Veela is the "allure" of fanon. And it is shit.
