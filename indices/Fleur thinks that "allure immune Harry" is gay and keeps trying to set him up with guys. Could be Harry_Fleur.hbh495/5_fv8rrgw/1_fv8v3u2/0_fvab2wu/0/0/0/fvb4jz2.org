  “Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.

  Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly.”

  “Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela *standing* in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.

  “I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!” one of them shouted. “I'm a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.” “No, you're not!” yelled his friend. “You're a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . . . but I'm a vampire hunter, I've killed about ninety so far ---”

  A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, “I'm about to become the youngest-ever Minister of Magic, I am.”

  “I don't know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again. “What was I playing at? There were people --- all around --- I've gone mad --- everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall --- she was *standing* there talking to Diggory --- and it sort of came over me --- and I asked her!” Ron moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable.

  “She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn't even answer. And then --- I dunno --- I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.”

  ”She's part veela,” said Harry. “You were right --- her grandmother was one. It wasn't your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it --- but she was wasting her time. He's going with Cho Chang.”

  “Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.”

Again, fanon isn't perfect. But unlike, say, Daphne, writers are jumping from a not insubstantial stepping stone. There is a clear and established affect that Veela give off that can mess with men's heads. To pretend otherwise is to ignore evidence that doesn't fit what you've already decide to be true.
