Right, it takes an entire troupe of veela dancing to create that effect. When they stop dancing, that effect is gone.

This is never seen again in the series, even in scenes where multiple veela are present, such as the scenes after finals when they encounter the veela, the morning before the third task when they see Fleur with her mother, at Fleur's wedding, where there are several veela present.

Taking that effect and giving it to every single Veela as a passive "allure" is pure fanon, and it is a shit idea.
