Except it!s not entirely unfounded. When the Veela cheerleaders start dancing harry looses all track and almost jumps out of the box. Now, Rowling could be VERY bad at writing teenage boys when they're... /distracted/.. but it's more likely that there's some magical effect going on there. Add to that Ron's behaviour around fleur, which, while yes could be hormones, is interesting when related back to the cheerleaders from earlier in the book, providing the suggestion of at least some kind of lust based influence, even if that influence is simply being unimaginably hot.
