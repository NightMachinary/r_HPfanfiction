Hmm. Let's see. We have his professors, of whom many tried to kill him and none had any kind of mentioned relationships. The vague â€˜order members' of whom some where probably male but by then it was probably too late for him. Remus was a mess, to put it simply. Sirius was twice the mess and is very dead.

Ahh, I thought of some. Minister Fudge, who also died... and, erm, Lucious Malfoy. And one of the Lestrange brothers. And uhm. Ahh, yes! Amos Diggory. There's also Bill Weasley, eventually, but I suppose he's met Fleur before that. The Lestrange brothers as well, come to think of it. Hermione's father via osmosis? Uhh... he probably /saw/ a lot of married people during the Triwizard Tournament and maybe he met some during the Slugclub event?

Lots of, err, unconventional relationships in this series. I suppose that's representative of real life, at least.
