It probably doesn't go by veela's own preferences, otherwise Ron wouldn't have been affected (unless Fleur and the stadium veelas like the attention of horny 14 year-olds very much). Moreover, we know not every male can be charmed - gay Albus Dumbledore and married Arthur Weasley don't seem to be affected. I'd say it amplifies other people's attraction. In this interpretation being a veela of any sexuality would suck. Just think of all then men who say things like 'she was asking for it' irl... and then imagine that they are using it against a veela girl and the worst thing is that they're kind of right, because she is magically making herself irresistible, just not for them specifically. The charm can probably be turned down (and then up) a bit to make veela's life easier, but it not being very selective would suck anyway.
