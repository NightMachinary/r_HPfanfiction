Why are you so offended? It's a reasonable trope (one that makes a lot sense in the context of the situation) for comedic laughs. It's situational irony, not a serious reflection of society. And I've literally never heard a female of this species say something along the lines of "he doesn't like me so is he gay?" online or in real life.
