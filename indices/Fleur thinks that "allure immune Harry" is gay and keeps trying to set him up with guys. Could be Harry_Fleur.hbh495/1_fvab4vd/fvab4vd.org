When Fleur first realized that 'arry Potter wasn't affected by her allure she nearly squealed. She new what that meant! When a boy wasn't attracted at all to a Veela, that almost always was a sign they were gay. It couldn't be anything else!

Certainly not some incredibly rare magical power that blocked her allure. That would be ridiculous.

There was no doubt about it. 'Arry Potter, boy who lived, was into other guys. And Fluer, a certified romantic expert who had read dozens upon dozens of strange books from Japan called /magma/ knew exactly what to do! She'd get her fellow champion a date to the Yule Ball in no time! She'd be the perfect wingwoman in disguise!

So with a little bit of planning she was able to put her plan into motion.

When everything was ready she tracked down 'Arry in the library. She grabbed over half a dozen books and, barely suppressing a smile, said, "'Arry! Could you please 'arry zese books for me? Zey are so heavy!"

Harry looked up from his homework, giving her a confused but polite smile, "Of course, Fleur."

Fleur almost giggled. The boy was so nice, perfect for who she planned to matchmake him with!

So the two set off down the corridors. And with so many books in Harry's arms the short boy could barely see above the stack, completely unaware of what was in front of him. Perfect.

At the end of the hallway one Draco Malfoy was speedingily walking towards the pair, eyes cast down on the confession letter in his hands. The note said to meet them in the library. And well... The Yule Ball was in a week and he needed a date (other than Pansy, hopefully). So here Draco was, nearly running to the library to find this secret admirer, unaware of the people in front of him.

Meanwhile, Fleur sneaks away. She'd let these two have their moment.

Harry was just starting to regret taking on so many heavy books when all of a sudden he ran into a wall. With a gasp, all of Fleur's books go flying and, trying to catching them, he falls forward and onto the wall.

But then the wall /falls down with him/ and he suddenly finds himself acutely aware of how fleshy and warm it is. And how it's /groaning/.

"Oh Merlin I'm so sorry!" Harry frantically scrambles off the /person/. His face burns in embarrasment.

He pats the ground around him, looking for his glasses that fell off in the fall, "I was just carrying so many books that I didn't see-"

"Oh sod off Potter!"

Harry's blood runs cold and he can't help but grimace, "Oh. It's you."

"Yes it's me! Don't be daft."

Harry ignores him in favor of picking up his glasses and sliding them on.

And there Draco was, in all his arrogant glory. Although there was a little satisfaction to be had in the young heir's messed up hair.

Harry groans.

Draco sneers.

"What're you doing here anyways, Potter? Finally decided to study? You were always dumber than the rest of us lot."

"I'm carrying Fluer's books. Which is something a decent person does. Not like /you/ would know."

The other student looks around, one eyebrow arched, "I don't see her."

Harry whirls around, "Huh? But she was just here..."

Draco snickers.

"Never mind that. What are you doing here?"

"I'll have you know, that I got a letter from an admirer asking me on a date! Really, it's no surprise that I've got witches just dying to spend time with me."

Draco smugly flashes him the letter.

Harry snorts, "Poor girl doesn't know what a big mistake she's making."

"Oh buzz off."

But Harry isn't listening. He's busy collecting his books. And it's then that he spots a peice of parchment laying on the ground. He's positive it wasn't there before. Fleur hasn't had him carrying any of her homework? Did she?

But he reaches down to pick it up anyways, quickly skimming the writing. And his heart drops into his stomach.

'/Dear Draco,/

/I've always admired you. You're so smart and attractive. Would you like to go to the Yule Ball with me?/

/Signed, your secret admirer,/

/Harry Potter/'

"WHAT!?" Harry screams.

He starts choking on air.

Draco's head snaps in his direction. And like a hawk his eyes go towards the letter in his enemy's hands.

"What is it Potter?" He jeers.

"N-nothing!"

Just as Harry is about to rip up the parchment, Draco snatches it out his hands reading it quickly.

Harry goes to grab the letter but the damage is done.

Draco's face goes slack jawed, "Signed your secret admirer... Harry Potter..."

Draco whips out his own confession letter and compares it to the one his most sworn enemy -- or at least he /thought/ he was his enemy -- had been holding. Was Potter really this love sick admirer he was supposed to meet?

After a moment he gives Harry a look, face straightening into something almost composed. He tugs at his collar, suddenly aware of how hot it felt.

"I uh... I didn't know you swung that way Potter."

Harry is literally willing to risk Azkaban to get out of this. So he points his want to the boy without any remorse.

"Obliviate."

A few unforgivables may also have been cast in the ensuing duel.

In another part of the castle Fluer is left unaware of the criminal acts being commited at this moment. Instead, she smiles as she pulls out a notebook and starts coming up with ship names.

By now she's certain they've tripped over eachother. Draco would have then helped the boy up, and then they would've found the forged confession note that she snuck onto the top of the pile of books. And because neither had a date they'd simply go together! It'd be just like her romance novels where the cold hearted aristocrat falls for the handsome and brash hero!

And it was such an obvious pairing too! She's surprised no one else saw their animosity as what it truly was, sexual tension. And lots of it.

Now then... Harloy or Drarry?
