I forgot that a thunderbird is actually something from FBaWTFT, so I initially cracked up, thinking of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_(TV_series][this]]. (Add a bracket after the link, reddit doesn't like URLs that end in brackets.)

I imagined Harry turning up to Hogwarts in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_machines#Thunderbird_1][Thunderbird 1]] instead of a flying Ford Anglia, him using Thunderbird 2 to have stuff delivered (trivial stuff, like sweets and odds and ends, not the kind of stuff you'd normally use a supersonic VTOL fusion-powered transport plane for), and him using Thunderbird 4 for the second task.
