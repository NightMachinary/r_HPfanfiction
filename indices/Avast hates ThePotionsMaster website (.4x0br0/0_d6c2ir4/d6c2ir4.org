I get the same problem. I don't know if it's a false positive or not and can't find any information about it.

If you want to take the chance and browse it anyway, you can add

#+begin_example
   thepotionsmaster.net/*
#+end_example

to your Avast exclusions (Settings > General > Exclusions) and it'll ignore it.
