It's never explicitly mentioned, but Neville is written as a bit of a wallflower and it generally implies that he's a bit left out.

I don't remember the specific quote, but in book six Neville and Luna are one of the few DA members to join the fight against the Death Eaters in Hogwarts and I vaguely remember a passage describing them as the loneliest members who had felt their membership of the DA the strongest, thus still carrying their fake galleons even a year later. It's been a while since I've actually read the books though
