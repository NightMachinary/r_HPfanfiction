It'd be interesting to see Neville be the one who saves her. He's a good candidate for it - he's terrified of it all but still willing to do what's right when he needs to. Even in first year he proved himself willing to stand up to Malfoy and his own housemates when he needed to.\\
He'd be lacking in ability to magically help, so maybe he rushes to her aid, a fumble later the trolls looming over him, which breaks Hermione out of her terror to save /him/. It'd leave them on decent grounds of equality, having essentially saved each other, and it'd form a bond between the two essentially pariahs of Gryffindor house. Maybe he'd develop his confidence a bit earlier and become his best self sooner.

It could develop into the dual duos of Gryffindor. Potter and Weasley, not the brightest but willing to charge into trouble and constantly finding themselves in it. And Longbottom and Granger, cautious and intelligent but driven to do the right thing anyway.

They both keep getting tangled up in the plots of Hogwarts, sometimes working together, sometimes competing to solve it first.
