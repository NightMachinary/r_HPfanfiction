that's a good point, I guess they only really became friends because harry and ron started including hermione out of guilt for nearly getting her killed, and she was thankful for them saving her life, even if she was only in that situation because of them in the first place.

And you're absolutely right, the butterflies of hermione not being in the golden trio are pretty big, not just with events, but with character development too.
