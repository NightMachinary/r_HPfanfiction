Hold up, Ron absolutely did not bully Hermione. And Harry absolutely does dislike her. He makes it clear in his thoughts multiple times.

As for the bullying thing, yeah, no. If you are clearly annoyed by someone, and they are just not taking the hint and keep being a condescending little shit to you, it doesn't make you a bully if you hit them where it hurts so that they finally fuck off. Ron, after being annoyed with Hermione for a while, finally exploded. Hermione was being a little shit since before the Sorting, managing to wait until Halloween shows way more patience than I'd be capable of when I was eleven. Hell, I wouldn't have that patience now and I'm twenty.
