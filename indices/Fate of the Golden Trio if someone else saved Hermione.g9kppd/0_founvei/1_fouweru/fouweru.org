As I read the canon /Ron/ didn't like and verbal (?) bully her. Harry just didn't disagree. Doesn't make it better but also doesn't mean that /he/ doesn't like her.

In such a scenario I can see two outcomes:

Harry becomes a bully too because he doesn't want to lose his friend (probably most if not whole subconsciously) (besides the two general paths of bully victims)

Or Harry becomes friendly with her because he feels guilty (independent of a fallout or not with Ron over the issue)
