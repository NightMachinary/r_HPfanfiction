They're not becoming friends without defeating the troll together either way. /They/ didn't like Hermione at all and Ron isn't apologizing. The person who comforts Hermione would have to be a ghost or a professor if we're keeping characterization the same.

Further divergence would be Harry falling off his broom causing him not to learn Nicolas Flamel's name. Keeping in line with Harry's canon characterization, he learns ways to keep himself from falling off his broom.

Canon can be derailed entirely by having TMR devour Ginny's soul as Harry only meets Myrtle because Hermione brews polyjuice. You can just as easily have Harry ask around about the girl who died the last time, but I prefer the former.
