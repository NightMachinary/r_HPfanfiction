That fic is great, it's actually what gave me the idea for the second scenario I suggested (the first scenario more or less occurs in 'The Doll Gamer' linkffn(13203887) but has harry and ron apologising to hermione and they all become friends still, although hermione seems to have stronger feelings for the SI who saved her.)

one thing that gets me though is that harry and ron are still somehow able to beat the traps and defeat quirrellmort, although maybe that's just me thinking too little of harry and rons abilities (the fact that hufflepuff gets screwed over like slytherin in canon may also have given me an irrational dislike of them though).
