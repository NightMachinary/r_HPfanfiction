One thing to remember is that Harry and Ron go to stay with Sirius (and presumably some sort of minder [Remus] as it's unlikely he's in any state to host kids by himself immediately after leaving Azkaban. Plenty of time to ask questions and get knowledge. The Flamel revelation came from a chocolate frog card, Harry can outfly the keys, Quirrelmort takes care of the troll and the chess set seems to be made for Ron. Since it seems that they are (or at least Harry is) something like actually friends with Neville here (for now as he tries his best to balance on that tightrope) having more Herbology knowledge offhand isn't unreasonable. And indeed, as "ways to attack a plant" go burning that motherfucker seems pretty instinctual no matter the exact species. The only /real/ problem is Snape's trap. And while Ron may not be familiar with logic puzzles and Riddles of that nature (heh), Harry himself isn't dumb. Especially given he's been forced to apply himself more than in canon. It might take longer than in canon, but the tragedy of this isn't that there is a time limit but the exact opposite. The Mirror of Erised was working as intended and Harry showing up nearly ruined everything.

 

I will say though that reading the final House points scene, I couldn't help but feel genuine anger at what had taken place. There ought to be a Hufflepuff boycott when the same thing happens next year (because you /know/ it will, even if Kasey manages to safely store the diary with no one being possesed.)
