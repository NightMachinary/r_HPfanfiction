I reccomend checking out What's Her Name In Hufflepuff linkffn(13041698) (there is extra/omake content in the relevant spacebattles thread). In it, Kasey (the PoV character) actually ends up comforting Hermione in a girls' bathroom earlier in the year. In doing so Kasey makes it explicitly clear that they are friends. So, when it happens, Ron's "It's no wonder she hasn't got any friends!" line doesn't hit near as hard or near the mark. So Hermione goes to dinner as normal.

 

I don't wish to spoil any more of the fic but I will simply say this. In the canon book series, what little free time Hermione has, not spent jockeying to be the top student of the year is instead spent solving various mysteries and trying to keep their trio alive. Here, she does not have that distraction. Harry and Ron very much learn that, for all that she isn't the easiest to get along with, you very much do /not/ want a vindictive Hermione with actual free time on her hands on the opposite side of you.
