I guess it would be pretty unique for hermione to not be friends with harry and ron, it feels like a lot of fics (or at least the ones where all 3 are in gyriffindor) stick to the canon series of events regardless of any and all changes the fic includes.

thanks for the rec, its pretty good, shame its only 3 chapters though.
