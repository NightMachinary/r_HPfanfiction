Most SIs I've read side with the 'good guys' even if they then turn around and act a lot like the bad guys. Like in that Lockhart SI where he murders the Dursleys.

I don't think I've ever seen an SI that actively sides with Voldemort and the death eaters. Most likely because unless you insert AS Voldemort, you really ought to know better than to trust him enough to work with/for him.

The only openly antagonistic SI I've ever read involved a detour through the wringer that is Warhammer and the psychotic result running amok in Buffy... And it was... Not my cup of tea.
