This assumes that you've landed in canon as you've interpreted it.

Would you bet YOUR OWN life on that?

I'd have to do a lot of careful investigation to make sure the world matched my recollection of the books before I risked reaching out to anyone. Even though I agree that canon Dumbledore would be a reasonably good person to turn states evidence to... I can't be sure that I'm right about the Dumbledore in the world I landed in.
