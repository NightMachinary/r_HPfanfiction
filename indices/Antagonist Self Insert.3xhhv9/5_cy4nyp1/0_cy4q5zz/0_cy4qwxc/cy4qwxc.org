Well, that really depends on the type of story.

Most SI stories turn you into a witch or wizard as part of the transition. You'd probably be a muggleborn unless you're doing a possession style SI where you replace the mind of an existing pureblood.

Actually, that would be one way to do it... Self insert "accidentally" into the body of an already established death eater with a war record that means changing teams is a death sentence.
