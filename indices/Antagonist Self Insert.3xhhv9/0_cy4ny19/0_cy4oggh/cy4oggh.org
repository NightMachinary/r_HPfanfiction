Something I've been looking for, and haven't found yet, is an "SI" or Peggy Sue story where the POV is another character trying to figure out what happened.

Like... Hermione trying to solve the mystery of why Harry suddenly acts differently, or why Draco is suddenly nicer, and only acts like a douche canoe when he remembers he's supposed to be one.
