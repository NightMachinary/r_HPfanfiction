Given that the galleon to GBP exchange rate in canon is far below the Muggle gold to GBP rate, and yet arbitrage does not occur, I think we can assume either:

1. the galleon to GBP exchange trade is extremely regulated and has limited liquidity, or

2. the value of a galleon is set by wizarding government rather than being based on the value of the gold it is made of (i.e. it is a pinned fiat currency). Further, the gold cannot be melted down due to Goblin enchantments on the coins.

Either one of these, or both, would prevent a change in the value of gold/silver in the Muggle world from affecting the wizarding economy.
