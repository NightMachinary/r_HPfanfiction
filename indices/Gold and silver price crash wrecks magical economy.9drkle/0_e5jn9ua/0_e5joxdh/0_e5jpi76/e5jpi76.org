Wizards use the word "gold" as interchangeable with "galleon". They are always described as gold. While it is possible that they are an alloy, the literal reading of canon would seem to heavily lean against this. And once you get into the business of unreliable narrator and interpreting canon against its literal meaning, you kinda lose the concept or canon as a standard of correctness. Which makes debate pointless.
