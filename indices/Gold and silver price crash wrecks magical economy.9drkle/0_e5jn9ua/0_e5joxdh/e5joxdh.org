  Given that the galleon to GBP exchange rate in canon is far below the Muggle gold to GBP rate
#+end_quote

I'm not sure we can say that with 100% certainty since we don't know about much gold a galleon contains.

The galleon could contain a ton of gold magically shrunken, a gram magically expanded or some more reasonable amount in an alloy with base metals. Its only if we assume galleons are 24 carats gold chunks that this problem occurs.
