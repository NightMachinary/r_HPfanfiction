I have a suspicion goblins have had to do /something/ to prevent wizards from taking their gold out of circulation. Possibly a way to inhibit destruction. I mean, otherwise thats what would /have already happened in canon/ and all muggleborns would be beyond rich. Of course, if they did that the Minsitry would probably step in under threat of the Goblins withholding the funds.

Basically, the system seems to be built on a tenuous balance between the wizards/goblins. Wizards provide certain magical capabilities and agree to follow the goblins system (as well as enforce it on their society) while the goblins agree to act in good faith with the gold (which would explain why they still kept vaults active for families like the Lestranges or Blacks who were all either dead or permanently incarcerated in theory).
