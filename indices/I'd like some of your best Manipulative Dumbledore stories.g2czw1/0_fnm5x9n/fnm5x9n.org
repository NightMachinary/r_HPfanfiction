Try this one. This is ff with EVIL EVIL Dumbledore. Harry is in Ravenclaw and it is a major AU.

in this fic Dumbledore is an enemy to the Black family. he is not the main focus of the story, a bit on the side, but I liked the idea of Black family runes and magic.

​

For Mentor Snape - try this one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]] It is very dark and centers on Harry being abused by Dursleys, so not sure if you would like it, but it is very well written and I liked the psychology in that.
