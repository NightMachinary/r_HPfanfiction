If I had to choose, I prefer character development beyond anything else. I like the somewhat self aware Harry.

Definitely Voldemort Vs Harry centric. Definitely H/Hr, but it definitely doesn't have to obvious.

I generally like to read fics where Harry is canon age. I only like post-Hogwarts if it's a Harry who still hasn't beaten Voldemort or the Death Eater collection.

I'm really looking for another good showdown story. Nothing more than that.
