Any other information on which kind of fics do you prefer? More character development or more plot and action? More logical or more mystical worldbuilding? With or without Voldemort plotline?

My favorite H/Hr has a good different Voldemort subplot in the beginning followed by an original plot about Harry and Ron's auror career and Hermione's 'career', has a really slow romance, logical worldbuilding and great action and is from 2017-2018: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)
