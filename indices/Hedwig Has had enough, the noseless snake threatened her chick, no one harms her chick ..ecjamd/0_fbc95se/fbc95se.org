I forget the name of the fic, but this reminds me of this scene in the owlery where Hedwig was in the top spot, and the owls of Harry's friends are all near her while she is attending "court". She made lots of mentions of bacon tariffs/offerings. Angry Harry or Runestone path.

Or the Crack path: Hedwig Unhinged or Laser Owl, Kung-fu Toad and I forget the Rat's name in that one Rorschach's Blot.
