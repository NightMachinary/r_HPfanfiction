linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695]]) Turn is a slash fic but I believe that it's done well and Harry is interested in woodworking (IIRC).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) has Harry interested in art in the beginning, but I can't remember if that continues.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]]) is a long series, but Harry often uses music to cast spells.
