linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson) has some of what you're looking for, the OC in question being an SI born as Draco's younger sister. No betrothals though.

There are a couple of fics about Andromeda too. Try this one.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anotherdreamer/D21_01a.html][December 21st 1997]]: /There were five of you, the heirs to all that was Black. You were to become the next generation of power-wizards. Born into privilege and taught to wield power, people noticed when you entered a room. Your clothes were impeccable, your language flawless. Your friends were handpicked. Your house at Hogwarts and life afterward predestined. What went wrong? How did you all fall apart?/

Just a oneshot though. There was a longer fic about andromeda, but I can't remember the name at the moment.
