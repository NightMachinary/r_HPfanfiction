Another idea: a Ravenclaw student that's a member of the DA leaves Hogwarts after her fifth year as she's married to her betrothed, who is a Slytherin, I would love to see a scene where she talks to Hermione about prejudice and how from her point of view, most of the prejudice against muggle-borns and blood traitors is based in envy of the freedom they hold.
