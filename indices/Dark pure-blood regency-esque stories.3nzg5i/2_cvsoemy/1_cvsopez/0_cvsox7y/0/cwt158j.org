I know it's been a month, but I thought I'd respond now I've finally taken the time to read it.

I absolutely *loved* the first 41 chapters. unfortunately now, only a few chapters later, I've lost pretty much all interest. Between the guns, 'red eyes', agreeing to at least 'ten pregnancies' and a few other things, I have not decided to read any further (I read up to chapter 46).

Thank you for the recommendation though, as the first 41 chapters were /very/ enjoyable.
