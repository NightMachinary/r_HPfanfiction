No real knowledge of the anime is required, though a quick google search of The Varia might help you understand the anime characters as they are introduced (not necessary until Chapter 42 and later, from what I recall).

Plus, the cross doesn't even technically happen until Chapter 42 (though the flame/soul colors are an aspect of the crossover, but are adequately explained within the story to not need external knowledge), so that's nearly half of a 363,195 word story to get into it and see if you'll end up liking it enough to tolerate the anime aspect.
