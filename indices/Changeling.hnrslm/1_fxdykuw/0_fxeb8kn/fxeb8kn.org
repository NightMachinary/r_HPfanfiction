Having sensed that there was something special about the child (regarding his destiny), Harry is raised by one of the Fae queens as her own (subplot is the bickering/potential conflicts with deposed queens trying to retake the throne from his mother).

He has a very orange and blue mentality, like a fae's, but has human intrigue, hence his decision to go to Hogwarts.

Once there, Dumbledore and the other professors try to, essentially, teach him humanity ('red versus blue' thinking), so he can at least consciously understand it than "becoming" human.

They have to step in because he very often tries to resort to "fae justice"/meets out cruel (by human standards) punishment to slights on him.

It's also embarrassing because various fae try to meet him and 'blow his cover' among his classmates.

Of course, a few of the more superstitious purebloods end up recognizing something is "off" about him, and they decide to steer clear (like the Weasleys, though Ginny being fascinated with him complicates matters).

If the Triwizard goes down in this butterflied universe, Fleur ends up recognizing him immediately: Her surname 'Of the Court' is very literal, as she's part of a lower-in-rank family in the fae caste system. They're also viewed with general disdain because her grandmother married a human, despite their heritage.

It also makes her very nervous, as she knows of him and how he could obliterate her family in a heartbeat, if slighted (literally: He could have them /all/ put to sword).

Her maternal family is pressuring her to pursue him: Marrying into the highest parts of fae royalty would wipe out any stigma.

Fortunately, he seems to have taken a brotherly shine to Gabrielle, albeit his lessons in fae politics/behaviour do frighten her mother and father.
