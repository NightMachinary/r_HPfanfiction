Quoth. As in "Quoth the raven, nevermore".

On a more serious note:

- Blackquill (in the vein of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs)
- Spook (double meaning - ravens are associated with horror, but also spying.)
- Huginn/Muninn (Odin's raven spies in Norse Mythology)
- Merle (Old French for a blackbird)
- Rowena (Ravenclaw)
