The original nicknames - moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs - are made up by 15 year boys and aren't too creative.

If you're looking for stuff in the same vein, you may wish to consider something like 'Pinion' or 'Plumes', 'Quills' or something that's just an uncommon word that a raven has compounded with a body part.

Alternatively, animagus forms don't actually require a nickname and I've never really understood the desire to give them nicknames.
