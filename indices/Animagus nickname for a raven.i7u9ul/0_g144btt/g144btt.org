Sharpbeak, Longtongue, Blackfeather, Niffler (as both species love shiny objects), Chatterbox [[https://youtu.be/9I5Vm_YO_MY][Ravens, Crows, and other Corvids, are capable of mimicking human speech and individual voices far better than parrots]], Omen, Black Snidget (the magical animal in HP world the Golden Snitch is based off is the Golden Snidget), and lastly silvertongue.
