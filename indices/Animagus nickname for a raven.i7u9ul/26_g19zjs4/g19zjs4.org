Talons.

Moony, as a name, is an outlier. Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are all names based on an anatomical feature, and at that an anatomical feature that isn't especially identifying/revealing. Wormtail has a fat rat tail that looks like a worm, boom, Wormtail. Padfoot had pads on his feet, boom, Padfoot. Prongs has prongs, boom, Prongs. Very simple.

Talons has talons, boom, Talons. Very simple, based on an anatomical feature.

A lot of people already have negative associations with OCs. If it were me, I would aim for a name that errs on the side of being simple and unadorned, like Prongs, rather than trying to come up with an original composite word like Wormtail or Padfoot. That seems like a very easy way to get readers to roll their eyes and say "great, looks like this is gonna be another 'cool' animagus OC with a 'cool' name."
