Just a heads up, don't expect a sequel for wind shear. Chilord died a few years back. Stage 4 cancer.

Echoes of the Fallen is probably my favorite fics of his. It's a buffy the vampire slayer fic. Somewhat a YAHF, as well. Has Xander dressing as Magneto for Halloween and being left with his memories afterwards. Its pretty much a character study.
