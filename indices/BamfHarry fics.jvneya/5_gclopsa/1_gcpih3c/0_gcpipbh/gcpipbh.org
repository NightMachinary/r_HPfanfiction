No prob, usually do anyway but was using the app. Here you go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter From A Parallel Universe]].

The author has a few other stories, though one is a harem and the other is a sequel to that one. Personally not really bothered by it unless it reads like a pokemon "Gotta catch 'em All" parody, but know some people intensely dislike it.
