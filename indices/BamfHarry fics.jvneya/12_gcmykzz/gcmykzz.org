Anytime someone asks for an OP!Harry fic, i have to recommend mine.

Slow-burn powerup, creative combat, action-heavy, and believable. International travel, to places and settings almost never used in fanfics, canon is thrown out the window after First Year.

Just updated it, only 1 more chapter til it's complete. If you read one action story this year, make it linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

Focus on wandless magic. Muggle OC is an important side character, but no muggles vs. magic.
