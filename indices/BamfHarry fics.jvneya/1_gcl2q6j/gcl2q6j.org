I just finished Stepping Back. Its a time travel fic and Harry is super powerful. It checks off a lot on that list you gave. It was okay. Not my favorite, but I finished it and it was good to pass the time with. VERY LONG. 300k+ words. It has a Harry/Bella pairing which isn't my cup of tea, but no smut.
