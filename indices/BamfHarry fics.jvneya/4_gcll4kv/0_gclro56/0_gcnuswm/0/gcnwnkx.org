I would say you can enjoy it without knowing anything about it. But since I had played the games, even if it was pretty long before I read it, I can't really say for certain. He usually does a great job of explaining any crossover universe tho. I didn't know anything about "Hawaii-Five-0" or "Rosario + Vampire" and still enjoyed his crossovers. So maybe just give it a go, or read a very short summary about the Mass Effect universe if you feel totally lost, but I doubt you will. It is definitely worth it.
