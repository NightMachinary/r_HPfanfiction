aha my time to shine! tomarry is /saturated/ with bamf harry.

(Please note these are all my /opinions./ Not facts.)

​

Inevitabilities linkao3(16308554) is a personal favourite. I love EclipseWing's writing style to death.

Diagnosis linkao3(12707139) is a masterpiece. Medical AU where Harry is so fucking cool I love him here. All of MaidenMotherCrone's fics just hit the spot. I know you said no crossovers but Fairest linkao3(11614332) was so good I have to at least link it. It's GoT/ASOIAF but with HP characters and is frankly fucking amazing.

Full Circle linkao3(6614155) is humour and hasn't updated for a while but it's immensely satisfying to read.

​

The following contain underage relationships:

Linkffn(5402147) is a favourite to reread.

Linkffn( 8195669 ) is more Hogwarts based.

Linkffn(4924413) is enthralling. Utterly enthralling.

​

And finally a few classics: (I'm too lazy to comment about these but they're classics imo.)

Linkffn(8149841)

Linkffn(6985795)

Linkffn(3532054)

Linkao3(10404927)
