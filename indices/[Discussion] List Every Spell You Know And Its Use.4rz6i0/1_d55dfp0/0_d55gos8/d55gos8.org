  Original spells from authors /belong to that author/, and if such spells are used elsewhere the original authors permission must be granted.

But this is a subreddit dedicated precisely to fanfiction, i.e. using other people's work as a base without explicit permission from them. I agree that using someone else's ideas without crediting them is bad practice and maybe ethically not great, but there's no 'permission /must/ be granted' involved - maybe '/should/', but not '/must/'
