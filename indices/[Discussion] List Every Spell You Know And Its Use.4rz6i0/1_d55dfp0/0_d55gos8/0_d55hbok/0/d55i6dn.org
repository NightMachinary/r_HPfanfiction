I agree that it's in bad taste or whatever, but I think it's fundamentally strange to have a rule that says 'if you write a story about someone else's work, without asking the author for permission, nobody can write a story using elements of your work without asking you for permission'. Should you do it? No. /Could/ you do it? Probably.
