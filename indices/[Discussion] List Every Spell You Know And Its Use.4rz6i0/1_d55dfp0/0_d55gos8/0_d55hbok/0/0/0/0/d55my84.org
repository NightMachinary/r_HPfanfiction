That seems quite sensible. After all, there's only so many interesting plot ideas available, and while some are awful and should never have seen the light of day (Lord Potter-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-not-Hufflepuff-because-it-sucks-Black-Merlin-sorry-that-should-be-spelled-Myrddin-Weasley stories are universally terrible ime), a lot of them have been conceived of, repeated, refined, parodied and finally perfected, something only possible if you have a lot of people writing the same sort of story and building on each others' work.
