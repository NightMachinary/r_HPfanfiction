I agree with both of you, I think. A bit. Do I avoid reading certain stories if I think I might write from that starting point someday? Do I take care not to knowingly rip off or recycle someone else's work? Sure! It's just fun for me that way.

Do I imagine that all of us writing fanfiction from the same seven books could have stories that echo or mirror someone else's? Yeah, it seems pretty likely.

Do I roll my eyes when I see a warning on a fanfiction that explains which parts are JKR and which parts are "MINE!" as if Author has his arm protectively curled around a plastic tray of cafeteria food? I sure do. Man, no one wants your beef stroganoff.

Do I care if I throw a bit of an idea up in a forum and someone else runs with it first? Nope. Will it stop me from writing something later when I get around to it? Nope.
