/u/[[https://www.reddit.com/user/will1707/][will1707]] and [[/u/hrmdurr]] i think in writing class they teach it as tension. whether it is a challenging to the protagonist as hurdles to overcome, clues to solve or angst to resolve or something else. i think quite a few mainstream authors sometimes lack in this bit and just about all hp fanfics are lacking true tension to make the story flow
