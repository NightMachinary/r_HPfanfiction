It's possible? I've never read Agatha Christie tbh - straight up mysteries have never really been my thing.

A famous example of man vs self would be Hamlet and the whole 'to be or not to be' thing - he's struggling with depression and considering suicide. There's also some dude that he's conflicted about murdering, but I don't remember the details at this point lol. Another would be pretty much the entire Fight Club book.

But yeah - you absolutely need both. I haven't taken a writing class before (it didn't fit my schedule back in high school), but my lit classes all focused on conflict over tension. Or at least they didn't call it out beyond the odd discussion about foreshadowing.
