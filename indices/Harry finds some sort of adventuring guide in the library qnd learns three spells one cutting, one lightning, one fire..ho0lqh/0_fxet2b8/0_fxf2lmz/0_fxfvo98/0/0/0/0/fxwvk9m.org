Um, those examples you gave? Two out of three are conflict. Conflict is man vs man, man vs environment, man vs self etc. Clues, and foreshadowing, and things like that are tension - tension realized is conflict.

The fic in question is lacking in both, tbh. I mean, they're there: will he/won't he get caught staying at Hogwarts for the summer, will he/won't he find his properties, and so on. But they're... The story isn't really about conflict, it's just a mildly interesting journey/coming of age without any real obstacles.
