  mysteries have never really been my thing.

  A famous example of man vs self would be Hamlet and the whole 'to be or not to be' thing - he's struggling with depression and considering suicide. There's also some dude that he's conflicted about murdering, but I don't remember the details at this point lol. Another would be pretty much the entire Fight Club book.

  But yeah - you absolutely need both. I haven't taken a writing
