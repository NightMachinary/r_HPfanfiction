I'm presuming that you're not wanting WBWL stories, though. Here are some:

linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB). In a yes-and-no way.

linkffn(Return of the Parents by AutumnBreeze12). Lily and James wake up in the wreckage of the cottage 14 years later.

linkffn(The Last Casualties by muggledad). Voldemort didn't kill Lily and James; he sent them forward in time, expecting them to arrive in a time when he ruled the world.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Sethrael by MadScribbler). Harry is also subject to an Elvish prophecy; meets his parents in the Summerlands.

linkffn(Blank Slate by tresmaraudeur). Lily and James were obliviated and sent to live in the muggle world. Their memory starts to return when their daughter gets her Hogwarts letter.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe). Not quite what you're looking for, since it involves Harry time-traveling back to the Marauders era.

linkffn(A Place Where I Belong by Corwalch). Lily & James left Harry with Dumbledore and went to America. When they return, Harry leaves before they can meet him. They try to track him down. Crossover with Stargate SG-1.
