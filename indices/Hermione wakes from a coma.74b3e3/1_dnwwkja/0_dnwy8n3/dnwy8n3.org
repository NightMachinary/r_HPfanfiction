The change is relevant for me. Although she is in a coma things change, not only around her but she herself as well. She grows older, her hair and nails grow longer. For me being petrified was always more a situation of stasis. Like, the time for Hermione just stopped running in CoS, although it continued for everyone else. This is probably only my headcanon, but that's how I saw it.

Edit: On second thought though I think I'm open for everything I can get. So being petrified is okay, as long as it's over a longer range if time.
