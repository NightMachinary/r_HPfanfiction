No, there's no coma in this one. I'm almost positive the story Meiyou was thinking of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056132/1/Heart-With-No-Companion][Heart With No Companion]] linkffn(2056132), which is all about Hermione's cursed coma and Snape's attempts to revive her. It's been ages since I've read it, but I remember enjoying it quite a bit.
