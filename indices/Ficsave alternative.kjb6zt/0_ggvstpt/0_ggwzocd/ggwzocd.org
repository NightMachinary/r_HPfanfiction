+1 for calibre.

It'll also update all your in-progress fics and give you the most recent epub with a click of a button. Paired with a kindle or kindle app on your phone/tablet, and another button click will email the fic to your cloud library (though it will /not/ overwrite old versions, unfortunately).

Pair it with epubmerge (another plugin), and you can grab entire AO3 series' in one epub that once again can be updated all at once.

Fantastic resource without even touching on the library aspects of the program.
