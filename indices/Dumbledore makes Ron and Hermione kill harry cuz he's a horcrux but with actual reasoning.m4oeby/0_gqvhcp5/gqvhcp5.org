Maybe he even teaches them the killing curse but since it works with pure hatred they have trouble using it on Harry whom they genuinely love and are heartbroken over needing to kill him and they only succeed in casting it by focusing on their hatred for riddle. It is also a bit wish-fulfillmenty/deux-ex-machina for my taste but maybe that focus makes it so that the curse only strikes riddles soul from harry's body.if you wanna go the tragic bait and switch route you can have them still be unsure if it worked/if riddle is gone and not believe Harry saying it's the case because it's what any villain with a brain would do as well so with tears in their eyes they finish the job some other way
