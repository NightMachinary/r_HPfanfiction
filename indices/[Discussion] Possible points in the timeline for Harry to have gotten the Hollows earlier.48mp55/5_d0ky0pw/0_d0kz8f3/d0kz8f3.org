True, but Harry would still needs to possess the items, and Dumbledore is notorious for withholding things he doesnt think Harry needs just yet. I doubt he'd hand the Hallows over to a first years student if he had any clue what they were; and considering his life long interest in them, he would. Harry would still need to win the wand from him, and Dumbledore coveted that sone horrendously.

So while getting the three things together isn't hard, getting them all together with Harry is significntly more finicky to work out from what i'm able to work out. This does get them closer to Harry earlier though, which would make it easier for him to have them quicker.
