I've always been of the opinion that the ring only enacts the death curse once you actually wear it, but when you touch it you are /compelled/ to wear it (mainly because I see no other reason for Dumbledore to wear it, since he was full aware the stone needed to be turned three times in his hand), so maybe you could explore that idea and have the ring full on hipnotizing Dumbles, to the point where he tries to attack Harry for ttrying to take it away.
