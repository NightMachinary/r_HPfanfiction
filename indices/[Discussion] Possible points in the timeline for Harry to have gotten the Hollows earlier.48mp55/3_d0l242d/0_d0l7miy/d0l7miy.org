That seems like a very logical series of events to me given what we kow about Dumbledore's handling of the horcruxes before he died.

I also agree it would be very complicated, but it would move a ot of things in the canon forward or make them completely redundant, like the horcrux hunt. That leaves more room after third year for things to go totally AU and have new things happen rather than a canon-rehash. So it would be hard to keep straight but if done right it would lead interesting places.
