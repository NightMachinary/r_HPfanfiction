The earliest possible point (aside from going completely AU) is probably sometime in third year.

End of Second year Dumbledore realises the diary was a Horcrux, over summer he does all the research he can on horcruxes and voldemort. At this point he has all the information necessary to start 'training' Harry like he did in sixth year. Lessons continue but instead of the cave this time Harry goes along to help with the shack. They manage to make their way inside but once Dumbledore realises the ring is the resurrection stone he goes to put it on, Harry noticing something isn't right disarms Dumbledore and grabs the ring. Harry is now the rightful owner of all three Deathly Hallows.

Where it goes from there really depends what being 'master of death' entails. Also trying to integrate this into the existing third year storyline seems complicated.
