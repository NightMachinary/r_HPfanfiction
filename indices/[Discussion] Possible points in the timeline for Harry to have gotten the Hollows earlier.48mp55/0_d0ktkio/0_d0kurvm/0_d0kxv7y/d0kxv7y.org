Elaborating on my idea above, what if Voldemort (or minion) kidnapped Harry to Riddle Manor during second year, Harry escapes and finds the ring and puts it on (no curse, just slow possession like diary) because it's offering him things (knowledge, skills, etc.). Then you have /two/ horcruxes in Hogwarts possessing people, but the diary is much further along. Eventually Harry rescues Ginny and destroys the diary (fighting the compulsion of the ring at the time), realizes the ring is similar and destroys it too, but the stone survives...
