I personally like to think that horcruxes by themselves don't really have any particular effect. The objects need to be futher enchanted to actually do anything. I mean, neither the cup or the diadem did shit (though the last one didn't had a chance) and Nagini acted like a normal snake. ANd there's Harry, of course. So, even assuming that you're following canon as close as possible (which seems you are), the mechanics of a Horcrux are vague enough for you to make it up. The ring being nothing more than a cursed ring is perfectly plausible, and the curse having no effect because it recognizes another piece of Voldemorts soul sounds as possible as anything.

Then of course there's the elder wand. Remember that Harry doen't have to disarm the elder wand- He simply needs to disarm whoever owns it at the time.
