The locket was not only against his bare skin (he wore it under his shirt, and he or someone else described it as being against their heart in a creepy way), it was against other people too. This would seem like the locket didn't choose Harry not to curse him, because it didn't curse anyone else either, or Dolores Umbridge when she wore it. The ring was Riddle's first horcrux, so it's possible he was being extra careful and decided to curse only that one, but none of the others.

If you have Harry running away from the minions 4th year like someone above mentioned, he could find the ring, but before he can touch it, he can hear people coming after him. He then slams the box/container closed without touching it, then shoves it in his pocket. How you deal with the touching and cursing thing after, I'm not sure.
