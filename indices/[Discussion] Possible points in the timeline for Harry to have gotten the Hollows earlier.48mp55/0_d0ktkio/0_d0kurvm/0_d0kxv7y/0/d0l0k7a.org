Could work! I think Harry would be a lot more skeeved out by the ring than Ginny was by the Diary though, since a diary makes at least a little sense in being able to communicate given what's known about magical books at the time (the books in the restricted section and monster book of monsters have similarly strange traits for example). A talking ring is a little less trustworthy in that sense.

The curse on the ring is still the biggest issue it has; maybe Dumbledore somehow gets harry to hand it over once he realizes its dark, fixes it, and then hands it back because he cant trust himself with the stone? Having harry present when the curse is removed would probably waylay the excitment that blinded him into putting it on without checking in canon.
