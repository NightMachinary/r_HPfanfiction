I really like this explanation of possible events; I actually hadn't even considered Harry finding the ring on his own and not having Dumbledore hand it over to him. This definitely adds more variety to how things could unfold.

My biggest holdup with having Harry get the ring in 4th year would be the horocrux bit; after his experiences in 2nd year I'd like to think he'd avoid objects that talk back or effect the mind if he gets an inkling they're doing it, and the horcrux's we've seen with that ability in the series (the diary) weren't terribly subtle about comunicating. Then again Ginny gets taken by it anyway, so who knows on that front.

I'd been toying with Harry accidentally disarming Dumbledore during one of his blowouts; he nearly destroyed Dumbledore's office at one point without meaning to, so accidentally tossing a wand out of a person's hand when he's feeling angry and threatened doesn't seem like a terrible stretch by any means. If Harry has his cloak on him and possesses the ring by that point, the wand might be swayed to accept that as a defeat to be reunited with the other hollows. After all, it goes with whoever is the strongest, and a person having 2/3rds of the hollows seems like a reasonable criteria to be considered the strongest. I'm still fiddling with that bit since it's not the strongest excuse in the world for Harry to get the wand, and I'd like to make it at least someone believeable he's gained ownership however he does it.

The possession disarming also seems like a good option, but might not work with the plot I personally have outlined. I'd still love to see someone write it out though. Having Harry accidentally 'mesh' with a Horcrux the way Ginny did with the diary seems like an interesting concept, especially if he's more cogniscent of it happening. Perhaps have its effects be less strong since he's a horcrux himself to allow him more free-will and keep things interesting. it's a fun thought to poke about with.
