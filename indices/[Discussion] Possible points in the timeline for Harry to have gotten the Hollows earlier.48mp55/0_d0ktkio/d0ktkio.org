I haven't used this much, but I would imagine the earliest possible scenario would be if Harry were to run away from Voldemort instead of taking the Portkey at the end of the graveyard ritual. Assuming the Death Eaters and all decided to let him run away, Harry might have been drawn to a ruined shack near the local manor in order to escape their pursuit. Feeling an odd pull between his scar and the object beneath the floorboards, Harry might have found the Ring horcrux and sensing that it was dark and powerful, took it away wrapped in a cloth.

What happens next depends a lot on how Harry escaped the graveyard and how he gets back to Hogwarts. If he has a long journey, the horcrux in the ring might 'convince' him to keep it secret from Dumbledore.

Eventually Harry needs to find a way to destroy the horcrux part, and if Dumbledore is there to save him when it all goes wrong, Harry might be in the position where he disarms the Headmaster while controlled. At that moment he would have the Deathstick's favor, access to the Stone and probably would be carrying the Cloak.
