Eh, how about this one.

Harry kills the basilisk at the end of second year but is too late to destroy the diary. Ginnymort attempts to flee but ends up in a duel with Dumbledore on the way out. S/he disarms Albus, who pulls a spare wand to continue, but Harry gets a lucky shot in and disarms Ginnymort, acquiring both Ginny's old wand and the Elder wand. Dumbledore subdues him/her. Harry gives the Elder wand back to Dumbledore, but since Dumbledore didn't reacquire it via conquest, Harry remains its true master.

Dumbledore utilizes a combination of legilimency and veritaserum on Ginnymort to discover what the diary was. Following up, he discovers Tom planned to make more, including the resurrection stone cum Gaunt family ring. Dumbledore spends the summer preparing, scouting different locations. At the beginning of Harry's third year, he goes to the Gaunt house and fails to be cautious upon seeing the resurrection stone in person. He makes it back to Hogwarts just in time to "leak his memories" (a la Snape), and then dies, leaving the ring to Harry to destroy.

I think it still fits, but it would basically speed up the story about 3-4 years compared to canon timeline. It is also very likely to run into the "preteens who act like adults" pitfall, but...yeah. The only real way to avoid that (that I can think of off the top of my head) is with lots of filler, a massive time skip, have that sequence be a flashback, or set it up as a (partial) frame narrative.
