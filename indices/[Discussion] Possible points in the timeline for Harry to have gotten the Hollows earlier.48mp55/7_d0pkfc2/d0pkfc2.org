The earliest I could think of would be first year. or the summer between first and second. Harry has the cloak on him when he goes to rescue the Stone. Quirrelmort kidnaps Harry, after harry fails to get the stone out of the Mirror. Quirrelmort ends up torturing Harry in Riddle Manor, and Harry escapes. Harry goes to the shack by accident and hides. Voldemort tells Quirrel that its pointless, Potter will die in the shack anyway. "Hisss body will feed the enchantments on that hovel" Harry, due to having a sliver of Voldemort's magic on him from where he was tortured by the man as he possessed Quirrel, or the soul shard in his forehead, allows him to slip past all but the curse on the ring itself. He hides there, finds the ring, and takes it with him. He exits the shack and says, "Professor Dumbledore would know what to do..." Fawkes appears, cuz Plot. He fireFlashes Harry back to Hogwarts, with the ring. The wards in the school pick up the curse on the ring, Dumbledore, knowing it is cursed, doesnt pick it up but does investigate it.

Second year happens, normally, except that Harry is a bit more paranoid and vigorous in class. He never wants to suffer that torture again. Dumbledore is focusing on figuring out how to break the curse on the ring, when the chamber opens. He doesnt know what the ring is, just that it is cursed and has the hallow in it. the rest of Second year happens, and when harry gives Dumbledore the diary, it all clicks for Dumbledore. He uses the sword to destroy the Horcrux, and hands Harry the ring back, maybe spouting some ancient magical law or some garbage. Harry wears it constantly.

Third year happens. Harry puts forth even more effort since he struggled with the basilisk. Lupin helps with his studies. Dumbledore takes interest, and decides to humor his student and see how good he is/train him/harry gets pissed. Harry disarms him by pure luck.

Now, you have a Dumbledore who is aware of horcurxes around the same time as canon, and a Harry who will end up around 3x as strong as canon since he started studying vigorously two years earlier. you can also stick relatively close to canon, or branch off where needed.
