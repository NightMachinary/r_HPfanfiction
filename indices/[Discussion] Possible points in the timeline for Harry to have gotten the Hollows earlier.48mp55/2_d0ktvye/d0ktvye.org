Voldemort has one of his minions kidnap Harry to Riddle Manor (for reasons); when Harry escapes (because plot) he briefly takes shelter in a nearby shack and finds a ring (which doesn't have massive protections for some reason, or maybe all you need is to be a parselmouth, or maybe Harry has some of Voldemort's memories, etc.).

Dumbledore realizes the diary is a horcrux and starts hunting the rest himself. You could have Dumbledore cursed and dying even before third year starts (or later, whenever) and he gives Harry the resurrection stone and lets Harry "defeat" him for the Elder Wand he knows Harry will need (maybe he doesn't even tell Harry that the wand is now his, but hides it for Harry to find later).
