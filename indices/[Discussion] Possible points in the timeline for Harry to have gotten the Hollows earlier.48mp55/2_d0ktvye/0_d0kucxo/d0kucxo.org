I feel like parts of both these options are viable; It's totally possible for harry to be abducted earlier in the series, since he wasn't really heavily guarded until Sirius escaped, and even then that was mostly by dementors, and they were there for the entire student body. Harry getting the wand by disarming Dumbledore, intentionally or not, would account for the wand, though the timing of when it happens would be crucial. Dumbledore may reason that death moves the wands ownership and not a disarming, and be convinced Harry isn't the master depending on the point in the timeline, or whatever.

I'd say Harry getting the ring on his own and not from Dumbledore probably opens up the most options in terms of when he can access it plotwise.

Thanks for sharing! It's always neat seeing how other people would construct a timeline around an idea, or interpret events to work. :)
