I think it's important to note here that Voldemort didn't know anything about the Hallows, and even Ollivander was unaware of the Deathstick's association with the Tale of the Three Brothers. The Hallows themselves are notoriously silent about their qualities. The Gaunts had the Resurrection Stone attached to their heirloom ring for generations without knowing of its powers, and Riddle made a horcrux of the ring without any indication that he sensed the stone was even enchanted.

The Elder Wand might be very intuitive at spellwork from its centuries of active use, but it gave no particular indication of where its allegiance truly rested. I can't think of a time that Harry even held it until after the final duel with Voldemort, and there wasn't a flash and pulse of happy power-jollies that came from Harry being its owner.
