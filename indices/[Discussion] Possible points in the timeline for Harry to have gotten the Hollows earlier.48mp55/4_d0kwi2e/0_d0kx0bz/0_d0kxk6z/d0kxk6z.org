That's true. As for the first reason, Voldemort became aware of the Hallows during the summer of 1997, right after HBP. So any time after that Harry could have heard about the deathstick when he was in Voldemorts mind.

The second point is very true. But in the end, you're changing canon, aren't you? So if you change the point at which Harry comes across the Hallows, why not change Hallows themselves?
