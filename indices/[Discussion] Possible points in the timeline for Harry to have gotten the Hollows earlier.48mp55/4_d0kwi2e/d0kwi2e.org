I can think of a couple of moments:

During Harry's outburst against Dumbledore after Sirius died, he gets a little more aggressive and conquers Dumbledore's wand, opening up a wealth of knowledge for him.

Right before the horcrux hunt begins, Harry has a peek into Voldemorts mind and finds out about the Hallows then.

While Harry's possessed in the ministry, Voldemort spurs Harry on to attack Dumbledore, using Harry's resentment of the man for holding back too much information.. Harry obtains the wand somehow.
