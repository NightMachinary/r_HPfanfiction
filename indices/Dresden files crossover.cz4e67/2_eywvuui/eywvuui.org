Harry Dresden pops up in the crossover-fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][Child Of The Storm]]. In an amusing scene, he encounters a rather unamused Magneto and promptly tries to hide behind the Scarlet Witch, who is over a foot shorter than he is!

One of the Big Bads ends up /terrified/ of Dresden, for very good reasons which include a mage-blast that sent him almost into orbit.
