There are a few that are readable. Not all of them are finished.

linkffn(3468902) - it's very good, but it's mostly a poweful, insane Harry in the Dresden Universe.

linkffn(7779108) - this is very unique. Again almost pure Dresden.

linkffn(11188292) - was interesting. There is a sequel by another author.

linkffn(6195236) - this is Ynyr, if you don't know what that means, just prepare for a VERY wild ride.

linkffn(6989216) - I remember it being decent.

linkffn(3513378) - as was this.

linkffn(12283457) - this is more recent and quite interesting.
