First of all, this sounds great so far. I would definitely read it. I love your character getting sorted to Hufflepuff and building unnoticed an army. (Great choice of name, btw 👍🏾). In which year is your main? In Harry's? If yes, I would give him Susan and Zach as good/best friends and possible love interests. I would let him also befriend a bunch of Ravenclaws, these two houses imo usually get along well with each other.
