My general critique from what you've provided already would be:

1. Names: Hadrian as a "Harry Potter AU" name is a meme at this point, you'll get a lot of hate for using that.

2. Orphanage: Why live in an orphanage? Isn't there anyone in the magical world who gives a shit about him? Is he directly targeted by Grindelwald's men or is his mothers death just incidental?

3. Most children of that age don't want to change the world. You're going to have to set up some series of events or revelations or discoveries that would make Harry decide to want to change the world, or at least, to set himself some kind of goal that when he tries to tackle that goal, he ends up changing the world.

4. The "invisible Hufflepuff Army" is also a bit of a meme. You'll get a lot of criticism for making it so easy for Harry to amass followers. Having Harry be a posterchild student in Slytherin and then have him befriend Hufflepuffs might be more entertaining to read. If he's "a little uncomfortable" about manipulating loyalties, then you need to reinforce his commitment to his goal so that he has to overcome or squash the discomfort and harden himself against self-criticism.

5. Bisexuality: Okay, whatever floats your boat. If it's done ham-handedly then you'll be accused of queerbaiting and people will be turned off by your fic. Don't force yourself to write a romantic subplot or romantic interest if you don't need to, and don't force it early just to get to writing "juicy smut" early on -- overly intimate romantic interests too soon/while young will kill any interest many people have to read on. It will be uncomfortable to read.

6. Friendships / Mentor: Google who was in the other Houses in Harry's year? Make stuff up if you need other characters. In this AU world with no Voldemort, it would make sense that there are different teachers and different students who are alive because Voldemort didn't survive to kill them or their parents/grandparents. Look up the "Sacred 28" Harry Potter families and invent characters for those names. Also invent some new Half-blood / Muggle-born characters besides who aren't on the Sacred 28 list. You can invent teachers and professors and older student(s) who might serve to be Harry's mentor figure. Harry needs to prove himself someone who they would /want/ to mentor, though. Harry Potter in canon didn't get special treatment for learning stuff except for Lupin/Patronus Charm stuff.

7. Figure out what to do with the canon elements that people will ask about. Is there a prophecy? Is it important in your world? Is there still a direct threat to life for Harry like Quirrell/DADA professors each year? What about Quidditch? What about Sirius Black (does he even exist? Is he free? Is he in Azkaban for something else?). Are the hallows important? Does not having a Horcrux affect Harry in any way? What are Lupin and Pettigrew doing? Does James Potter play a role anywhere? Do the Marauders even exist as a group? If Voldemort doesn't exist, then wouldn't the society have a different attitude towards Slytherin (because he was an heir to Slytherin and killed a lot of people)? You might be able to get away with putting Harry in Slytherin, but having Slytherin itself be a less hostile and sneaky House.
