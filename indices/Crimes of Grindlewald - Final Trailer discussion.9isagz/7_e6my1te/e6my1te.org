I hope it's another case of rushed trailer before the VFX teams could wrap up some shots because some of the green screen scenes look really unfinished, as do some of the big CGI scenes. But the ones that feel finished look amazing and I'm really excited to see it.

As for the actual story, it finally feels a bit more credible and serious than the last trailers, which is great. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie !
