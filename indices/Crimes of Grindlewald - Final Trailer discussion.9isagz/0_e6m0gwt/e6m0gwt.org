Apparently, the actress (Claudia Kim) plays a Maledictus, a female individual whose blood was cursed from birth, eventually leading to them turning into a beast. The cursed is passed down from mother to daughter (per Harry Potter wiki).

But I liked the final trailer, much more than the first two. It looks visually stunning and there's a lot going on. It makes me wonder how long the film will actually be. From this trailer and past ones, the filmmakers have a lot to fit in (unless they cut a lot out). Also, I wasn't much of a fan when they cast Johnny Depp but he looks pretty amazing in this one. The scene where he escapes MACUSA transport over New York looks to be a crowd-pleasing scene. Still can't say for sure if I'll see this in theatres (as I didn't like the first Fantastic Beasts).
