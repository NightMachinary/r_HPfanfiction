Bit surprising you won't go to theatres. I found Fantastic Beasts to be very enjoyable in theatres- great effects.

I'm not expecting these stories to be as rich as the HP series, but they seem like very entertaining movies, which I think will have maximum effect in an actual movie theatre. I rewatched FB when it came was put on HBO but I don't envision myself rewatching this series as much as the HP series, but I'll still catch up them all in theatres.
