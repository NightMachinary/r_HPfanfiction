I'm on the fence with seeing it in theatres or not. I saw the first one opening weekend and while I enjoyed the first half of the film, I found the second half to be a disaster. Afterwards, I saw it only once more (on television in a hotel in New York) and even then I was distracted through most of it and didn't really pay it much attention. This one does look better than the first but I'm not 100% sold on it just yet. I'll probably wait for the reviews before I make a decision.
