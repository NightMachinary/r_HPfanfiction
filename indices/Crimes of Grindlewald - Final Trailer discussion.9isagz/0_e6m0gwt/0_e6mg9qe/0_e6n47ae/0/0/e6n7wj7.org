If we get the full five films, one of them could take place in/around 1945 when Grindelwald is defeated, which would be a good time frame to have barely-adult Voldemort happenings. By that time he had at least two horcruxes made. But I'd hope it would be really minor, more of a passing thing or Dumbledore expressing concern.

Maybe Dumbledore consulted Newt when the Chamber was opened, but when Hagrid was 'caught' no amount of testimony would have swayed the ministry in favor of a half giant with an illegal pet.

(Thanks! Nice flair lol)
