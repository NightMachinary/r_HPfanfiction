The best trailer out of the three -- visually stunning is what immediately comes to mind. I do hope that magic can be portrayed and applied like the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore in OoTP. The magical world has SO much potential, yet it feels squandered by the fact that most wizards/witches don't know how to utilise it, compared to other magical universes.
