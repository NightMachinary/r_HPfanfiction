I strongly dislike Rowling for adding stuff that makes little sense if one relies on the original books as canon.

I even more so dislike the fact that "Crimes of Grindelwald" apparently is not mainly Dumbledore vs. Grindelwald, as it was supposed to be, but Newton Scamander frolicking through the world, saving the day. - For someone who supposedly is capable of defeating/subdueing Grindelwald he sure is mentioned little in the original canon books. Hmmm? No? Nobody else hates such discrepancies? Well okay then.
