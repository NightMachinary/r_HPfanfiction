I don't think Nagini's intelligence was /ever/ supposed to have anything to do with being a Horcrux; inasmuch as she acts intelligently in the main novels, she does so in ways that don't suggest her being a mind-clone of Voldemort.

And looking back to the Boa Constrictor encounter in /Philosopher's Stone/ (and the Basilisk having enough wit to know to obey the Heir of Slytherin and no one else), plus the very fact of Parseltongue's existence, it seems like snakes in the /Harry Potter/ universe are just smarter than in our world. I don't think Nagini was that special in this regard.
