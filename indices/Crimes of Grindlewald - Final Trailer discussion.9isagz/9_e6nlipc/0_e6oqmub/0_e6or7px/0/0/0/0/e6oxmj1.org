I don't care one way or the other about representation, but it's the sudden retconning that makes no sense that bugs the crap out of me. Seriously, Hermione isn't black because it was never pointed out when Harry first met her, unlike the clear mentions of Dean Thomas and Blaise Zabini. Dumbledore wasn't gay even though there's a line where he said it was the hardest thing he had to do to fight someone he once shared so many ideals with. That's not code for "I'm gay". That's just saying that if you're a cop and your buddy's a criminal and you have to go after them, it's going to be difficult for you but you have to do your job.
