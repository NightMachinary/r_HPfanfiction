I feel like we're thinking similarly. Not going to lie, I've been responding while finishing Bojack Horseman so I wasn't really typing very much.

I do not like that she is throwing out this information with the intent of looking woke, staying relevant, and drumming up interest in future projects.

I especially do not like it because it is 0% genuine. If Hermione was not white, if Dumbledore was gay, if ANYTHING - it should have been mentioned in the books, otherwise it comes across (almost definitely truthfully) as her pulling things out of her ass.

I hate it, a lot. Not just on a societal level, but in a very selfish way. As a person who is likely on the autism spectrum (please no one be a butthole about getting a diagnosis, my doctor and I are working together), Harry Potter has been my "special interest" of mine for 16 years. I grew up processing every event of my life, every confusing emotion I ever felt, through this lens.

And all of that feels like it's being cheapened by her shitty behavior.
