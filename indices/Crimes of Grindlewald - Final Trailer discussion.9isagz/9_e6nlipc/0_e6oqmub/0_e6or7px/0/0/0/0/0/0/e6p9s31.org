I completely agree. Like I said, I don't care if a character is gay or black or trans or whatever, but I don't want it shoehorned in after the plot has resolved itself. I didn't like her saying Dumbledore is gay not because I don't think a gay person can be powerful but because there was no proof or comment that he was gay. There was no dip into the pensieve that shows Dumbledore's feelings or his comments about how he felt towards Gellert. I don't like her saying Hermione could be black not because I'm racist (we're all a little racist, piss off) but because there was no mention in the books that Hermione was dark-skinned, whether it meant she was black, latina, Indian (from India), or Middle Eastern. The only time it was mentioned that Hermione's skin was dark in the books was during the opening chapters of PoA where it was mentioned she looked darker and Ron had freckles, both being indicators of looking different than they normally did. Ron wasn't mentioned as a white boy because that's the norm in 1990s Britain. The times you mention someone's skin color, or hair color, or anything, is when it stands out from the norm or you're trying to meet a word count minimum. In the prior's case as an example: you wouldn't describe a Saiyan's (from DBZ) hair color since all of them have jet-black hair. The only exceptions are Nappa (bald) and Trunks (half-saiyan with purple hair).
