You're not wrong. I wasn't saying it's a pedantry issue of using animagus in place of cursed to become a literal snake. It's more Rowling is kind of wrecking a wonderful world with all this crazy crap that makes no sense, even in the context of the world. That's not counting all the virtue-signaling she's doing on social media of "Oh, Dumbledore's gay" and "Hermione /could/ be non-white" despite none of it being clear in any of the books and it seems to be contradictory instead.
