I liked the trailer, there was just so much going on and it looked like there's going to be lots more beasts in the new movie.

I wasn't sure about the Nagini thing but I read that Nagini is actually in Indian mythology as being able to transform between snake and human, which sold me on it.

I loved the last bit of the trailer, "I think that might have been the greatest moment of my life", Theseus and Newt clearly do not get along.
