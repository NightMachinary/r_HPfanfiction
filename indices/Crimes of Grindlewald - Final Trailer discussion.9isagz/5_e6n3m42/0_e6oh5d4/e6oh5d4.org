Nagini is a female Naga. I grew up with this myth. It's popular in India, Indonesia etc. When I first read about Nagini in GOF, I knew there must ne some sort of connection with the myth but it wasnt really explored. JK said on her tweet(and also from a set report) that this Nagini is from Indonesia(where Im from). I think that's pretty cool.
