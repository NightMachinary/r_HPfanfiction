As for me, I just thought she was a /friend/ of his --- a snake Bellatrix, all the more devoted to him because he was the only wizard who saw her as an individual rather than an animal. And I suppose we might get /something/ like that with the retcon, but I really liked the idea of a snake character with actual agency for a change. (Dammit, Rowling! You don't establish that snakes are sentient in your world and then don't feature any interesting snake characters!)
