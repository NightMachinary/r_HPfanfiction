I've never seen a theory that harry is or was an obscurial. That doesn't even make sense. It 100% makes sense that Ariana was an obscurial and that's how she injured people and died from her own repressed magic. Jk has shown boxes of notes on details from the books that date back to the early 90s. Just because you don't like these things doesn't mean she didn't plan any of it out. I'm sure some things are embellished but this part of the plot actually makes sense.
