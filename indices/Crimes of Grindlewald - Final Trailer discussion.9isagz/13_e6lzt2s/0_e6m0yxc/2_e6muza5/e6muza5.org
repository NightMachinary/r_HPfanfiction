  By your logic, all movies are cash grabs then. The MCU, Bumblebee, Marry Poppins Returns, etc., etc.

Well, yeah, to play devil's advocate for a bit, I think there's an argument to be made that these are "cash-grabs" more than other movies might have been. You could define cash-grabs as when the producers specifically decide to make movies along a certain template because it'll make money, as opposed to writers and directors coming up with a project first and then asking for funding.

Before anyone asks, this is kinda-sorta-but-not-really true of the /FB/ films. They /exist/ for an extremely cashgrabby reason --- we know this because Warner Bros. decided to make them on their own, then started looking for a writer. However, the end product is what happened when Rowling heard of the cashgrabby scheme, highjacked it, and went "well if you're doing a /Fantastic Beast/ story you won't do any of the lame nonsense your writers were going with, /I'/m going to be writing it /my way/ as an /ambitious epic/ and you just hang on to your veeblefetzers".
