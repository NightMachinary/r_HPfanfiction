Anyone curious about the Deathly Hallow symbol in both trailers? Clearly the elder wand is involved in the movies, but by having the full symbol (and having just the stone and cloak in the most recent trailer), it seems to imply that the other hallows are relevant. I could imagine ways of getting the cloak involved, and they sound a lot like something from fanfiction - having Harry's grandfather participate in the fight against Grindlewald, for example.
