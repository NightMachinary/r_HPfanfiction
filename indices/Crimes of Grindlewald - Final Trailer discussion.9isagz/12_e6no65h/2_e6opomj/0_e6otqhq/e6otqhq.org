It's not about who the bad guy is or that the character's story is cruel, inhumane, etc. That would be fine. Racism, sexism, cruelty, etc. exists. No one (including myself) is saying not to include these things in stories (they can lead to excellent tropes and narrative subversions to critique the prevailing racism and sexism narratives in the current media). However, that's not the case here as JKR specifically combines this backstory with Nagini (the pet, servant, horcrux of a megalomaniac psychopath). The problem is that:

1) JKR specifically created this to solely dehumanize women (who already get enough dehumanization in media), and now this specifically with Nagini being dehumanized forever because she's literally forced to become a beast for the rest of her life.

2) Latinate curse being applied to an east Asian woman (who are already often portrayed polarisingly as either demure fainting flowers--Cho anyone?--or dragon ladies) with an Indian stage name... for whatever reason we don't know yet?

3) Putting said east Asian woman character to work into a wizarding circus full of living oddities (and, again, who later becomes a servant).

There's a million other options JKR could have done. Created a new character, kept her as Nagini and made a narrative about appropriation and the issue of racism, slavery, etc. but out of everything she chose this. But we all know that it's really JKR pulling a marketing stunt. She's trying to tie everything back to the original storyline to keep attention.
