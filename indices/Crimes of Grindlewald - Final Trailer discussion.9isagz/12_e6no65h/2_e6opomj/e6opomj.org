Since we're talking about curses and villainous masters, I don't think it's a case of 'unfortunate' implications. The ones inflicting the Maledictus, the ones using Nagini as a servant or circus attraction or monster -- they're Bad Guys. Of course it's cruel, inhumane, unjust, and otherwise nasty. That's why we want the heroes to /fuckin' kick their sorry arses into the Fiendfyre/.
