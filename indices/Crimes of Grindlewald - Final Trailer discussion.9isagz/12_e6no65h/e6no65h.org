The trailer as a whole was very nice and well done.

Nagini being a maledictus, I have to admit, I'm a bit mad about. Removing agency from women and forcibly turning them into a beast... and Nagini specifically, who is a woman of color, essentially ends up as a pet/slave (he sends her on missions, milks her venom, gives her orders, and people call Voldemort her master) to a white supremacist? Like... did JKR not stop and think literally one moment in the past 20 years (so she claims) that she's been thinking about this about how sexist and racist that is?
