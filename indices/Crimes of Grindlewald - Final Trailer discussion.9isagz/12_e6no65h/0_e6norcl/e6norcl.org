Asian woman here. Does not think this is racist and haven't seen anybody of HP community around thought this is racist. Most people feel surprise/sad (beautiful girl has basically “terminal disease”). And she is a maledictus, which means she may be a full snake. In this case human slavery concept is not a thing as you won't say your pet is your slave. No need to jump to accusation so fast with so few information. And skin color is not a thing in HP. I didn't see Tom Riddle being white and the Nagini actor being colored people as improper.
