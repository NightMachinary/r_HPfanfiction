I'm also an Asian woman, so your point with that is...? This is the only place I've seen where people DON'T think it's racist or sexist. I've seen a TON of people who are pissed off about it (and, as per usual, that brings in the flood of all the other things JKR has done that are problematic).

Anyway, the fact is that Nagini is treated like a pet, but... she's still a human unwillingly stuck in the body of a beast who does Voldemort's bidding. That's... slavery. I'm not sure what else you would call it. As a human, she works in a circus and changes to a snake for entertainment. I'm not sure how you don't see how this isn't remotely problematic at all (not to mention, on top of the whole issue with Native American culture and Ilvermory, JKR has a running track of racist issues going on)? You can say skin color isn't a thing in HP, but there are mentions of it in the books (of both skin and ethnics) which are represented in the movies as well (Cho Chang, Patil twins, Lee Jordan, Dean Thomas, etc.). If you want to forget the Asian thing, it still doesn't remove the fact that this is a curse that only affects women (a curse that they can't revoke or consent to--the curse or the changing into a literal beast), and then we have Nagini. This could have been a whole thing about subversion, but instead it turns into another layer of racism and slavery.

And yeah, Tom Riddle is white. He's literally described as being "whiter than a skull."
