To be fair, I literally just finished reading this one. So I am still seeing it in the beautiful afterglow of having read a long, satisfying fic that feels complete even though it will forever be a WIP.

But I think linkffn(637123) will fit your requirements. Just get through the rather painful "Harry being a dumb dumb" beginning. The story gets interesting quickly, the action picks up big time in about chapter 9 or 10, and the combat is pretty interesting and original in a way that you only really see in older fics written before HBP and DH (in my opinion).
