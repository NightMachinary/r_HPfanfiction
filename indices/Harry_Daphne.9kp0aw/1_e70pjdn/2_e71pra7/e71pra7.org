Like they said, its basically just a way to pair together Harry with a Slytherin. I was into it for a while because I was interested in the inherent conflict of opposing worlds colliding and all that comes with that, but most of the stories erase any possible interpersonal conflict between the couple almost immediately (if there is any at all) and just have the drama come from other Slytherins and Gryffindors being against their love (especially Ron and Draco).

At this point I'd probably prefer a Harry/Pansy fic, but I'd still be happy to read more decent Haphne fics. But I will say, all the talk about her family being neutral just makes me think of those aliens from Futurama.
