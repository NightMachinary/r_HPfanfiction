  Because Daphne Greengrass is a canon character that people can use to fit the slot of ‘Pureblood Slytherin love interest'. She's only briefly mentioned in the books and is basically a blank slate that you can do a lot of things with. It's mostly a fanfiction thing since if you're just going off the books you probably have no idea who Daphne Greengrass or Tracey Davis are, but within fanfiction they've taken on a life of their own and they basically have fan-given personalities and character traits that aren't canon, but have been used so often that they might as well be.

  Daphne Greengrass

  smart

  Doesn't ‘truly' believe in Pureblood dogma

  Neutral

  Aloof and standoff-ish , kind of an introvert

  Really beautiful

  Cold

  Tracey Davis

  Extrovert

  Not dumb but not really smart either

  Warm and Friendly

  Both of these characters are almost universally treated as though they are best friends and have been basically their whole lives.

  I consider myself to be a Harry/Daphne shipper, but the truth of the matter is that it's not really ‘Daphne Greengrass' that people like to pair Harry with, it's more of an idea of an all around decent Slytherin that by pairing with Harry you can better tell a story of acceptance and unity, which is different than the rather divisive tone the canon pairings leave us with.
