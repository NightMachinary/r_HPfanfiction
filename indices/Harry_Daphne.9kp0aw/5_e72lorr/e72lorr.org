For me, the best ones are linkffn(The Mind Arts; Honour thy Blood; Paid in blood; Novocaine; A Fateful Walk; Harry Potter and End of War; Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin; Fratercullus)

Also, all of Dorothea Greengrasses' work. I also love The Legacy, but was already mentioned.

EDIT:linkffn(Ice Princess)
