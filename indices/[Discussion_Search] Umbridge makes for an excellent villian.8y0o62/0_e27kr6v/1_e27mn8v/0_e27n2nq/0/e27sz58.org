Well, it seems clear enough that Dumbledore home-schooled him to an extent, once he'd unsnapped his wand and hidden it in the umbrella. So I imagine that as /soon/ as he was pardoned, he did a few weeks of revising and then sat his OWLs in a special session Dumbledore got him. I don't imagine he passed them with flying colors, of course, but he probably got As wherever it mattered, an E or two, and naturally an O in Care of Magical Creatures.
