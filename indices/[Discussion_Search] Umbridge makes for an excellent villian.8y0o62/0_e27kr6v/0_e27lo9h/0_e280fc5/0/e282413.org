I love Mercedes Lackey! I just finished her latest one--The Hills Have Spies. She's pretty much my fantasy comfort food.

And I totally agree about villains. The worst are often the ones that make us think they're on our side while systematically dismantling everything we hold dear and then making us think it was our idea. Kind of like a certain president. Then the true horror is when you realize what's been done to you right under your nose.
