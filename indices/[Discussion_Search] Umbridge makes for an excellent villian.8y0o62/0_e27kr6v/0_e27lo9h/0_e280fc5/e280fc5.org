I can't claim 100% credit. There's a series by Mercedes Lackey called the Mage Storm trilogy, where the worst evil guy isn't the ruthless emperor who's ruling like a despot; it's a petty paper pusher. He quietly goes in, and finds ALL military accounts that are in arrears, and leaks it to the press. And when his own accountants come in and audit the books, he acts HORRIFIED. All of a sudden, he's got the merchants on his side. He rounds up all the criminals, and puts them to work in forced labour houses. The poor are happy, because he's “tough on crime”, and their roads are clean and the cities are working again. The military is in his pocket, because he managed to get them all paid and up to date. He assigns rationing chits to everyone. Now the entire populace is on his side, because they can get (meagre) food. Employment hits pretty much 100%. Beggars are rounded up and sent to work in feeding the furnaces of the factories. Now the merchant class loves him, because their supply chains are running, and their labour force is in place.

Meanwhile, he assigns spies to keep an eye on dissent. He drops little gems of gossip so that the petty nobles all are fighting each other, and think he's on their side. It's a terrifying look at how easily everyone slips right into mediocrity, and I can totally see it playing out in any truly conniving villain.
