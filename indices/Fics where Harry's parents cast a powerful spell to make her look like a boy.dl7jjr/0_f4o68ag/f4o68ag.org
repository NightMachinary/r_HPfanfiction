That's a half of all fem!Harry stories just right there. These Harriets (or whatever they call themselves) take it with a different level of panic. Harriet in linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) takes it rather well, Brogan (yes, I still cannot believe that name either) in linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi) with plenty of Calming Draughts (fortunately, it is also a Severitus, so there is plenty of potions available), and Melantha Black in linkffn(To Reach Without by nwardtransience) didn't take it well at all (it is also femslash story so there is plenty of angst and depression).
