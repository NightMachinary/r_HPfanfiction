There is linkffn(Effects and Side Effects, by Pheonix Dawn).

It's a "Magical Accident turns Harry into a girl" kind of story not a "Harry was born a girl, but was forced into a boy form as a baby" story.

I've not finished it yet... so maybe it devolves into pointless sex before the end. But this is maybe the only Fem!Harry story I've read where Harry doesn't immediately go full acceptance that he's a girl now. Even through chapter 29/37, Harry still thinks of himself as a Guy trapped in a Girl's body, hoping for a cure. He practically has a panic attack when he has to take shower cause he feels like a pervert just looking in the mirror. Everyone still uses masculine pronouns at home, and barely remember to call him 'Harriet' when they go shopping in London.

There are still plenty of other cliches in this story: Powerfull!Harry, Harry/Multi (though that's not progressed too far by chap 29), Muggle Training montage (keep edging closer to MuggleWank)...

But, it is the only Fem!Harry story I've seen to even acknowledge the psychological struggle of suddenly waking up as the other gender, much less make it a primary story arc. Another things I really appreciate is the author did NOT make all the other girls in the relationship conveniently Bi/Lesbian. Like, some of them are not sexually attracted to Girl!Harry... and that causes awkwardness between the characters.
