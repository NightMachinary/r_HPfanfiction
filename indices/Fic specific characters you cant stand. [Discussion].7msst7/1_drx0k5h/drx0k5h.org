So this isn't a specific fic because I don't exactly stay long enough to take this kind of fic down, but nice!Lucius. I don't mind him not being horrible to his family or anything, but he's still a blood supremacist and willing Death Eater. I can't see him being an incredibly mushy cuddly person, it's just not him at all! He can be kind in his own way to those he cares about, but I still don't see him being the type to cuddle with you after you have a nightmare
