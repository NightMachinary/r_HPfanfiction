Yeah, same. I don't really like seeing him put family above everything else either, unless he's already gone through what happens to him in the sixth and seventh book. The man willingly put him and his family in danger for his ideals. That's a pretty shitty father.

What if he was killed? Draco's now fatherless --- though, that probably would have done him some good. What if the people actually found out he was a Death Eater? Boom, Malfoy reputation ruined. Have fun, Narcissa. Dude brought a Dark Lord who likes throwing Cruciatus Curses around near his family. Fuck him. If I was Harry, I would definitely make sure he made his way into Azkaban.
