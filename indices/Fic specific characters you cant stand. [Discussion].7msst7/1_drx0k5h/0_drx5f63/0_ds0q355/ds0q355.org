  The man willingly put him and his family in danger for his ideals.

Wouldn't that sentence apply for any Pureblood Light side characters? It feels like the sentiment only really applies because we're all agreed that Blood Supremacy is a negative thing.

If you put some other positive ideal there (equality) but still apply the fact that fighting for it endangers your family, would that make all parents who fought against Voldemort as bad as Lucius in that regard?
