Just because Malfoy thinks it's a good cause doesn't mean it has any chance of being so. It's not even a subjective thing. It's pretty much objective. Voldemort's side is bad. Harry's side is not. JK Rowling went out of her way to make this very clear. There's hardly any gray area.

Just because someone thinks they're doing something good does not absolve them of the shit things that they actually do. Malfoy wasn't fighting out of self defense, he was fighting to kill those he thought inferior. That's really it.
