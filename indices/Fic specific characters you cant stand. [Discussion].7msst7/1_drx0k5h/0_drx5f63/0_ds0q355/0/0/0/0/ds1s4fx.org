It's not objective. Killing someone *for no reason at all* isn't objectively bad. It's bad only because we decided it's bad based on our moral world view. That is a world view I share by the way.

But /from Malfoy's perspective/, his side is good.

That is what you said that sparked my initial reply. That statement applies to all fathers in this conflict. It's dishonest to say that only Malfoy is bad based on that statement.

If you add the qualifier, which is what you've subsequently done, that

#+begin_quote
  The man willingly put him and his family in danger for his ideals. *Ideals which are wrong, thus making his putting his family in danger a bad thing.*
#+end_quote

But then your initial statement is pretty much pointless. You may as well have said Malfoy is a bad father because he's a villain.

My simple question, which I should have put in my first reply, is "is someone a bad father because they put their children at risk for their cause?"

It's a yes or no question. If the answer is yes, then Malfoy *and* Weasley are bad fathers.

If the answer is no, then neither is a bad father *as far as that specific statement is concerned.*
