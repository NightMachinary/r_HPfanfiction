Gee Whiz, I'm impressed you came up with such a good excuse to not answer a yes or no question!

Look here big fella. You can't just stop reading once it gets to a part you don't like and assume you got all the relevant information. Thing is, to fully understand someone (and thus properly write them) you have to see things from their perspective - not that you have to /share/ that view.

Malfoy thought he was doing the right thing, from his point of view. Weasley thought /he/ was doing the right thing, from /his/ point of view.

I will not argue that Malfoy's Point of View wasn't heavily flawed. It really was. Yes, Malfoy is a terrible person - /FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW/.

Pretty sure that Draco Malfoy thinks Weasley is the terrible person. EVERYONE. HAS. BIAS.
