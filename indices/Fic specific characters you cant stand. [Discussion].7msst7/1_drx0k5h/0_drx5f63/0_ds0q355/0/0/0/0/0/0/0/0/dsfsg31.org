I mean, from a purely unbiased standpoint, there probably aren't.

Thing is, there's no such thing as an unbiased standpoint. People have opinions on right and wrong. What makes an action 'wrong' is a deviation from societal norms in what is viewed as a potentially harmful manner.

I'm not saying that I don't think anyone is bad. There are loads of bad people. It's just that most of the time, people don't think of themselves as bad. "The road to hell is paved in good intentions," "For the Greater Good," all that rot.
