See, saying it's fine because it's a good cause kind of misses the point I think.

In your opinion it's a good cause. In Malfoy's opinion, an opinion based on blood supremacy, his cause is the good one.

And for us, viewing these characters from a 3rd person lense, it doesn't seem like a good critique to criticize Malfoy as a father on the basis of him risking his family, cause that is exactly what others like Arthur Weasley did.
