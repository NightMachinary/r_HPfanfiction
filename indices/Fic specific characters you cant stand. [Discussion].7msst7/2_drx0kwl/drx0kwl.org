I don't remember the fic name. It was next gen, Lily ends up with Scorpius. And oh my fucking God did I want to beat the shit out of Lily (and well... just about all the characters). Total Mary Sue and was a garbage person. I think the author had to have been an angsty "my parents don't get me" teenager. At least I hope so. Harry/Ginny are pretty much assholes, but the thing that got me was that when they were really concerned with Lily's attention whore ways (because parenting) but the author handled it like "lolparents" instead of it being parental concern. (Pretty sure Lily was drinking/smoking/having sex/partying at like 14. But ohmygodparents amiright?) Lily ends up running away and living with that Malfoys (who, in a twist, "got her". They also got her a modeling contract with a wizarding lingerie company at the ripe old age of 15. So yeah.)

Sometimes I wish I didn't feel an almost compulsive need to finish fics that I start.
