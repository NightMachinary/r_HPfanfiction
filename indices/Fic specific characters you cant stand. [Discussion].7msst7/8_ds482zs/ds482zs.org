I have to say all those OOC Lunas where she either:

- has her whole personality as a cover
- is blatantly a seer with little to no drawbacks
- is all 'woe is me' over her "quirkiness", without even really being all that quirky.
- or uses 'nargles' and 'wrackspurts' as codewords for magic or bullies or whatever

I mean there are always exceptions - if its well written, it works for me. Its just almost impossible imo to pull one of those off without sounding terribly cliche or entirely ruining her character's charm.
