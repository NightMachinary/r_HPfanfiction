Molly being Harry's substitute mother. She knew Harry was being starved and chose to send him some food instead of, you know, doing the sensible things and call the DMLE or the Police. That is a criminal offence from where I come from.

And her giving Sirius shit for being framed for the death of his best friend and being tortured for 12 years.

She was also a bitch towards Fleur and tried to break her son's engagement.

So how the hell can anyone come to the conclusion that Molly is a good mother figure for Harry? Even Luna Lovegood, despite all her issues, would be better suited for that role.
