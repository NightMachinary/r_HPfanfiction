Honestly, I think JK Rowling just downplayed how terrible the abuse was with every character, especially Harry.

  And her giving Sirius shit for being framed for the death of his best friend and being tortured for 12 years.

Yeah, can't defend her on this one. I always found her attitude towards Sirius annoying. Here's the only real family member Harry has and she's just bashing him and keeping Harry away from him.

  She was also a bitch towards Fleur and tried to break her son's engagement.

Fleur was depicted as pretty haughty, so I'm kinda eh on this one.
