The story in linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) diverges by book 5 and everything up until then is just like canon, so I just can´t take it how the fic redeems the Dursley´s, it´s just them realizing that Harry is family and vowing that they will treat him better from now on, after they joined the Empire, with the explicit knowledge that Harry is a target. This really soured my opinion of an otherwise really enjoyable fic.
