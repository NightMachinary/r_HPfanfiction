I think the biggest clue is the fact that Harry deliberately concealed the source of his knowledge from his teacher, and felt panic when he thought that source would be discovered.

Ask yourself: what would have happened if Harry had told Slughorn that he was getting his modifications from a book rather than thinking of them himself? Would Slughorn still rate Harry's work so highly?

Clearly he wouldn't. Slughorn is rating Harry highly because he thinks that the Potions Harry brews are the product of his own skill. If he knew that Harry was copying someone else's ideas, Harry would not get the credit for them.

Harry is keenly aware of this, which is why he conceals the book from Slughorn. Even when Ron is under the influence of a love potion, Harry perpetuates the lie rather than admit that he doesn't know how to brew an antidote.

So Harry is using dishonest means, in full knowledge that it is dishonest, to pass another person's work off as his own in order to achieve better academic results than he would have been capable of achieving on his own. That, surely, is the definition of cheating.
