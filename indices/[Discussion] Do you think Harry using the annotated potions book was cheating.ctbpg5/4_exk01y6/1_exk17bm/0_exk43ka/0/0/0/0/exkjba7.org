  If I had a book that was annotated so for a chemistry lab, I'd try and figure out why equivalent of a counterclockwise stir works. Harry doesn't do that.

I don't think that is a good analogy. Remember, we know that advanced Hogwarts students can and do add to their fields - Dumbledore, for example, was publishing articles in academic journals during his Hogwarts years. There is no tertiary education in the wizarding world... Hogwarts is a school analogue, yes, but it is also the equivalent of a university, a place where new magic is created by talented students.

By all accounts Snape was a Potions genius, and the innovations recorded in the HBP book are advances that others do not know about.

The analogy is therefore not so much an annotated chemistry lab manual giving tips on how to ace routine assignments. It's more like you're a postgraduate chemistry student and you've found someone's notes on a new way to improve the Haber Process. You don't publish them, but you do use them to impress your professor, taking credit for the ideas. Your teacher, impressed, announces you a genius and gives you a high grade.
