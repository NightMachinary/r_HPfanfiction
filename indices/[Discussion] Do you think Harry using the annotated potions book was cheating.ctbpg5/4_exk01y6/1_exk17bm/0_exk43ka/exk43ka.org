  All the book did was improve his brewing ability.

Except it didn't. That's my point: Harry gained no skills from the book. So long as he brewed the potions in that specific book he would excel, but if you asked him to brew /any other potion/ he would flounder.

If anything, the book likely harmed his potions ability, because he relied on it entirely rather than engaging with the material. If he had progressed to take his NEWT exam he probably would have failed it - no book to help him there, and suddenly he'd be having to use his own skills and knowledge.
