I disagree. What you've stated is that canon Harry squandered the opportunity the book gave him. I agree with that statement.

Potions is a mix of steady hands and technical knowledge in canon. Harry had one, and the book provided the other. No one had recipes memorized, and they each used their own copies.

All the book did was improve his brewing ability. Likening it to an annotated lab manual with tips on how to perform a procedure more effectively. You don't need to understand the procedure to perform it.

So, no, it's not cheating.
