If the purpose of potions class was to supply the school with potions then use of the book would be fine. You'd just be brewing potions using different instructions.

But the purpose of potions class is not to brew potions. The potions they practice are thrown away. The purpose of potions class is to /learn/, so that you can brew any potion. You're supposed to be developing your skills.

Harry didn't learn anything, yet made it appear that he had. That is fundamentally dishonest so yes I would say cheating. If he had actually used the book to learn e.g. by investigating the changes and understanding why they were made, that would have been different. But he just used it to appear better than he actually was.

All of which we see when it came to do antidotes and Harry didn't have a clue what he was doing... reinforced when Harry couldn't help Ron after the love potion.
