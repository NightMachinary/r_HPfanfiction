We see, what, 5 Potions classes in canon? Certainly not more than 10.

As with all magic, we don't see the vast majority of it. Harry knows a lot more magic than we the reader know. So I'm not sure we can say anything like "Most Potions classes go like X."

We know from homework assignments that Potions does involve having to know about how the ingredients work, and there's nothing to say that they don't have theory classes as well as homework.
