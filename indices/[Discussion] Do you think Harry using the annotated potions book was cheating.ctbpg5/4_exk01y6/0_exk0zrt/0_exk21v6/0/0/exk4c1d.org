You could make the same argument for spells with respect to wand motion and incantation, in that the classes generally focus on those. And yet its clear (and explicitly stated) that there's a lot more to being able to cast spells successfully than getting the wand motion and incantation right.

One mustn't confuse the way magic works with the narrative focus. The former is a matter of the totality of the textual evidence. The latter is a matter of plot convenience.
