The issue is that they're told to this for homework, and we're told that they do this as readers, but we don't actually know what Moonstone /does/ in potions. In the actual potions class, all we see, over and over, is Snape yelling at kids for not following the instructions he gives them, telling them they did it wrong without telling them /why/ this ingredient reacts in a certain way. The way JKR structures the school year, anything not related to the main mystery is hurried over and falls under the "Tell instead of Show" school of writing no-no's.

  "Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing," said Snape. "Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday."

  "Shall we do Snape's stuff first?" said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink. "'The properties... of moonstone... and its uses... in potion-making...”‘ he muttered, writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them.

  "There." He underlined the title, then looked up expectantly at Hermione. "So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?"

We never find out what moonstone actually does. As a result, it feels like the narrative treats it as unimportant, compared to the importance of following the instructions, where we are shown clear consequences when the instructions aren't followed. Stuff blowing up, Neville being berated, cauldrons melting, etc.
