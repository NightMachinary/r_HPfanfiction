Ehh, your point about the aim of the is flawed due to the nature of how potions is shown to be taught both under Snape and Slughorn. They never learn the correlation/causation of different ingredients on the potion. The class has always been how best you can follow the recipe. You can't honestly say that any subject in the real world could be connected to potions without your points falling apart.

Memorizing better recipes would have the same moral connotations as have notes in the margins according to your view. If the ability to make any potion was to be tested then making a potion while looking at instructions would not be the way to do that.

Edit: I didn't say this before but yes the hw and theory lectures if present would account for understand the effect of ingredients on potions; however, that point is moot considering we are talking about the lab and he was using better instructions for a lab.
