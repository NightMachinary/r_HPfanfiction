Not at all. Those potion books were distributed among his classmates just like used textbooks in elementary, middle, and high school. When using used textbooks its not unusual to find old scribbles from some past student. As long as the book is still usable and not too beat up then the teachers don't care and won't replace them with new books. It's not Harry's fault that the teacher and by extension the school couldn't be bothered to spend money on new textbooks that are clean or put some spell on the book so that it at least looks new with no notes. Is it unfair that the other students didn't have a book with great and helpful notes from a past potion prodigy? Yes. Absolutely. I'd certainly be jealous. But its not Harry's fault that he got that certain book. He never intended to get a basic cheat sheet book, but that's how things turned out.
