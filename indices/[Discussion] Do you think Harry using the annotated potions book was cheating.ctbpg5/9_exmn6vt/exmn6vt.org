I mean no that would be like getting a used text book with notes in it to help you study considered cheating . Its not like hes bringing it into an exam. Its not much different than a friend being like hey this might help in chem lab or just getting any information to help you outside of assigned class materials.

But it is kinda bullshit that 2 decades ago a student came up with a better way but the books written by supposedly more educated people hadnt done anything to update the material. Hell not even the actual potions master was like hey lemme write a letter to the editor or something cuz shit I came up with in highschool is more competent in this book .
