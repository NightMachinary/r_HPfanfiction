Snape's changes were innovations, however. By passing those innovations off as his own, Harry created an unfounded and misleading impression that he was a genius capable of producing such innovations himself. He did nothing to correct that impression and indeed he encouraged it.

That is dishonest, I think.

It all would have come crashing down had he continued with his 7th year and taken the exam. Suddenly he would be working on the basis of his own skills and knowledge, which would likely have atrophied after 2 years of relying on someone else's answers rather than doing the work himself. The gulf between his actual skill and the impression of genius he had built up would have become obvious.
