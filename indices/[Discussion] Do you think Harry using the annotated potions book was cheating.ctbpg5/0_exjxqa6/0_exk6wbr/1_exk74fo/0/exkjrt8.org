No, because no one who is following the textbook is claiming to have written the textbook. Harry is claiming to have come up with Snape's Potion's innovations himself, taking credit for them to boost his grade. Sure, he's honest about them to Ron and Hermione, but he doesn't come clean to the person who matters - the person assigning his grade.

He's not only cheating (using another student's work as his own); he's also a plagiarist.
