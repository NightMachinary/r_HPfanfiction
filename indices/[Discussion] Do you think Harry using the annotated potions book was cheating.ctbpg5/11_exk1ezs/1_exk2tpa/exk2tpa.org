You are making the assumption that nobody else can get access to the same notes. I doubt that there a fifth/sixth year Snape is smart enough to change potion instructions in crucial ways that have not already been discovered in other areas. Also they are using aleast 20 year old books which doesn't really do anything to support the point that others could not get access to better material.

Also it would be like saying studying from a better textbook or medium is cheating. Or that giving your notes to someone in the class below yours your notes.
