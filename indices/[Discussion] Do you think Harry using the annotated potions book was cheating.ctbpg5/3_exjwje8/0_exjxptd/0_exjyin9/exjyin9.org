Snape /is/ an unfair dick, he hates children and it shows. But he also seem to have a special kind of hate toward Neville (only second to the one he has toward Harry). I don't know if this is because he is "the other child" who could have become the Boy Who Lived without Lily dying, or because he is just that bad at potions, but I doubt Snape has the habit of threatening the student's pets so he made an exception for Neville.
