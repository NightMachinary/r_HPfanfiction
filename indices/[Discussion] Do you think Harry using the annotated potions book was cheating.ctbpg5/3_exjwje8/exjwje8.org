The way Potions brewing in Hogwarts is taught, a successful potion is based on following the directions + recipe as closely as possible. Stirs in the right direction, the amount of time on the burner, the right amount of the right ingredients. The way Snape went about teaching was through shoving the instructions down everyone's throat until they got it right. So Harry having extra textbook help isn't cheating, imo. Not unless he snuck the book into the written exam and copied answers off it there.

However, in the books, Snape takes points from Hermione for helping Neville with his potion. Though whether it's because Snape counted it as "cheating", or he was just being mean to the Gryffindors, or trying to tough-love teach Neville into brewing a working potion without someone spoonfeeding him instructions, is hard to tell.

  "Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"

  "Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. "I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed."
