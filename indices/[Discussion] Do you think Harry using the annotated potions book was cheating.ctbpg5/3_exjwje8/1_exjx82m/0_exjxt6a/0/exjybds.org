If you write it, post a thread!

Though if Harry actually did point out all of Hermione's hypocrisies, an in-character Hermione would run away crying, because she has a bad track record with confrontations under stress. (The troll and Devil's Snare in year 1, various arguments with Ron, walking into Ron and Lavender making out.) Under stress, Harry snarks back and makes impulsive decisions, while Hermione freezes and panics.

In the books, Hermione's crying and running away has the strange effect of making her sympathetic to the readers, even though she's the one who has made mistakes and, since she runs away, never actually acknowledges these mistakes and apologizes for them. So a Harry who tries to call Hermione out would look like the bad guy in the situation.
