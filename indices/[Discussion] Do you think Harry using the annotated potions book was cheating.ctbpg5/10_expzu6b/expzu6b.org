No. It's just as if he's using a better Potions textbook. I find Hermione's reaction to the ordeal rather weird -- wouldn't she be all over that book wanting to learn better brewing methods? I get her reluctance with unknown spells, but her disdain for a book that gives better brewing methods never made much sense to me.
