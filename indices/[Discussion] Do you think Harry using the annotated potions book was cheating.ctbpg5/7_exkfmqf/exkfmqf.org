No.

But I always thought that Hermione's biggest problem with using the book was that Harry was just blindly following the instructions without understanding how this alternative way works.

That being said this part of the series showed some of the most irrational behaviour by Hermione that I cant explain at all. Her entire attitude in book 6 was very OOC to me. I always point to her behaviour in this book as a great hook for anyone that wants to write a love/loyalty potion Hermione story since it requires basically no alterations to canon till that point
