Depends on how the class was done in previous years and the 6th year.\\
Some fics have it that while they have the books with recipes, Snape gives them instructions on the board anyway. Now why would that happen? Most common explanation is that there is a discrepancy between the book and the board - either the books are wonky or simply the board instructions are improved versions of he potion that give you a bit more leeway in terms of how precise you need to be.

Now, if that's the case, then it's obvious that one should have his own book, and add notes based on what's shown on the board. 5 years of that, and when you don't get the board of instructions in the 6th year, but get the book, and then screw up the brewing, it should give you some indication what you're supposed to do - either ask the professor for help, or figure it out on your own based on 5 years of experience in brewing and learning about properties of potions. If that's the case, then Harry was cheating - he didn't put up the required work and simply mooched off of someone elses anwsers/preparation.

IMO we could compare Potions in NEWT level to advanced chemistry classes - you get some instructions about what you need to get, but at this point you really should have enough knowledge to figure out that the textbook is wrong (either deliberately or not) or know how to do some things by yourself simply from knowing the general rules of how this stuff works on a basic level.
