Well, it depends, doesn't it?

Let's say I need a handbook for a class and I buy a second-hand one from someone who's had the class last year and made notes in it. Nothing wrong with that, right?

Now, the issue comes from the fact that Harry uses it in class assignments, for which they get graded. Now, I'm assuming that if I made notes myself, I could use those in those classes. Would having someone else's notes be cheating? Probably yes? I suppose it wouldn't matter if those assignments didn't actually count towards your actual grade and were more of an indicator for how you are doing in class . We don't know what the case is in Hogwarts, so it's a bit ambiguous.

I'm leaning towards no, it's not officially cheating. However, I don't think it's a good idea for Harry to rely on it - making your own notes is a way better idea than just blindly following someone else's. Also, if the grades indicate how you're doing, they will be skewed and you won't notice you're actually falling behind.
