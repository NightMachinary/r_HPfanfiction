linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) takes the idea of Harry being the typical shonen anime protagonist of wanting to be the very best, like no one ever was, and the incredible strength of will and exceptional feats he must undertake to accomplish that goal. Except that Harry's life ambition is to be the LAZIEST person to ever live. This results in some truly hilarious escapades, and the formation of several cults of house elves. There are also a few sequels dealing with years 1-4
