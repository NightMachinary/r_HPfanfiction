linkao3(12705891) A Complete Education by Andante825 is a hilarious and well-written fic (sort of crack) that covers the introduction of a sex ed component to the Hogwarts curriculum. The author writes really good dialogue between the teachers as they try to avoid teaching duties, there are some hilariously embarrassing moments for the students in the class, Hermione is a keener (as usual) and the whole thing is just charming.

...or it was when I read it some time ago.
