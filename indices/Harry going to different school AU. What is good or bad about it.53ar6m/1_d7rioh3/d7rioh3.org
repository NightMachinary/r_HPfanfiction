Well, it should be obvious considering what you wrote, but make sure that Harry isn't out of character and that any changes that happen to him are organic changes (as in, caused by something the readers can see in the plot and that they think could make those changes happen). Because if you don't do that then instead of being a story about Harry attending another school it will be a story about how much Hogwarts sucks, and needless to say “Hogwarts bashing” is ... well, probably not a good thing.

To add to that, don't make important people comment “obviously their laws are shit” or stuff like that about the British ministry. Yes, we do know that at least some parts of it are not very functional at the time they are seen in the books, but when someone belonging to another ministry or something equally as important speaks about a foreign (British in this case) ministry, there is something called “political correctness” and there also is the thing about not wanting to be deemed to arrogant to let rule (and people like Skeeter are a thing) so realistically nobody would go on a rant about how much a foreign ministry sucks unless they'd gotten formally involved, by the request of that other ministry, in fixing those many problems.
