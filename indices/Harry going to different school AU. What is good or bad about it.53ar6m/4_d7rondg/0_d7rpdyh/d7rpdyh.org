I think people can easily get lost in bashing vs exploring and explaning flaws.

While I have read a few bashing fics and can see where people do come from--they just exaggerate it far too much.

There are obviously going to differences in schools and their teaching style. Just think about the difference of private and public schools. What needs to happen is an exploration of the magical society itself.

This is soooo difficult. There needs to be consistency and proper explanations.

Also, if Harry does go to a different school does not mean that he would be interested in pursing a relationship with someone from Hogwarts. Especially, if he does leave it at that age. Think about it, if you ever switched schools as a kid/teenager---chances are you had very little contact with them. That's long distance and they're so young.

That's not to say something can't happen later down the road. I would expect Harry to be more focused on the new school.
