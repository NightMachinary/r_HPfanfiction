Outside influences are what make people the people they are. If you send Harry to Durmstrang, he'd trend dark. If you send him to Beauxbaton, he'd likely trend to wear a fancier shoe.

The whole point of an AU is to take all these outside influences and show how they affect Harry, how he's different without Ron and Hermione.

One I quite liked was a James Spookie story I believe, where everyone thought he was dead but Riddle put him in the twt to get him in his grasp. Though admittedly I only read it once years ago.
