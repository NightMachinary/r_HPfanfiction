Yes, putting a canon character in a different situation requires an adjustment to his/her characterization. viol8er is right about that, though I wouldn't really expect the most obvious sign of Harry attending Beauxbatons to be his fancy new shoes. I may be wrong, in that case I'd love to read a story like that ;)

For a writer, the most challenging thing is likely building a new and possibly entirely separate society, all the while doing it in a way that doesn't clash with any information we know from canon. For Durmstrang and Beauxbatons at least there are some details to work with and let them guide you, but what if you want to create your own fictional school?

If you're adding a new one within the British isles (like the story "... and the Irish Choice" did), why was nothing about it ever mentioned in the books or movies? Why does one get the impression from canon that there is, at most, one school per country, if even that? Why would Hogwarts be called "the best school of wizardry in Great Britain" in canon if it's the only one? Wouldn't it then also have to be the worst too?

Once an author starts with his own school, in most cases outside of Europe - the US being a prime candidate with the country's potentially larger readership originating there - it works mostly along the lines of inserting a canon character in your very original setting that is guided along a basic framework. You should respect the way magic works in the Harry Potter fandom, you should keep in mind the international references being made in canon (the ICW, quidditch being the most popular sport, etc) but otherwise you're left entirely on your own.

I personally quite like bellerophon's epic where Harry switches schools and starts a whole new life for himself in the US of A. It does all the must-have things right and it is not too outlandish as far as original wizarding societies go. Some others, Snow Point immediately comes to mind, are to me pure "in-name-only" stories and I abhor these with a passion.
