See? *SEE?*

That is exactly what I do not care about. Your logic ruins it all.

While your reasoning is sound, as a reader I simply do not care about it. I want to read about the fantastical side of the wizarding world, not its bureaucracy and laws.

In Salem I want there to be a vegetarian Wendigo as housekeeper who gets angry at air draft because his heart is frozen and wind makes it worse, because why not? I want the students in Mahoutokoro to play pranks on the Oni of the neighbouring woods and an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaname][Akaname]] spirit for keeping the toilets clean. Castelobruxo should have a huge [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl][feathered Serpent]] as its librarian and the students go on wild treasure hunts for El Dorado during free periods.

And so on and so forth.
