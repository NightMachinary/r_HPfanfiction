Both of you make valid points. There needs to be an exploration of different cultures of magical society--while certain basic laws should still apply.

Think about it, the magical UK society is heavily built on secrecy. While the US do allow certain muggles to have the knowledge of magic.

For example, if Harry went to a school in Brazil or something, he would have a different set of rules to follow. Maybe the school wouldn't be boarding, then he also needs to get integrated into the culture of Brazil itself. And, different creatures based on what are common myths in that area.

Honestly, there's so little known about magical schooling that I think it's kinda difficult to assume that Hogwarts is the oldest and greatest school around. There could be minor school all over the world with just as eccentric personality but far older. Or there could be schools that keep a level of secrecy even from magical society--almost like an elitist group.

I love the idea of exploring the magical world based on present history and mythology.

Just imagine, a japanese magical school where there are different yokai attending school? Or even spirits. Where people travel using umbrellas or "clouds".

Or a school called in the ocean (or something to the effect) that's completely separated. You could have underwater classes-- sirens teaching you illusionary magic, mermaids teaching you languages of different creatures. There's just so much you can do.
