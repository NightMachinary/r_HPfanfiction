  That is exactly what I do not care about. Your logic ruins it all. We like different types of stories then, that's cool. It also helps an author get an idea for the kind of audience he will have to live with, because writing to one end of the spectrum is going to make one part love and the other hate (him or) it.

I can see your side too. There's no reason why fantasy can't be fantastical like you've shown in your comment. If you ever get around to writing about this vegetarian Wendigo, look me up because I do enjoy good humor like that :)

That said, my previous posts were geared primarily toward the author and not the reader. When you start to write your own story and borrow another person's fandom to do that, you need to have an understanding of how that existing world works. To me this means not only the obvious things that are mentioned in books, movies or other official sources but also the deeper mechanics and any implications built upon that.

A good author writes fanfiction and gets the characters right, a great author can meld his own ideas (original characters but also new settings and ideas) with the source and make it work. I'm reinterpreting here, but I read a sentence just like that once before and thought it would fit here.
