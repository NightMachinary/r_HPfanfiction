I'm pretty sure that Hogwarts has safety standards too, they just aren't followed very rigidly (or at all). Can you imagine all those influential pure-bloods in the ministry and on the board of governors putting their precious children in a school that's dangerous to the point of possibly serious injuries or even death? That's what happened every year during Harry's attendance.

Although the school appears to be largely outside of ministerial sphere of influence, that's in part due to Dumbledore's standing in the community. When it suits them, outsiders can and will take action within Hogwarts and there's nothing any of the staff can do against it, therefore some kind of legal framework must exist which allows them to act.

The wizarding world may look vastly illogical and very exciting to a non-magically raised Harry Potter, and there's no doubt that his time there has been extraordinary, but any successful society with its own economy must have some rules that allows them to function properly. You can't tell me there's nothing of the sort, when you hear Percy Weasley drone on about something as banal as cauldron thickness.

Another point is the venue itself. Hogwarts is a castle out of another time. Back when it was built by the founders, apparently in the year 993 AD going by the unofficial wiki, the world and society was completely different and the wizarding world would not be separated from the non-magical population for many hundred years. In comparison, the oldest public school in the US is the Boston Latin School, which was founded in 1635 in the same state as Salem. What are 350 years in a school built by immigrants against one thousand years of history in a magical castle built by the preeminent figures of their time?
