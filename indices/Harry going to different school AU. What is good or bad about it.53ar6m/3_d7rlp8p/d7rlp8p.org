What I hate most about this "genre" if you want to call it that, is when there is just nothing going on at the new school.

Hogwarts was magical. From the talking portraits and moving staircases, to the horrors that called its dungeons their home. It got an animagus Transfiguration teacher, an evil potions master, a half-goblin charms teacher, a batshit crazy Divination teacher and Albus Dumbledore, powerful wizard and almost cliche in his getup as such. There were ghosts and a homicidal willow, a giant squid and mermen. There was an enchanted forest with centaurs and giant spiders, a half-giant gamekeeper who had a love for creatures that ripped Heros to shreds in other tales.

I get angry when I then read about a Salem Institute that is basically a american highschool with classes for magic. Period. Thats it.

Magical schools, in my mind, must be extraordinary. Complying with the safety standards of the respective Ministry of Education does not a magical school make.
