The worst thing I've ever seen was an explicit rated fic for Harry/Lily Luna, where, judging by the tags, she was probably a toddler.

Like holy fuck! I have successfully forgotten most of it, but I'm pretty sure one of the tags for it was "extreme underage".

Normally I have a strong stomach for that kind of thing and even sometimes check out stories with stupid incest pairings to see how bad things really are and have a laugh and the rediculousness of it, but for that story just reading the description was already way too much.

It's the only time browsing for fanfics that I ever immidiatly went back to the top, excluded a new tag from my search and reloaded the page just to get a fic out of my sight as quickly as possible.
