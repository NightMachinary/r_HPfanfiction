If I am not wrong, the protego diabolica spell in the movie, produced bluish-white flames, not green. And if we are being complete cannon, the spell is supposed to create a black ring of flames that competely wiped out enemeis while letting his followers walk through it, however it was changed to blue flames in the movies because the background was dark and the flames would not be properly visible. I am not really sure if the speculated title of HBP has any kind of relation to the Protego Diabolica, as it would be very out of character for JKR to do such a thing
