I mean, I highly doubt that JKR is taking inspiration from fan rumors back in the early 2000s but it is a fairly nice coincidence. Also, the rumor had a flame that healed good and destroyed evil, not loved ones and enemies.

Edit: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20010804142856/http://www.geocities.com/jeffvg/rumors.htm][Link tor the site]] where the green flame rumor is mentioned for those interested. Most of the rumors seem like obvious guesses and the ones that are more far-fetched, like this one, did not happen like Fleur becoming a Hogwarts teacher.
