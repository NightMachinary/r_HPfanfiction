Do you know if JK had confirmed prior to book 7 that Snape was in fact a good guy because he was in love with a woman? I think that and the fact that Harry's eyes will play a big role in the last book were two of the most speculated predictions.

Also I forgot exactly what the green flame torch was supposed to do but other than Voldemort who has delved so deeply in the dark arts, good and evil are quite subjective concepts. For instance, if we were to trust the theory that Hermione took Umbridge to the centaurs to have her raped, she would be no safer from the torch than, say, Umbridge.
