Sorry about deleting the comment starting a new parent chain. It was meant to be a reply here.

Snape was an obvious guess, there were hints before the last book. Snape's sacrifice arc was hinted at ever since the first book. I'd put the guesses on the same level as guessing that Hermione would become prefect, and one of Harry's classmates becoming a Hogwarts teacher. This "ifI' is a bit confusing. Do you mean that she confirmed that he was "a good guy" before the last book?

  Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world

  This was all I found for a quote on Snape's character. Her other comments suggest that she doesn't think Snape falls into "evil" or "good" as well.

Good and evil are not quite as subjective in the magical world as they are in real life, which stems from a lot of things, JKR's inspiration among them. Love is a tangible concept that can be studied, horcruxes are directly evil and are evil objects, and you can taint your soul. In any event, the difference between good and evil and enemies and loved ones are very different. And differs even more from Protego Diabolica's actual function.

And of course, and most importantly, I very much doubt JKR is trolling now-defunct fan sites from 2001 looking for inspiration.
