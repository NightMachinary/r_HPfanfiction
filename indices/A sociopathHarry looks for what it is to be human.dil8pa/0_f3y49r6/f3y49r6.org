For some reason this make me think of an old movie.

I imagine that this story starts with Freak hearing the story of pinochio, he wished to love and be loved like a real boy. But no blue fairy came, no jiminy cricket. He probably missed the memo. He'll just have to look for the fairy himself, so he could ask how to be a real boy.

Aunt and uncle doesnt like questions, maybe others will tell him how to be a real boy or where to find the blue fairy. He probably have to stray from his path to school first.
