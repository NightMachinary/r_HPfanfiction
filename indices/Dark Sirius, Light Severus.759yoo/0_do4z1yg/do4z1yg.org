Haven't read any personally but I'm intrigued by the idea. I would think you'd have Sirius as the son Walburga always wanted, like a mix of Regulus and Bellatrix. But would you keep Severus in Slytherin dealing with Bizarro Padfoot on a daily basis? In Gryffindor with James and Lily, or in Ravenclaw which he could probably fit in with?
