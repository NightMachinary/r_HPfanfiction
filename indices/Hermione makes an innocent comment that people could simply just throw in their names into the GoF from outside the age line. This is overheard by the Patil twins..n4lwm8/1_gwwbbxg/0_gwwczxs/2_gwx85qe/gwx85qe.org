Well, the parchment AND a strong confundus charm, which might be beyond even most seventh years. But yes, the fact that a magically binding contract with unspecified penalties can be entered into ON SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHALF, and without their knowledge and consent, opens up a massive and horrific bag of worms in the HP-verse. Probably a larger one than the prevalence and apparent cutsieness of date-rape potions and spells like Amortentia, Obliviate, Imperius, etc. Hell, the Weasley Twins sold love potions like they were condoms and the girls all thought it was absolutely adorable and awesome, even though those could be used to literally take away their will and agency. Imagine how much worse it would've been if they could be entered into literal slave contracts without even knowing it.
