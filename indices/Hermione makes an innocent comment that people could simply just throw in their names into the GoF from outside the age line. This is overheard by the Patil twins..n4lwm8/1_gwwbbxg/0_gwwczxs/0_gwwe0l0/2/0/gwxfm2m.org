The Golden Trio knows about the possibility and used the Twins help to insert Riddle's name (and probably other Death Eaters too, this could be two different fics). The end result is the targets losing their magic for being unable to attend the gathering right after the announcement. Now I'm really sure there are at least two fics about this because I remember one of them has Snape losing his magic too because he left the room, while in the other fic Snape is one of the conspirators.
