I suppose that is fair to some degree, though at some point one has to conclude that Dumbledore, while magically amazingly powerful, is otherwise either a moron or a very manipulative schemer. Those fanfic tropes didn't just pop out of thing air, they do have some degree of justification (though almost all fanfics that have them overdo it way too much).

It is not just specific people doing specific dumb things though, it's also wizarding society as a whole that at times seems devoid of logic. This is not necessarily a bad thing and at least in the first books it was absolutely great. But it does lead one to wonder whether there is some negative correlation between having magic and having common sense.
