Fanon really does take that throwaway line from Hermione, an eleven-year-old girl who is entirely incapable of judging great wizards by their relative intelligence, in Philosopher's Stone as sacrosanct. I'm not saying that the girl who had to be reminded that she could use magic as a direct, logical solution to the problem of "how do I make light to stop this Devil's Snare?" is unqualified to do so, but there are plenty of instances where other wizards puzzle problems out logically faster and more thoroughly than Hermione does. There's an entire house dedicated to logic, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge, after all.
