According to Muggle standards, wizards do lack logic. I already wrote a long-ish comment on this about a month or so ago, but a wizard's brain will develop very differently because the laws of physics work very differently for them, so they will note different kinds of contingencies and just reason very differently in genral.

Like, remember Ron being amazed that Muggle cars aren't bigger on the inside? For a Muggle it's "logic" that they're not, but for Ron there's no reason why something would be the same size both outside and inside.

So for Muggle standards, wizards do "lack logic", and it's the same in reverse (Hermione forgetting to take magic into consideration and other people constantly going WTF how could you forget that is an excellent example). But that's just because wizards work with different premises on, well, the basic physical laws of the world, so they seem incoherent to an outsider. They do have their own internal logic.
