Huh, that's interesting. I could actually see him half-lying: It's a binding contract in the social sense, not the magical sense. So he makes it sound like the Goblet magically forces you to participate but if anyone called him out on it he could just say he means it's legally/socially binding because of tradition or whatever. The others might not say anything because they don't know for certain and don't want to embarrass themselves in front of everyone else there.
