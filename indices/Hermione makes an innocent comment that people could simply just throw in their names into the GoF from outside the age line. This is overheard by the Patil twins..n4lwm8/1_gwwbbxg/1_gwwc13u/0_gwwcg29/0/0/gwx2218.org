But it still means that you can force anyone to participate in the tournament if you just convince the Goblet. That just doesn't really fit in the HP world. It's the kind of magic that would let you kill anyone anywhere just by writing their name into a book. Alternatively the Goblet doesn't actually force you, it only selects a name, and the adults are just being assholes and tell the selected people they must participate. Alternatively, plot hole.
