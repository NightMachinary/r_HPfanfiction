I remember vaguely there was one fic, possibly a time travel au, where Harry asked Fred and George why they didn't just throw it in and they were like “huh?” And he had to demonstrate crumpling up a piece of paper and tossing it and as soon as they realized what he meant they were beside themselves. Now that I'm thinking about it I'm pretty sure that Harry and George both got picked, and even more people couldn't believe Harry didn't put his name in because he had told people how they could get it in. Also, pretty sure Harry was a shadow panther animagus and could move through shadows in that form, I can't for the life of me remember what the name of the fic was, anyone knows give me a holler!
