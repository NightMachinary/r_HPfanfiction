All right, here's my review. All in all it's not that bad. Sure it has its weak spots - like any story does - but all in all it's pretty good. No blatant cliches that cringe the brain, no plot lines that feel overly forced, and they actually do a pretty good job of showing Harry is a normal school kid going through life. For example, there's a few chapters where he decides to ask out Lavender Brown simply cuz she's a cute girl at school, and they eventually decided it's not working out so they split on good terms. The Harry in this fic feels a lot more human than the other fics I've been reading lately. The one downside is that it is desperately begging for a sequel to be written because it only goes through fourth year.

I'd say probably about a 6.5-7/10, simply because there's always room for some improvement, and it feels very sequel-baity with no actual sequel looking like it's going to be published.
