I think people like thinking of the Evans having a naming convention with flowers because the Blacks have one with stars. So it seems consistent with the way JK Rowling sets her series. Especially because nobody can tell us the contrary, since the Evans women we know follow the trend. It's Devil's proof. You don't have the evidence it doesn't exist so it can be said it exists.

Edit: but, yeah, you can just argue that Petunia and Lily's parents love gardening. So there is no "traditional" naming convention whatsoever.
