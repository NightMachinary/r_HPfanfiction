For the Weasleys, I think people want to find a pattern too, actually. You can read theories about all their names having a link to Medieval history: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasley_family]]

I'm not saying it's right or wrong, about the naming convention. I actually tends to think it's more a meta theory than something holding true in-universe (since, as you say, why would a normal Muggle family have a naming convention?). But I actually believe that JK Rowling tends to organize the names thematically. So I understand why fanfic authors want to reproduce that.

I like flower names for fem!Harry, whether it's Holly or Jasmine (never seen the others), because I feel like the authors try to construct a real character based on the trope fem!Harry while making an effort to integrate it in the HP series' way of writing. But I also like original names since they usually try to offer a new approach of the character. But it does feel more "OC" than fem!Harry, for me. And for those reasons, I do understand the aversion for "Harriet", albeit it never stops me to try reading the fic either way.
