I've actually not read too many fem!Harry fics, and the majority of those I have followed the naming convention you so disliked. The “Harriet” version is obviously just the female form for the name Harry, and when every named canon female member of the Evans family line has been named after flowers, it's not difficult for one to think that it would extend to Harry and Dudley, were they female.

Frankly, I've never been overly bothered by it.
