I'm not expecting female Harry to have a special name, just a name that is hers, one that doesn't rely on Harriet (Which is because a female version of Harry) or a flower name. (Flower names were Petunia and Lily), Or if it's a flower name, then a flower name that sounds good and doesn't sound pretentious.
