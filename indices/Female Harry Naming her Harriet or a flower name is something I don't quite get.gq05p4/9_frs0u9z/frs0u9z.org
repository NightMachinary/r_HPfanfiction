I kind of get where you're coming from, but I have the opposite opinion.

I mean, you want a female!Harry to be her own character rather than inheriting male!Harry's elements, but what is lazy to you is keeping to character for me. If I'm reading female!Harry, I want female!Harry, not a random ass OC put in Harry's situation. Sure, the name is ultimately a very minor part of the character, but it sure as fuck helps making her a plausible Harry rather than an OC. Especially in a setting like HP where every other name is a hint about the character. Flower names are a plausible association to the Evans women, and Harriet is just Harry for girls, so they're alright. A typically brit middle class name would be alright too, as that's a name I could see JKR choosing for a female!Harry, but when I start seeing stuffy names like Victoria or Alexandra my brain goes to Hadrian and Harold Potter instead. That said, as I'm not a brit myself, this goes off my perception of british names rather than the reality of british names, so there might be whole classrooms of little Victorias and Alexandras and I'd be none the wiser.

Also, although I think Harriet an acceptable name for Harry form a setting and characterization point of view, I do find it a rather ugly sounding name so I'd rather not read fics using it. Especially if it's just an excuse for author to shorten it to Harry or (it hurts even to write) 'Harri'.
