I hate the name Harriet, too. Really hate it. Can't explain it, though. Maybe it's because I associate it with old ladies.

Of the flower names I've seen, I like Jasmine and Violet. If I ever write one myself it'll be Laura/Laurel/Lauren.

I think the only non-flower, non-Harriet name I've come across has been Taure's Victoria/Alexandra Potter. While I personally think J/L would give their daughter a flower name, those two names are far more enjoyable to read than Harriet, Holly, Heather, Ivy, Iris... Both fit a Girl-Who-Lived better, too.
