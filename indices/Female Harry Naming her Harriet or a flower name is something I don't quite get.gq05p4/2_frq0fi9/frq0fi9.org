I think they usually do Harriet so they can get around the nickname issue and just continue saying Harry in the story. Heather is a pretty good name if you're trying to keep the flower restriction and an H restriction.

I still prefer Harriet (even though I think it's terrible) than Morgana La Fey Potter Black Lestrange, Etc.

If I ever do a female Harry story I would probably either pick Heather Lily Potter or just substitute Heather for another girl name I like.
