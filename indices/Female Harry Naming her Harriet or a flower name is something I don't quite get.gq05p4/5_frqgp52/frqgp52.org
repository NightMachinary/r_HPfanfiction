For me, a gender-swapped name has gotta start with the same letter and should look and sound similar. Also shouldn't be the same as another character (/eyeballs "Hannah Potter"/). This isn't "what would Lily name her daughter" it's "how can Rook keep the new name straight". So no offense to the many wonderful stories that are out there, but I can't read a fem!Harry named Iris or Vicky or Rose. My brain just doesn't connect the renamed character to the original.

So, using my personal and semi-arbitrary rules, Harriet is an excellent name for a female Harry. So are Holly and Harley. And IMO her middle name should always be Lily, to parallel the canon middle name of James.
