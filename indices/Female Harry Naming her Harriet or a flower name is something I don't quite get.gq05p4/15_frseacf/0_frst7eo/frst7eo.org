What other families have traditional names? I know that the Black family name their kids after stars, the Malfoy family might have a naming tradition, but no other family has been shown to have such a tradition.

Weasley family just seems to name their kids what they want, we have no idea what Hermione's parents names are, the Potters didn't have a naming tradition, the Lovegoods don't seem to, the Diggorys don't seem to, et cetra.
