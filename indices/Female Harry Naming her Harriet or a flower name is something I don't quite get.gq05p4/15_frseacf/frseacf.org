  Just because Petunia and Lily's names are based on flowers, doesn't mean that Harry or Dudley's would be if they were girls.

It makes sense as a thematic pattern. You see Rowling us it for a lot of families in canon with different themes. Keeping with an established theme makes sense to me.

  I'm also not the hugest fan of the name Harriet for Harry, just seems like there wasn't that much thought on it.

I think that's the whole point. They didn't feel like putting the thought in. I know I'm terrible at thinking up names and when I am making an OC it is the last thing I make. I've even started writing fics with a placeholder name like "Character B" instead of an actual name.
