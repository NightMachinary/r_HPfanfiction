Sorry, but this comment is no longer available. The writer has switched to Ruqqus.

/My resignation as a sub mod and as a reddit user/

Hello readers,

I have been a member of reddit for 5 years, from 2 different accounts, this being my 2nd. As such, I was able to see the decline of Reddit and free speech. The reach of the admins has grown more and more, and I'm afraid that this isn't a community that I want to be part of.

I attempted to clearly define Reddit free speech, especially on my subreddit, however censorship is becoming more and more pronounced.

I have registered my account with Ruqqus today, and I will no longer be posting or commenting using my reddit account, except for very rare occasions.. Subs which I experimented with will remain restricted until someone claims them, or, in the case of [[/r/TwoFacedTrumpets][r/TwoFacedTrumpets]], I will award complete power to [[/u/OscilatingOctopus]].

As such, I hereby resign as a subreddit moderator and as a reddit user, as of the 6th of July. I hope to meet you all again.
