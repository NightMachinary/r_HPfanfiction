[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered destinies]] was the first fic I read, so that might be biasing my opinion a bit, but it's what came to mind and I remember it as one of the most engrossing I've ever read.

Basic premise is that Harry goes back in time to stop the bloodshed of the war by "fucking with" a young Tom Riddle, so to speak.
