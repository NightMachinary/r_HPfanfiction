#+begin_quote
  Darkness is about to rise, but they aren't ready to fight. A plan was set into place; to stop it from ever rising in the first place. Harry & Teddy must time travel to 1993. They must find the boy who would grow up to become the new Dark Lord, without getting tangled in the whole Sirius Black issue. Would they be able to keep their identities secret from everyone?
