I love chained! I think JacobApples fic called Disorder of the Phoenix linkffn(13668247) has a good Harry and Teddy bond, but Andromeda coparents. Also, it's nowhere near as good as chained. The quailty of writing is worse.

Jenorama has some great stories where Harry and Ginny raise Teddy, though it's mostly Ginny POV, but her Ginny is super fun. Here's one I found that's a Teddy and Harry fic and it's pretty good linkao3(12132915)
