Harry hustled away from Fleur, flushed, as Ron trailed behind him. As soon as they turned a corner, he whirled. "Did you see that? She used some kind of Veela magic on me. I could barely control myself!"

Ron looked bemused. "Harry, there's no such thing as Veela magic."

"But you just saw it." How could Ron be so blind?

"Look, she's attractive. I get it. But maybe you should, you know, tone it down a little around her." Harry looked at him, indignant.

"Ron, I'm telling you, she did something to me. As soon as I looked at her, it was like I couldn't think about anything else." Harry was desperate to make him understand.

Ron only looked uncomfortable now. "Maybe it's the Veela thing." Harry felt hope stirring. "Just look at Hagrid, you're obviously not the first bloke to have a thing for non-humans." Harry's mouth fell open, hope gone.

He tried one more time, half hearted. "There's got to be some kind of Veela magic. An allure of some kind?"

Ron looked at him incredulously. "I'm telling you for the last time, Harry. I grew up in the wizarding world, there's no Veela magic, no allure, nothing." He paused. "You're just a freak," he finished with a shrug.

Harry flinched. Maybe his Aunt Petunia was right, though she clearly never meant it in this context. Now that he thought about it, he'd never seen women of another species before. Gringotts only had male goblins that he knew of, and hags were, well, hags. Maybe he did have a thing for other non-humans. Intrigued in spite of himself, he slowly began walking down the corridor again, realizing they'd stopped.

He vaguely remembered seeing a dirty magazine with some interesting possibilities, one he'd ignored at the time. Maybe it was time to revisit. "Thanks, Ron," he said absently.

Ron just shook his head, muttering about "Of course he has a fetish" and "Can't do anything the normal way." Harry ignored him, thoughts preoccupied with more important things.
