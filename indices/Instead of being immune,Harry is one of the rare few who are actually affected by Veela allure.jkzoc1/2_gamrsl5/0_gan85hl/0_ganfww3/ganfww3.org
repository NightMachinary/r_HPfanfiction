Harry warily approached a corner and peeked down the corridor. /Empty/. Exhaling in relief, he hurried along. Just a little farther, and he would be safely back in the common room.

Sneaking around had become routine after he so foolishly tried to ask Fleur out in the Great Hall and puked up his breakfast from sheer nerves. As she gaped at him in shock, he ran off without even offering an apology. Since then, he avoided her like the plague.

To make matters worse, she developed a disturbing tendency to linger in the vicinity of Gryffindor tower. Almost as if she was stalking him---but no, that would be absurd. He still dreamed of her every day, of her fair skin and glimmering hair and sky-blue eyes, but if she ever thought about him, it would be with disgust and contempt.

A hand touched his shoulder. "'Arry?"

He jumped. There she stood, the last person he wanted to see. "Fleur!" he cried, clutching his chest. "I---I didn't expect to see you here."

Even her frown was beautiful. "I 'ave been trying to find you for days, but you always disappear somewhere! I really need to talk to you, 'Arry."

"Oh." He swallowed. "Is this about what happened a week ago?"

"/Oui/." Her slender hand returned to his shoulder, as if she were afraid he would run off again. "I keep remembering it."

He ducked his head. "I'm so sorry. I must've eaten something bad---you must be totally disgusted---"

"Disgusted?" she asked. "/Non/, /non/. It was... um, how should I say... the 'ottest thing I've ever seen."

His head jerked up. "Wait, what?"

Fleur fidgeted, looking as nervous as he felt. "The other boys... they pay me compliments, bring gifts. But no one ever proposed to me as boldly as you, 'Arry." She bit her lip. "It was so manly."

He stared at her with his mouth ajar. She was still beautiful, but now that he looked from up close, there was something distinctly bird-like about her face.

"Er, manly?" he asked, shaking his head.

"/Oui/," Fleur breathed, her eyes locked onto him hungrily. He didn't recall her moving, but she seemed closer all of a sudden. "It's a bit embarrassing, but the veela 'ave, you could say, unusual standards. And you /certainly/ qualify, 'Arry. My answer's yes."

"Yes?" he asked dumbly.

"Yes, I accept your invitation." She glanced over her shoulder; something rustled under her robes by her shoulder blades. "/Zut/, you made my wings come out!" she said, blushing. "We better 'ide."

"Meep," Harry said as she yanked him bodily into the nearest broom closet.
