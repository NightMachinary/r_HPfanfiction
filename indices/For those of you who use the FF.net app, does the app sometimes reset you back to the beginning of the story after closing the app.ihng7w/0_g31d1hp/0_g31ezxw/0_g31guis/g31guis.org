Yup, it's kinda annoying. Especially if end up forgetting what chapter you were on and stuff. Like I said, you just need to go all the way back to the main menu and open up the last read fanfic (or library if you have to) to avoid it from happening again. A bit tedious but I like reading from the app more than the browser
