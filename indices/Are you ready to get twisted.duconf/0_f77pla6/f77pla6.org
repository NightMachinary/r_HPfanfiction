My attempt at a Christmas Dramione story with a twist.

Draco Malfoy woke up on Christmas morning to a pleasant but expected surprise. Amongst the presents he had received from his friends was one from Granger.

He still couldn't believe how the mudblood had actually believed his sob story about how his father was forcing him to be a Death Eater...

As if he'd ever refuse that honor!

Well, the last few months had certainly been interesting, with their secret meetings. She actually thought they were dating!

Well, she'd be in for a nasty surprise. The Dark Lord would surely reward him greatly for luring the Boy-Who-Lived into a trap by kidnapping his friend. Draco was looking forward to finally being allowed to do with the mudblood what he really wanted, and had practiced his Cruciatus regularly on transfigured mice.

So far, everything was going as planned. His acting had been impeccable, he was sure. His father had initially been sceptical of the idea, but here was the evidence that he had managed to trick Potter's mudblood into falling in love with him: She had actually sent him a Christmas present. Of course he had sent her one too, a small golden bracelet. Pretty worthless compared to real jewelry, but it wasn't like she'd be able to tell the difference.

Draco smiled as he imagined the look on her face when he was going to deliver her and Potter to the Dark Lord, and unwrapped her present.

Strange, he thought, some kind of mechanical clock. A muggle item? His danger detector had detected neither curses nor enchantments on it, which had been a little strange.

There was a note attached to it.

"Dear Draco,

I hope that you received my present on time on Christmas morning. It's a little surprise I worked very hard on for the last three weeks.

You won't believe how hard it was to get the things I needed for this! And figuring out how to make it work wasn't easy either, the magic around Hogwarts disrupts all electronics.

Luckily most other places only have enough magic around to mess up microchips and not simple circuits, so I was able to work on this in Hagrid's hut.

I hope this present is appropriate. I don't know much about wizarding traditions, but I think that it's the correct choice given your secret feelings towards me.

Your special 'friend',

Hermione"

What did she mean with appropriate gift considering his feelings? Was this what she thought a courting gift should look like? And what was that talk about electric stuff, was this some kind of muggle tradition?

Draco looked at the gift again. What were those red rods strapped to the back of it for? They certainly weren't decorative, the weird object was downright ugly with those messy wires coming out of the back. The front part definitely was some kind of clock, but it was all wrong - it was showing one minute before twelve.

Far far away from Malfoy Manor, in a very different wizarding home, Hermione Granger looked at her watch and smiled.

"What is it, Hermione?", one of the resident redheads asked.

Hermione thought back at her calculations on how large of a crater five sticks of dynamite would create.

"Nothing special, Ginny. It's just that it's Christmas morning and I just got a present I've wanted for a long time."
