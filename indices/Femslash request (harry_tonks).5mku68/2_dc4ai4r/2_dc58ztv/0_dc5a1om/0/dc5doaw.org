I paraphrased a rather good few descriptive lines that described the animal in a way that would highlight how I read it in my head.

Alas I do forget that there is an author behind the story who reads Reddit and I want to make myself clear - I really enjoyed your story and thank you for writing it. There just isn't enough Tonks in the Fandom and I enjoyed your take on her.

Fanfiction has a whole has got me through some rough times these last couple of years and I'm indebted to the authors that spend their time writing stories for free that I can read. Due to that I get rather mad when I see negative comments being fired at authors and yet in the attempt to be witty I've done the same no matter the lack of intent.

My apologies.

EDIT: That horrible moment when you also realise that it wasn't even this story, I seem to have messed up on so many levels here...
