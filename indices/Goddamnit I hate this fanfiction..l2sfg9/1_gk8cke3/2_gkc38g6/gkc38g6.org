Personally I thought that was what made it funny. But then, i kinda read it as a crackfic that became a little more serious or had more of a plot than most, I didn't really pay attention to the "science" or the author's attitude, and I didn't know about the legion of terrible fans it apparently had until after I'd mostly finished it.
