Just a point, sword's aren't actually that heavy, the aforementioned Claymore sword weighs around 2kg, or about 5lbs. Of course, without adequate training, swinging even a 2kg sword will get tiring fast, not to mention that without any skill using a sword would, at best, only be useful as a distraction.
