"You're a wizard Harry!"

Harry looked up at the giant of a man and looked at his Uncle.

"Uncle vernon, we hae ony swords muckle enough fur him or shuid we juist sell him a motor hood wrapped aroond a lamp pole?"

Vernon stamped his feet and got right close to the taller man giving him an eye.

"Ye dane wi' that silly magic nonsense 'n' aff tae uise a sword lik' a real jimmy? or shuid ah git some flowers fur yer locks?"

Hagrid had heard McGonagall a few times break out with a thick accent of her Scottish heritage. The Dursley family and Harry made her worst accent sound like the Minister giving a speech on a sunny day.

He looked around once again at the smithy he had found the family at. Apparently the factory Vernon worked at had a fire just days before Harry had shown up on their doorstep.

So Vernon had packed up everything, sold the house and traveled back to the Scottish hills where his family was from.

Now he was a well known smith and the boys were highland rough folk near as he could tell.

"I'm just here to take Harry in to get his school supplies. He needs to attend Hogwarts this fall he does."

The family broke out in a fast gaelic tongue he couldn't make heads or tails of before Vernon nodded and looked at the man.

"Sae lang as he kin tak' his sword 'n' keep up wi' practice we wull allow it."

Hagrid could just about make out the words sword, practice, and allow. He thought for a minute and nodded his head.

"Dumbledore's a great man, I'm sure he won't have a problem with that!"

Nodding back Harry asked Hagrid to wait and got changed for going into the city.

His accent got his strange looks unless he was in near full kilt and dress when he went into any of the larger cities. Then they just rolled their eyes or looked at him like it was expected.

So he got a partial dress with bunnet, brown kilt with matching hose, good walking short bits and a dark green woolen tap.

He had a short sword for now that he had papers for. Grabbing those he buckled the sword and made sure his hose knife was on tight.

Stepping out Dudley laughed and called him a proper git dressing up for the city folks. Harry couldn't disagree and could only turn on Hagrid.

"A'm duin tae gang, sae let's hurry up 'n' git gaun."

Snape wanted to talk shit to the little wanker but he was loath to do so. After he had gutted Draco on the train with his boot knife it had been a shit storm.

Draco had survived and Harry had pulled out some old as hell rules that were hard written into the Hogwarts charter.

He was allowed to be armed with martial weapons, and his honor was more than justified in being considered sullied from Draco's idiotic speech.

Now almost every student was armed and manners were at an all time high.

He'd tried to keep the status quo, until a seventh year Hufflepuff had told him his remarks were a stain on his honor. Then the bastard had forced Severus to apologize or face him on the dealing piste.

That Fredrick Nott was a stone cold sociopath and was a truly dangerous Hufflepuff was a given. That he would likely kill Severus in less than a minute was also a given. The Nott boy was a regular in the world dueling league adult bouts since he was a fifth year.

His apology had been the straw that broke the camels back. Every student and teacher was taking care to truly be polite.

The fucking prefect council had even been reestablished. Their job was to ensure any slights of honor were in fact legitimate and not simply used as an excuse to bully.

Albus was working on getting it all changed to how he liked it but it wasn't looking good.

That grades were going up, dangerous incidents were going down and the traditionalist were supporting it, well Severus wished Albus luck.

Of course it had been a ride awakening for Malfoy to find out simply because he was a leader of the Dark he had little sway with the true traditionalist.

Augusta Longbottom had nearly pulled a dirk on the man in the Wizengamot. Overall Severus had to admit it was a shitshow and it was all Potter's fault!
