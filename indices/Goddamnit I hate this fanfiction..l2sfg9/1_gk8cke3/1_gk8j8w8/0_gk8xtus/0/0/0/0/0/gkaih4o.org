Harry was walking towards the great hall on a fine Sunday morning when his favorite teacher crossed paths with him. Being a polite young man he greeted her about the day.

"A braw mornin' this is wifie mcgonagall, keekin tae th' future tae wee lamb ower neeps."

With young Harry bringing a revival of traditional life back lamb had made it back on the menu. Most of the castle was rather happy with this and today the elves had made some for breakfast.

"The neeps ur richt guid though ah will tell in ye wheesht th' wee lamb is a bawherr done."

Harry wasn't happy to hear that but it could be worse.

"At least it's taps-aff 'n' gallus. At we gaed intae th' muckle toon ah wis feart it wid be summa hot."

They both looked out the open windows before McGonagall replied.

"Well it gets a bawherr taps aff by april, a' th' magic aroond 'ere warms it up richt fast."

"That's a pity it's, aff tae fin' oot aboot waither magic ah will."

Always happy to encourage learning she replied with a positive note.

"You hae git th' braun fur it whin ye git older. Ye shuid be able tae git a crakin' rowk in yer neist year or so."

"Thanks fur th' kind wurds wifie mcgonagall. Ah will be aff tae sloch noo, guid day tae ye."
