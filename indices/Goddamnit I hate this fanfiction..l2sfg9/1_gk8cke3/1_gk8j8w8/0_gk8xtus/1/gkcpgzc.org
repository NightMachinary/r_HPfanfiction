There are exactly two situations where muggle weapons would be useful. Handgrenades and such in the DoM, maybe claymores, to cover your retreat, and the full arsenal during the Battle of Hogwarts because the Hogwarts wards negate the advantages wizards have over muggles (no apparation, too far for the Imperius). Give the DA a crash course on how to operate machine guns and mortars and the Death Eaters cannot reach the castle (the shield spells we see in canon are stationary or expand out from the caster, they are not a shield you carry aaround).You wouldn't necessarily kill Death Eaters or Voldemort, but you would stop them from advancing. More importantly, you would tear through all kinds of dark creatures since if something is vulnerable to physical force (eg being punched), it is vulnerable to bullets (I really hate the trope where guns are useless but you can kill the bad by punching it). And the more explosives you can bring to bear, the higher your chances of actually killing wizards with shrapnels from directions they didn't anticipate or by overpressure.

There are a few other scenarios where muggle weapons would be useful, but that always relies on the element of surprise and weapons killing faster than a wizard could react, not weapons overpowering magic.
