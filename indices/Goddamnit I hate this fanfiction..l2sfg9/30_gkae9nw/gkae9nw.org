I genuinely couldn't get past the first chapter where HPMOR!Harry who was like, fucken eleven at the time, went on a spiel that you could tell was coming /straight/ from the author's mouth about how McGonagall violates the laws of physics like the series isn't about god damn magic. I just felt like the whole fic would be about the mastubatory exploits of a completely OOC "lel, genius" harry being smarter than everyone, and as far as I've heard the fic be described, it doesn't seem like I was wrong.
