So, I actually had a similar reaction reading The Arithmancer. I really liked the first couple years, but got thrown for such a loop when Hermione learns about dementors and has a literally existensial crisis over the existence of souls and soul-sucking demons. Like all of a sudden she starts flipping out about God and religion and all this shit that had previously gone completely ignored throughout the fic. It was super frustrating for me and definitely threw me out of the story for a while.
