So I read methods of rationality when I was a lot younger and really enjoyed it (I've since revisited it)

the early story is definitely rough (and does make fun of a lot of aspects of canon)

But I do think if you come at the story from the perspective that Harry is a genuinely flawed character who learns to be a good and /more/ rational individual over the course of the story, then it is a worthwhile read.

The author definitely puts a lot of his viewpoints into Harry's mouth but he's not always correct in story (he just tend to think he is)

I get the hate for sure but I do actually think most of the complaints I've seen about the fic itself, are actually addressed in a reasonable way in the text.

It's not perfect or for everyone and Harry is a pretentious little shit at times,but I don't think it's badly written it's coherent it's characters are fleshed out and flawed and are pretty interesting IMO

I definitely have a soft spot for HPMOR, but I really don't think it's as sneery or as author inserty as people make it out to be.
