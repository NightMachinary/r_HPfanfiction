I read the whole fic. It's got some semi-humorous moments of parody in the beginning, a neat Enders Game rip-off section, an attempt at a heist story... but all of this is interspersed with, and filled with shitty author tracts about how death is the great enemy and reducing Bayes Theorem to crystal ball biased guesses. I used to be really into Yudkowsky, I even read his original fiction, but I've ultimately concluded that he's a self important huckster.
