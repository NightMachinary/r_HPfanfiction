Meh, a tidbit of weird logic from time to time isn't what messes me up when I attempt to reread it.

It's memories of freaking Spring Break, the farthest I ever got; suffice to say, I had to stop because I freaked out. Years later when I heard the last chapter was releasing, I decided to peek at the last few chapters to confirm if I might be able to retain my sanity on a reread... suffice to say, I still haven't been able to do it. If anyone hasn't read the fic and wants a word of warning to try and steel you so maybe you'll avoid the same kind of breakdown I had: she comes back near the end.
