I haven't read the fic since I read enough about it online, but I was under the impression that it's considered poor taste on fanfic subs to make a post to criticize a fanfiction. Would people object to the post if the chosen story was different? I thought that current fanfiction etiquette is "don't like, don't read" and "move on" because concrit isn't wanted/the author wrote their story for free. Is it fair game to post how much you hate a specific story and all your reasons why or is this just the super popular fic exception like "My Immortal"?
