The fic is called G is for Gabrielle, it's from Gabrielle Delacour's POV but I don't think I should link it because, warning, there was a few instances where there was sexualization of a minor (the only thing that stopped it from being a completely perfect fic for me because the charactization and magic in it was done SO well).
