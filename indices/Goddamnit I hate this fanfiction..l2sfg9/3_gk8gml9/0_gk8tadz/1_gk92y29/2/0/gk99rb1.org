Strangely, it worked out really well. There were a lot of plots the author was juggling at the same time though, that's why it was so long. But even focusing on the main plot, I didn't notice that hardly a day had passed by as I was reading because there was a lot going on. It didn't drag on like HPMoR's 300 year Diagon Alley trip.
