Reminds me of a fic I'm following that used to be rather enjoyable but recently started padding the word count with unimportant worldbuilding digressions at every opportune and inopportune moment.

Another character says something? Why, that's the perfect place to have the PoV character think about it and then think about how it relates to their own life and then narrate half their life story!

Recently it has had three chapters with a total length of 25k or so words which tell us about the things that happen on the day of the first task /before the task even starts/. Granted there's an Order of Merlin ceremony before the task for some reason, but still! The PoV character during the ceremony remarks on how boring the speeches are and then goes on to describe the content of those speeches. Before the whole ceremony another PoV character tells us about his political career and the history of socialism based on an offhand comment by another person about what country they've recently been to.

It's all very aggravating and I don't know why I keep reading it.
