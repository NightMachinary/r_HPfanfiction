Very intense and action-packed though most of it was lighthearted mishaps. But there was some scenes from other POVs that showed the more serious and darker stuff going on at the time which added to the word count.

It was really well done though, because unlike HPMoR, it didn't feel like a drag. I didn't even notice that hardly a day passed after a few chapters.
