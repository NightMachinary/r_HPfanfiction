The fic is called G is for Gabrielle, it's from Gabrielle Delacour's POV from the week before Bill and Fleur's wedding. Warning though, if you choose to read it, there were a few instances where there was sexualization of a minor I guess because she's a Veela. If the author never included those, I would be recommending this fic everywhere because everything else about it was done so well. So disappointing.
