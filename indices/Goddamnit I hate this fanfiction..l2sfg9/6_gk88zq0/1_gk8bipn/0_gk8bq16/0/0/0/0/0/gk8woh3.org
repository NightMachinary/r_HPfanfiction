Harry also realizes that Draco isn't necessarily evil in this instance, he's an ignorant kid spouting something he hears his dad say. Harry is thinking that maybe, as a peer, he can show Draco that empathy isn't a weakness, and can in fact be a strength. He manipulates the shit out of him because Draco isn't really a peer at all, but he decides to take responsibility for turning an ignorant kid who thinks rape is a joke into a functional human being.
