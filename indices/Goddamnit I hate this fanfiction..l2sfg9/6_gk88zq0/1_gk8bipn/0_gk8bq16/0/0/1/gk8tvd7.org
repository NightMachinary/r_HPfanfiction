The rape thing isn't a joke, but IIRC Harry had made a murder joke but Malfoy thought he was serious and cast a Muffliato to seriously discuss the viability of the murder. Harry assumes the entire conversation is a joke until Malfoy makes the rape comment, at which point he realizes that Malfoy is serious. Malfoy jokes that getting away with it would be so easy that her father would wind up paying the Malfoys money for defamation of character if he tried to charge him with rape. Harry then makes another joke comment to prevent Malfoy from actually raping her (claiming that he intends to marry her).

The initial comment wasn't a joke, but the entire conversation had a jokey tone to it (including the parts about rape). That tone is intentional, and supposed to make the reader understand that Malfoy doesn't think rape is a serious crime because of the way he was raised.

It is not a well-done segment, and Yudkowsky has rightfully received tons of criticism for it.
