In Sweden, we actually call biological parents in this context "genetic parents" if literally translated. I'd chalk up /that/ issue to a possible language difference at most. The fic has far bigger problems than that.

EDIT: While I stand by that the fic has much bigger issues, it appears that I was mistaken about the wording Swedish uses generally. While we do use both, "biologiska föräldrar" (biological parents) is used far more. Not sure where I got the idea from, it's possible that since I'm not really exposed to adoption in general in real life (i.e. where I use Swedish), the few times it did come up happened to use the "genetiska föräldrar" term.
