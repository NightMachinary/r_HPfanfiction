Hmm? That's always the term I've heard..? Then again, I haven't really had any adoption-related events in real life, so my main sources of it has been movies (back when I still received everything in Swedish), which used the former. That might have been a quirk of the translation, though.

EDIT: I looked it up. It seems like both are used, but biological (well, "biologiska") to a far larger extent. "Adoption genetiska föräldrar" (eng. "Adoption genetical parents") gives 34.4k results on Google, "adoption biologiska föräldrar" gives 59k. So yeah, I was mistaken, even if both do see use. Sorry! Edited the post to correct this.
