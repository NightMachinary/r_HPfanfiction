I enjoyed the fic on my first read when it was coming out chapter by chapter, and I still reread it on occasion even now. I do end up skipping certain parts nowadays, and my rereads don't quite give me the same level of enjoyment as the first time did. Chalk it up to growing up a bit more perhaps.

I still resonate with the humanist message that the story has throughout though, and Harry's solution to his patronus charm "happy thoughts" problem still makes me smile.

That said, I find it hilarious how much genuine, visceral hate this fic gets. It's quite funny from the sidelines because of how disproportionate it feels, you'd think the author had burned down someone's house or something.
