My worst issue with this fic was that it had so much good ideas, so much potential, that even taken apart some of them could make real good AUs by /themselves/, and yet he just... Put them all in one fic, and didn't even bother to make it enjoyable.

So, yeah. Look, MoR has good ideas. It's got a different tone than other fics. It's... Interesting, sure. And it can be fascinating.

Is it enjoyable? No. Not at all.
