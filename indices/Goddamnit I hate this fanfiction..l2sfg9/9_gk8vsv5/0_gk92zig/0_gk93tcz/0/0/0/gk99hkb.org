Some of the soliloquies are very well done, there are subtle (or not) musical accompaniments to different parts. The guy in charge got some other voice actors to read along. For a fan production of a fanfic, it is quite well done and draws you into the story well. It was great for long car rides and drives.

I can still recall the feeling I got from Harry's first patronus, Draco's first patronus, Harry and Quirrelmort sitting together in space, Harry calling upon the great old ones to Smite the bullies, and of course the final test. I'm tempted to listen to that again after I finish the story I'm on now.
