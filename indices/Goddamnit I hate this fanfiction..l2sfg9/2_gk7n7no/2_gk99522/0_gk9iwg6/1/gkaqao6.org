/Harry Crow/ is pretty terrible, but it was written at a time when the fanfiction field was a lot more barren and people have a fondness for it based on that nostalgia. RobSt has a number of better written, plotted, and characterized stories (to be fair, he also has /worse/), where Yudkowsky had only HPMoR.
