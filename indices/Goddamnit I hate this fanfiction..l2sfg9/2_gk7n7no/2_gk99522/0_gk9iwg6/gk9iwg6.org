Robst 100% hands down. Harry Crow made me want to throw up. Biggest power fantasy cheat code crap I read in a long time.

I enjoy a good power fantasy now and then, but at least you have to have a teensy bit of real conflict. One Punch man is a story about the most powerful character ever, and the story still manages to have conflict and humor. It can be done.
