And people complain about Harry's knowledge of certain aspects of science being wrong. Even if that wasn't intended, that's fine. He's a kid, even if he is suppose to be an Ender type of character.

I'm with you. It was my first fanfiction and I definitely wouldn't have continued on if I didn't find that one. Sure I've found fictions that were much better, but they are rare.

Plus I really like the plot device. It's really hard to make a smart harry without falling trap to the "author's prior knowledge" pitfall. Hpmor falls victim of that a lot when it starts out, but you can tell the author improves with practice. That and it's hard to write a character that is smarter than you. Conan Doyle had that issue with Sherlock Holmes. You end up glossing over some things.

So I'm always down for good smart harry fanfics. That and time travel are my jams.
