Yeah, it's literally the word in British English, and 'snicker' brings up thoughts of 'snicket' or chocolate bars, rather than laughter, except recently.

Rather than smack readers in the face with a 'cleverly hidden n word' (it never was, but that's not going to stop it stinging American readers), I've switched to the American term. However, it's just how that word is in British English and people will be using it entirely innocently and probably, like I was, rather aghast to see what's been read into it.
