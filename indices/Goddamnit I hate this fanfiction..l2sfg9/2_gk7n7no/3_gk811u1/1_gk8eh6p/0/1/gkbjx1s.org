I don't see how 'timed exclusive', especially of WIP content, would be more illegal than having a patreon in the first place...

Edit: I'm seeing downvotes, I'd love comments to discuss this. To clarify: I don't see how having a Patreon tailored to your fanfiction would be less illegal than having that Patreon and then going 'when something is finished, you can read it early if you're a patron or wait for an edited version to be posted publically if you are not'
