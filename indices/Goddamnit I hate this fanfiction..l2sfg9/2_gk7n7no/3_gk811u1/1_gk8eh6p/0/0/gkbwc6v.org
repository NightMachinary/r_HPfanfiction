Yeah, if I went Patreon, it would be for original works that readers of my fanfics might like. It wouldn't be fanfic itself, but fanfic is a great introduction to an author's writing style and competence.

Of course, by that point I've paid at least Â£250 to a solicitor (lawyer-of-paperwork), probably several times that, to make sure that there is no argument that I am 'selling fanfic', and I've also paid a professional editor for the webnovel manuscript too.

Now, how and where to advertise without being banned from fanfic communities and hosts, that's trickier.
