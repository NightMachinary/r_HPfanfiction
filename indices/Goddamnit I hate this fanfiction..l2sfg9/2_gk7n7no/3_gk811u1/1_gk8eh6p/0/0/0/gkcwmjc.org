Not really. It's completely allowed to link to anything that is not your patreon/'Insert Fund Me page here' on Ao3 and ff.net. Fanfiction.net has auto formatting that makes it tougher to post links because too many people were directly linking and they lack actual staff to moderate the archive.

Aka: You can totally link to your personal reddit/discord/webpage which then has a link to your Patreon, for example.
