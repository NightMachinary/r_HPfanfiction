The scene at Madam Malkin's is one of the few things in that fic I actually liked.

That and the bit where Harry scares the bejezus out of a Dementor - though I dislike where it came from (being one of the many "Harry being less a character and more a vehicle for the author to filibuster" moments), I can appreciate that moment itself and the news article afterwards ("Entire British Wizengamot reports seeing 'Boy-Who-Lived' Frighten A Dementor" "Expert on Magical Creatures: 'Now you're just lying'").

There is some good humor in the fic. It's a shame that it's interspersed by paragraph upon paragraph of [[/r/iamverysmart]].
