No, it's just a memetic hazard, i.e. if you know about the idea you're potentially in danger. [[http://www.scpwiki.com/antimemetics-division-hub][An antimeme is "an idea with self-censoring properties."]] It's something that you can learn about, but you forget about it once it's not something you're consciously thinking about. A closer example of an antimeme would actually be how magical secrets are treated in certain fics, i.e. Prince of Slytherin.

I don't read a ton of SCP, but a web serial I read (Worth the Candle) draws from it a fair bit and has a whole subset of memes and anti-memes.
