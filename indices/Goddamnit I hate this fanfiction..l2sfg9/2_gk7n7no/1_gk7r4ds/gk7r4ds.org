I'd actually recommend it, when the story isn't trying to be smart Harry can actually be a fun character. For example, Harry and Draco's joke in the clothing store is pretty funny. I think this why I hate it so much because the author is competent about 10% of the time. So the 90% failure rate is even more unacceptable than it is in a story where everything is constantly bad. That said it's still a valuable negative example, I mean how often do you find a piece of writing where you can say "Look at that, that is what talking down to your audience looks like."
