As great as character growth is, I think a lot of people need the character to be somewhat likeable or compelling enough to lead the story. There's a pretty big jump between "this character is really annoying and makes all these stupid assumptions" and "this character is literally perfect."

I've definitely dropped books because the main character was just too obnoxious for me to deal with. I think you kind of have to want to character to get better for it be satisfying that they do.
