Yeah, I can't deal if the character is too horrible. In the very beginning of The Chronicle's of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, he straight up rapes a woman who'd been nothing but helpful when he was stranded and confused. Just because he could.

I read a bit more after that, but the bitter taste was too much, and I decided no amount of redemption could turn this around for me.

Turns out the entire series is rather depressing after reading reviews, so I'm not missing much.
