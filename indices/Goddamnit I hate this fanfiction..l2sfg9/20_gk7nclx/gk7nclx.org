Harry is an annoying little shit that makes too many assumptions about things he doesnt know because he's scientifically minded and just discovered a world that doesnt need science to function. As the story progresses, he learns more and becomes a little bit wider and a little bit less of an obnoxious shit. It's called character growth. If a character starts the story perfect. They have no room for growth, no room for drama and strife, no room to be entertaining as a story. That being said, the first ten chapters of that story need a rewrite, badly.
