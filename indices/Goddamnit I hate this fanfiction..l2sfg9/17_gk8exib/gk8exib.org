I honestly don't understand why this subreddit seems to hate this fanfiction so much. I mean yes it has flaws, but so have many of the recommended stories I see here everyday. It is at least written in a good enough style that the stories flows well, it has no major plot holes that I can recall, no deus ex machina...

The two major criticism I've seen for it is that the characters don't act like 11 year old children, which... Yeah true, just imagine they're 17 or whatever, is it really such a big flaw that you'd stop reading it entirely ? At least there is no sex between 13 year old children like in other fic I've seen recommended.\\
And the other one : the rants on the sciency parts can be annoying. I can get that, although I personally enjoyed them, but even if you don't, I believe they stop after around 10 chapters.

As for the criticism in this thread that Harry assumes that magic will follow the rules of science... Well I thought that this was kind of the point of the early chapters and every experiment he makes : Magic DEFINITELY doesn't follow any part of our current understanding of the physics rules, but it still follows some rules. And as long as something has rules, the scientific method will help you find them. And from my memory of the fic (It's been a while since I read it though), Harry makes the mistake of making "logical" assumptions early on and get sharp reminders that his logic is wrong, but then he learns better and ends up understanding more and more of the underlying rules of magic. I thought that it could be a good introduction/reminder of the scientific method, and why our current scientific theories actually have some weight and are not just a bunch of cool ideas from dudes in a lab coat.

My main complaint with the fic would be that he jumps into helping Bellatrix escape on the world of Quirrel without questioning anything, but then again, I've seen worth plot holes in fics more highly recommended...

So yeah, TL;DR, I get that this fic cannot be everyone's cup of tea, but why does EVERYONE on the sub hates it ? Not just disliking it, but actively loathing it and making it known actively. It's not so bad, or did I miss something ?
