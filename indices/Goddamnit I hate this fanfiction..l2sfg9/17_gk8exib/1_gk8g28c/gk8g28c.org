I don't know why everyone hates it /so/ much. But personally, my problem with it is it's inherently flawed nature. See the experiment I mentioned in the original post. It's not so much that Harry makes assumptions that don't follow, more that even when he has the chance to apply the scientific method he fucks up. Also, it was monetized which is generally disliked.

Edit: Also we fanfiction writers tend to be the assholes who go "Wait, what the fuck? That doesn't follow at all!" So I think we also just have a vested interest in non-pretentious logic.

More edit: I forgot to mention the rape shit, I haven't gotten there yet so I kinda forgot about it.
