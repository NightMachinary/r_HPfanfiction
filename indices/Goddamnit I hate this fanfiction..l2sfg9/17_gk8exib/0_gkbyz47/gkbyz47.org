People hate something more that nearly hits the point and misses, than something that is just really, really bad or boring.

HPMoR has good bits and looks like it /could/ get there but then doesn't. It is good enough to evoke an emotional reaction. It's also the skeleton of an online event, a moment in time, so people have fond, very fond memories of it being constructed (I do too), and make the mistake of recommending it without a reread, especially since it was revised.

I don't recommend it, although I will link people to it if that particular subject comes up.

If the author ever gets a decent editor in tow they'll probably write some fun fiction that doesn't hold water on later examination, and that's fine, tons of people do just that.

What they haven't done is produce the One True Way of thinking about reality, which the work and author notes claim to do, and that's the /other/ half of the backlash. People dislike what the author is evangelising.
