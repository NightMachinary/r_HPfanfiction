Yeah, and I find the Harry in it to be a bit unlikable after a bit. Mostly nowadays I tend to roll my eyes a bit and just gloss over mentions of it. Everyone has to start somewhere and I won't begrudge a newbie who doesn't know anything else. Hell, I still have fics I love that I know are trash compared to others and are probably heavily nostalgia-tainted. =)

As far as others bashing. People only comment on what they know or have read and most have come in contact with such a popular fic, for good or ill. The people who search out the less known stuff tend to like it and comment more positively when it pops up. Or so it seems anyway.
