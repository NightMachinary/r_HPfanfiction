Thanks for the detailed answer, I haven't read it in a while and my memories might also be tainted by nostalgia as it was one of my first fanfiction. It was my go to recommendation for a while I must admit, I just hadent read the better fics yet. I guess I just find the hate it gets excessive, but I can see how it might get annoying after a while if any new member of the community talks about it. Although again, I've rather seen the opposite: someone recommending it and getting answers bashing the fic, whereas any other recommendation would only get positive comments if any.
