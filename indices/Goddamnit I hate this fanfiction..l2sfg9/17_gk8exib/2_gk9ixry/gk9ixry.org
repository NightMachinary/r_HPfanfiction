I tried reading it years back and found it interesting to start and gave up after a while. I might have some stuff mixed up with other stories from then, but from what I can recall:

1: It takes more than half a million words, a total greater than the first 4 HP books combined, just to get halfway through year one. And in that length of time more happens to the characters than even a full season (or two!) of a wacky scifi TV show, yet without ever getting anything significant done other than the author soapboxing about how awesome or great or impossible something is for chapters on end. Even comic books and freaking Dragon (Blue)Ball have more progression (but a similar 'diving into the depths' issue) in less time.

2: Just how much f-ing time does he waste (yes, I consider it a waste in the balance of things) in how he can 'redeem' the character of Draco yet completely alienating the vast majority of the rest of the school in the process. I don't like Draco much, but can see some fics where he is young and doesn't know better, and thus becomes better, but he's already several feet into death eater indoctrination (or at least Basic Bad Guy in Waiting).

3: Adult-acting 'kids' I am actually ok with, in that I can't stand whiny tween n teen bs, but the [[/r/iamverysmart]] late teens/20s college student vibe of: "I know everything or at least am just so fucking smart I figure it out" is very grating, especially since he always seems to be able to rant forever about his crisis du jour and rarely gets stopped without pages of verbal vomit first, often running over whoever is suffering through it.

4: In regards to the above: Sure he gets 'punished' and smacked down here and there, but there is so much blatant favoritism for what he is allowed to get away with its insane. It is more balanced than some other stories in how students are treated dismissively. The villians are actually well written and smarter than some others on the whole... but I guess I prefer a more black and white view of things instead of the insidious danger of constantly being so close to some of them.

Really, if it was shorter one-off and/or occasionally referenced, it would be fine. But I run into it constantly being praised as the best fic ever and it just sticks in my craw a bit. Its like... the first 7 books of HP being the first 7 seasons of Game of Thrones, only for MoR to be a season 8 flashback episode... stretched out over 7 more seasons... filled with nothing but dialog that completely ignores a lot of the original, all with 1% of the budget and talent.

I'm being a bit harsh. It really isn't bad to start, just drags after a while. And it has brought more people into fanfic that might not have found it otherwise. But like anyone who has been in a fandom forever: It gets tiring seeing the new people raving about that one 'special' episode of a show, or that one 'popular' cover song that is completely different from the other albums, or that one 'hot' actor guest star in a long running series.
