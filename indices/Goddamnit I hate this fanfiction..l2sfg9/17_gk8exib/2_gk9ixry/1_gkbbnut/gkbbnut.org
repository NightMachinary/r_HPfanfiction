Actually, spending a lot of time trying to reform the Malfoy heir does make sense.

- The Malfoys have a lot of money and basically own the court system. Shifting Draco's loyalty would have big ripple effects throughout society.
- People like Hermione and Neville don't need much reform. She's already great, and Neville just needs confidence. And Harry does support them in their efforts to be great, they just don't need the same level of attention.
- If he doesn't do something about Draco's attitude, there's a real possibility of Luna Lovegood getting raped and obliviated in a few years as retaliation against the Quibbler, and the courts won't help as long as Lucius Malfoy owns them.
