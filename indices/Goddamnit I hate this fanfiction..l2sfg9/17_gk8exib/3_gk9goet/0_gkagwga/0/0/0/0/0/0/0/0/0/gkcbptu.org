Your exact words of the first sentence were "Brevity is a virtue for an academic thesis or a cookbook".

And I'd be inclined to agree with your follow up sentence if MOR actually furthered the plot in those 500k words. Instead, it's mostly Harry going on tirades, yes tirades, about how magic doesn't follow the laws of science. Brevity would have been a blessing as I couldn't get past the 5th chapter. And this is coming from the guy that has kept up to date with all 145 or so chapters of Prince of Slytherin.
