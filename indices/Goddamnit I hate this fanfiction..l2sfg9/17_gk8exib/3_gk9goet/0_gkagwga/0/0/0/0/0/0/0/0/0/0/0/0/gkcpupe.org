Perhaps you skipped chapter 8, where Harry and Hermione discuss good and bad science and she goes about testing a hypothesis? Not to mention Harry's experimentation with Comed-Tea, from chapter 7 to chapter 14, which is just silliness on the face of it, but turns out to highlight the important principle that sometimes we fail to successfully investigate something - either we can't get an answer, or we come to the wrong answer - because the true explanation is so different from what we're used to that we never even hypothesized it.

Since the stern warning against transfiguring liquids or gases was in fact given by Professor McGonagall, not Professor Quirrell, and after quite a /detailed and even occasionally gruesome/ explanation, I'd venture to say that perhaps you didn't actually read chapter 15, either.

(And on what basis are you saying that it's not dangerous to transfigure a liquid or gas? Canon? This is AU.)
