Being in the top 1% isn't a bad recommendation.

And I question the idea that it's excellent spelling but garbage writing. For example, it has a genuinely clever, dangerous, partially understandable and partially sympathetic antagonist. That's a big deal.

And everyone's sense of humour is different, of course, but I for one found it very funny.

And even if you think Harry is wrong about a lot of things, he still makes you think about it.

I felt the character development was a weaker point; I didn't feel attached enough to cry about Hermione's death. But it gives that a go too.

A story that makes you laugh, think, and maybe cry is doing something right.
