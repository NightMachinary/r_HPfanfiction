Brevity is a virtue for an academic thesis or a cookbook. For a fictional story, it's sometimes valuable, other times irrelevant. (Some people /like/ being immersed for longer.)

Pacing... definitely reflects the fact that it was originally written serially. But I didn't find it to cause notable problems when I was reading it. What problems did you see?

Neither of those things puts it into "garbage" territory. "A story with a fascinating and thought-provoking plot that occasionally drags things out a bit" could describe The Lord of the Rings; pacing and brevity are real concerns, but secondary ones.
