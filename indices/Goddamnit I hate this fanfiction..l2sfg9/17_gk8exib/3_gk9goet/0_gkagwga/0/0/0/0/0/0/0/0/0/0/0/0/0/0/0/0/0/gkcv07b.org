And get full explanation of why no liquid: Liquid evaporates, little bits and pieces of it get into the air.

Unless you put your face right at the point of transfiguration, you're not going to inhale it. Even if you do, you're going to breathe it out almost immediately. Also, speed of evaporation is a thing. It's not going to start evaporating the minute you turn it into a liquid, especially in September in Scotland.
