Wait, you haven't read past chapter 5, yet you claim to judge the writing quality of the whole story? I mean, I gave up on Harry Crow at chapter ten, but I don't claim to know just how well the rest of it was written; I'm relying on other people's assurance that it didn't fundamentally change from those first ten chapters. And even then, I'm still able to allow that if someone felt differently about the issues it's addressing, they might well like it better than I did. I'm willing to say that Harry in those ten chapters was the most Gary Stu character I've ever seen, a good match for the "Black Hole Sue" trope, but I don't make any definite statement about whether he continued to be that way, only my best guess.

Chapter 5 is practically the start of HPMoR. At that point, /of course/ Harry is still in full "None of this makes sense in terms of what I already know!" mode. That changes as he learns more magic and sees for himself that it reliably works. (Though he's still left scratching his head at what's really going on.)

By the way, various readers would agree that the early chapters of HPMoR are not, in terms of writing quality, the equal of the later ones, that the author was still finding his feet, which is why one of them rewrote the first four chapters as linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).
