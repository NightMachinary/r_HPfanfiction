I suggest actually reading chapter 15, where Professor McGonagall gives quite a sufficient explanation of how it's extremely dangerous, including an in-story real example. And Harry tries to speculate on how it might actually work (with a liquid, by the way, not a gas, and after specific instructions from his teacher to try to imagine it - further suggesting that you haven't read it), but knows he doesn't have enough information.

(And besides, even if transfiguring a gas /might/, in some circumstances, not kill you, we're talking about a warning given by a teacher to a class of eleven-year-olds. Telling them "you shall never ever do anything of the sort" is entirely reasonable.)
