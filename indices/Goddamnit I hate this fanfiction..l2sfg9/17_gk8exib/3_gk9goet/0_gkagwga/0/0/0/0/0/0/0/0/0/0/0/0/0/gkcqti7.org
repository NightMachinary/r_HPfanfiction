Do you know how dispersion of a gas works? Because spoiler: depending on volume created, you have to be dead center at the point of creation along with having to literally flood your lungs with it. You're more likely to breathe in and immediately exhale whatever transpired air you created than ending up dead at the end of it. Also, we don't know if it's atomic transmission or direct transmission. Atomic basically means one atom of wood is one atom of water. Because we've been given no rules, Harry sounds like a complete moron. Hell, even as an 11 year old, he could have gave a simple "you'd die", but nooooo, he had to talk like a college student taking advanced biochemistry... and still be wrong.
