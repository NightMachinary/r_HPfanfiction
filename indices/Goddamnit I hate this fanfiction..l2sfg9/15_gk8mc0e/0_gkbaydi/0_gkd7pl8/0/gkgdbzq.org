Losing his first mock battle because it doesn't occur to him that other people have valuable contributions to make. Hurting Neville's wrist by being unnecessarily rough. Needing to win so badly that he misuses his Time Turner and gets it locked, which ends up contributing to him not being able to save Hermione's life. And yes, his trust in Professor Quirrell - which is not that hard to understand, for a bright but impressionable child who's never before encountered someone on his wavelength like that, and then this teacher takes a special interest in him and extols his skills - leads to some whoppers like breaking Bellatrix Lestrange out of Azkaban, but the biggest mistake of all was narrowly averted by the Unbreakable Vow; even Voldemort wouldn't have actually annihilated the planet, but Harry's impulsiveness could have.
