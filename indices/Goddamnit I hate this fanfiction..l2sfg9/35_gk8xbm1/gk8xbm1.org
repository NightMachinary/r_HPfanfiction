Ah... So we are here again. The most hated, most popular, and most divisive Harry Potter fanfic ever written. I will agree it has some major issues, but it is also something wholy different. Especially when compared with the stories of it's time. It has some really thought provoking ideas, and the way it uses tension and stakes are quite good in my opinion. Of course, this is from someone that could see past it's mistakes and not care that much. Not everyone can do that.
