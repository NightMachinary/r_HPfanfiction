Thank you for a nice little corner of positivity for this fic.

Hpmor was not my first fic but i think you nailed what i really liked about it that i never really managed to understand. Its HOPE. I still remember one conversation Harry had with Quirrell were the man confessed he would like to find a place far away were he could belong and leave everything behind and Harry later thinking that he could never understand Quirrell because Harry would never run, when things go bad , you just dont leave them, you stay and fight.

It just stuck with me all this time.
