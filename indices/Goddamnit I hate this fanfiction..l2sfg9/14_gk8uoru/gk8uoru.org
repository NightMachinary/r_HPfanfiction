Ok, unpopular opinion here:

HPMOR was literally the /first/ fanfic that I ever read, and as such it will always have a special place in my heart. When I first read it, one of the things that most touched me was Harry's HOPE and FAITH in humanity. I always was a very pessimistic and cynical person, and I struggled a lot with depression and suicidal thoughts. Harry's speech with Dumbledore about immortality still is one of the things that helps me when things get hard ("but what would you do with immortality?" "I would read every book ever published, party with my grandkids in Mars, meet every interesting person, watch the sun explode from new earth, discover every secret of the universe. Every day, I would want to live JUST ANOTHER DAY, and as such, I would want to live forever" - it's not exactly that, but something like it). His belief that humanity will find a better path was something very inspiring for kid me, something that got me going.

Besides that, when I was younger, I also was very much like Harry. I thought I knew the root of all evil and the reason the world was so shitty was bc everyone was stupid, and not a genius like, you know, 13 year old me. I very much identified with eleven year old Harry: why are the adults so /stupid?/ When I first read it, seeing he get in trouble with his friends and teachers over his arrogance, even when he might be in the right (in his opinion) was not only hard for me, it was /familiar/, the same happen to me. In most stories, the main character does something wrong either out of necessity or impulsivity, and they know it. In HPMOR, Harry has a rational argument about why he acted the way he did, a good, solid reason, and he was still wrong. Seeing in a fictional character something I did (and rarely still do, old habits are hard to kill) helped me correct my behavior and see why what I did was wrong. Now, spoiler alert for anyone interested in reading the fic:

Harry's character is not supposed to be likeable. He is literally a Tom Riddle clone, with a smidgeon of Harry's soul in there. I reread the fic these days, and honestly, Harry is exactly that: a precocious kid with a self entitled atitude, coupled with a sense of superiority and a risible nativity. He is not a self insert genius, he is /a smart eleven years old/. Problem is, he /think/ he is a genius. So he gets involved in all sorts of troubles, even when the older, more experienced adults of his life tell him not to. He frees Bellatrix from jail bc her son asks him to, and due to his god complex, he does it. He doesn't think about the consequences or what that entails, he just does it. He challenges Snape, he tries to go toe to toe with Dumbledore, he thinks he will have an enormous breakthrough in magic by applying the simple experimental method: a kid. At the end of the fic, we see that a literal vow against destroying the world was necessary, bc otherwise /harry would have bc he wouldn't have thought through his actions, and probably messed with something that shouldn't be messed./ The fic isn't about "but what if a genius entered Hogwarts?" It's about learning to respect other people's opinion, expertise and experience, even if you might think you know best. Every opinion is valid, and one should try to keep an open mind, even if it sounds like complete bullshit. Otherwise, you stagnate. Like Harry, at the begining of the fic.

Honestly, I really like HPMOR. Once you stop taking Harry seriously and start regarding him as a very biased narrator, the fic gets a lot better. But that's just my opinion.
