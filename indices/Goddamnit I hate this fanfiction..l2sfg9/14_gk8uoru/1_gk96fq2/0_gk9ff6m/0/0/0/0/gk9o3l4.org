Wait... Ah, you're talking about Harry's "dark side" as he calls it. I was talking about the linearity of the universe and his panic attack when he got Neville's remembeball and the thing shone like the sun. It was a bit after that he started to ask himself if the universe was really consistent or not. But anyway.

About the dark side (and if that name isn't a good sign that Harry is a little kid I don't know what is) I think that's just... How he deals with anger, really. He gets cold, and cruel, and sharp... Bullshit, he just gets mad. Some people think better under pressure. But he doesn't feel like /himself/ when he is angry, after he calms down he sees that he did things "he wouldn't normally consider acceptable". So he alienates it and calls it his "dark side". Probably bc he also clearly has some anger manegent issues.
