Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. He ends a chapter with, 'there was something seriously wrong with Harry Potter,' and just goes on his way. Hmmm, it would be cool to see Harry like, I don't know, do something? If it wasn't a chapter end, it wouldn't stand out. Because I read the original scene and thought Harry was acting angry, and he sees the same scene and has an existential crisis? I'd like to see that get dealt with, even by being shoved to the side, before I have to deal with Quirrell again.
