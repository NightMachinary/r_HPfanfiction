Well... There IS a moment when Harry tries to figure out just what the heck is going on with the time-turner. Something about multiplication of prime numbers of 3 digits or something. We basically get a "don't mess with time" out of it. Wich, to be honest, is kind of the only thing the author could do outside of the realm of sci-fi and, well, logic. That's the problem with time travel, unless you suspend your disbelief, it just doesn't work. So the author just put a "screw it! It works, this is how it's applied and we won't answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe using a device created for nerds! No one is finding out if we actually have free will or no with a damn time-turner!"
