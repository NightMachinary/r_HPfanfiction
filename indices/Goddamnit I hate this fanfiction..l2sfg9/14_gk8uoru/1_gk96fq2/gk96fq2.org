I like those elements too. It's fairly well written, the characters are well done. I can't get over the pacing though. It just doesn't work for me. That and the worldbuilding is a bit clunky. I like the characters, but I think they're brought down by the world and pacing of the story.

Though I do make fun of their Harry, because it's entertaining. And to at least a degree, we're probably supposed to.
