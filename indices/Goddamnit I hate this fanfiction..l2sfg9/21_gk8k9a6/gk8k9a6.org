It's a trend for fics that involve interesting magi-science concepts to be trash outside of them. They always feel like they're written by a reddit pseudo-intellectual.

If you want something easier to read that involves exploring magic's limits and fucking around with it (this one focuses on magitech), try linkffn(13326497)

It has one of the worst Harrys I've ever read - the author tries to make an OP!Harry at the start, but eventually gives him, and to some degree everyone else, the personality of a "Good Guy Harry Who Can Do No Wrong" - always angsting over nonsense, fishing for people to tell him he's a good guy and in his interactions with women you keep expecting him to tip a fedora and say "M'lady".

But it's generally pretty readable, as long as you're fine with every single plotline falling short of expectations.
