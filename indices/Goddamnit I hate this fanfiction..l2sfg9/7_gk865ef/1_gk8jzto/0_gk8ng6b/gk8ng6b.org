There's the occasional obnoxious guy, who feels the need to rant about how they're going to stop reading X fic, because the protagonist didn't act in the most optimal manner in that one scene.

Most people are normal though, yes. Lot's of fans of power fantasies, but that's also the case on fanfiction.net.
