People don't ask why Frodo didn't just hop on an eagle, they ask why Manwe didn't send the eagles to deal with the Ring in the first place. Which is a valid question that can be meaningfully talked about more than just "because then there wouldn't be a story".

SB on the other hand loves to ask "why does this character not do the things I believe are optimal" even though the character doesn't have all the OOC knowledge that the reader has. They keep asking "why don't these characters act so unrealistic? They should already know all the things that I know from reading the canon story even though they have absolutely no way to know without magically infusing them with OOC knowledge." This is in addition to the usual ignoring that characters are supposed to be human beings with flaws and not perfect rational machines that exist solely to wank.

Granted it's not a large part of SB that acts like this but it's common enough that "SB competence" has become a bit of a meme.
