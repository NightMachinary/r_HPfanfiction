Honestly i just dislike spacebattles in general, but specifically i've always associated the overly nitpicky, minutiae obssesed, get angry when something doesn't go exactly in favour of the main character people that are everywhere on spacebattles with VS debates people and the rational crowd. It's why you see so much wanking get so popular too. Not sure if infested really is the right word, it's just that "VS debate people" and "Rational crowd" people tend to intersect alot from what i've seen.
