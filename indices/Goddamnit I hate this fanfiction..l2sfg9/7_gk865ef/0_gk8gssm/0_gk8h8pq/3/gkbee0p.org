If you care about a short explanation of the premise, Worm is a webserial by Wildbow that is a deconstruction in a way of superhero stories.

It starts, like many similar stories, by an AU from our world: people started to get power in the 80s through trauma (mental and/or physical).

While the worldbuilding isn't extremely great outside of North America (like all of his works, set in a North-american-centered point of view), the psychology of the characters is wonderfully done.

The premise (power through trauma) also neatly explains why the world the characters live in is such a horrible place, as you are reminded of your trauma when you use your power, which, by snowball effect, creates more Vilains than Heroes.
