Worm is more or less to the superhero genre what call of cthulu is to the magic genre.

​

WARNING: The following description may contain spoilers for the series.

​

The villains in the city it takes place in vary from druggies that kidnap people of all ages and forcefully addict them to drugs, to basically sex slavers, to actual Nazis, with a bond type villain in the shadows poking holes in the hero organisation's security to allow villains to constantly escape. The Heroes are not all entirely good people either, with most of them burdened by Narcisism of some kind or traumatic past of some description, mostly both. The Hero organisation is furthermore led by a person who absolutely loathes people with supernatural abilities of all kinds due to yet another traumatic indicent.

​

Most of the powerful people in the genre are guilty of mass murder at least, or omnicide at worst.
