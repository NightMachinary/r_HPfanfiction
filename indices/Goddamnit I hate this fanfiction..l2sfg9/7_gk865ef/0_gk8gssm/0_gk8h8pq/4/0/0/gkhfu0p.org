The source material is, from what I've heard of it (I haven't read the source material myself due to experiences of the protagonist coming way too close to personal experiences). The setting though allows for easy crossover with isekai type characters without completely breaking the setting entirely due to the sheer power and diversity of the characters and entities already in the series. This is a universe where you can dump the Hulk and people will just go "oh, another guy who gets stronger the more you fight him".
