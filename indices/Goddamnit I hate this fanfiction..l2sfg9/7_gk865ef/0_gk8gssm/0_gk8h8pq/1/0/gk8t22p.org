What makes it even worse, at least from an academic standpoint, is that one of the father's of utilitarianism argued against a similar example. Paraphrasing a bit, the question goes why shouldn't a random person be made into spare parts for the sake of a greater number of people, isn't that a net positive? His answer was that with a completely random method of choosing a person everyone would go and be afraid of being sacrificed for “the greater good” thereby resulting in a net negative on societal happiness.
