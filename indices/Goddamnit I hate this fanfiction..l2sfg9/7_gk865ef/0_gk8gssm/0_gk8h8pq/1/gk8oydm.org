Worm is a reconstruction of the superhero genre. It's great, but rather dark. The issue is that one of the central themes is the viability of Utilitarianism on society, and Yudkowski is so far up Utilitarianism's ass that he believes it would be better to torture someone to death if it kept dust out of people's eyes ([[https://kierkeguardians.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/eliezer-yudkowsky-doesnt-understand-ethics/comment-page-1/][No, really!]]). Yudkowski sent an entire crowd of his worshippers to Worm, which infected the fandom with their "yes, psychological torture is fine" ways.
