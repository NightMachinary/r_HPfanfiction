  he believes it would be better to torture someone to death if it kept dust out of people's eyes

Maybe having trillions of people with a spec of dust blown into their eyes giving them mild discomfort every second of every day for trillions of years is enough, maybe far more pain is required, maybe far less, the point is that there exists /a point/ when torturing someone to prevent it is morally justified.

I think most people would agree with that if they agree with utilitarianism, that the purpose of morality is to reduce the total sum of suffering.

Of course, not everybody endorses utilitarianism, but the blogpost you linked is about Yudkowsky not /understanding/ philosophy for having this view and is very uncharitable.

Also please don't call people enjoying rational fics his “worshippers” that are “infecting” the fandom, this kind of dehumanizing rhetoric is harmful and unnecessary.
