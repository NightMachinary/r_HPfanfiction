Reminds me of how every so often in the philosophy sub it seemed that someone would post some philosophical article on quantum physics which would be immediately trashed because it would get something fundamentally wrong (I'm not even anywhere near well-versed in QM or even just classical physics in general, but the number of times I've seen someone get called for misunderstanding observers is astounding). Also it's kind of funny to see the semi-frequent articles about how schools and corporations and governments need to have permanent philosopher positions and the need for more epistemological training. I get where they're coming from, though in the large quantity that is continued to be produced it does sound a bit like begging for a job.
