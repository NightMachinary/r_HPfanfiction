I haven't read it, but it sounds similar to harry potter and the daft idiots which was well written from a grammatical standpoint, but absolutely grating to read after a while. Like, we get it. You, the author, are very smart and this whimsical society of magicians from a children's book are big stupid dumb-os. But like, how much more interesting and productive would it be if instead of going through and pointing out every last 'logical flaw' from the perspective of your main character who is the personification of autofellatio.jpeg, just make changes to the universe until it makes sense to you and then tell a fricking story!
