Just an honest question.

Why is there so much hate towards this particular fanfic? True, Harry was quite patronizing in this one but this fic is so good. I learned so much from reading this. For example, I had never heard of the bystander effect before.

I also discovered that I really like this subgenre. Rationality makes the fantasy more real and readable for me and I realized that I was pretty tired with the ignorant mc genre.

But everyone has different tastes. You might like this. You may not. Your choice. But why do you hate?
