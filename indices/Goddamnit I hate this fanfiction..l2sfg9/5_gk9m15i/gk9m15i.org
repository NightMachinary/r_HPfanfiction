  He says that magic shouldn't be able to do that

The correct response here is "that's nice, but I /did/ do it". Like, who's going to come out smarter in this conversation? The person that's dedicated their life to Transfiguration and is actually an Animagus, or some kid that learned of magic less than a month ago?

That's one of my biggest issues with the fic: Harry tries to put magic into little boxes that fit his worldview, rather than changing his worldview to accommodate magic.

Despite his assertions that magic doesn't make sense, it clearly /works/. So he should learn to expand his worldview, rather than try to drag magic back to how he thinks it should work.
