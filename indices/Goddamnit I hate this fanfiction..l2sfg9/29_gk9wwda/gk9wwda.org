I enjoy MoR more for the concept than the execution; it spawned a genre with some good fics so I can't hate it even if I dislike the original

  Not to mention the genetic parents' bullshit, we have ways to refer to biological parents, such as biological parents or their fucking names. Though this might be a cultural difference between me and the author so fill me in.

This seems a really petty complaint. Whats the difference? I would probably use "biological parents" but like I would completely understand and not even pay attention to word choice if someone said "genetic parents" instead.
