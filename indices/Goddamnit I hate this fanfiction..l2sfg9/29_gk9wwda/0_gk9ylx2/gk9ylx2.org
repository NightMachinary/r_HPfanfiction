Indeed it is a petty complaint, I don't like it when stories do things that I find weird. Purposely italicizing genetic and then using the word every sentence for four sentences is going to make me pay attention. It's not that I find it to be major issue, rather that it is a thing that stuck out to me because that is not really how humans talk. It's not a major difference in meaning between biological and genetic in this context, but the story went to great lengths to inform me of the fact that they had swapped words in a way that seemed to be for the purposes of demonstrating the authors intelligence. I have been informed that it could be a linguistics thing.
