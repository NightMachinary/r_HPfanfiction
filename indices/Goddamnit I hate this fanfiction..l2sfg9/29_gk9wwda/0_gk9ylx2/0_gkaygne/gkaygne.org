I think it's because using genetic comes across as being more impersonal and implies a greater irrelevance to their contribution than using "biological parents", which is already pretty bad in context.

It's one thing to be dismissive of your biological parents if they just abandoned you to be adopted; however, Harry's parents gave their lives trying to protect him. If you're not a rationalist cretin, that level of sacrifice is something worth honoring for your whole life.

I can't remember the details of how Petunia and her husband raised him, but adopting a child and raising him well and with love is also worth honoring.
