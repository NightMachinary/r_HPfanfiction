This fic managed to sour the /term/ rationality to me so in some ways, I consider it quite exceptional.

I haven't (or more accurately, attempted to) read it since that day a few years ago when I closed it in disgust and wonderment as to why would it get such a following when the main character is neither nice nor charismatic, two qualities that tend to make me overlook problems in the work.
