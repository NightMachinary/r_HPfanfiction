  It's so fucking uppity towards everything.

That's... the main reason I enjoy it. It's uppity and pretentious and as a self-identified intellectual snob that speaks to me. I personally think it goes off the rails near the end and far prefer the AU ending given in Following the Phoenix linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix]]), which is a fic I actually /like/ rather than just enjoy.
