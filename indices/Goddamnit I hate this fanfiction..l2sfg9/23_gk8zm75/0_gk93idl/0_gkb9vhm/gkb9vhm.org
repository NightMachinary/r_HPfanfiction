It's long, complete, funny (if you like its style of humour), has a complex plot, lots of shout-outs to other works, a very impressive antagonist, very few typos, and gives you food for thought.

Objections that I've seen tend to revolve around Harry himself being unlikeable, which is a fair cop. Even though he's very opinionated, he's not always right and the story doesn't say he is.
