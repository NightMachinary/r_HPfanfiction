Have fun with TOOS :)

NB Harry isn't really /awful/ to people. He legitimately does want to help the world, but he's arrogant about it. So, he can be quite selfless in helping his friends, but if you disagree with him about something, you have almost no chance of changing his mind. And he can explain why he thinks the way he does, which usually means that as the reader you can learn something even if you still think he's wrong. In the end, he realises that his single-minded devotion to his own ideas nearly destroyed the planet or handed it to Voldemort on a platter, averted only because /Voldemort was more cautious than himself/, and he needs to grow up.
