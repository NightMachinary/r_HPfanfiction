You /might/ like it. Opinions are very divided. I'd recommend trying it out yourself. The first ten chapters should be plenty to decide.

As mentioned, it does give you food for thought, even if you hate Harry's guts. And the story does punish him for his arrogance. And there's quite a bit of humour; whether it appeals to you or falls flat, I couldn't say without knowing you better.

If you want a story about rationality and how to think better with a less condescending protagonist, I recommend Pokemon: The Origin of Species, but it's not HP.
