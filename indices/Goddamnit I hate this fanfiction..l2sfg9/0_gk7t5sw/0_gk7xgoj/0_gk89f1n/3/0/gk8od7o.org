I've only seen Petunia/Sirius once. It intrigued me with its potential, but to be frank, I don't really think the main fic premise itself was good. It wasn't even the main pairing in it, but a post-halloween LESS was (my least favorite kind of that ship, even if I personally like it generally, I don't like Order/DE for the most part). I can try track it down if you're still interested. I did consider the Petunia/Sirius parts to be the best part of the fic, with Sirius learning to take life seriously and be mature when the need exists, while Petunia learns that sometimes it's okay and fun to let loose and to not always be uppity/"correct".

I have, however, seen Petunia/James once in a fic I actually liked. Note that this is also a LESS fic, which I know not everyone likes, but at least this one is Marauder-era and thus far less controversial. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4852149/1/Irresistible-Chemistry]])
