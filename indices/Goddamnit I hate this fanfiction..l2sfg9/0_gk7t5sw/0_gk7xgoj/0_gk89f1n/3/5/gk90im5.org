“On December Something by KathrynElaineDarling” linkffn(12898595) is Petunia/Sirius.

And related to the theme is “Petunia's Letter by mzzbee” linkao3(11676102) (and its sequels), which is Petunia/Arthur Weasley.

Of course, there are plenty of Snape/Petunia (half of pre-Hogwarts Severituses, I guess), but I have just finished reading (great start, not that much persuasive ending) “3 Slytherin Marauders by severusphoenix” linkffn(4923158), which has Petunia/Lucius Malfoy. Yup!
