While I haven't read this story since around 2014 (before I even got into HP fanfics in general, incidentally), didn't she basically imply to Lily that she'd consider taking her own life if Lily didn't make her beautiful? Which is... just no. Faking suicidial ideation is one of the /worst/ offenses someone can do IMO, because it lessens people's will to help those who truly have suicidal ideation since it can make them question whether the person is truthful or not.
