Totally agree with you. I have personal experience with someone that suffered from such a problem, and it got really bad because nobody in the family took it seriously, saying that the individual is probably just trying to get attention or so.\\
It took something serious to happen for people to wake up.

So, yeah, I hate stories that 'experiment' with such stuff. Most are crap.
