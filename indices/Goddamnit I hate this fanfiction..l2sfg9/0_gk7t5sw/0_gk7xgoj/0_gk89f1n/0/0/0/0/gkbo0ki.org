Which is textbook for the sort of narcissist that Petunia is displayed as in the books, but doesn't gel with the 'decent mother' she became in MoR.

(I enjoyed MoR very much during the writing. It wasn't the current, revised version, it was very much first-draft crackfic and was a fun event and readalong at the time. Without that zeitgeist, it doesn't stand up, just as Cursed Child apparently makes a fantastic stage show but is awful to read. I can't get through it now.).
