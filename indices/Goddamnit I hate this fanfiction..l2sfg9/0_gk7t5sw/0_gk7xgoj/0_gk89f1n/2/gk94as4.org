Dude, the author is straight up the equivalent of that kid in highschool who bragged about his IQ, except he never grew up and just got worse with age.

The guy made a 'scientific foundation' which asks the extremely pertinent and never before considered question...

/"Can AI do a genocide?"/

Thank you for having us consider that a sufficiently human-like artificial intelligence could possibly just maybe want to kill or harm people. I'm quite sure that question has never been asked since we came to the realization that sentient and sapient life could be created through ones and zeros.
