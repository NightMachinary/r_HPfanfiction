One thing that I always found a bit odd is that Petunia marries a /scientist/. Is this a subtle author insert about how they're clearly the best marriage prospects?

From what we know of Petunia, I always found it far more likely that she'd marry someone like a muggle version of James (e.g. something approaching nobility), if she could pick anyone, which presumably was the idea behind her emotionally manipulating Lily into making her magically beautiful. She is a social climber, after all, which a James-like person would allow her to accomplish, no matter his personality (even if the person behaved like teenage!James did even in adulthood).

Come to think of it, this might explain why I kind of like the idea of Petunia/James, or Petunia/Sirius...
