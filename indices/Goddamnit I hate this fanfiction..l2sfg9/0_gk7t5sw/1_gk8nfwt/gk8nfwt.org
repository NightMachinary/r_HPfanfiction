That's what I find most disappointing about it - a fic with a scientist Harry earnestly testing the way the world/magic works and devising a bunch of cool experiments would be a lot of fun! But instead, the 'rationality' the author uses comes across a lot more, at least to me, as just logic(al leaps) and less so on practical science/experiments.

It could be done in a 'serious' or a crack fic way and be interesting or fun, but as it is it's just not for me. Although I did enjoy reading someone writing an excessively long takedown of it lol.
