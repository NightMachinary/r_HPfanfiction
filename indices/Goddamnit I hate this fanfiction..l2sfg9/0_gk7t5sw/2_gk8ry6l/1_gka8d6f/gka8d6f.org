Yeah, I agree. I like Starfox5's The Granger Principal (Hermione gets tossed into a non-magical parallel dimension, gets a Doctorate in Theoretical Physics and makes a portal back home through sheer single minded research and intelligence) and WhiteSquirrel's The Arithmancer (Hermione is a maths genius, applies that to spell-crafting, writes many academic papers, is generally scary-impressive) and I'd really enjoy one that's Harry focused, but I haven't found it yet.
