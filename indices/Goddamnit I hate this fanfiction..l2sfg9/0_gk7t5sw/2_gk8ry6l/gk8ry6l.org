This so much. A true rational or scientist complains for /maybe/ 15 seconds that the previous theories have been proven to be untrue - but at that point, they don't keep using them out of /spite/, like MoR does - they discard them and build a new set of rules.

I have no idea why so many stories about "harry applies science to magic" are really just a circlejerk about how a soft magic system isn't to the liking of the author, rather than applying the scientific method.
