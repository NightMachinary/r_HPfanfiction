  A true rational or scientist complains for maybe 15 seconds that the previous theories have been proven to be untrue - but at that point, they don't keep using them out of spite, like MoR does - they discard them and build a new set of rules.

Definitely more than 15 seconds. For something as profound as Potterverse magic, one must also consider the possibility that one's senses or cognition are compromised. That is, "Am I dreaming?" "Could I be intoxicated or experiencing a stroke?" "Could I be delusional or hallucinating?" "Has my ability to think logically been compromised" "Could this be a conjuring trick?"

I thought Harry's first reaction was not unreasonable, if rather exaggerated for comedic effect.

  I have no idea why so many stories about "harry applies science to magic" are really just a circlejerk about how a soft magic system isn't to the liking of the author, rather than applying the scientific method.

Because they are written by Smart!Harry mavens and not actual scientists? Of course, LessWrong only kind of has this excuse.
