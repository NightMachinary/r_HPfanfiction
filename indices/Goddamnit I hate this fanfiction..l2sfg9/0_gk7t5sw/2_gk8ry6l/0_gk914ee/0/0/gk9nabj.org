  Yes, this obviously happens before you throw out the old rules.

To quote Sherlock Holmes: "When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the solution".

If magic clearly and consistently breaks all known laws of physics and logic, then you need /new/ laws of physics and logic.

The problem is that, in my opinion at least, MOL tries to do the opposite. Rather than create new "rules" for how magic works, it tries to shoehorn it into the "old" rules.
