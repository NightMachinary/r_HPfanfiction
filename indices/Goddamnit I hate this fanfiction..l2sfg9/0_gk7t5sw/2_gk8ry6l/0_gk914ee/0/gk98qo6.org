  Definitely more than 15 seconds. For something as profound as Potterverse magic, one must also consider the possibility that one's senses or cognition are compromised. That is, "Am I dreaming?" "Could I be intoxicated or experiencing a stroke?" "Could I be delusional or hallucinating?" "Has my ability to think logically been compromised" "Could this be a conjuring trick?"

Yes, this obviously happens before you throw out the old rules. I was working under the assumption that all possible explanations have been ruled out - hence /"the previous theories have been proven to be untrue"/.
