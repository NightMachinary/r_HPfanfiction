I read it since it had so many good reviews and I liked the premise but it was so uppity and condescending, and I like my characters with even a little if emotional empathy, that first chapter or was it chapter 2 with Harry referring to his biological parents as sperm donors made me cringe. To be fair it's been years since I first read it so I'm a little fuzzy in the details but it made me feel like the book was talking down to me. Sure there were good parts with the whole mystery and you didn't know quite where you were going but I stopped when they were breaking into Azkaban. The overall tone got to me and my second hand embarrassment is strong.
