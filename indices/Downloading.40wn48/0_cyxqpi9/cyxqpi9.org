1. Download Calibre [[http://calibre-ebook.com/download]]
2. (I'm on OSX so you might have to dig a bit to do the same on Windows) Select Preferences --> Advanced --> Get new plugins
3. Filter for the plugin *FanFicFare*
4. Click install and choose the option to place the icon on the toolbar
5. Restart the program
6. After the program starts select "Download from URLs" from the dropdown next to the *FanFicFare* icon
7. Paste the URL of the fic you want to download in the box and press ok

I hope this is enough to get you started!
