I guess you mean Fanfiction.net, since you you mention the bot? There are other fanfiction sites that provide ebook formats themselves ([[http://archiveofourown.org/][Ao3]] is the big one). Many people have already mentioned bots that will automatically create an ebook for you from various archives.

If all those others mentioned fail you, you can also try the [[http://grabmybooks.com/][GrabMyBooks]] extension for Firefox and Chrome. It's good for archives that aren't big enough for the automated grabbers to bother programming for, for sites that aren't fanfic-specific (and therefore don't have standard formatting, like individual blogs), and /especially/ for sites that are password-protected, because it saves what's displayed on-screen.
