The Hinny pairing. Like what? O just don't see them being a good pair. Friends? Definely. Lovers? Not likely.

Also, Harry was a pussy in the epilogue, just becoming rivals/friends with Draco, when Draco was the biggest bully to harry ever, bigger than Dudley.

Overall, I think that the epilogue was just too damn sofr about consequences. No doubt Dumbledore influence
