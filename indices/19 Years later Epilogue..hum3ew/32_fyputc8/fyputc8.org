I just don't like where it broke off. It would have been much better to end on an uncertain future than an “oh, we worked everything out”.

There's a saying, you should tell the most interesting story your characters ever take part in. If there's something cool that happens in their lives, I want to see it; read it. I don't want it to be off-screened away. I don't give a flying hoot what their kids were named, I want to see how they recovered the broken ruins of their country after the war.
