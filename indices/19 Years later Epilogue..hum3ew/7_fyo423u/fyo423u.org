I think the word “hate” is too strong. Yes, there are some problems with the Epilogue (both male Malfoys and Narcissa IMHO as well should be in jail at least for some time; Albus Severus Potter is just atrocious name; not everybody should be happily forever paired and some other nitpicks), but the main gist of the Epilogue is just perfect: “All was well.”
