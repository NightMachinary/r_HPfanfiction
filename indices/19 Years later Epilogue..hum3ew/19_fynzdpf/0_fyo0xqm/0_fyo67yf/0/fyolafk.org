He'd already suffered enough throughout the series, seeing him genuinely happy creates a feeling of nostalgia and makes you feel like all of that turmoil he'd gone through was worth it. I'd have hated it had written Harry as Moody no.2 after that, it shows you that his victory was pyrrhic, and I don't think people would appreciate waiting so many years for each installment to be that way. Let Harry be happy.
