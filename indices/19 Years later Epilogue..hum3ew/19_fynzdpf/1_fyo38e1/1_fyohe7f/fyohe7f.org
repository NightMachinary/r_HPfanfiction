I stopped at the part with the Trolley Lady. I was expecting a deep story about making peace with the past and BestDad!Harry, but instead got a crack fic with OOC characters. I read the entire summary online, and I am absolutely furious with Harry's portrayal. Harry is my favourite character. I know a lot of people don't like him because he is portrayed as the "everyman", and it may be true, but I still adore Harry. He is a well-rounded character, with good days and bad days and most of all he is forgiving, which I can relate with. So yeah, CC should be found on Wattpad in the crack!fic section.
