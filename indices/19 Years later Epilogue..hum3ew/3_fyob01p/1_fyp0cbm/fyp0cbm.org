Id like to think he waited for his kids was done with school to become a tracher eventually

But even i cant see him becoming an auror with his experiences with the ministry. Not giving gis godfather a trial, kangaroo court to snap his wand and all of 7th book where the ministry rounded up pepole like his mother who he adores.

Only real way is if punishment after the war was suffucient to convince him that it was worth working for the corrupt ministry
