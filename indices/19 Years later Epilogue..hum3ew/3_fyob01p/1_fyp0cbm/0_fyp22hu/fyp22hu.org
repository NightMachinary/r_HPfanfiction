Exactly! I mean people talk about how Shacklebolt and Hermione presumably went on to reform the ministry, but that sort of thing takes time. Combatting corruption like that is very difficult. Even worse is sympathizers who are not going to just change their ideas. That's part of why I like the idea of him becoming a Professor. I feel like he saw how the school failed some people (Snape, Neville, and even Malfoy and Riddle to a certain extent) and would have wanted to do better. Not everyone can be convinced of course, but at the very least I imagine he would have been harsh on bullies and unbiased. I also feel he would be active in looking for kids from abusive homes and trying to remove them from those situations or just being there for them if he couldn't.

Just my headcannon of course, but I feel like there is so much potential there! So much of the story takes place at Hogwarts and it shows how much impact those years can have.
