You certainly have a point. I feel that Harry would have been too close to the issue to judge it properly though. Malfoy should in no way have been Harry's problem, excluding giving honest testimony. I'm not fond of Malfoy, but it seems implied that his parents were being held hostage. Not an excuse, but a mitigating factor. I do feel he, and especially his parents, should have faced at least some consequences for their actions.

I wonder how something like this would be judged in real life. I think coercing someone to commit a crime is a crime, but I'm not sure how harshly the coerced are judged. Also not sure if he was legally an adult at that point.
