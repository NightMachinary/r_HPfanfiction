I like your description of it and when you put it that way it's much easier to picture. I'll probably always prefer Professor Potter, but that explanation makes the Auror job feel a little more natural for me. Plenty of people end up in jobs because they are good at something and I could see him mentoring in other ways. Perhaps he would even spend some time instructing new aurors. Thanks for the great discussion!
