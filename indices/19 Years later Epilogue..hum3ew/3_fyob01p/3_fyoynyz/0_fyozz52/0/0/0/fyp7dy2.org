Oh lol, I'll just see myself out...

Jokes aside, I imagine his auror career like this: at first it's personal. He wants to be part of bringing down the death eaters that weren't apprehended at the battle, and he wants to help shape and change the ministry for the better as well as work for criminal justice reform.

But when the personal part is over, what's left is that he's damn good at his job, and he likes making the world a better place. He's always been the one to step up and protect those that can't protect themselves. So in this way I personally don't see him becoming fatigued with the job the way some people think it would. I think it could be a fulfilling career where he can do a lot of meaningful stuff, both on and off the field.

I can't really picture him at Hogwarts full time, but I can see him doing guest lectures and things like that. But I see why professor Potter is a popular profession for him as well.
