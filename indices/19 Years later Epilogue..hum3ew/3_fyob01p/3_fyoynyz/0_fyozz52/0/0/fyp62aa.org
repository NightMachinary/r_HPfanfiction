Ah that was more of a joke. My point was mostly that either it's a dangerous job catching dark wizards suggesting that dark wizards are common enough that they need a special taskforce. Or it's a peaceful job except in rare occasions since dark wizards aren't common. If the second is the case, then I would imagine that they have to do something in the meantime and that's what my brain went to. If it's the first I feel like Harry would feel it's meaningful but get tired of "the fight". If it's the second, I feel like he'd struggle to find meaning in it. Maybe I just lack understanding of how most law enforcement agencies work.

I'll find any excuse to make him a professor lol.
