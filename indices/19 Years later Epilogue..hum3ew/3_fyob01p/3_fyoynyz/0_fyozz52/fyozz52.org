I definitely could see him doing it because if his "saving people thing" but that depresses me. I just feel like that version of Harry wouldn't really be happy. Especially, if all he did was give people tickets for having insufficient cauldron thickness or something. He also didn't get along well with the ministry and I doubt it changed that quickly.

He just always seemed to look up to his Professors and I feel like he could recognize that education is the starting point for change. Just my headcannon I suppose.
