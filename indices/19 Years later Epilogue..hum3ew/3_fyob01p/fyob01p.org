The thing that always bothered me about the epilogue was Harry ending up an Auror. Obviously that's what he says he wants to do in book 5 (although he wasn't that decisive about it), people change their minds all the time and I always imagined him as a teacher. I could maybe see him being an Auror for a few years to round up the last of the death eaters, before going back to Hogwarts as the DADA teacher. He was so passionate and proud of the DA and deeply admired Lupin as his professor. Of course there's also the fact that Hogwarts was his first home.

By the end of the battle he seemed so tired of fighting that I struggle to imagine him making a career of it. Particularly when his Auror buddies may die on him (he already watched so many of his friends die). Only way I can see it is if he stuck with it because of everyone else's expectations, which would just be sad. I feel like even professional quidditch would have made more sense than being an Auror.
