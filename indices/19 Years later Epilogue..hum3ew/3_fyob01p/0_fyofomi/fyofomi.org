I imagine that outside of environments where Dark Lords are genuine, immediate threats to Magical Britain, being an Auror is nothing like what it was during the series. It's probably more just patrolling, educating yourselves about common Dark curses and magical items and how to fight them, and possibly interviews with captured Dark wizards.
