Also the fact that Harry now has kids of his own, losing his parents was a huge part of his life and I fee like he wouldn't want to risk his own kids going through the same thing. Defense professor makes so much more sense, he loved teaching the DA, he admires Lupin as a professor, he named his son after Albus who always said teaching was his greatest achievement. Professor seems like a much more approproate job for Harry I agree
