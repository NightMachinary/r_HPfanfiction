The underlying issues with the society hadn't been addressed. Even assuming that reforms are made, it takes a long time to really see the affect of that particularly on crime. Actually, if it wasn't dangerous I'm not sure Harry would have liked it either. After a certain point (especially with issues of corruption in the ministry), I feel Harry would have had enough. I feel like he'd just be frustrated with it and want to take a different path to change. Educating people is the best way to enact change and Harry's mentors and role models were primarily educators. I'm sure he would make a fine Auror, but a teacher simply seemed more natural to me. Just my headcannon I suppose.

As an aside, I've always been very curious about the role of Aurors. Are they just cops? Or more like the FBI maybe? If they aren't cops, then who are the cops?
