Well I would consider pureblood supremacy, rampant ministry corruption, and racism to be underlying issues. Killing Voldemort doesn't change the sentiment that he built his power base on. He likely had many sympathizers who agreed with his cause, but weren't necessarily willing to commit crimes. They may have supplied him with money or political support. Think Malfoy after the first war. In addition, neither Umbridge or Fudge were death eaters and we're very high up in the ministry. Umbridge believed in pureblood supremacy and Fudge hated half-giants. Of course, we can say they are simply terrible people, but such blatantly terrible people getting that high up in the government suggests deeper problems to me. We also know that the ministry passed terrible creature laws restricting werewolf rights before Voldemort ever took over. Lupin resigned when it got out he was a werewolf and Dumbledore faced heavy critism when it was revealed by Skeeter that Hagrid was half giant. Abuse of house elves also seemed to be an issue.

Killing Voldemort is great and it destroys the rallying point for some of these ideals, but it doesn't change the mindset. Enough people agreed with Voldemort that he was able to gain a lot of power and influence. The ministry was also corrupt before Voldemort took over as shown by how many death eaters managed to buy their way out while Sirius was never even given a trial.

Obviously I don't expect these to be addressed in the book and I'm willing to assume that after the war they worked to reform the ministry and thats great, but that takes time. Harry goes to work for the ministry right after the events of the book. I just struggle to imagine him working in a non-reformed ministry.

As for the question on aurors, I guess a part of it is just how prevenalent are dark wizards that they need a special taskforce for them? What do they do if there aren't dark wizards? Does dark wizards include dark creatures like werewolves and vampires? Who does the non-dark policing? Also what about hit-wizards? Not expecting answers, just little thoughts I've had.
