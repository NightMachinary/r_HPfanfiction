  I'm afraid we will have to agree to disagree on most points mentioned, as while we can write off specific characters actions, I prefer to view them as a larger symptom so to speak. It makes the wizarding world more realistic to me if everything isn't solved when Voldemort gets taken down. Of course that's only my interpretation.

If there were even a single instance where that wasn't the case, I'd be inclined to agree, but even Cursed Child says it is.

  I will touch on the house elf issue though. I wasn't trying to suggest anything about their culture or how they are generally treated merely that we do see evidence of abuse with Kreacher and Doby suggesting at least some reforms are necessary. Hermione seems to be on the case though.

Dobby's treatment was obviously way out of the ordinary - not one other elf displays nearly as much evidence of abuse nor his ingrained desire to injure himself as punishment. Winky is half-crazy because she can't help Crouch Sr., who by all accounts had a relationship of genuine affection and mutual respect with her. Kreature is actively disobedient and spiteful towards Sirius in a way I have a hard time believing is standard for House Elves. Again, with the other Blacks, he seems to have been content and valued. It seems weird to us that his life's goal was to have his head mounted on a wall after his death, but that's how xenofiction works. The Hogwarts elves, the only other ones we see in main canon and the only ones who aren't in an exceptional situation, are treated well and only refuse pay and time off because their culture rejects it.

  Thanks for the pleasant discussion! I enjoyed hearing your thoughts and I appreciate the answers to my questions about aurors, the DMLE, and hit-wizards.

No problem!
