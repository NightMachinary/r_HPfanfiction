  He likely had many sympathizers who agreed with his cause, but weren't necessarily willing to commit crimes. They may have supplied him with money or political support. Think Malfoy after the first war.

Voldemort used his power to make 'neutrals' or people who did not vocally support him change their methods and either fully declare for him or be ground underneath his heel, as we see in canon. Malfoy was no different - he claimed he had been serving Voldemort under the Imperius Curse, but there was no doubt that he /was/ serving him.

  In addition, neither Umbridge or Fudge were death eaters and we're very high up in the ministry. Umbridge believed in pureblood supremacy and Fudge hated half-giants. Of course, we can say they are simply terrible people, but such blatantly terrible people getting that high up in the government suggests deeper problems to me. We also know that the ministry passed terrible creature laws restricting werewolf rights before Voldemort ever took over. Lupin resigned when it got out he was a werewolf and Dumbledore faced heavy critism when it was revealed by Skeeter that Hagrid was half giant. Abuse of house elves also seemed to be an issue.

Umbridge was totally on board to sign up with the Death Eaters, as seen during Book 7. Fudge was just an idiot, a fact which was repeatedly stated over the course of the books. He was weak-willed and being leaned on by Lucius Malfoy, and he was convinced that he was in the midst of an armed insurrection that involved child soldiers, hence his restriction werewolves. No matter which way you look at it, the werewolves signed on with Voldemort last time, and were being stirred up again by Greyback. That's not corruption on Fudge's part.

We don't really know enough about Half-Giants to say what was going on there, except that Ron - who holds some pretty conservative opinions about such issues - gets over it within a second. Giants, at least, are legitimately dangerous.

House Elves are an Uncle Tom story from our perspective, but in-universe they aren't usually abused and participate in their chosen lifestyle with total consent. Furthermore, Hermione is in a position to put any needed legislation through. Interfering in their culture otherwise is a paternalistic colonial attitude.

  Killing Voldemort is great and it destroys the rallying point for some of these ideals, but it doesn't change the mindset. Enough people agreed with Voldemort that he was able to gain a lot of power and influence. The ministry was also corrupt before Voldemort took over as shown by how many death eaters managed to buy their way out while Sirius was never even given a trial.

Those people were purged. Nobody bought their way out, some simply claimed that they had the Imperius Curse cast on them without anyone being able to prove otherwise.

  As for the question on aurors, I guess a part of it is just how prevenalent are dark wizards that they need a special taskforce for them? What do they do if there aren't dark wizards? Does dark wizards include dark creatures like werewolves and vampires? Who does the non-dark policing? Also what about hit-wizards? Not expecting answers, just little thoughts I've had.
#+end_quote

Dark Wizards aren't usually Voldemort-level threats, but there's low-level stuff, like the people in Knockturn Alley. They'll probably just train and patrol when they aren't in an active investigation. Werewolves can be Dark Wizards, like Greyback. Vampires are likely able to be wizards - The Quibbler published an article saying Rufus Scrimgeour was one. DMLE officers do non-Dark policing. Hit-wizards are DMLE officers, like a SWAT team is for Muggle cops.
