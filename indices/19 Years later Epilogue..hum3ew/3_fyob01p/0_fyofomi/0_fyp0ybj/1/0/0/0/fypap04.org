I'm afraid we will have to agree to disagree on most points mentioned, as while we can write off specific characters actions, I prefer to view them as a larger symptom so to speak. It makes the wizarding world more realistic to me if everything isn't solved when Voldemort gets taken down. Of course that's only my interpretation. I will touch on the house elf issue though. I wasn't trying to suggest anything about their culture or how they are generally treated merely that we do see evidence of abuse with Kreacher and Doby suggesting at least some reforms are necessary. Hermione seems to be on the case though.

Thanks for the pleasant discussion! I enjoyed hearing your thoughts and I appreciate the answers to my questions about aurors, the DMLE, and hit-wizards.
