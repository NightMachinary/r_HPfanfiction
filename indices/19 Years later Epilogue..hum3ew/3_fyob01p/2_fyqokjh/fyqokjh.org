Based on the recommendation of a Death Eater, no less.

There's /so much wrong/ with being an Auror.

- Working for a Ministry that treated him like shit

- The Ministry was totally corrupt, and everyone knew it

- The corruption was enabled by still-living blood supremacists

And now he's taking orders from them.

I can't see how anything really changed. Voldemort wasn't the problem, he was only a symptom of a violently bigoted culture. If Harry wanted to fix anything he'd be Minister. He'd be voted in unanimously. Didn't they outright offer the job to Dumbledore?

No, being an Auror would be ridiculous. As Minister, teacher, or Headmaster he would be in a perfect position to influence coming generations. Why would he be so content with the Status Quo that he'd choose to support it?

He could also easily be a Quidditch star player.
