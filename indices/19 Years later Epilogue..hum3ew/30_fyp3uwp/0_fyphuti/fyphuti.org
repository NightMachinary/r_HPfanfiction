  My biggest problem with the epilogue was that everybody ended up married to their high school sweethearts

Only George, Fleur, and the Golden Trio iirc. Neville, Percy, and Draco married women they didn't start dating/contract until after Hogwarts; Luna wound up marrying an iirc significantly older man (Rolf Scamander); and I don't remember if we find out what happened to Pansy or Penny.

Yeah it's bit high of a percentage, but dating pool for Wizarding Britain being basically the people you went to Hogwarts with probably puts a lot of pressure on staying with them.
