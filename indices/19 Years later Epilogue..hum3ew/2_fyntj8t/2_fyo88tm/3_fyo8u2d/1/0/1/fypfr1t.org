Hermione is Umbridge's half blood daughter who she tossed away into the muggle world after she was born, out of hate and shame! Hermione doesn't know she was adopted as an infant by the Grangers, and they didn't want to tell her. Hermione learns her real middle name is JANE and not JEAN after meeting Umbridge in book 5. :)
