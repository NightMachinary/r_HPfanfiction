  I can't imagine that Ginny spent her 6th year at Hogwarts single and pining over Harry

This, and also, I feel like JKR really glossed over the Ginny/diary/possession trauma. Apparently it didn't affect Ginny at all to not have chunks of her memory, almost kill a dozen students, and nearly bring Voldemort back to life??

I feel like JKR was going for a softer, sympathetic character to "heal" Harry and bring him into the Weasley fold properly, but I think between the possession, and the horrors of her 6th year at Hogwarts, she'd actually be a very different person.
