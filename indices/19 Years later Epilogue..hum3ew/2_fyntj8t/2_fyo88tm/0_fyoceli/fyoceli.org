You could make an argument that Luna was Ginny's idea, rather than Harry's. The names aren't my biggest problem with the epilogue, it's mostly how lazy it felt to stick Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny with the people they were dating in school. I never saw Ginny and Harry getting back together after the war, or at least if they did, not forever. I can't imagine that Ginny spent her 6th year at Hogwarts single and pining over Harry. And if that last year of the war didn't cause significant trauma to Harry then there would be something really wrong with him. Even if they tried to get back together they would both be different people.
