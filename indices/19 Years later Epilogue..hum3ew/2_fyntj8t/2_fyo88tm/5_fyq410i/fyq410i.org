Why did the kids have to carry the names of dead people at all? Just give them their own names. Adrian, Martin and Vera Potter. There, those are some completely fine names without any legacies or ghosts attached to them. I wouldn't want my kids to carry a specter on their name for the majority of their lives, it's cruel.
