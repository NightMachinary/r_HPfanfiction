They did a horrible job ageing the actors and Albus Severus is a rediculous name. Snape was an asshole for Harry's entire high school life and killed Dumbledore and it is out of character for Harry to honour someone like that by naming his son after them. Albus yes. Snape no way. They didn't even know him as Severus.
