  I don't see Ginny going along with that name choice because she was in Hogwarts during the time of Snape being headmaster and by all accounts that was not a fun time.

I have exactly the opposite opinion here.

If Ginny ever agrees with naming her son "Severus", Snape must have bailed her out of several tight spots and covered up her transgressions from Voldemort. We readers already know the Sword Incident in which she got a detention with Hagrid instead of Cruciatus or worse. In the aftermath, Ginny should have realized how much she owed to Snape for not being hurt much much worse.

Snape himself was walking a tightrope between maintaining his cover and protecting the students. He seems to be able to reign in the Carrows until Easter, when Ron's involvement with Harry was uncovered and all Weasleys went into hiding. Only after that point were the Carrows able to torture students at will. In a sense, Ginny had escaped the worst of that year.
