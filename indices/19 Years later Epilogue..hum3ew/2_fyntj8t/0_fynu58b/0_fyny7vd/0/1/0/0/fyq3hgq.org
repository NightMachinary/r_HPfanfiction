Been saying this for years now. Every time she "clarifies" something it takes away an avenue of interpretation, destroys possible canon and narrows the entire world down to the most boring possibility. It's like she specifically thinks about the lamest possible thing that something could be interpreted as and then says it. And anyone who asks will be treated to meticulous, boring details that narrow it further.

For example.

- No schools outside the big ones

- Wand magic is all there is, and is superior to all other forms

- Wizard culture is derived from rome yet does not know plumbing, yet does, because otherwise sewer technicians connected a weird snake chamber to the system in the 18 hundreds and never told anyone

- Wandless magic is always weaker than wanded magic, and is completely useless in all ways

- spells are bound by physical laws

- etc etc, it goes on like this.

All she has to do is tease things. Write small passages on twitter. A couple of lines of dialogue. Leave it completely open-ended and you light a fire in your community like you can't even believe. The people will be scrambling at your words, forming entire universes based on what you left open, or purposefully vague.

But rather than caring for her work, she is transphobic on twitter and posts about wizards shitting on floors.
