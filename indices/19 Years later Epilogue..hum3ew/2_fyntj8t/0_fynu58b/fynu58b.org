Most of the names weren't great choices, I didn't mind Snape in the movies but that is mainly because of Alan Rickman's acting in the part, but in the books he was just a straight up prick and the name choice makes no sense, plus I don't see Ginny going along with that name choice because she was in Hogwarts during the time of Snape being headmaster and by all accounts that was not a fun time.
