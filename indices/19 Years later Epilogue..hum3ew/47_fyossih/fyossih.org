Yup, I also hate the epilogue and the movie one had such odd changes to the characters, literally made me gag. Furthermost, now I am so much in Harry/Daphne that no other pairing fancies me. PS- got a good Harry/Daphne Fanfic? Post link in reply. And please not the famous one I have read them all. Hopefully during hogwarts but post hogwarts are just fine.
