I hated it. It was so...cliche. Exhibit A: Names. The names. Horrible. The only one that even made sense was Scorpius because duh, with names like Narcissa and Lucius and Draco...and other names if you go back farther like Bellatrix, Andromeda, Sirius, Cygnus, Abraxas....I mean, Scorpius fits right in.

It also seemed cliche that it gave off vibes that once Voldie died everything returned to normal, everyone was fine, everyone married their teenage sweetheart and lived happily ever after. Instead of having emotional baggage and life-long issues they popped back up like daisies, married to their high school/boarding school/whatever sweethearts and have no issues to speak.
