I guess i'm in the minority that doesn't mind the epilogue. For one, I enjoy the canon pairings very much, and would vehemently oppose much of the bashing of them in this thread. I also think that the epilogue follows the theme and tone of of the rest of the story. It shows the war over; it shows Harry having reached his desire for a family; it shows forgiveness, etc. I don't love aspects of it, like Harry naming his kid after Snape, but I can understand why JKR did that.

I get that it doesn't fit in with a lot of peoples opinon on what HP should be, but it fits in with canon.
