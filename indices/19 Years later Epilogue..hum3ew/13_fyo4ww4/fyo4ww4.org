I don't like it because it feels like fanservice: "ooh let's show all the ships, the 2nd gen characters, everything a rose coloured version of the beginning of the series". It's tropey and trite and completely unnecessary as it doesn't give you closure at all, since it skips all the conflicts left, it just tells you that all was well in the end.

It reminded me strongly of that shitshow that was Kaichou wa Maid-sama!'s ending. Or rather, it reminds me of it now, since I'm pretty sure that manga ended after DH.
