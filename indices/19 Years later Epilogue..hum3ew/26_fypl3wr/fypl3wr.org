The fact literally nothing changes in 19 years. Hermione and Ron's very different lifestyles, beliefs, and career goals never come into conflict. Harry and Ginny never face issues given he's a human and she wanted to date an infallible idol. All the other relationships seem to have been fixed since school.

Like Draco not marrying Pansy despite dating for years at school is the only sign of difference in the entire section.

And Albus Severus.
