The best way I saw it described was it's an ending tailored to baby boomer standards and expectations (2.5 kids, married to school sweetheart) for a book series targeted at Millennials at the time.

Barring the fact that Hinny was not progressed well (Ginny was virtually nonexistent for the majority of the books and changed personalities from a shy fan girl to what JK viewed as a “powerful woman” and their relationship started because Harry realised he was jealous of her and Dean) Albus Severus makes no sense and his part in the epilogue makes no sense.

Harry saying that it doesn't matter if he gets in Slytherin and that the hat can take your choice in the matter shows that he's “matured”, even though we never got to see this newfound maturity. He canonically detested Slytherins for the most part and it never really made sense to me because we were never shown a huge progression.
