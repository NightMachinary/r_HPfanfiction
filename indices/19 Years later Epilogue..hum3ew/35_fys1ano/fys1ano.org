no yeah im pretty sure everyone collectively agrees that entire mess is garbage.\\
I personally am of the opinion that everything past, what, halfway through book 4 is also straight garbage? That's the point where it goes from "plucky young child with balls the size of the Great Hall saves the school from asshat dark wizard and other things" to "edgy idiot teen broods and wishes he was more boring than he already is instead of, oh i dont know, actually doing something to prepare to fight the Dark Lord that he knows is eventually gonna try killing him and all his friends"
