I remember when it got out that there was a lot of theories in "mainstream" media about the ending, one of them being that they all transformed into animals.

Personally I wasn't to fussed on it but when I got to read it (at 11~12 yo) I felt really disappointed, but more because I didn't care for these characters and there was no reason for me to care. Maybe if there had been another book afterwards about the children or better yet, the 19 year period I would have appreciated it but as it was, it felt like a copout.

It felt to me that Rowling treated the end of the series like I did my homework: a rushed job that work on only the barest of technicalities.
