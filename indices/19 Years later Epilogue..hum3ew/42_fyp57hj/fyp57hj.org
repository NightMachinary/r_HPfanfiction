I have three main reasons why I don't like the epilogue. They may be minor and petty, but they still bother me.

1. The names, especially Harry's kids' names. They're awful. James Sirius I get. Lily Luna, maybe, because hopefully Luna was Ginny's suggestion. But Albus Severus? Are you actually kidding me? Hell, I could list at least 5 other male characters who deserved the honor more than Snape and Dumbledore, people who actually cared about Harry as a person and not just as a pawn or as the kid of the woman they loved.

2. Everyone married their high school sweetheart. This one just rubs me the wrong way. While I'm not the biggest fan of Ron/Hermione, I do actually like Harry/Ginny. That said, I still don't like that they all got together at 17 (16 in Ginny's case) and stayed together. Not very realistic imho.

3. The literal 2.5 kids. I could go on and on about JoKe Trolling's concept of motherhood and the way she uses it to define the women's value throughout the saga, but damn, that's just awful. And again, unrealistic.
