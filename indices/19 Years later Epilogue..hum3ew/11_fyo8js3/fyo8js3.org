Well, there is an entire subgenre of fics called "Epilogue, what epilogue?" so I think it's safe to say quite a few people dislike it. Personally I dislike it because it ropes everyone in relationships and careers. Voldemort's death is closure enough and if the book ended right after the battle readers could come up with their own endings.

Besides that, I don't like the children's names. Naming new characters on already existing ones is super confusing and I avoid next- gen fics because of this. It would be as stupid as naming Ray, Poe and Kylo- Leia, Han and Luke in the new Star Wars movies. As bad as those movies were at least they had the common decency to come up with new names for the new characters.

As for the movies- they were pretty terrible since Order of the Phoenix (God, I genuinely hate David Yates) but they hit a new low with Harry breaking the Elder wand without repairing his own. The makeup in the epilogue was absolutely terrible. Ginny looked like Harry was abusing her and she was abusing substances.

It's a bit of a side note but I don't understand this obsession Hollywood has about aging actors up/ down through makeup and CGI. Just hire other actors. This way you'll give younger and less known actors a chance to build a career. The Irishman was incredibly awkward to watch with seemingly young faces and bodies that move like old people.
