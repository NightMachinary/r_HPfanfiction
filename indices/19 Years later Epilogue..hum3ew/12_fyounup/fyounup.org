I broadly liked it on first read and can see where it came from JKR's life, as a neat tying up of ends (although having said that even I had some issues, although I understand from a storywriting perspective why they were there - e.g. everyone marrying highschool sweethearts 20 years later is kinda weird, but it saves having to introduce new characters at the last minute when the aim was to portray beloved characters having a happy ending, as JKR envisioned that).

However, I've seen since a stellar set of posts about it which basically concluded that the reason this ending felt like a misstep for a lot of millennial and younger fans was because it was - especially for a series that had managed to so far otherwise capture tone with readers of that age pretty damn well - something of an old-fashioned view of what a happy ending entailed, that didn't really reflect anything of how millennial readers imagined their lives might be - with stable jobs, safety and assured comfort and harmony, and traditional relationships with multiple children by age mid 30s something of a relic of the past or at the very least an unrealistic idea of a goal or possible achievement for today's young folks.

There's also the critique brought up that this ending kinda undermines what had become core themes of the series - that is, it's a poor defense of muggle- and muggleborn equality if Hermione has left that world behind to live full-time in the wizarding world, the only muggle characters we knew in the books never again mentioned, and the suggestion that anti-Slytherin prejudice still remains nearly two decades on despite the fact that the last few books preached unity and evolving on from bigotry and early judgement of children. This is likely because, iirc, this ending epilogue was one of the first parts of the series written, before JKR did all the middle bits. A revisit and update of this section before publication may have improved it to remove these inconsistencies.
