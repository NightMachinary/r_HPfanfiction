Right there with you! I was already disappointed with book 7 for the excessive camping and Fred and Lupin's deaths, then I turned the page to see that “19 years later” and cringed inwardly because I knew it would be lame...

I remember pre-DH reading that the last word the book would be “scar” and feeling so excited. Then I read the Epilogue and felt so disappointed. It was just so...smooth. Predictable. Boring. It was -too- neatly tied together. Not that I needed a cliffhanger ending, no way, but...it was just too unrealistic and perfect. I didn't like it then and haven't hoon rereading over the years, either.
