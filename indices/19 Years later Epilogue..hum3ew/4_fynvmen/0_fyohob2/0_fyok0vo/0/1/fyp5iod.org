Wasn't that unusual in my country in the past

Our country was (and still is) quite religious (Christianity) so many popular names came from the Bible (Joseph, John and Peter being most popular)

My Great-Grandpa, grandpa and father are all called Peter

Even have uncle from mother side who's called Peter

I was lucky to avoid the tradition but still have christian name (name of 1 of the apostles)
