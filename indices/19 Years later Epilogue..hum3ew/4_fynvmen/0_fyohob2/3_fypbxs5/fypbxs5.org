Every generation in my family has an Elizabeth in some form, until my Great grandparents bucked tradition some it was always the first name of the oldest girl (they made it their eldest daughter's middle name) Then she went and insisted that she be called Betty anyway. I'm a Liz, Zea, Betty, Liza, Lizbeth, Beth, ELizabeth, Bet, Eliza, Lizbet, Tess, Betsy, Ilsa, Libby, Elsie, Buffy, Lydda, Elsa, Izzy, Lilibet, Thea, Zibby, Ellie, Lily, Zelia, Etta, Lea, Zizi, Lettie, & Bess no not 30 generations, but there were a number of times there was 2 or 3 cousins all names ELizabeth or Elisabeth at the same time. The family has been British/English/American for at least @ 500 years, but some of the spouses have been French, Spanish, Dutch, & Italian.

In some places/cultures it is bad luck or bad taste to name someone after a living relative or someone who died young or had a bad life, but good luck to be named after someone who lived a long, healthy, happy life.
