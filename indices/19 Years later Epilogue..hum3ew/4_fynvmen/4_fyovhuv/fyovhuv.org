Honestly it seems odd there is an Albus there before a Hagrid. But Even so... it is hard competition for Hagrid. Harry is not going to name a son Hagrid instead of James or Sirius... So I guess:

James Sirius Potter (2 Harry picks)

Arthur Billius Potter (2 Ginny picks)

Lily Luna Potter( 1 and 1)

Would have made more sense.
