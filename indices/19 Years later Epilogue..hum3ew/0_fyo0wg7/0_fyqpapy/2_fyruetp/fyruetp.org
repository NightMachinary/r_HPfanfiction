The Horcruxes made it so that every fanfiction out there now has to deal with them. I think I might have liked it more if there hasn't been so many of them.

My biggest problem with the sixth book is I don't get the feeling Harry is doing anything for the war that is apparently going on. He's obsessing over some random book and Draco.
