There's a reason I read fanfiction that ignores books 6 and 7. Book 6 was /boring/. Book 7 had me asking "why are they /doing this?/". The utter stupidity of /wearing a horcrux/ is a perfect example of the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiot ball]] trope.

And I can't imagine why Dumbledore tried to condition everyone to use a name that was known to trigger a taboo. He knew the problems it had caused, and he knew that Voldemort would return. How could he be so arrogantly stupid?
