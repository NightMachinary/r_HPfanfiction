Albus Severus? I mean, the name make sense but that name for a 11 year old kid? I think that because of that name I hate that character. And the thing I hate the most is the movie epilogue, Harry looks to young and unrealistic, and his sons are so different to their parents. It's like James and lily, they are young persons, James has black hair, lily has green eyes, it's almost the most important thing of both characters, and they are not even close to be similar. The same happened with albus and James, they are not similar to their parents, the only kid I like it lily Luna.

I hate the epilogue of the movies, and because of that adaptation I also hate the book part.
