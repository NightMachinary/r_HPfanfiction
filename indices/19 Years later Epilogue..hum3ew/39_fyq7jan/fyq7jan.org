The only one of the kids name I like is Rose, I don't think either of the couples should have ended up together, Hermione would have killed Ron, she needed someone older than her, R and H were toxic together, Ginny may have been sassy but she kind of came off as bitchy too, Harry needed someone that could rein in his impulse control problems and make him laugh as well, and Ginny needed someone with a strong personality to keep up with her. They all deserved better than they got. The epilogue always felt trite and slapped together to tie the books up in a neat little Weasley bow.
