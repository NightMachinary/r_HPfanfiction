The only way I can buy Albus Severus is if they both considered it one great prank, Snape would hate Harry Potter's kid and James Potter's grandkid named after him so much, and Dumbledore screwed up so much of Harry's life while claiming it was for the greater good, I'm surprised he'd want any association with him.

Though, to be fair... Ginny also sucks at choosing names. She named Ron's poor owl /Pigwideon/. Perhaps they both just came up with those and couldn't think of anything better and went with it against everyone else's warning.
