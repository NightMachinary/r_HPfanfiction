The name Hermione is not of French ancestry!

It first appeared in Homer's Iliad or 700 BC! That Hermione is the daughter of Helen of Troy and Menelaus of Sparta.

A second fictional Hermione appeared in Shakespeare's Winter's Tale. The Grangers are supposedly his fan and named their daughter that way.

The French do like that name however, as [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Hermione][they named 12 ships]] after her.

The Royal Navy also [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermione][had 4 ships named after Hermione]]. The last one was scrapped in 1997.
