This might definitely be part of the unconscious reason why it threw me off. Tbh it's something I've never really finished being able to put my finger on why exactly it seemed so out of place for me, but it's one of the few instances in the series that a name just didn't glue with the world building. It definitely contributed to the epilogue feeling unnecessary/wrong to me.
