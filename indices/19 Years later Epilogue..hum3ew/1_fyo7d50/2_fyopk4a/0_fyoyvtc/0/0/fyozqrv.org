But is Greek mythology inherently muggle? Narcissa looks like it's taken from Narcissus, which is also Greek, so maybe not.

As an aside, it's always struck me as weird that she's the one exception to the Black family constellation naming system - I'm assuming that JKR named Narcissa first, and then did the Black family constellation names later.
