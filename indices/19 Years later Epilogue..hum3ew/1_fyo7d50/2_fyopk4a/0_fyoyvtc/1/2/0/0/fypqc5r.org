Thanks. And yes, Eris is the goddess of discord. I've always felt that I'm probably one of her descendants. I'm the truest chaotic neutral I've ever met. And I seem to have an obsession with naming kids these sort of names. Not many people would have this combination as opposed to ones like Emily Jane (I still like to call her Seraphina).
