Hey! I'll have you know that I'm likely to give my kids most of those names! I've always ADORED the Black and pureblood naming systems, and I've even planned out my kids names. (Except for Morag)

Thanatos Thomas

Eris Hela

Delphini Lily

I wanted to honour some pretty awesome figures and ones that I felt sorry for. Also, it's ironic that the kid named after death is "Tom". And Delphini Lily sounds adorable, and Eris is a pretty good name as well. Sooooo, yeah. I really do adore names with meaning. It's why I normally go by Azalea Blackthorn (stupid Reddit's inability to change usernames!).
