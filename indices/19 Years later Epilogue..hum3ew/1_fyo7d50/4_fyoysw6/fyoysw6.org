Why couldn't they have used one of Albus' middle names? Percival I guess is out because of Percy Weasley, Wulfric is equally horrid, Brian is a little mundane but so much better than Albus!! Or they could have taken the "Al" from Albus and tacked on another ending - Allen, Alexander, Albert, Alfred, Alvin. Actually I quite like Allen.

Severus is a little harder to replace - he doesn't have a middle name in canon, and even if it was Tobias, honoring Snape's memory by naming a kid after his father would be a slap in the face.
