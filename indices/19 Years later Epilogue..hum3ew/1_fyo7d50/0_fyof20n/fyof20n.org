Hugo must have come from [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo][Victor Hugo]], supposedly Hermione's favorite author. But there's an obvious problem naming her son "Victor":

Ron: No way our son is going to be called Victor!

Hermione: Why not? Oh I see, you are still jealous of Victor Krum! I mean still after all these years? Honestly Ron, grow up!

Ron: My answer is still no.

Hermione: How about Hugo Victor then?

Ron: Fine, but then our daughter should be named Rose Lavender!
