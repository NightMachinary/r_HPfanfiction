I didn't like the epilogue and it feels like it was written as an afterthought considering how brilliant of a work JK did writing the whole series. But I appreciate the fact that it had its role. Basically it was intended to let the reader know that everything was well, Harry's kids got to grow in a loving environment (unlike him) protected from the evils of the world and it offered the series a sense of finality. I think it was also meant to deter (unsuccessfully) people from writing fics about the next gen because there was no more bigotry, no more dark lords and the Potter or Weasley kids could never be the same as Harry/Dumbledore/Voldemort/Snape since they never experienced tragic losses and - at the very least it's expected that - throughout their Hogwarts years they'll have someone to lean on. It's supposed to be the happy ending of a rather sad story which has as main theme death. That's why I actually hate CC so much... instead of leaving the story at that, they had to exploit it because it was a readily available cash cow.
