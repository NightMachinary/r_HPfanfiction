The reason that epilogue (I'm talking about the books) feels jarring and abrupt is because of how good the preceding chapters are. The writing is absolutely brilliant. The exposition is fantastic. JKR knows that legions of fans have hung on with the characters she's created, that they've laughed with them, cried with them, lived with them for years and years. She knows that she's got to craft a fitting end to the series, and boy, does she deliver. After the end, you're left overwhelmed, at a loss for words, but incredibly satisfied and content that this was the conclusion Harry Potter deserved (talking from a literary standpoint here).

Then the scene shifts abruptly to nineteen years later. Harry's close to forty years old. He has three children, he's asking them to behave, he's being a /parent,/ Ron's telling him how he confounded a driving instructor, and its all so /domestic./ That's why many people go UGH at that, because it goes against their view of Harry Potter as this plucky, adventurous boy who's ready to fight evil and save the world. No one wants to envision a Harry Potter as a grown-up man who's at his desk by nine and is owls healers because his four year old son has the loosies.
