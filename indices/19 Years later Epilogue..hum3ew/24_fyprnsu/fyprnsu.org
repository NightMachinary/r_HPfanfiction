I've never read the book epilogue (I'm struggling to get through the books because I find fanfiction so much more interesting) but I've see the movies quite a bit.

To me the only character that didn't seem weird was Harry, the way he dressed and look seemed so like someone who didn't care about their appearance in terms of fashions and such. Ginny seemed so different, and I know from the books she was hugely independent so there's no way she would have cut her hair and become that stereotypical looking housewife. Can't remember Hermione and Ron too much acc.

The overall vibe of the movie epilogue was really depressing too, like after the war everyone was still super depressed cause everything had this grey tinge to it. And no one smiled all that much to my knowledge.

All in all it seemed really really depressing when it should be happy, and the “personality” of the main characters didn't seem to fit much
