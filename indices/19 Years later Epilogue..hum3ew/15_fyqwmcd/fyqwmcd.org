Lets begin to analyze that shit.

1st naming choices

Albus severus potter... Literally ASP if he isnt sorted into slytherin and become dark lord cus he was picked on ill eat my shoes.

Also no sane person will name their child after a bully that picked on them for 7 years, no matter how brave and heroic he was that 1 time, send his grave flowers and call it a day ffs.

2nd

ron used magic on muggle like its not big deal and harry is totally ok with this....

3rd

Draco Malfoy

2nd year he was more then ok with muggleborn dying to the heir of slytherin.

3rd year he got an innocent creature executed.

6th year he took the mark, bragged to his friends voldemort gave him special task, imperio rosmareta, attempted murder number 1 on dumbledore nearly killed katie, attempted murder number 2 nearly killed ron, he let 6 known terrorists inside the school, the only reason he didn't kill dumbledore is because he's a coward
