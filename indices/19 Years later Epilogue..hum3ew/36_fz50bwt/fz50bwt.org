Not even touching the name thing since everyone is already mentioning that from all angles.

While it's popular to have epilogue's pick up in a similar place to where the OG starts (going to Hogwarts for the first time- inspiring a new generation) I just don't feel like it was the right move for HP. Or at least, they jumped way to ahead. Maybe if it was like James II going off for the first time, or like Ginny is expecting and they're sending Teddy off. Gives more "unknown and hope for the future" vibes. 19 years is also such an odd number to go for.

Also, they did Ron dirty with the epilogue (also Percy). And the movie versions didn't help. They didn't really age them well or realistically. I also like Draco so I wish there was more with him, but that's just me personally. They did him alright (but that beard... no).

Overall, book was alright/bearable. The kid casting looked decent in the movie, but the adults were really badly aged. Also the lighting/cinematography had a lot of things I wouldn't have chosen.
