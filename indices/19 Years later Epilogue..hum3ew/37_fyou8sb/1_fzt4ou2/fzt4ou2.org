I find myself somewhat sympathetic to Snape, or at least the younger version of him. However, I still think it's a terrible name. Even if you consider Snape redeemed in the aftermath, would you really want to saddle your child with the name of a person (let alone two) as prominent as Albus and Severus? Let alone someone who a lot of the Wizarding World is still likely to harbor dislike for, because no matter what side Snape was ultimately on, he was very much still an ass to basically everyone. The poor child is going to be living in the shadow of his namesakes, and we all know how cruel kids can be -- I could very much see him being bullied over the name.
