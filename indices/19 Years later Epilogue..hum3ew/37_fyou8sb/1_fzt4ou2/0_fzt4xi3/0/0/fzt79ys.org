Children's books are usually meant to teach kids something. I think, realistically, Harry and Ginny /wouldn't/ have named their children such heavy names. But, since this is a children's book, JK wanted to make a lasting impact by showing Harry's ability to forgive and to also show his growth and maturity. It shows children that, even if you may not like someone, you shouldn't hold a grudge against said someone, especially if they're dead. I think that she wanted to show that Harry was able to forgive Snape, unlike the latter, who couldn't let go of what James Potter did to him in their school days. She wanted to show that Harry, unlike Snape, was able to let go of his hatred for his dead tormentor and be at peace.

I agree that JK could've done better, like make Harry lobby for a posthumous Order of Merlin to be awarded to Snape or some sort of recognition, but I also think that Albus Severus's name holds heavy symbolism, especially for the latter name. Albus Severus has green eyes just like his grandmother's which are the same eyes Snape asked to look into before he died and the same eyes of the woman Snape loved dearly.

This is why I like the name.
