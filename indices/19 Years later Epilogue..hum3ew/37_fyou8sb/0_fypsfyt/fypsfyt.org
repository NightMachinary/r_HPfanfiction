You are not alone. I love Albus Severus's name. I get more frustrated with Dumbledore than Snape. Yes, Snape was a dick, but he never tried to seem like anything else. Albus just kept up his paragon of the light attitude while planning for a child to die to save the world. I'm not a Dumbledore hater, but he wasn't perfect either. And Snape is owed more credit than most people give him. Also, Harry would give him that credit, even if others wouldn't.
