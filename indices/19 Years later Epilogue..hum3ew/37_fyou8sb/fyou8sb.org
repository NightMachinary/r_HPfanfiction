Am I the only one who actually /likes/ the name Albus Severus? There's a deeper meaning behind the middle name! Albus has Lily's eyes, Harry was able to forgive Snape, and Harry wanted to thank Snape as well. Even if Snape was an utter douchebag to Hermione, Neville, and Harry, he was the one who did the most to ensure Harry's survival, even going as far as vilifying his own name. If he hadn't been muttering the counter-curse in Book 1, Harry would've died. The reason why Harry didn't give Albus a middle name of Rubeus is because Hagrid, though he was nice, didn't do as much to protect him. He didn't name his child Albus Remus either because Remus already had a son, which meant he already had someone to continue the name. Also, Remus didn't show up in Harry's life until 3rd year, and even then, Harry only learned about his association with his father at the end of Book 3. On the other hand, Snape was always there, behind the scenes, making sure that Harry is safe. He wasn't obligated to /like/ the kid, just to protect him, and out of everyone who protected Harry Potter, Snape did the most and sacrificed the most. Harry understands that, which is why he wanted to honor Snape by naming the kid who inherited Lily's eyes after him.
