I can buy Ginny and Harry. I do not submit to Ron and Hermione being married and living happily ever after. As an adult I can recognize toxic behaviors and reactions that just don't allow their relationship to work. They are way too different. Throwing kids in the mix just makes it a lie or a deeply sad loveless marriage where they are just staying together for the children.
