First year, Ron stayed loud enough for Hermione to hear: “It's no wonder no one could stand her” in retaliation for Hermione being a “know-it-all” in class. This leads to the troll incident as Hermione was so hurt she locked herself in a bathroom to cry. But, they were young kids so I'll move.

I don't see that they moved on quickly from the Scabbers/Crookshanks fiasco when it was implied that the friendship looked to be over. He never apologized when Scabbers was found alive either.

When I think of an old married couple bickering, I think of little, inconsequential arguments about how hot the tea is or what to watch on tv. In GoF, Ron insulted Hermione with: “Oi...Hermione, you're a girl!” Showing her that she was a last choice out of desperation. No girl wants to hear that. Yes, he's a dumb teen but still. He treats her horribly at the Yule Ball by accusing her of fraternizing with the “enemy” and helping Viktor win against Harry. He then chooses to ignore her and when she calls him out on his behavior, he doesn't apologize. It's funny that he tried apologizing to Harry for acting like a jerk but never bothered with Hermione.

Then in the HBP, Ron gets worse. He basically slut-shames his sister for going out different boys and kissing her current boyfriend “in public.” When Ron thinks that Hermione more than likely kissed Viktor two years before, he rides his jealousy and gives her the cold shoulder without bothering to explain why. They plan a date together and he chooses to be derisive to her and kisses Lavender instead in full view of the entire House. This is humiliating and hurtful to Hermione. But we agree on that. I don't need to get into the mustache scene.

In DH, Ron admits it himself, even without the Horcrux around his neck, he was an absolute terror. He focused on his needs and damn everyone else. When Ron finally blows up, he accuses Hermione of “choosing Harry” when she refuses to abandon Harry in his quest to defeat Voldemort. Like it was her purpose to automatically jump and go with him despite her having her own mind on things. He changes a bit after this and that quickly results in the two being meant for each other to end the story.

I just never saw the spark between them personally. Most people argue that we can't see everything that happened between them and yes, that's true. But everything significant just gives me the sense that it would take a lot of work for the relationship to work out. I never thought they belonged together. Just my opinion. Since they have two kids in cannon and all that, I guess they sure showed me lol.
