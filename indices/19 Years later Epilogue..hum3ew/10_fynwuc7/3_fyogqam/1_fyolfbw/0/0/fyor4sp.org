“Know-it-all” comment was still hurtful despite the fact she wasn't supposed to hear it. And even after that, he continues along that vein though the two become friends.

Scabbers/Crookshanks

How was she supposed to control a cat 24/7? Crookshanks also proved to be very intelligent so it might not have worked anyway. Also, from Hermione's viewpoint there wasn't much proof that Scabbers was killed by Crookshanks and she did apologize to Ron before they found out that Scabbers was still alive. Hé didn't return the favor when it turned out that Crookshanks hadn't eaten him.

The mustache scene. Harry laughed too! Said it was the stupidest thing he'd ever seen and I'm sure a lot of the class did too. But Ron singles out Hermione and imitates her cruelly. If we're being fair, Ron should have hexed everyone he felt so offended by.
