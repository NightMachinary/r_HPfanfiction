My whole point is this: based on the interactions between the two of them, I just couldn't see a romantic relationship. Is Hermione prideful? Yes. Could Ron be a jerk? Absolutely. But as demonstrated in the Scabbers situation, she was genuinely sorry and grew from that.

Ron also grew a lot but, for me, the books initially set up a relationship with Harry as opposed to Ron for Hermione.

Ron is not a shitty friend. He's loyal, he's shrewd in tough situations and is humorous. But as Luna noted, he could also be unkind. Just as Hermione could be stubborn and prideful.

I'm not denying there were good times, it just seems to me that they weren't all that compatible. But that's just me.
