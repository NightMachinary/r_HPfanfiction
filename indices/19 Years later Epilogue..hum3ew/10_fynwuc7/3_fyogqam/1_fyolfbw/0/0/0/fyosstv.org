  “Know-it-all” comment was still hurtful despite the fact she wasn't supposed to hear it. And even after that, he continues along that vein though the two become friends.

I'm not denying that it was hurtful. I'm saying it's not bullying. He continues to call her a know it all(because she is one), but who doesn't rib their friends a bit every once in a while. Notice that Hermione doesn't seem to mind.

  How was she supposed to control a cat 24/7?

She was supposed to try! Not completely dismiss his concerns! That's all it would have taken to not make her the asshole in the situation. “Hey Ron, my pet is a natural predator to yours but I'll make sure to keep him out of your room!”

  The mustache scene. Harry laughed too!

Hermione and Ron were already fighting at this point. It's reasonable that Ron would be less forgiving with her then. I think that's fair. This is them being assholes to each other.

All I'm trying to do here is debunk this idea that Ron was a shitty friend who was constantly hurting poor, fragile Hermione, when that's not the case. Funny how no one ever compiles lists of all their fun and loving moments.
