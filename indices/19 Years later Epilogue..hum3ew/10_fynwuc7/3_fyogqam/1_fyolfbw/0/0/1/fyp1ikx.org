I agree that Hermione and Ron would have really had to work to stay together, but I don't know if your case works just on Ron not being empathetic or understanding enough for her. I think she also had a lot of flaws that most people either weren't willing to overlook (which is why she didn't have many friends) or that people overlooked in favour of her intelligence (why she really like teachers). Harry and Ginny are her only other friends, and we see Harry get irritated with her antics. I think both of them had a lot of growing up to do, and it's fair they both did grow up once they weren't in the middle of a war... Assuming we ignore Cursed Child, which we always do.
