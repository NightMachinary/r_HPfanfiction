  First year, Ron stayed loud enough for Hermione to hear: “It's no wonder no one could stand her” in retaliation for Hermione being a “know-it-all” in class.

He says this to Harry in a private conversation that Hermione happens to overhear. It's not malicious, and it's also not surprising that he's not very fond of her after that lesson.

  Scabbers/Crookshanks
#+end_quote

Why should Ron be the only one to apologise here? Hermione refused to keep her cat away from his pet rat, even after Crookshanks clearly wanted to hurt it. When Scabbers disappears it's a logical conclusion that Crookshanks killed him. Even then, she's not apologetic.

Oh, you mean when Hermione loudly makes fun of his transfiguration attempt, and only then does he retaliate? That time?
