Ron is consistently very interested in everything Hermione does. He doesn't share most of her interests, but he cares about what she's up to. For example, Ron investigates the whole time turner thing and worries when she doesn't eat and sleep enough. This is, of course, in contrast to Harry, who's usually too busy worrying about his own shit.
