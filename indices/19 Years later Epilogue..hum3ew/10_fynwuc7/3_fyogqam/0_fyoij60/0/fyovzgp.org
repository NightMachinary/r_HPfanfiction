Ron outgrows his ignorance even in the series when he worries about house elves. Hermione outgrows her insensitivity when she cries for Ron departing mid-DH. Sure, their love is not always in honeymoon, but if you've ever been in a relationship I am sure you can attest to that. Furthermore it's healthier to have someone criticize for your short-comings rather than a love-sick puppy. Neither Hermione, nor Ron seem like the type who would appreciate the latter.

And 19 years later, I would have also expected for the trio's friendship to have fallen apart like it does in Muggle world, but according to JK's universe things are far more traditional and people tend to marry the ones they fall in love with towards the end of the school.
