Disagree. If you're talking media portrayals. Emily Gilmore for example is highly competitive and ambitious always working on some charity event, climbing her social ladder, and trying to futher her relationship with her daughter. (Not always healthily.) Same for Margo robbie in Wolf on Wall Street. Very rarely are women partners to ambitious men just lying around the house sipping wine and watching Netflix all day. It's a different kind of ambitious but not in anyway wrong or less worthwhile.

I will say that older media holds different values so I'm sure this doesn't apply to a pot of pre 90s media.

Edit to add: now that I think about it usually abitious women pairings to ambitious men are also only in that relationship by being ambitious. They want to 'land the prize' so they work out, mae themselves pretty, learn how to be charming in order to do so. Not that its healthy at all times.
