I think the top part is subject to differing opinion so I'll leave that there.

I'm curious how the 'traditional' world would effect the muggle raised Hermione. I think the main issue I have with the pairing is that Hermione is settling. Not that ron is a bad guy. I think she is just too driven and ambitious where he is too laid back and flexible. It's a pairing that can go well but often doesn't.
