Old married couple is not always a good dynamic. I've always read both Ron and Harry as dismissive of her passions. Not the worst trait in a friend but could be awful in real life relationships.

I think I'm okay with Ginny just because there isnt much to her. It leaves a lot of room for assumptive growth where Hermione and Rons personalities have ingrained flaws they are unlikely to grow out of because they've had them for years. However I also wouldn't be too torn up about it if they all showed up with random people who weren't class mates and never showed up in the book.
