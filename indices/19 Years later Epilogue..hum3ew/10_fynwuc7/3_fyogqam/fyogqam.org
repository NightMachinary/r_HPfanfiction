I actually think that the opposite is true. Ron and Hermione were acting the whole time like an old married couple. They were bickering all the time but they were usually getting over it rather quickly. Despite what [[/u/ClawedRavenesque][u/ClawedRavenesque]] says, Ron only acted nastily towards Hermione during the whole Won-Won fiasco. And so did Hermione, when she ignored Crookshanks' attempts to kill his pet rat (despite what we learn of Scabbers later). Both were outshone by Harry despite Hermione's intelligence and Ron's worldly knowledge, both were rather shy in public settings and both cared for each other a lot.

I think Ginny is specifically written as to be Harry's girl but overall he is quite an unrelatable character because he is always so focused on his mission and on himself that he doesn't care whom he hurts in the process. So JK had to come up with a rather thick skinned funny girl to counter that.
