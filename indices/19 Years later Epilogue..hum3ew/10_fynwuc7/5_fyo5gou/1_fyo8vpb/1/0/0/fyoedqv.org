Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her â€˜Hermy-own.' 'Her-my-oh-nee,' she said slowly and clearly. 'Herm-own-ninny.' 'Close enough,' she said, catching Harry's eye and grinning.

What I mean is, it wasn't an affront to her. Yes, she kept correcting but it obviously wasn't a dealbreaker for her and she was patient and amused with his attempts. Her name wasn't common in his language and she understood that.
