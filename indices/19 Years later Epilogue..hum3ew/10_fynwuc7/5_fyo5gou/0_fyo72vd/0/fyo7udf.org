I feel like they'd meet up in their late twenties/early thirties and rekindle their romance. Hermione would want to establish herself in her career first and Viktor would be semi-retired from Quidditch by then. He might get a job at the ministry in International Magical Cooperation or Foreign Affairs and Sports. They also seem like a “one and done” couple to me.
