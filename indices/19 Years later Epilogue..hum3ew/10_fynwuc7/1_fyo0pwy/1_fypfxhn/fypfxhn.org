Except that the entire population of people roughly their age in Wizarding Britain was in the same school at the same time. Puts a lot of pressure on people to stay with the one they were with at graduation, and makes it a bit difficult to find a new LTR, since your entire dating pool has baggage with each other.

Honestly, that and the harassment campaigns are big reasons I think Harry winding up with a noticeably older partner makes a lot of sense.
