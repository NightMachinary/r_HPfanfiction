Because from what little we see in canon, the defining trait seems to be jealousy on both sides (Ron with Viktor, Hermione with Lavender).

Athough I agree for a different reason, from what we see High School is probably too mature (there was not even one case of such rampant jealousy during my last few years at school), kindergarten would describe it better.
