But that's not what high school sweethearts mean. It's means a couple that dated in high school.

Them being jealous of each other because they had crushes at the ages of 14 and 16 doesn't say much about how their relationship would look after they actually got together, which happens off screen, post Hogwarts. This is after they've been through a war together, by the way.

Edit: and I would disagree with you assertion that jealousy is a kindergarten behaviour, lol. It's perfectly reasonable for a teenager to be jealous.
