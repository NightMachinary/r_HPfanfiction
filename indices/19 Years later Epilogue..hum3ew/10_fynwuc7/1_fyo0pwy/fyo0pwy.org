I love Harry and Ginny but I really dont get Hermione and Ron. I always felt like they would eventually break up. I heard JKR even said that they would need marriage counseling to stay together. I can see them being in a sad, loveless marriage after awhile where they're both too afraid to leave or make the change to become happy.

And not sure about others, but I feel like to "high school" sweethearts is pretty unrealistic if their small group. Even more if you throw in James and Lily. Not saying its impossible but I find it unlikely. In my circle of friends and family its rare.
