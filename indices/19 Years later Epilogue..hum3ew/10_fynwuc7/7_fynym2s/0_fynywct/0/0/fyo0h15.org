Actually all my reviews consider my writing very in character. Also I have read some amazing OOC fics that are excellently written across many Fandoms. It just shows an author is able to make a unique individual character that is believable and interesting. That is by definition good characterization. That being said there are dreadful ones as well. It is a mixed bag with Fanfiction.
