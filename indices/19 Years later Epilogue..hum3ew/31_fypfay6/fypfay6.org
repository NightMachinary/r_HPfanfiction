They did a horrible job aging the actors. Hermione looked the same, Ginny looked /way/ older than Harry. Ron also looks similarly old. Harry would've been the same if it wasn't for that damned /hair./ It looks so strange. I also don't like how Harry named one of his kids after Snape. Dumbledore, I can understand, but Snape? Sure, he helped, and he died, but he was a total bastard for essentially the entire time Harry knew him. Does “I see no difference” ring any bells?
