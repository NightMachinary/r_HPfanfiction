I literally hate everything about the epilogue. From the first to the last line, I find it absolutely awful, and though I read the books multiple times, I forced myself to read the epilogue only twice: the first time I read Deathly Hallows(I didn't know it would be so awful), and on a re-read after a few years of break from HP(it found it even worse the second time if that's even possible).\\
Albus Severus makes me wanna puke, and frankly question Harry's mental state after the war.\\
I don't know why Rowling went with it. I think it would be much better if she ended the book with, I don't know, Harry, Ron and Hermione watching the sunrise after the battle or something like that.\\
The epilogue felt forced, it was cringeworthy and so unbelievable. The movie adaptation only strengthened my disdain for it.
