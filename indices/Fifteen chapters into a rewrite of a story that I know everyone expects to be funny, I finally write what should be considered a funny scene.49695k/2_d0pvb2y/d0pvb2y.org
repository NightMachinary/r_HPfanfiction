It feels too much like it breaks suspension of disbelief. It would only really work in a crack fic, and if you're fifty pages in without any funny scenes so far it's not going to go across that well, I think.

There's nothing wrong with it inherently, if you've written a story with intentionally over-the-top humour so far, but if you just drop it into a canon-ish type of story it won't work well.
