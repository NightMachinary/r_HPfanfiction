Only issue I have is that there never really felt like there was a sense of urgency, or impending doom due to the zombies. Sure, there were brief moments where there was a death or whatever, but I felt like the actual zombie stuff took a back seat to everything else, except that the "everything else" was kind of boring political stuff that didn't really feel like it belonged in that type of story.
