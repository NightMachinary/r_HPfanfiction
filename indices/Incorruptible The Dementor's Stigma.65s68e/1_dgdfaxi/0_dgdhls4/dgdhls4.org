Yeah I do agree that the focus does switch away, but the switch of focus is dealt with in the plot. In hindsight though, I think a better summary for it would be: 'Wizarding world reacts to Apocalypse' rather than a direct zombie/harry potter mashup as you are right- describing it like that might misdirect the reader's expectations.
