Maybe linkao3(Say a Prayer by Mad_Fairy) ,Linkffn(Invincible) also has a bit of it, but they are all adults trying to escape the apocalypse while dropping dead one at a time, so it loses some of the whimsical fun of just exploring space for the sake of exploring, still a masterpiece in world-building with excellent characters and a much more scientific outlook (so a treat for my sci-fi loving heart) and the author also has a really good writing style.
