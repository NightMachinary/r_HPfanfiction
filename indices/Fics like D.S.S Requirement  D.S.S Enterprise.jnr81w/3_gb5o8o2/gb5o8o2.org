Well, if you mean in terms of writing style, obviously more esama fics are the way to go. He definitely has a knack for very interesting, VERY exposition heavy, stories. Spellist is good, linkao3(5366507), so is Disillusion, by Hermione Granger, linkao3(1149623). Really wish he would go back to more HP fics, hasn't done any in nearly 2 years.

Other than that, if you're thinking space/sci fi wise, other than the ones already linked here (Say a Prayer series, Invincible, Starship Hedwig), the only one I can think of is burnable's Back to the Beginning, linkffn(13586310).

You can always look at crossovers for popular sci fi movies/shows, though those are usually more dimension hops, and typically don't have the same magical spacecraft building/space exploration aspects that I think you're (and certainly I am) looking for.
