Oh gosh I've read that one. I was in it for the Harry/Hermione pairings but it was not worth it and the absolute worst. Bashing aside the levels of potty humor were disgusting, and Ron has never been more OOC including fics where Ron is a death eater. I wish I had brain bleach to wipe away the memory of that fic it was so bad. Where's an obliviate when you need one?
