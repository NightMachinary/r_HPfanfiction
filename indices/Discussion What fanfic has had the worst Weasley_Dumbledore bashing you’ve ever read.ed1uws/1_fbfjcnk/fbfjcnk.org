[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]], a H/G author, writes imho the worst Dumbledore/Weasley bashing. Usually, authors go easy on Arthur and the Twins, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] paints ALL of them in a very bad light as they sold out their own daughter to the Ministry. Dumbledore was first killed in an ambush and later sentenced to eternal torment by Harry through the Resurrection Stone.

In his forced marriage one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11367427/1/In-the-Heat-of-the-Night][In the Heat of the Night]], every Weasley except Ginny got again bashed into oblivion, with no redemption.

--------------

In the dimensional time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]], Voldemort won the first war, murdered Arthur and Molly, and corrupted all remaining Weasley children.
