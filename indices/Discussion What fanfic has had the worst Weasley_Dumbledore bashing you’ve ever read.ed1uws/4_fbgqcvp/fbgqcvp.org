one of them was a next gen story with an old bitter harry talking with rose

as ron and hermione had fled the country due to stress from the war and never returned sounds intresting, they could both be filled with regrets and remorse

Only we discover ron turned abusive and his entire family disowned him and its not like it was a slow decent in which we discover ron was broken by leaving harry behind nah its a throw away line about how they are divorced and ron was kicked out of the family for abuse

another ron turned into a rapist
