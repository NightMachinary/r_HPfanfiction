I can't remember the name, but the worst Dumbledore I read made me stop and just go, "Damn." Early scene had baby Harry using accidental magic to make his toys float. Dudley and Petunia were laughing and playing along when Dumbledore burst in the house. Petunia turned, "Professor Dumbledore, thank you for bringing Harry us. It's like having my sister back."

... hrm, can't have a happy, well adjusted Harry, "OBLIVIATE! You hate Harry!"
