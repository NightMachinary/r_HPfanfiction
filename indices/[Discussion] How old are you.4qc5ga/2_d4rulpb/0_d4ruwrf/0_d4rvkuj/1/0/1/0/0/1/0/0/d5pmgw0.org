It was the first good h/hr I read. the part where they would ride the horse to the pond in the forest I liked really well, and Kimmy because I've an idiots adoration of house elves. The scene where Harry as his cat form nearly ends Draco I liked a lot. Voldie was at least a bit clever which helped.

All pretty standard stuff now but amazing when I first read it. Have you tried Harry Potter and the Witch Queen?
