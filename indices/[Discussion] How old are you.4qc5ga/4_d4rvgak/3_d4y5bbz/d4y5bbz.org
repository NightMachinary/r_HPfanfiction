Just got on the sub looking at some recently popular post. Got on here expecting to have my current fears of a disappearing childhood reaffirmed. Little did I know that I'm apparently one of the youngest at 19.

I'll be honest I expected almost everyone to be between 14 and 17. Maybe the old folks just got upvoted.
