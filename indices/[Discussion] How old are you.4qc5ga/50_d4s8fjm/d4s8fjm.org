28 here. I read some fanfiction when I was a teen, then stopped for some reason that I don't remember. Started reading again a few months ago, right after Alan Rickman's death. I cried over a few tribute videos, then stumbled upon a "Second Chance" fic. And then I read another. And it's kind of spiralled... Lol.
