I'm 25. My first HP was PoA in 1999, still my favorite of the series. Started reading fanfiction around 2001, whenever someone would print it out or if I was able to get to an internet cafe. Fanfiction is one of the things that you can do on a dial up connection, lol.

I know in my head that HP was born in 1980, but the movies came out just as I turned 11, so a part of me really felt that I was the same age as the characters.
