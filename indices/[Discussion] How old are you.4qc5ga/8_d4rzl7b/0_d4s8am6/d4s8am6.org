The first fanfiction I ever read was LotR. I was young enough that I didn't know it was fanfiction, and a friend printed out pages upon pages of LotR diary entries which we read around the cafeteria table at lunch time. Still not King. Still makes me giggle. I wonder if that fic is still around... It would be amusing to re-read it as an adult.
