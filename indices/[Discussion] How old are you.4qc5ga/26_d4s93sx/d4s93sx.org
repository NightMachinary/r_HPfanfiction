I'm 26. An older friend introduced me to Star Wars fanfiction when I was 7, and it's been full steam ahead since then. I was lucky enough to be in on the ground floor for HP fic - I remember when the first one was put up on FFN, in the Misc Books section. (And in retrospect, it's hilarious that one of the first handful of HP fics on FFN, written after only the first book, was a Snape fic that totally called Snape being in love with Lily.)
