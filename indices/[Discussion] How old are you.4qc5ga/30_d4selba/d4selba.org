I'm 33 and discovered fanfic when Harry Potter ended. Harry Potter was such an important part of my life that I wasn't ready to accept that it was over so I went searching for all things potter. I found fanfic and never left. I started with very canon compliant fic and now read anything that is well written. I don't think I will ever outgrow my love of the fandom.
