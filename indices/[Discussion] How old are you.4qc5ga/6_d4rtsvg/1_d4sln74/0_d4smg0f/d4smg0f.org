Oh, I read at least a few fanfics in middle school, but mostly one-shots, because I find it impossible to read long works of fiction on my computer. Then I forgot about it for many years, until I got my ebook reader, which I got to help with my sleep issues, and even then, it still took me a few months to realize I could download fanfic on it.
