I'm 22, and began reading fanfiction around age 10/11. As soon as an Internet connection was set up at home, I searched for anything Harry Potter related, which led me to many boring fan sites. The only good thing about those is that they, in turn, led me to deviantart and the old ff dot net. Now, HP is only one of the fandoms in which I lurk/read/write, and have plenty of friends (and some classmates) that do the same.
