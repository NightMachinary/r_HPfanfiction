Starsky & Hutch - written by a friend started out gen but moved to vague slash especially as they became kind of collaborative within our group of friends (I think that started because none of us could agree what type of girls would suit S&H) - so eventually, S&H were definitely doing it but there was always a fade out because none of us really knew how gay sex worked but there some scenes that, in retrospect, would have done serious physical harm (this was pre-AIDS, condoms were for birth control duh and none of knew about lube. Boy did that change.)

The same friend also wrote a few MASH stories (mostly Hawkeye/Hotlips - which were seriously joshed before joshing existed by 'Comrade in Arms').

I knew a couple of people who wrote Dr Who in the early 80s (not my cup of tea mostly due to the really horrible quality videos - made by someone pointing a video camera at a TV as the episodes aired. I remember getting a little motion sick while watching them)

The same friend who wrote S&H then started this sprawling Facts of Life story (which was way MarySue, had Jo being Magnum's daughter etc) that eventually spawned into 5 of us writing parts of it, which turned into a round robin letter thing when after high school graduation/college but only lasted a year or two. I finally threw away that what I had of this story around 2004. (I had been roomies with one of these friends and she died suddenly in 1997 at 29, leaving behind 40 or so journals along with both of our copies of the story and they all moved with me 3 times. Finally decided to trash the box and get on with life during the 4th move.)
