26, and I've been reading fanfiction since I was about 11.

I'm always baffled when young fans are surprised that adults are still active in fandom. Like, at what point was I supposed to disengage with this activity that I enjoy? It's like they think we turn 18 and then immediately lost interest in everything we've ever liked.
