Oh, I left feeling guilty behind once I discovered like-minded, funny, bawdy, and delightful fellow fans. I might have felt (briefly) guilty about the fact that these characters didn't belong to me, but I never felt guilty about which pairings I shipped. The Snape/Harry dynamic was too invigorating. It pushes my buttons, and that's all there is to it. That's the justification.

Fiction is not reality, not endorsement, not a direct equivalence of any sort to sexual behavior, emotional susceptibility, or moral opinion. So I generally lose interest in talking to anyone who judges me as a person for my fictional pleasures. I've had the Why Do Women Write Slash conversation and the You Horrible Fetishizer, You conversation and the Ugh, That's Disgusting conversation so many times in the last 10 years that I just snort and pass on by now without engaging.

I hope you get back to writing Snarry someday! I know it can be difficult to go solo if you're used to collaborating, but you might give it a try. The Snape_Potter community on LJ/DW is having a no-pressure fest this summer, a self-posting challenge to write fic with or without prompts. Maybe think about it?
