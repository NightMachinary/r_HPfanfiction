Yeah, it ticks all the boxes for me as does cross-gen in general. I stopped justifying it a long time ago as well, don't argue about it because people will like what they like and it would be boring as hell if we all liked the same thing.

I'd like to get back into writing but the timing isn't great for me and so far nothing has really struck my fancy to write about. I need to feel excited about the premise to write about it and I just haven't been feeling it. I hope the mojo comes back one day because it really is a happy place when I'm in the 'zone'. Thanks for the encouragement though! It has me thinking!
