I stumbled into the HP fanfic world about 10 years ago, made friends, started writing fic as a stress release valve after years of working in solitude on original fantasy stories. Those first few years hanging out with a crowd of older Snape fans remains one of my fondest memories.

I found out about fanfic in my twenties, when photocopied Kirk/Spock slash was making the rounds and a customer of mine at the bookstore where I worked loaned me a few examples. I didn't follow up on that initial introduction and forgot about fanfic until decades later the LotR movies motivated me to seek out fic. I ran across Snape/Harry by accident, and the rest is history.

Seriously, don't guilt-trip yourself. Fic-reading is fun, and so is writing, even if you sometimes have to duck and hide to avoid fandom's flying wank monsters. I still read regular fantasy, mainstream lit, Victorian lit, poetry, magazine articles, architectural monographs, and other print-related things, so it's not as if my entire reading life is comprised of fanfic. Although, let's face it, it /is/ rather addictive.

Edited because the post autocorrected my age.
