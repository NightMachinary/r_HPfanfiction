Thats exactly my story. I'm 28, so a bit older than you, but my brother called me laughing to say read the first few chapters of this Harry Potter crack-fic. I read it, found this subreddit, and here we are!

The best thing for me about fan-fic is the accessability. I have a 40 minute commute to work, so thats over an hour a day sitting on a bus, reading Fanfic. I love that you can pick it up, put it down, start another one, read a one-shot and then go back and re-read stuff that I like, or start another random story. Its great.

Weirdly though, I've tried to get into other fan fics, and can't do it. Maybe because I love the Harry Potter world in general.
