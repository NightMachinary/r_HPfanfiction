There's no such thing as "too old to still be reading fanfic." What's the difference between reading original fiction and fan fiction, really? Read what you like and screw everyone else.

I'm 24, by the way, and I'll probably be reading fanfiction until the day I die.

I started reading fanfiction when I was about 13/14, so it's been a good decade now.
