To put it bluntly, the average fic is terrible. Just start writing consistently and watch your skills improve over time as you hone your craft. Many great writers had their starts in fan fiction, and for all anyone knows you could be one of them. Give it a shot! :)

And to contribute to the overall thread, I'm 21. I've been writing a fic for three years and been reading them for just over a year. It's a lot of fun.
