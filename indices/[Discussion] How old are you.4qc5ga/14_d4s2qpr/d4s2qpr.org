1. I had friends in high school who read and wrote ff, but I was never interested. About two years ago i read fangirl, by rainbow Rowell at my younger sister's suggestion. I work night shift at a call center and some nights it's pretty slow; I forgot my book at home one day, read some fanfiction (I forget whether I read nightmares of future past and then dumbledore's army and the year of darkness, or via versa) and the rest is history. I'm even writing my own fic(s) now!
