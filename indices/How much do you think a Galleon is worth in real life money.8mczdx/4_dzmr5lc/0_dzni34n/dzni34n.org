I'm not sure why you would think the goblins(or Ministry/ICW perhaps?) don't have a way to prevent/discourage this. I've seen it in multiple fics where Harry uses this as a way to make profit, as if it's some great plan only he can think of and not a blatantly obvious attempt at fraud(but wizards dur hur). If such a loophole was possible so many people would be doing it that economys would be ruined.
