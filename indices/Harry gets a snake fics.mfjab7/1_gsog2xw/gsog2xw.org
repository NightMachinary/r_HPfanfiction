It's a brilliant work with a lot of focus on magical beings and creatures and on the Forbidden Forest. It's fascinating and so very magical.

Harry comes to Hogwarts when he's 8. He lives in the Chamber of Secrets, ventures into the Forbidden Forest and the Lake. He's a magical creatures/beings ambassador. For example, he delivers the acromantula silk from acromantulae to the merpeople. He also has a platonic soulmate in a centaur heir.

This series is just one of the best.
