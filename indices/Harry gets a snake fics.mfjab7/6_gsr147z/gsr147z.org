Harry's pet snake Storm in the Perfectly Normal series is one of my favs. I like how he eats somewhat sentient creatures (fairies), making Harry (and me) pretty uncomfortable, regrets failing to kill Sirius, and has low self-confidence in regard to other people's pet snakes (particularly Slytherin's basilisk).

Snake not introduced until the second fic, but the first fic is a short pre-Hogwarts thing that establishes the setting.
