Hermione, although the movies started my Hermione hate. They took away Ron's best lines to give them to Hermione, and the Mary sue train began there. Book 5 Hermione is one of my favourite characters in the whole series, where she was willing to get a teacher killed in order to save her friends. I also hate Book 6 Hermione, where she's pretty much a simpering fangirl that loses all of her redeeming qualities. (Pines over Ron, Confunds McLaggen, isn't even slightly willing to listen to Harry about Malfoy clearly being a fucking death eater, whines about an annotated Textbook)

Then there's Fanon Hermione where if she was any more of a Mary Sue, she'd shoot Friendship Powered Anti-Voldemort beams from her breasts... I immediately ignore fics if it says H/HR for that sole reason. (And it's a shame too, H/HR is never Harry x Helena Ravenclaw though)
