Fanfiction usually makes me like characters more. They manage to show 3 dimensional characters and it makes me understand them better. Terrible portrayals in fanfiction should not influence your view on canon characters. You should still be able to know that they all had their motives and that...

... Snape is not just evil and obsessed with Lily.

... Dumbledore is not just manipulative and evil.

... Ron is not stupid.

... Hermione is not perfect.

... Harry is not super powerful.

... the Dursleys are not great but they also don't regularly beat Harry almost dead or rape him or whatever else these stories come up with.
