If you think there were tribunals, the Nuremberg trials show that Draco Malfoy getting off is probably an accurate result. Following orders wasn't an affirmative defense, but it was a mitigation to the sentencing, and the fact his family was threatened? Probably icing on the cake. I mean it's not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731][like the US ignored war crimes to their own benefit before.]]

Lucius Malfoy getting off is just messed up though.
