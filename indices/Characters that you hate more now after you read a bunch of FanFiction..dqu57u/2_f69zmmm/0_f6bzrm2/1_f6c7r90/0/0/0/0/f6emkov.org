If there's anything to take away from canon it is that the justice system in magical Britain is messed up and broken.

Does the Imperius Curse warrant lifelong imprisonment? There is no equivalent to the effects of the curse in the real world, but I would argue it shouldn't. To temporarily strip someone of their free will is certainly a heinous crime and well worth a jail sentence. But is it worse than permantly maiming someone? Is it worse than rape?

If you say that someone is irredeemable because they have commited a crime that warrants a life sentence, then you have it backwards. It's the other way round, someone is sentenced to a life sentence because the society they're living in considers their crime irredeemable.

Now, if you think that Draco's crimes are irredeemable and therefore he deserves life in prison, then we'll have to agree to disagree. Then you simply have a more rigid and strict sense of morality than I have and that's ok.
