I do think that he got off too lightly for his crimes in canon (which however is not unrealistic when you compare it with the denazification in Germany after WW2 for example), but the question if someone is redeemable cannot be decided by consulting a law book. I don't think many people would disagree that he deserves jail time for what he did to Katie and for letting the Death Eaters into the school.

But just because someone commited a serious crime for which they deserve jail time doesn't mean that they're irredeemable. It's rather a question of if they're able to change, to become a better person and to take responsibility for their deeds.

I think that Draco is very much capable of the former. By the end of Deathly Hallows he is very much disillusioned with the Death Eater cause and only does whatever it takes to stay alive. Canon never goes far in a redemption arc though, if anything it is merely the very beginning of one. But considering how Scorpius turned out, it is very likely that Draco managed to leave his past beliefs and attitudes behind to become a better person. But is Draco capable of taking responsibility for his past deeds? I doubt it, he feels like the kind of person who would just blame everything he did on the influence of Lucius and Bellatrix.
