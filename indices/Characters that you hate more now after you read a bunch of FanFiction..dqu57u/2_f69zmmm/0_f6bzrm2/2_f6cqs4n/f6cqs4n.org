Before his attack on Katie yes, afterwards, he belongs behind bars for life.

Think about what he did there. He mind-controlled a civilian to make another civilian walk into a school with what's basically a bomb vest to kill someone. He nearly killed Katie there. And he did so without openly distinguishing himself as a combatant but continued to hide his plots under the cover of being a student. That's a long list of war crimes, just from that one attack.

He could have made an attempt on Dumbledore directly, but he chose to attack civilians and force them into his plots.
