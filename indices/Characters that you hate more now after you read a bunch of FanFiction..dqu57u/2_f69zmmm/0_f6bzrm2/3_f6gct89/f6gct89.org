Um, no? Even removing the death eaters from the equation, he was a racist bigot, relied on daddy's money to pull his ass out of the fire, was spoiled beyond belief, bullied literally everyone, led the inquisitorial squad, spoke ill of the dead (I.E. Lily and James Potter), picked fights, got away with everything, and that's just off the top of my head. And including the death eaters, He joined a terrorist organization, attempted murder three times, let a bunch of death eaters into Hogwarts, almost killed two people simply by collateral damage, etc.
