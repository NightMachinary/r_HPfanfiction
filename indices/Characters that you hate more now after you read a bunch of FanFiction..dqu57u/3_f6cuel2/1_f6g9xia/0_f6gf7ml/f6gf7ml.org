Neville is a product of his environment. His parents were tortured to death in front of him, He's never good enough for his grandmother or anyone else, his uncle threw him out of a FUCKING window when he was eight, he's constantly bullied, walked all over, taken for granted, and he can't find a way to prove everyone wrong about him being a loser. His only real friend in canon pre fifth year is Hermione, and we dont see the two interact at all.
