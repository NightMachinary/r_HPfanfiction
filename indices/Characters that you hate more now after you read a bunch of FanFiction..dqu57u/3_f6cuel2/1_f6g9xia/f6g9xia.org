You can't have so many different arcs with Neville if you want to be Canon compliant. Harry Potter is a "coming of age" type of story so basically 90% of this fandom is about growing-up in a way.

Neville is a wimp in Canon at the beginning, then he trains and he is not a wimp anymore. I think that many people find it a little baffling that the other guy of the Prophecy is such a failure.
