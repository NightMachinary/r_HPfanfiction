That's the spirit. Some Hermione fans seem to take offense for whatever reason, however. It seems that, for an alleged open discussion, you aren't allowed to state your opinion on the bookworm.

The way a lot of fanfics portray her is infuriating. Her SPEW and overbearing attitude with "I'm right and you're wrong because I refuse to adapt to your culture because I'm right that your culture is bad and you all need to change. Oh and if you're doing better than me in class I'll give you the stink eye for eternity because I have to be the very best." Oh and let's mention:"You've got all these books in your family library, all that knowledge, and you're not sharing it with the world?!" probably the most infuriating thing, really, when she's portraited as an avid commie.
