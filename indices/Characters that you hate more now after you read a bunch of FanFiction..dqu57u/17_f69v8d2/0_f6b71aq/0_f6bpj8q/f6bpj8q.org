Yes, but what is wizard culture? There doesn't seem to be one canonically. All the stuff about why do we celebrate Halloween and not Samhain is all fanon. There aren't enough wizards to have a separate culture all they have is quidditch, Celestina Warbeck, the Weird Sisters and house elves. Ok, she could have tried harder to understand house elves but she was 15, for Pete's sake.
