Ron was a pretty big prat in cannon and fanfic only makes it worse.

In cannon he bullied Hermione first year purely because she was smarter than him and tried to help him cast the levitation spell properly, shunned Hermione for a couple weeks in third year because she told McGonagall about the */potentially cursed/* broomstick, spent several months of fourth year not talking to Harry because he wouldn't believe that Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, walked out on the trio 7th year because he was hungry and tired, and was overall a lazy piece of crap. But I guess we should like him cuz he's good at chess or something.

In fanfiction he rarely contributes anything positive to the story, is often included in the "bash everyone" genre of fics because he's easy to hate, is almost always a judgemental ass who automatically thinks Slytherins are evil simply because a hat sat on their head and said a word, and is almost always a poorly constructed character with little to no development in most fics.
