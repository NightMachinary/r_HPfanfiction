The whole lot of them to be honest. Hermione is a know it all snob who runs her intelligence in everyones face. Ron's a lazy git who is jealous and untrustworthy, he leaves the moment things don't go his way. Ginny is a fan girl who should have never ended up with Harry. Molly is an overbearing and hypocritical bitch who claims to love everyone yet openly abuses her children for following their dreams (Fred, George and Percy). Dumbledore is a minipulative prick who thinks everyone is a piece on a chessboard. I still like Fred and George as well as Sirius, they are always good but I don't think I could read the originals again.
