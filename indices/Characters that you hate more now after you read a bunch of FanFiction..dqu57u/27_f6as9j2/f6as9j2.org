Characters I've actually hated more: -Snape -Dumbledore -Molly, Ron -Canon Sirius/Hermione

Characters that I've actually found more palatable: -Draco -Luna -Fleur -Umbitch (cause of actual character development in some fics and not just wannabe dark lady) -Ginny, fanon Hermione and Cho (based on author)

The logic behind the majority of my hate more is that each of them had actions they could've taken to make things better for Harry as the main protagonist. Or they've straight up manipulated him constantly into doing what they desire.

For the likes I've actually found these characters to have way more development than their canon counterparts which imo makes the actions that they take more believable/palatable.
