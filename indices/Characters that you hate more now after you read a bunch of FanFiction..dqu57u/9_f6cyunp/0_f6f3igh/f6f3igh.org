have you read the calista Snape series? it's basically about Snape and Bellatrix having a daughter and what it would be like if he raised her by himself. Super well written, about 1M words in length, and Snape I think stays mostly true to character. He's a bit softer with his daughter, but just as much of a vindictive ass with everyone else. Great read imo.
