Definitely Snape. He was one of my favorites in the books-- brave, funny, brilliant, bitter, and so very deeply flawed. In Snape-centric fan fiction, he's often a woobie victim of the Marauders (who themselves have no redeeming qualities, because any person capable of goodness would of course worship Sev).

I make exceptions for something like the Meaning of Flowers series where Snape takes responsibility for his terrible decisions and seeks redemption while still being himself: hard-edged, snarky, and dangerous. But those are few and far between.
