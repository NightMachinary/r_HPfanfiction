  Harry/ginny - never seemed right to begin with but so many evil ginny fics, i love a good hinny < only seen a few> but they are so rare. this pairing is rough on me

My main problem with Harry/ginny is that it came out of nowhere. Pre book five Ginny is known just as Ron's little sister, she's a nonentity. In book five we get interactions with her but they are few and far between. Yet in book six Harry is pining after her, a roaring monster in his chest, yadda yadda. There is a reason it's so easy to write ginny as love potioning Harry, from what I can tell they barely know each other.

  Ron/Hermione - even the author says shit looking back. they were never going work out much. it can be done well, but as fanon and JKR even says. yeah.

Yeah, Ron and Hermione really only ever agree on one thing in the books, helping Harry. Once he moves out and isnt as big a part of their lives, they would probably start fighting, constantly, like third or sixth year. They dont work as a couple because they always needed someone as a mediator between them. Plus, Ron has his inferiority complex, and Hermione is kinda known for her "holier than thou" attitude. The less said about the whole Lavender debacle in Half-Blood Prince, the better.

  tonks/Remus - she was too young for him in ways, 13 yrs is a lot when you in your 20s to 30s. maybe not 30s to fourts or late twenties to 40s, but their age group didn't work. as well as fact.. he never dealt with alot so was shit to her.

Agreed. Remus was also kind of a dick in book seven, and so heavily fixated on his curse that he kept pushing her away. They need to work out several major issues.
