  (Tonks) I hate how easy she is and how easily she was a mary sue in the canon
#+end_quote

I hate what canon did to her character. In book 5, she was the one adult who was cheerful despite Voldemort's return. Then she becomes the pining doormat.

  I feel she was another self insert for JKR
#+end_quote

No, JKR dislikes attractive/feminine women, just look at how Fleur is written. Tonks is certainly no self-insert in that regard. Just look at the scene where Ron is like "she is alright I guess, but nothing special" when talking about a shapeshifter who can literally look like anyone on this planet. Although JKR admitted that her choice of relationships in the last book was influenced by her pining after her ex. She said that in regards to Ron/Hermione, but I feel like it spilled over.

  i feel the fanfiction versions of her depth are so much better
#+end_quote

I use her character in a lot of fics, but I feel like many authors make her (and Fleur) arm candy and little more. Harry just has not to be an utter arse and they will go out with him because apparently, no other man is capable of even basic manners.
