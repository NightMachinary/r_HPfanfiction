Well, just write. I started out writing because I was annoyed by the lack of certain story themes, so I said "I'll write my own, with blackjack and hookers". And those first few attempts sucked. A lot. I cringed when I went over my old stuff while editing it again. But I got better because I kept writing.

Hell, I still remember how my English (as second language) teacher failed me for an creative writing assignments. And now I'm the one who's laughing with more than half a million story views.

  it does seem they undervalue those characters so much

I feel like that's due to the authors being too, well, I'm hesitant to say romantic, but that's kinda the issue. Just look at "Rune Stone Path". I like that fic, it has the best mentor/student bonding I have ever read, but the relationships in there were an utter trainwreck because the author used a lot of pureblood culture BS to justify and equalise the relationships when a "normal" poly relationship would have worked much better.
