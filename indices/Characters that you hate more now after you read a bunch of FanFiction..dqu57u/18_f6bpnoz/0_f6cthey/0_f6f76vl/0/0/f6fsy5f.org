23/24 year old tonks hitting on high schoolers? Yeah that's pretty weird, even if it's legal in Scotland.

The stages of life don't really match up at that point.

Now if it's in the future, or Tonks retconned to be a few years younger, then go ahead.

I stand by my statement that it's creepy during the ootp though.
