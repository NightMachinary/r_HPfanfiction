It's legal in the entire UK, the marriage without parental consent is a Scottish thing. It's even a pretty common theme in older fanfics.

I mean, I guess it really depends on how you get to the relationship. If you base it on looks and bad pick up lines, yeah, that's weird. But if you base it on character, you should be able to get something non creepy. And if you don't bring up the age at all, it doesn't really factor in. I mean, A boy and his cloak is one of the best smut fics around despite the fact that it's set at the start of OotP. Meanwhile a lot of fics get weird if they bring up how hot someone is for their age, without getting into explicit territory.

I also remember a school lecture (Der Vorleser) we had to read where a 16 yo has a fling with a woman twice his age, and no one, not even the female teacher, raised an eyebrow at the age gap.
