my characters I hate more

​

Lupin. - just how he never reached out, best friend of his father's, never checks on a kid after his parent dies. and the way he reacted to his wife's pregnancy and the whole overuse of his curse.

.Tonks (not a favorite one I am sure to here). I still LOVE the character, but after reading a lot of fanfic. I hate how easy she is and how easily she was a mary sue in the canon. Badass auror who shapeshifts. I feel she was another self insert for JKR. I love the character when shes did right but not the canon version as much feels flat mary sue at times. i feel the fanfiction versions of her depth are so much better.

​

Molly weasely. - the love potion scandal, the smothering mother, the way she never noticed rons own issues to deal with it, how she treated Hermione and fluer. I wish she would have been dealt with more and had more done with her character, she seems a positive influence and could have been more )( got told the potion thing was from fanon and i remmebered wrong. can admit i am a mistake).

.Ron - cause 95% of the writers of fan fiction write such a shitty or bad Ron it's hard to remember a great friendly ron. I only seen a few good fictions were Ron is in a positive light

​

Snape - looking back.. a man who basically never got over a crush and lost a war over it, and even sought to make it better.. he never moved on. that's not loving, that's creepy.

​

Hermione - just looking back espcially the movie Hermione was so mary sue. its like tonks above, in the fan fiction she can be written so much better.. or so much worse like ron lol. like tonks. feel the fan fiction versions often better.

and I like more.

Lavender brown. the Patil sisters - these just got fleshed out more and though at time's portrayed bad, you can see more to them.

most Slytherin kids - you realize their kids and most likely have a side we don't hear about

Cho - your views limited, but it's from harry so meh

​

relationships

Harry/ginny - never seemed right to begin with but so many evil ginny fics, i love a good hinny < only seen a few> but they are so rare. this pairing is rough on me

Ron/Hermione - even the author says shit looking back. they were never going work out much. it can be done well, but as fanon and JKR even says. yeah.

tonks/Remus - she was too young for him in ways, 13 yrs is a lot when you in your 20s to 30s. maybe not 30s to fourts or late twenties to 40s, but their age group didn't work. as well as fact.. he never dealt with alot so was shit to her.I
