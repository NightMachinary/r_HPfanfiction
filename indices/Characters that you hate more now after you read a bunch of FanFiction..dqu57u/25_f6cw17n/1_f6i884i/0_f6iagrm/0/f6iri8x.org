  I still say that copying ideas, not methods, like the wizarding radio or enchanted cars, is the way to go.

Yeah. The thing that annoys me is all the wizardwankers think that radio, cars, trains, buses, cameras, etc were invented by wizards when they just ripped them off Muggles. How many Muggles, even ones that know about the wizarding world, would be able and willing to decontruct and reconstruct magical items and replicate them for non-magical use?
