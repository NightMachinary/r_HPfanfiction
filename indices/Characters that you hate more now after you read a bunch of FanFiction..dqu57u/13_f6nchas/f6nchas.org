While fanfics has altered my opinions on characters, various ships, various events, etc, there isn't any character that comes to mind that I truly /despise/, except maybe Umbridge, but this is no different from after I read canon.

Even while my opinions are sometimes not aligned with the typical majority (especially with regards to ship preferences), I'm frankly tired over the endless bashing that is omnipresent, no matter the character. Ron does not have Death Eater tendencies. Hermione is not utterly close-minded (she has her "holier than thou" moments, but fanfics go overboard). Dumbledore wasn't maliciously manipulative. James wasn't abusive. Severus was no rapist. Sirius did not have murder tendencies at sixteen. Ginny does not have an unhealthy interest in love potions. And so on...
