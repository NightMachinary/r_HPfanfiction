Technically they are. Simply bad step-parents don't put a kid in a cupboard for ten years until they are 'caught'. They don't treat a kid like a slave, they don't feed him through a cat-flap...I could go on. There's been lots of discussions about Harry's abuse, but honestly, if the audience had not been young teens for the books, if an author had depicted Harry's abuse seriously, Harry would have been a severely mentally damaged child. The Dursleys were absolutely despicable, even in canon. It just so happened that JKR 'softened' the portrayal of Harry's abuse for the target audience.
