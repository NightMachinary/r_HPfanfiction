Hates for certain characters in this fandom are often based on ridiculous double standards:

- It's totally ok to powerwank Harry who beats Voldemort in a straight fight at age 15, who navigates Wizengamot politics at age 14, who collects his harem at age 13, and who inherits gazillions of Galleons at age 12. But if Hermione shows a little more competence than in canon, she's a bloody MARY SUE!!!
- It's really fun to see Hermione physically assaulting Ron with birds and fists. But if Ron complains a little bit too much, he is an ABUSER!!!
- The Hogwarts resident Hitler Youth espouses magical Nazi ideology and actually carries out terrorist activities at the school, but doesn't have the courage to torture and murder his victims personally. "Oh, he must have a heart of gold. He's just misunderstood. Hermione should totally marry this guy!" Their best friend routinely risks his life and stands by them even in direst situations, but has gotten into arguments a few times. "What a traitor! This guy is a filthy devil incarnate!!!"
- This girl has only appeared once, and only because her last name is the next to Granger alphabetically. "But of course, Ice Queen of Slytherin must be the epitome of beauty and Slytherin cunning, the perfect mate for Harry!" Several other girls are depicted as physically very attractive, stand out in certain subjects, but are somewhat emotional as teenage girls should be. They also risked their lives for Harry's cause and fought against overwhelming enemy odds. "Meh, who are those annoying whiny bints???"

Lol.

Surely Hermione is more competent in Starfox5's stories, but so are Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, and Voldemort. Especially his Voldemort would have squashed canon good guys like bugs, and canon Horcrux Hunt would have certainly failed in half of his fics.

The biggest change in Starfox5's fics is not Hermione, but Dumbledore. If you guys are interested in a really competent manipulative Dumbledore, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877).
