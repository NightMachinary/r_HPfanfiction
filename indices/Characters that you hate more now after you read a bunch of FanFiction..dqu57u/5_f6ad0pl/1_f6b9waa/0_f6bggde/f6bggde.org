I don't know about the Arithmancer because I don't do Hermione centric, but I read/skimmed through the Accidental Animagus a few years ago until the second year I believe. That's a good 50+ chapters lol.

If memory serves correct that was full of self-righteous muggles, muggle wank, and characters holding the idiot ball for the sake of rehashing canon. There's also a Hermione who was good at flying, learning to become an Animagus and a parselmouth lmfao, and could beat Harry and other kids at dueling all the while keeping up with her studies. Harry was just a cat boy who read a little more, but still managed to be an inferior duelist to almost everyone.
