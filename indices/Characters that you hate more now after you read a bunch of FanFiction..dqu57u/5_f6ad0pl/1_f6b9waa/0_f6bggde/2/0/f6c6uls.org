  It's kinda expected that characters turn out differently if they have a completely different childhood, don't you think?

Yes, which is why it's an issue that Harry isn't all that different while Hermione has a steady power creep. If JKR says he's better than her at defense after having a competent teacher logic dictates he's better than her at it before then if he's actually taking time to study.

And if Harry finds himself at the Grangers when he's 5/6, he's faced 4/5 years of abuse with not a muggle saying a word. They have their own porch to sweep.
