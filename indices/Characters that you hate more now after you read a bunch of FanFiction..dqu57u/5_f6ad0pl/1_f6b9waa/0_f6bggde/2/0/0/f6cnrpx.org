  Yes, which is why it's an issue that Harry isn't all that different while Hermione has a steady power creep. If JKR says he's better than her at defense after having a competent teacher logic dictates he's better than her at it before then if he's actually taking time to study.

  And if Harry finds himself at the Grangers when he's 5/6, he's faced 4/5 years of abuse with not a muggle saying a word. They have their own porch to sweep.

The muggle world not being perfect in regards to child abuse is not an excuse for the wizarding world's political system. And if we are talking about child abuse, the Wizarding World is /hardly/ any better in that regard. Apparently /nobody/ thought it problematic that Neville's uncle threw him out of a window, which he only survived because he was a wizard, of which said uncle was not convinced at that point.
