  full of self-righteous muggles, muggle wank
#+end_quote

IIRC the only thing that the muggles in that fic are perhaps self-righteous about and where one could call it muggle wank was when it came to the Wizarding World's politics and judiciary. And let's be honest, the Wizarding World is objectively Bad in that regard. This is not "guns are way better than wands" or "haha wizards don't know any tactics" or anything like that, it's more like "So you don't have separation of powers, your ceremonial head of government is also the leader of your equivalent of the UN and for some reason headmaster of your only school and your trials basically boil down to a vote between the representatives of the established families if you even have a trial at all before stuffing the accused into a prison full of soul-sucking monsters. And you want us to send our daughter to live in that world? Are you nuts?". And I think that's a perfectly reasonable reaction for someone who is used to a modern democracy and all it entails.

  characters holding the idiot ball for the sake of rehashing canon
#+end_quote

I didn't really have that feeling at all. In fact everyone seemed quite a bit more competent than in canon. But there is a point of divergence from canon and everything before that is obviously the same, including people being idiots just like in canon.

  There's also a Hermione who was good at flying, learning to become an Animagus and a parselmouth lmfao, and could beat Harry and other kids at dueling all the while keeping up with her studies.

It's kinda expected that characters turn out differently if they have a completely different childhood, don't you think? And if your sibling/best friend could turn into an animal and talk to snakes, wouldn't you try to learn it from them?
