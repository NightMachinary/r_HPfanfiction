  Hermione has no great fanfics really. Not where she is strong on her own.

I know this has probably been recommended thousands of times on this Subreddit, but the Arithmancer by White Squirrel (and even more the sequel, Lady Archimedes) is very nicely Hermione centric without making her a Mary Sue. Their second biggest fanfic, The Accidental Animagus has Hermione and Harry on practically equal ground (and the plot moves along a bit quicker, but it's also not finished yet!).
