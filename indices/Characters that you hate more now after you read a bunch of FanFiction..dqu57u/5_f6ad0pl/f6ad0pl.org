Molly Weasley! The fanfic would has taken a very 1-sided controlling view from the books and expanded on it so much. Hermione has no great fanfics really. Not where she is strong on her own. I still love canon Hermione! And finally, probably very unpopular, Sirius Black. There was huge hole (in my opinion) about his recovery from Azkaban, or lack of. I guess I never understood Harry's attachment. Granted it has been forever since I've read the real books.
