Luna

i never really cared about her or saw the hype about her in canon but i was okay, but fanon? nope. they've turned the quirky girl with little to no friends and a slightly abnormal background to an all seeing seer who can read peoples minds just by looking at their expressions and whose made up animals are part of a hereditary talent that makes her one of the strongest and lord do i hate it.
