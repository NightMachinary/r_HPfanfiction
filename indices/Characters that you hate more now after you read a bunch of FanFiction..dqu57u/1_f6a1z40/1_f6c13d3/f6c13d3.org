Oh yeah. The Weasleys is an extremely flawed family that canon thought could do no wrong and part of fanon think can do no right. Unfortunately the rosy picture of canon is the more unrealistic one.

The best Molly Weasley story I've read was one where both Molly and Arthur died and Percy was raising hi younger siblings. She got to be a real person with flaws and not be the idealized mother figure.
