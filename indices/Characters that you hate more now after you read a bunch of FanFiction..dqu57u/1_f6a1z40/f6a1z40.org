For me, it's Molly Weasley.

Things like how Ron is lowkey written as having a rather troubled childhood, the twins bullying him so much, always being on the short end of the stick in terms of possession (secondhand everything), how she was cold to Hermione simply because of that Rita Skeeter article.

I dunno, after reading a lot of fanfictions that expand the Weasley children's childhood, just have a different take on her character.

Fate by TheTrueSpartan is probably the biggest contributor in this thinking.
