Dumbledore and the Dursleys. Most ffs show how manipulative Dumbledore was, as, even in the books, he had people watching Harry, such as Figg, who most likely told him about what was happening, and then he ignored it, and how what the Dursleys did was actually abuse not just something to wash over.

Ffs really shine a new light onto books/shows and most of the time gets me thinking a bunch deeper into how bad incidents are that are just brushed over (such as Harry sleeping in a cupboard for eleven years and Marge's dog chasing him up a tree and him staying there all night).
