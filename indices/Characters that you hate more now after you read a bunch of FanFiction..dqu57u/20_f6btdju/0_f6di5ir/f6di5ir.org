I don't disagree, but sometimes I think it's easy to forget how all that abuse happened behind closed doors. Figg was a squib she didn't have magic, how would she know Harry slept in a cupboard. Not even Harry's teachers and fellow students knew and they seen him almost everyday. And Harry never told anyone, not even at school to Ron and Hermione his best friends I don't ever remember hearing him say anything about the cupboard. Which is actually realistic because most abused kids don't tell, unless someone asks.

I honestly don't think Dumbledore did know Harry was being abused, he was a lot of things but being in touch with the day to day he was not.
