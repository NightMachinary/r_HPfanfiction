Agree totally. Also agree with slightly more problematic attitude towards Dumbledore (NO BASHING! He is a good guy, just lost in his power ... Do not touch it, Frodo! and Lord Acton). I cannot say I lost my appreciation of Snape, because I have never appreciated him, but discussions here finally explained to me that there is also book!Snape and film!Snape (first one just plain horrible, other one suave conflicted persona) and that film!Snape heavily influenced JKR in writing her books from OoP onwards. Yes, even JKR fallen for Alan Rickman.
