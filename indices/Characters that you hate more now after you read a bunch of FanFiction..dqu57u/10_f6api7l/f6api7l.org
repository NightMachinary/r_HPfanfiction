I guess I am the exception here but there aren't any characters that I started hating after reading their fanon versions. The only thing reading those types of fics does for me is make me hate the author for portraying a character unfairly rather than dislike the character. It also makes me appreciate JK Rowlings more nuanced characterization of them. I find fanon overly abusive Dursleys, manipulative Dumbledore, evil Snape, death eater Ron and love potion Molly/Ginny to be ridiculous and fics portraying them like that are not worth reading or taking seriously.

Although if I had to pick one I am more critical of Dumbledore now that I have read fics overanalyzing his every action and inaction. Harry Potter books did start as children's stories and were never written to be super realistic so I can forgive a lot of inconsistencies in his behavior.

There are a couple of characters for whom I have much better appreciation for after reading fanfiction though. I really didn't care for Tom Riddle or Ginny but after reading fics that expand their character I have started to really like them in certain instances.
