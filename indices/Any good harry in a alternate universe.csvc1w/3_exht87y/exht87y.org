  /AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze./

Hermione is a bit of a Mary Sue, but no more than in the movies and it is Harry Hermione, but the world building is amazing and I love seeing the familiar cast in such a different setting and seeing how it changed them.
