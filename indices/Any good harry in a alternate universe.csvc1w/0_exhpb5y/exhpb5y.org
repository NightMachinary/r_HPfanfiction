Hmm, is time-travel necessarily alternate dimension as well? Tough call. Either way:

- linkffn(A Black Comedy): the absolute reigning champion of this category, Harry and Sirius run rampant in this alternate universe.
- linkffn(Delenda Est): kind of a mix of both tt and au as well. This fic is hit or miss with some people, though it does hit a lot of the more fun notes, and is probably the best iteration of Harry/Bellatrix, for what its worth.
- linkffn(I'm Still Here): another mixed-bag, but there is a lot of content and may arguably be closer to rent a hero than any other I can think of (with alternate fem-Harry in new dimension). Props though for Draco as well I suppose.
- linkffn(On a Pale Horse): so Harry is death, and decides gets summoned to help out the OotP. Pure-crack, but some moments are truly hilarious. Ah, my little shell...
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero): this one is the sequel to another fic, and is a bit dated. However, if your more inclined toward the badass, to giant battle zones, and to three-way fights with animagus Harry and a pair of nundus (nundi?), then read its predecessor and then this.
- linkao3(C'est la vie by cywscross): an incomplete fic, but honestly I enjoy this one mainly for how...well drawn I suppose...all the characters are. Props for hilarious rune teacher.
