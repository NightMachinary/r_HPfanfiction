  so this means the author has to have either outright said he would only release future chapters if they got "donations"
#+end_quote

In the MoR case, what he said was that donations would lead to an accelerated timetable of chapter releases.

He considered this a kind of dodge around the "can't ask for money" standard, but it a) is a technical dodge, as people are still paying money in exchange for the writing of fanfic and b) isn't even a good technical dodge, because doing something sooner than otherwise planned is recognised by courts as consideration for a binding contract.

Interestingly, that final point means that if he failed to update according to the timetable stated, readers could potentially sue him for breach of (unilateral) contract.
