My issue is not with the legality of the situation. OP's question was "how do you /feel/" and my feeling is, everyone who jumped in to express their outrage over the (false) idea that this writer was holding his work hostage and demanding money for his own personal gain - which isn't the case - base their arguments on this weird imaginary line between original and derivative content which I don't /feel/ represents the value of a work of art, just because they've grown up in a society where we're told that line exists by exactly the legal and media institutions who have the most to profit from the line existing.
