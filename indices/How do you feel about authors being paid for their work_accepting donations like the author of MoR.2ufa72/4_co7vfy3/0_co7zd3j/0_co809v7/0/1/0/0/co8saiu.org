  My issue is not with the legality of the situation.
#+end_quote

Nor is mine. I think it is immorral to use someone else's IP for personal financial gain, that's not due to laws it's because if I wrote a story i'd be pissed if someone stole it and made money off it without giving me a cut.

The rest of your comment is your own belief that the only reason people don't like it is society and not their own morality which is condescending. The only time law has been brought up, other than you, is to point out what could happen if fanfiction authors started charging for their writing without permission.
