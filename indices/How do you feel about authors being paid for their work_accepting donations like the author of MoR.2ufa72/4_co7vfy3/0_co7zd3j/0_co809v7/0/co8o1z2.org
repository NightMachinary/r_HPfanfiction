It's very easy to frame that in a way that looks shady, but if he was just doing it for the money, why would he bother using a non-profit organisation as a third party to pay himself? He asks for donations because that non-profit does something which he absolutely considers vital for the future of humankind. Yes, he also works for that nonprofit. Yes, he draws his salary from that nonprofit. Being paid for your labor is not a crime.

I find it so weird how people condemn people who expect payment for doing good things. If the CEO of a charity gets paid as much as the CEO of a bank, because their workload and responsibility are comparable and their expertise is of a similar value, it makes no sense to condemn the CEO of the charity more than the banker. Yes, money from the charity's account is going to him, but without him, there is no charity. Maybe all CEO salaries are too high, that's its own issue, but condemning the guy who does a difficult and worthy job for having the same expectations of being compensated for his labor and time stems from this stupid, childish belief that charities shouldn't have overheads. It's so easy to tell yourself that people should be doing charity work out of the goodness of their hearts, but I bet you don't spend all your free time volunteering with orphaned puppies.

LessWrong isn't trying to pull some weird wool over your eyes to get a bigger paycheck, he's asking that people support the cause he truly believes in, whose philosophy is taught in every example of his oeuvre of work.
