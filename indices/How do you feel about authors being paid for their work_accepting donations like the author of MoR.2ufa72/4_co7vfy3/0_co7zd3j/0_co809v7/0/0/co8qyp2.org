There's a great TED talk about charities and overhead and how people seem to judge the quality of a charity by what percentage of their intake is used on the issue rather than the overhead. IIRC a lot of it is a combination of the weird expectation you described, and a lack of concrete metrics to legitimately rate them on. Something like how do you rate a charity working towards curing a disease before the cure is found and you can say who/what actually helped with the discovery?
