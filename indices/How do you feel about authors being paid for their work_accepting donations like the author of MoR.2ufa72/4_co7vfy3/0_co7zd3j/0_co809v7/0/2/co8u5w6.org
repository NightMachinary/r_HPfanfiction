I actually agree with your first paragraph. I do think the author is doing it to benefit the NPO he works for and not for himself. My dream is to one day work for a NPO and I respect that they have to pay their employees an acceptable salary for their work. It's not realistic to ask full-time staff to work without pay, even if it's "for a good cause". The bulk of these donations are most likely going for this NPO to continue doing its research, with maybe a small amount going to overhead costs that need to be paid for this NPO to continue to exist. (Side note, I wish people would stop calling it a charity, it's a NPO that researches artificial intelligence. Charity gives a different connotation.)

The only way I can see this being shady is if the author suddenly got a raise and was pocketing the donations that way. Basically using his NPO to launder money from his fanfiction. Although, we wouldn't know either way if that was the case.

In regard to the rest of your points: I think in some cases, even with NPOs and charities, CEOs are being paid unreasonably high salaries. That's probably a topic for another discussion.

Another topic would be whether he has the right to use Harry Potter material to fund raise donations for this NPO.
