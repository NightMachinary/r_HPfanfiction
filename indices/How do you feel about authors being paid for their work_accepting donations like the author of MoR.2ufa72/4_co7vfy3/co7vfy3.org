I'm not sure how these things even come up. I mean normally no fanfic reader would offer a fanfic writer money, so this means the author has to have either outright said he would only release future chapters if they got "donations" or at least strongly suggested this. And I have a problem with that. What makes a few authors think they have the right to demand money when everybody else is doing it for free? As far as I'm concerned, if you want to get paid for your writing, write something original.
