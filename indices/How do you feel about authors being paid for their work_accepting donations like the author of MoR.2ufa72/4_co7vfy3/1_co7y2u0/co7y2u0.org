  normally no fanfic reader would offer a fanfic writer money
#+end_quote

This doesn't necessarily have to be this way, though. People get donations from appreciative audience for writing games, creating and supporting websites, making films and videos, translating books of their favourite authors, etc. If the relationship is bidirectionally beneficial, accepting donations of itself isn't something bad.

  What makes a few authors think they have the right to demand money when everybody else is doing it for free?
#+end_quote

Because they have. It's another question that the audience in return has the right to not give anything if they don't like it.
