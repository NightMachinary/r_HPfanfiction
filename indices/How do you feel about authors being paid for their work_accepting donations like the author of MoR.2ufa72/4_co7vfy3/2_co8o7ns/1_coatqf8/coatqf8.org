Okay - let's take a case of an original work: Sherlock Holmes and all the people who are not Conan Doyle who are making money on Sherlock Holmes.

What's the difference between "Elementary" the US TV show and "HP and MoR" the fanfiction?

First off, the creators of "Elementary" are licensed by the [[http://www.conandoyleestate.co.uk/index.php/movies-and-tv/][Conan Doyle estate]] which means they have permission to use the characters and have compensated the estate.

"MoR" is not licensed by JKR or any other of the rights holders to Harry Potter and I seriously doubt the author of "MoR" and his non-profit compensates JKR etc for using Harry Potter. Furthermore, the author of "MoR" is making a profit off of Harry Potter which directly opposes JKR's request.

Wah wah you say - he's just asking for a donation to an NPO. It's a charity afterall. But he's being paid by the NPO and he is profiting.

If you bought a computer from a guy on Craigslist but you didn't know it was stolen - it doesn't make it NOT stolen, it just makes you ignorant of the crime and no one reading this thread who is still saying "oh it's a donation" is ignorant of the crime.
