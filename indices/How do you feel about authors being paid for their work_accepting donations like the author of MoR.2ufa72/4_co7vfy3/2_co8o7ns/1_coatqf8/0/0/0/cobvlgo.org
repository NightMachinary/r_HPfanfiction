While someone trying to make money under the radar might do it via an NPO which employs them, the fact that he is doing it that way doesn't mean he's trying to make money under the radar. If you can't trust that any money donated would go to furthering the cause of that NPO and not his salary, you don't have to make any donations. I imagine that's the rationale - it matters less that people think he's in it for the money than that the NPO gets more money.

If people see it his way and believe he's not selfishly motivated, that's better from his perspective because they'll be more inclined to give, but if people believe they're putting money directly in his pocket and give anyway, the material outcome is the same. People keep bringing up the fact that he founded and works for the NPO as though it's some big secret he tried to keep from his audience, but it's not, he's as open as he can be about his motivations in all his outputs, because the best strategy is one which doesn't rely on the strategy being a secret.

He wants people to believe in and support this cause he's literally dedicated his life to, a cause he believes is vital to the continued survival of humanity, and he's willing to accept the possibility of some people misinterpreting that as self-interest because the payoff is still more donations than if he doesn't ask.
