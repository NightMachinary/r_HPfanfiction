As I've said elsewhere in this thread, the question is not 'is it legal'. I know it's not legal. The question OP asked was how do you feel about authors doing this. My answer is, the example OP gave ISN'T an example of an author 'charging' for fanfiction and I don't think what LessWrong has done deserves the outrage that's been expressed towards him here and on other forums. In the case of an author publishing a work of fanfiction which is otherwise unavailable in exchange for money, I think that's bullshit, but asking your audience to donaate to a cause you care about while still putting out a massive amount of content on the reg doesn't make you the worst asshole in the world.
