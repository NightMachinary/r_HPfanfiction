No I think the film people deserve the money because JK sold the film rights to them. They paid her in order to be able to do it.

JK has actually spoken about fanfiction though. She's said use my IP all you like /providing you don't charge for it/. That's the difference, fanfiction authors don't have a contract with JK allowing them to charge for her work just a tenuous agreement she won't sue them for doing it for free.
