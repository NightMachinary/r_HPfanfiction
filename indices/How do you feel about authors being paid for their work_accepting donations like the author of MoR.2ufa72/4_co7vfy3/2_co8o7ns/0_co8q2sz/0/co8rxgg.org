That's not my point. I'm saying you claimed fanfic authors don't deserve to make any money because their work is derived from someone else's. JK made bank, but so did a lot of people who didn't do anything creative or new with something she'd created. The only reason you think fanfiction authors don't deserve money and the studio execs do is the people who founded studios to record music and films told you that you should follow the rules they set in place re: copyright and ownership of ideas, because that's how they make money.
