  if you want to get paid for your writing, write something original

The idea of copyright and ownership of ideas and stories was invented by record companies in the early 1900s. People have been reworking and reforming other people's art into their own distinct works since before the beginning of history. Many of Shakespeare's best plays were based heavily on works by other contemporary authors and playwrights. All human cultural expression makes sense only in the context of its production and all the media which has gone before it. How original does something have to be before someone who has put in work is 'deserving' of your cash? If you like Harry Potter, I bet you paid to see the films in the cinema. How is this any different?
