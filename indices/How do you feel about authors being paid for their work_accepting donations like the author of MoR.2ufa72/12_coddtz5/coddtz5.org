Accepting donations is fine, I suppose, depending on how it is done; most often I lose interest almost immediately because it sounds like begging/holding something hostage rather than "hey by the way, I love sea turtles, and if you guys like, feel free to donate to help save more of them!" Same for "play to win" models in video games; if you want to charge me for the game, fine, but if the game is "free" it shouldn't need tons of microtransactions to make it to the end.
