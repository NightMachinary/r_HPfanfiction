Personally I think authors should be able to make money off of derivative works if there's enough original content, especially if it's voluntary donations, but I'm not in charge of copyright law. I doubt I would pay for it, though.

I think people who do try to charge for derivative works aren't good for the community because it would likely make original authors less accepting of fanfiction and could cause legal trouble for the hosting sites as well as the fic authors.

I very much do not approve of fic authors asking for donations in return for releasing chapters.
