If people want to give money to an author because they enjoyed their work then I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to.

Putting fanfiction behind a paywall would be a huge no-no, but since I've not seen anyone doing that, I don't think it really matters if an author leaves details on how to donate if you want to in the AN.
