As said, I think there is a direct moral disagreement with people who think that /nobody/ or /nobody associated with you in any way, including a nonprofit/, not just you, can be associated with any money whose movement is triggered by your fanfiction in any way... though in that case they really should be crusading against fanfiction.net for taking ads and thereby profiting off the fanfictions, one would think.

Personally, I give blanket permission to all to take my original fictional works, such as Three Worlds Collide, steal the world and characters, and sell their derivative works at a profit if they so desire. I have a tremendous disagreement with the way modern copyright law is set up and I think the doujinshi culture of Japan, or Shakespeare's ability to riff off common works of his own era, are tremendously healthier than today's infinite copyright. I don't think I'm morally entitled to royalties from the author of the off-Broadway play /Yudkowski Returns: The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski/ which was produced without my knowledge or consent.

  While I tend to publish most of my writing for free, I strongly believe that money is not evil. Therefore, anyone is welcome to take characters or settings from my original online fiction, such as the beisutsukai or the Baby-Eating Aliens, and use them in new commercial works of your own creation. I do ask for acknowledgment and a link or other reference to the original, but so long as the writing is your own, you may charge for access, distribute printed copies, sell the story to a magazine, etc. I don't mind.

That general attitude does inform my approach to fanfiction, and while I diligently obey US laws against charging for fanfiction, and I am even okay with voluntarily abiding by both the letter and the spirit of a norm against asking for personal donations tied to fanfiction, I am not going to obey non-widely-agreed rules advocated by some individuals against advertising nonprofits, or whatever. I have an open moral disagreement with those individuals, and I'm cheerful about that being a thing.

I will accept any and all criticism of what I actually did, accurately conveyed without distortions or sly phrasings. I am /not/ okay with my actions being misrepresented.
