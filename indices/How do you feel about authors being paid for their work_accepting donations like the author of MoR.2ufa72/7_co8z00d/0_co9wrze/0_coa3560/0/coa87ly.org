I think that much of the disagreement stems from the grownups in the community knowing in their hearts that unauthorized publication of fanfiction of work not in the public domain is at best (in most cases) illegal in the U.S. and at worst morally wrong. I'm guilty of this, having published several such stories, only a few of which would be covered by Fair Use (something Shakespeare never had to fret over). None of my most popular fanfiction stories are covered as such, nor is yours.

The legal issue is separate from the moral disagreement you might have with your detractors. We may attempt to justify our illegal behavior with disclaimers of a story's not being published for profit (irrelevant), sugarcoat it with pretenses to Fair Use (inappropriate in the majority of cases, and nevertheless applied on a case-by-case basis), or claim that fanfiction is a sort of "legal gray area" (it isn't: the law explicitly states that copyright holders have the /exclusive/ right to make derivative work from their copyrighted work). While U.S. copyright law is the mess that it is, we're knowingly breaking the law when we publish it. (As are the administrators of ff.net.)

So what we have is a largely underground community a hundred-thousand strong with a love affair for the organic, creative product that's sprung up about our beloved series, as well as a tenuous truce with the author and her publisher who appear to tolerate the use of their intellectual property in making derivative work--so long as it doesn't cross a line. We don't quite know quite where the line is but we do know the line exists--see RDR's attempt to publish the /HP Lexicon/ and the ensuing court challenge. Unlike RDR, we're not a major publisher with a high-powered legal team. If a challenge were ever raised to our publishing of fanfiction, if JKR ever said, "Enough, begone!" it wouldn't make it to a court battle. JKR's attorneys would only have to issue a single CAD to wipe out millions of hours of collective creative effort virtually overnight. It wouldn't matter if they were in the right, legally or morally; the threat of a lawsuit would have ff.net folding in a heartbeat.

And against this backdrop, the most public, outspoken figure in the fandom, the guy written up in /The New Yorker/ and /The Atlantic,/ goes and risks /draco dormiens nunquam titillandus/ over a Thoreauean stand that his interpretation of U.S. copyright law is necessarily the one the courts would uphold (except, of course, that it would never go to court). I'd hope you'd understand why once money gets involved, this changes the balance, making people uneasy. It doesn't matter, really, whether the money ends up in your pocket or your favorite non-profit to save humanity from a futuristic Big Bad. The small but nonzero threat of negative externalities sucks eggs.

Ours isn't the only community wrestling with issues of copyright law and the ensuing stifling of creativity. For example, there continues to be a huge folderol over the removal of cover songs and accounts uploaded to YouTube. The various open software movements also continually fight court battles over their stances with respect to legal sharing of software. It's true that U.S. copyright law remains overly restrictive and doesn't favor the creative use of media, nor will it anytime soon with our stridently pro-corporate Congress, but this doesn't mean that concern over actions that risk bringing the thing down are entirely unwarranted.

  I don't think I'm morally entitled to royalties from the author of the off-Broadway play /Yudkowski Returns: The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski/ which was produced without my knowledge or consent.

This is the difference between a public figure and private one; privacy protections for a public figure are much less restrictive. (Besides, that was Yudkowski with an 'i'; huge difference. I speak from authority, being named Brian with an 'i', not the despicable 'y'.)
