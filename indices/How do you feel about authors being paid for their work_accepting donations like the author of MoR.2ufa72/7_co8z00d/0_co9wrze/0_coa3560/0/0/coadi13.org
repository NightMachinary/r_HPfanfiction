Sir or Madam, I thank you first for your perspicacious and well-argued points.

It is not clear that HPMOR, which is (a) free, (b) very clear political expression, and (c) parody, would not be Fair Use under US law via the combination of these factors; I'm not aware of US law having tested a case like that. Which is mostly irrelevant in real life, since it's not like the rule of law is still a thing around here.

There's a general question of how much value to lose, for never trying or doing certain things, for risk of upsetting certain applecarts. For example, maybe I should never have written HPMOR because it attains a high profile and so brings down some terrible lightning upon all of fanfiction, independently of any worries about donations. But I don't think that scenario is actually realistic, and I tend not to let low-probability disaster scenarios that I do not think will actually happen in real life, ward me off from generating value, e.g., writing HPMOR and thereby edifying readers, or asking for donations to a charity in an author's note.

Once HPMOR is complete, I might seek out some avenue to Rowling and ask about publishing HPMOR (maybe under the title "HJPEV and the Methods of Rationality") with all profits accruing to a mutually agreeable charity, on the basis that HPMOR has generated a lot of new buzz about Harry Potter and that it will contribute to keeping the brand alive and vital. I mostly expect she'll say no or be overruled by suits. But (if I get around to it) that expectation won't stop me from /trying/ to generate even more value (in the form of more people enjoying HPMOR and income for the agreed charity), from /trying/ to ask Rowling just to see what happens, /merely/ because I mostly don't expect it to work. I mostly didn't expect HPMOR to work.

This does reflect a more dynamic approach to life than keeping your head down and trying not to make trouble. Whether that's /immoral/, or whether big disaster scenarios are realistic, is something where I might well disagree with someone else who feels a more instinctive drive to keep their head down. And I'm not sure I can think of much to say about that, beyond that sometimes people disagree in life, and good and virtuous people may well find reason to criticize me for things that I actually say, do, or advocate, which does not lead me to respect them any less; and that to misrepresent what I do is another matter entirely, and it is the matter I was addressing here.
