  Once HPMOR is complete, I might seek out some avenue to Rowling and ask about publishing HPMOR (maybe under the title "HJPEV and the Methods of Rationality") with all profits accruing to a mutually agreeable charity, on the basis that HPMOR has generated a lot of new buzz about Harry Potter and that it will contribute to keeping the brand alive and vital.

Is this a joke? The only reason I've even heard of HPMOR is because of this community. It certainly is not "keeping HP alive" for Rowling. What a bombastic statement to make!
