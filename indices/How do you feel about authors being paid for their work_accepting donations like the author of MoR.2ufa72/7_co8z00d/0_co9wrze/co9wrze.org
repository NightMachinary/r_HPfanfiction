Congratulations on entering the final arc of your story. While I haven't followed it since its early chapters, I nevertheless respect the level of effort involved in completing an ambitious, novel-length work.

I think much of the question of the original post's being a 'lie' comes down to parsing. While you did not receive direct remuneration for your writing, you did ask for donations in response to providing a derivative fiction product on an accelerated time scale. To many, this would meet the criterion of "accepting donations" for writing fanfiction and, despite the strict legality of the matter or the nature of your ties to 501(c)(3) organization, it understandably puts a few people off. It's not an E. L. James level of putting people off, granted, but it does seem to leave most in the community with an uneasy feel once money or donations get mixed up with the craft of writing fanfiction. (And for the record, [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/][S'TarKan]] (Matthew Schocke) of /NoFP/ fame is arguably far more culpable with respect to his shameless acceptance of donations for fanfiction writing, which is part of why I do not read his story any more.)

Edit: slight reword for clarity
