P/S/A: The original post is a lie, no one's ever paid me a cent for HPMOR and I have no intention of ever asking for one.

The actual event which the trollpost is twisting is that one time while the charity I work for was running its annual fundraising campaign and seemed to be in danger of not making it, I said that upcoming chapter releases would be 1 per 2 days instead of 1 per 4 days if the charity made its fundraising goal. My salary did not depend on this fundraising goal in any way, theoretically or actually. Furthermore, the number of chapters being released was predefined, so there wasn't additional content being generated or held hostage in exchange for donations - what I'd already written was just being released faster, depending on whether the charity made its fundraising goal.

I've advertised other charities as well in the author's notes of HPMOR, and don't regret it. I doubt J. K. Rowling regrets it either, and if she does, she's welcome to say so.
