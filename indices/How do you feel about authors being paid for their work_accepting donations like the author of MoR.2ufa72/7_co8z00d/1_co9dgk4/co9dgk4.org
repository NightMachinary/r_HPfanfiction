  P/S/A: The original post is a lie, no one's ever paid me a cent for HPMOR and I have no intention of ever asking for one.

What about [[http://hpmor.com/notes/86/]]

  CFAR could make very good use of a lot more money than this while starting up. I don't work for the Center for Applied Rationality and they don't pay me, but their work is sufficiently important that the Singularity Institute (which does pay me) has allowed me to offer to work on Methods full-time until the story is finished if HPMOR readers donate a total of $1M to CFAR.

That is directly asking for money in exchange for spending more time writing.

I personally couldn't care less how many donations you ask for (as long as they're optional and all text is released freely), but saying you never asked money for HPMOR is just false.
