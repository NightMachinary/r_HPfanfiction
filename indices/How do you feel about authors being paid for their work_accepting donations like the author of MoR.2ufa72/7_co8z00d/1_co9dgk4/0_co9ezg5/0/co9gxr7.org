Besides the charity there (CFAR) being one to which I am financially unrelated, I furthermore remark that my salary wouldn't have changed at all in that circumstance, I would simply have been doing other things on a daily basis for a bit. The story got finished anyway, though later, and my salary would have been unaffected by the counterfactual.

If people hate the idea of fanfiction being tied in any way to charity, then yes, I explicitly disagree and am 'guilty' as charged; I think it's perfectly fine to use the medium to advertise charities. But if they think I'm profiting personally off HPMOR, like the original post implies by saying that I'm 'asking for donations' (slyly implied: to myself personally), then I never made a red cent and wasn't intending to. No, not even indirectly in terms of increased job security or improved salary negotiating leverage. Most of MIRI's funding doesn't come from anywhere near HPMOR, I've been working there for 10 years before HPMOR was a thing, and the marginal funding donated to MIRI by some HPMOR readers genuinely doesn't affect my salary at all. Yes, really actually in practice. I helped cofound MIRI, which means that I'm core personnel whose salary isn't in doubt; I was already funnelling donations to MIRI in ways that have nothing to do with HPMOR; and I voluntarily work far under my market value. I already had 'brings in donations' as an attribute before HPMOR was a thing, HPMOR still isn't most of that attribute, and I don't use that attribute as salary negotiation leverage because nonprofit cofounder. Donations from HPMOR readers do not affect my job status or salary; they just make MIRI more able to do more other things like running decision theory workshops.
