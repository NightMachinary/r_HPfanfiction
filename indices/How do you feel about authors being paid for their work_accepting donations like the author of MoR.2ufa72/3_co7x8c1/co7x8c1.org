I don't like it. If you want to get paid, change the names and the recognizable stuff and pull a Fifty-Shades-of-Grey or Mortal-Instruments type of deal where it's now original work.

If you can't do that, that means your fanfiction depends too heavily on JK Rowling's work and you shouldn't be profiting from it.
