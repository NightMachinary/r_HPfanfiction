The problem is that fanfiction is work based on copyrighted material. They have no right to make a profit off of someone else's work. In a case like MoR, yes, the author put a lot of time and effort into that story, but it wouldn't stand on its own without the world Rowling created. It's still using Rowling's world and expanding on things from the Harry Potter series.

I think if more fanfiction authors decided to take this route and request/receive money, regardless of talent, that would make the actual authors take action against it.

When you sign the guidelines on ffnet, there is a small number of authors who requested that the site not allow fanfiction for their work. As a result, ffnet doesn't take submissions for these works. Now, this is taking it to the extreme, but what if more and more authors/publishers/producers requested this because they don't like the public profiting off their book/show/whatever? Sure, that's not going to prevent all fanfiction, there will always be clusters of it somewhere on the internet. But it's going to take away easy access and a lot of people probably wouldn't bother with it.
