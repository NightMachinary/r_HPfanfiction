I would not consider myself a member of the fanfic community as has been mentioned - I lurk this subreddit, read mostly off of fanfic.net and that is as far as it goes for me. I disagree with a lot of the comments made in this thread, so consider this post an outsider's point of view

Personally, I have no problems whatsoever with authors being paid or accepting donations. It is a transaction between two willing participants. HP MoR is an incredible achievement in captivating a vast audience in a crossover of Harry Potter and rationalism. If I'd never read it, I'd consider the concept absurd, and yet the author has made something special. Given the countless hours it has taken to research and write, I have absolutely no qualms with the author accepting donations or with readers giving donations.

The few authors thinking 'they have the right to demand money when everybody else is doing it for free' have that right because they are sufficiently talented, and have a fanbase who are willing to pay for it. All authors are welcome to request/demand payments in my mind, but only those talented enough at their art would actually receive that money.
