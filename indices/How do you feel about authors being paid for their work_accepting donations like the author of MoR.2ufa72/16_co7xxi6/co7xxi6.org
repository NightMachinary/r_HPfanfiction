If the writer merely lists their account numbers for those who are willing to support them, I don't see why it should be a problem.

This, however, does not apply to situations in which the author is ready to fulfil requests (e.g. “I'll pay you this much if you kill/torture this specific character I don't like.”, etc) or intentionally withhold updates hostage to extort money from the readers.
