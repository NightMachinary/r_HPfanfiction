*Disclaimer:* IANAL, and while there was a period in my life when I read and thought about these things a lot, it's been a while, so I might have forgotten things and/or not kept up with the latest developments.

There's the legal issue, which is messy, but would probably come out on the side of the franchise owner over the fanfic writer.

And then, there's the ethical issue. Personally, I think that copyright has weaker ethical grounding than rights over physical property overall, though I support limited copyright as a social contract. (Basically, copyright ethics --- last I looked, anyway --- drew a line between the /idea/ and the /expression/, and while the latter was restricted, the former was meant to be copied: that's how culture evolves.)

In this case, whereas unauthorized redistribution (commercial or not) of a work directly competes with the authorized distribution, distribution of fan fiction (commercial or not) does not diminish the original or its profitability in any meaningful way, so I don't consider it unethical. In other words, I don't see a frachise author having ethical standing to forbid fan fiction in the first place, even if our bloated copyright law might given them the legal one.

This is /especially/ the case for well-established franchises like /Harry Potter/. For smaller franchises, bad fanfic may do reputational damage to the author of the original, but there are less prohibitive mechanisms (like obligation to add a clear disclaimer) to mitigate that, and the issue is orthogonal to whether money is being made from the fanfic anyway. (Honestly, /Partially Kissed Hero/ would have probably done /less/ damage to HP fandom had PL charged money for it.)

So, personally, I don't have a problem with people even going so far as charging for the fanfic, as long as they make it clear and uprfront that they are not affilliated with the franchise, that the money doesn't go to the franchise's author, etc.. However, I acknowledge that, legally, as law stands, they are probably on thin ice.
