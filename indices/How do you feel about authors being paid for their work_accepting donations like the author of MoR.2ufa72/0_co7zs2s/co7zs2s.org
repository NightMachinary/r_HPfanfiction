For me, fanfiction is something I do for fun and for me. I love getting reviews, but I only post/write if I am happy with the results. I would never demand money from readers.

I think that fanfic writers who think they are entitled to a paycheque come off as arrogant and I will never ever read their stuff, no matter how good it is. J.K. Rowling and other authors, such as Tolkien and GRRM, worked hard to create these fantastic worlds and all we do is borrow their worlds for our own personal fantasies/stories. These worlds are shared with us, but we are not the creators. We may be writing the fanfics, but we are, technically, using someone else's work *without* their permission.

If a fanfic author feels they deserve money, then they should write their own original work. But, to me, if there is no legal contract and they are getting paid, it comes off as copyright infringment. There is a reason we usually write "This does not belong to me, I don't get paid for this" at the beginning of our fics (and it is covered in site rules), which is because we, legally, cannot receive money for writing our fanfics.

If someone, privately, wants to provide a donation because they are extremely happy or supportive, that is up to them. But the author should not demand or expect money from readers. They do not have to refuse a private donor, but they should not make monetary demands. Nor should they make the private donation public.

As someone else said, we are a community. We share our work with each other, we provide proper criticism, and we support each other. But we should not be demanding money from one another. I write fanfics because I love to and I will forever love the world JK created for us. But, if I want to get paid, I will write my own work (which I am currently working on).

Long and short: if someone wants to privately donate, it's up to them and keep it private! If someone demands payment, they're an arrogant twat.
