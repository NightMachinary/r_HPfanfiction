The fanfiction community is exactly that: a community. The relationship between reader and writer is not one of seller and buyer but rather of colleagues--there's a sense of mutualism.

The commercialisation of this relationship can be summarised thus:

I'm having a birthday party and I make a cake for it. An acquaintance gives me a bit of help in making the cake and I invite them to the party. We have fun.

The next week it's my acquaintance's birthday. I help them make a cake, they invite me to the party. Only when I arrive at their party, it turns out they're charging for slices of cake.
