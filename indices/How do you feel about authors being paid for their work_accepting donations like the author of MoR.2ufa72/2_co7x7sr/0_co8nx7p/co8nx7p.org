I completely disagree. If there are two guys busking in the centre of town and one charges nothing for his music while another has a hat in front of him and a sign saying "Please contribute if you feel like this music adds value to your life" is the second guy an asshole because the first guy is giving stuff away for free?

Your analogy of the party is stupid. We collectively understand that being invited to a party means you're getting cake - and both people get invited to the party. A better analogy for fanfiction writing is: guy makes cakes, every week, for free. One day guy says "I love making cakes, and I want to keep giving people free cake, but if you like the cake, giving me a bit of money would make it easier for me to make more cakes."

You're not being invited to read fanfiction - the author is putting it out there, FOR FREE, and saying "I'll keep doing this for free but it's very labour intensive and I really believe in the philosophy this work espouses, which is why I've dedicated my life to working for this non-profit and I write things like this to convey that message. If you agree with what I believe or if you just like the work I'm putting out, paying money means I have more time and more incentive to create that work." You're radically misconstruing this situation to make the author whose work you admire look like a bad person for something he hasn't done. Don't be an entitled fucking asshole.
