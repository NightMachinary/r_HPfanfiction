I don't really mind if people give money to fanfic authors and I agree with your last paragraph here (and I'd note that the HPMOR guy has been pretty careful to avoid taking money for the fanfic and instead solicit donations to his transhumanist/AI stuff). BUT. Your analogy between fanfic and the films is preposterous. Warner Bros paid JK Rowling a huge sum of money for the rights to the films, she didn't just "sign off." She agreed to allow the film studio to use her intellectual property in exchange for some contractually agreed renumeration. Fanfic is a whole 'nother thing.
