The fanfic author uses other people's characters in the same way that buskers play other people's songs. Anyway, you're a Harry Potter fan. Did you pay to see the films? Because the only difference between them and fanfiction is that someone somewhere went "this'll be totally profitable for our film studio, let's get JK Rowling to sign off on it".

As for using someone else's characters and settings, the best fanfiction to me is that which takes the world created by the original author and explores it in a way that the author never dreamed. There are fanfiction stories out there which would be completely unrecognisable as such by the end if all the names had changed, but I read those stories because the characters had those names.

I think that kind of fanfiction can be considered far more 'original' than the hundreds of copycat books with a young orphan going to wizarding school which came out just after Harry Potter got big, but I don't think those authors don't deserve a chance to ask for their work to be compensated. You don't like a book? Don't pay for it. You don't think the author deserves some money? Don't give it to him.

And once again, we're not talking about an expectation of profit, we're talking about someone saying "Now I've got your attention with this work of art I've spent hundred of hours of my life on for free, I'd be very grateful if anyone who feels that what I've done has added value could contribute to this cause I represent".
