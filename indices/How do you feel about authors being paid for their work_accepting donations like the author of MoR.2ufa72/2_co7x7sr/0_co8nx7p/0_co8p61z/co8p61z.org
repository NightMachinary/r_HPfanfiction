Except your buskers are independent agents. You missed the point about community: readers are writers and writers are readers. Ideas are shared, refined; works are critiqued and revised. We're all part of the same club, no single fanfiction writer would be able to do what they do without all the others.

It's you who are radically misconstruing the situation. The offer wasn't "I'm going to do this anyway, you can donate if you want to say thanks, but it will have no direct effect on what I produce". It was "If you give X money by Y time you will get Z reward" -- a archetypical commercial relationship governed by a contract.
