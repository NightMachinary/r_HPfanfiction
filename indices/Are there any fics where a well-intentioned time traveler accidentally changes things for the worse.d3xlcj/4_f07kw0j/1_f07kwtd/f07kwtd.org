  Waking up in St Mungo's almost sixty years in the past, newly appointed Auror Ron Weasley is out of his depth. England is at war with the Dark Wizard Grindelwald, but he's more concerned about the threat of a young Dark Lord still at Hogwarts. Ron is about to learn a very valuable lesson in Time Travel, and the dangers of trying to change history.
