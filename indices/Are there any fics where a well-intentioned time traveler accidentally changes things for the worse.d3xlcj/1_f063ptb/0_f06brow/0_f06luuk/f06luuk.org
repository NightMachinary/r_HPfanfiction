They're not portrayed as wrong. If anything, they're portrayed as having made the sensible decision to protect their children. The problem is the main characters don't immediately understand that an alternate universe results in different causes, effects, events and reactions, and while Arthur and Molly fundamentally have not changed, they aren't the same people that the three protagonists once knew, because they've been through very different things. And unfortunately, the story is painted from our three protagonists' POV so it's similarly coloured. But as they eventually realize, "I can't forgive you because there is literally nothing to forgive. None of it was your fault, no matter how badly you feel about it." (Paraphrased)

In fact, I'd say it's more of a testament to how loving and wonderful they are that they tried for so long to make things right the moment they actually understood what was going on.
