Dodging Prison And Stealing Witches May apply; its a WBWL story where Dumbledore sends back his brother, the pseudo Boy-Who-Lived and harry goes back as well somehow (can't remember why) even though he was falsely imprisoned. In the past the two of them duke it out with his brother usually fucking things up and trying to hurt Harry while Harry saves lives and protects people.
