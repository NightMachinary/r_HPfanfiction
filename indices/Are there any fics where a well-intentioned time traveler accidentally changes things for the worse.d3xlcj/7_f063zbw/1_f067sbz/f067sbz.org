Very much so. I'm a basic, bashing fix fan kind of bitch, but... honestly the worst part was the babies ever after overtone. Be in harem to have best babies from Harry.\\
I like lunar harmony... usually, I loved the fablehave xover. But this story bugs me.

Also, the insistence that vampires are broken non people who have to kill is fine, but he based it off Dracula. Especially that Dracula needed to study harker to learn how to fit in to modern society, when a person could figure it out. As some one on the spectrum, who needed study guides to fit into the society I was raised in? One, oof, man. That hurts. Two... did we read the same Dracula? Because loads of bitten people get better. It takes lots of visits to kill them. It's like half the story.
