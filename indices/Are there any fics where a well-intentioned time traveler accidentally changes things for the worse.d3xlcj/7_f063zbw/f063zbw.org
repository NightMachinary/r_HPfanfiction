This sounds like a great premise and i wish i had a good recommendation.

The prompt rings some bells, i think I've read some unfinished fics that use this. The issue has been that 'things spiral out of control' is a very hard premise to keep the reins on. As the story progresses, they all feel the need to keep expanding the loss of control, adding threads to the story without knowing how to tie them together, and then the fics get abandoned.

There was one I read but abandoned for being bad. I dont remember the name but some of the elements fit. It had Trelawney, who was also a dryad and part of a harem, go back some 20+ years in time to become the queen of the Caribbean. There were 4 elemental items: a 'cauldron of plenty' that had to be cleansed of evil, the goblet of fire (which manipulative dark lord dumbledore used to enslave fawkes, making people think he was light)... And the author was angry. So angry. I remember being bored with how often they used 'stupid' and its synonyms.

Is this Linkffn(partially kissed hero by perfect lionheart) ?
