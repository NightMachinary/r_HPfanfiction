Well, considering that you did not specify it has to be Harry Potter stories (yes, yes, I know, there is the presumption that they are to be), I am posting ones that I like from other fandoms as I think they are good enough that at least some people will enjoy spending time on reading them:

“All But Name” (linkffn(6836473)), a Star Wars story in which the Jedi refuse to let Obi-Wan take Anakin as his padawan, and Obi-Wan decides to take the decision away from them and do what is right. For its faults, I'd found it to be both enjoyable and not an inaccurate portrayal of how such a situation could develop.

Then there is “Blazing Sun” (linkao3(2501546)), a still in progress and quite unlikely to get finished any time soon Final Fantasy 7 AU story that takes the existence of “soul bonds” and twists it into a pretzel that it then proceeds to set on fire. It's ... well, it has its moments, I liked and still like it, and considering how known (and often enough disliked too) the “soul bonds” are in this fandom I think it's a potentially noteworthy story.

Another one from the same fandom as above, “Off the Line” (linkffn(1295005)) is a highly AU story that basically exists to make fun of Cloud at every possible opportunity and see how the situation develops. Its state of completion is the same as the above one's, by the way. It is not entirely serious, but it actually does have a somewhat serious plot despite being pretty much crack on crack. A small word of warning, though: it contains slash (of the “two people of the same sex are hugging and such” variety), and while that does not bother me due to my lack of care about pairings those who see such a thing as disgusting and enough of a reason to discard a fic probably shouldn't even start.

For those who know something about the ロックマンX/Mega Man X series, I give “Impertinence” (linkffn(9325864)), a potential pre-X1 story about Dr. Cain and what drove him to do what he'd done. I consider it ... quite poignant, in a way.

From the same author, there is “One Link in the Cable” (linkffn(10455089)), a story centred around X and Zero with the plot being that Zero has gotten a bit bored and X genuinely tried to help. It has some action, some humour, and I think it is a refreshing read, and a bit warming too.

And then, going into the actual Harry Potter fandom, I can throw a few stories that I presume were not recommended very much if at all.

The first of those will be “you will bleed to death with the pain of it” (linkao3(3916129)), a story about a world where the people who are ... let's say important for your or your life, imprint their first words to you on your actual body. I think it is a very well-written story, personally.

Another one is “Coexistence” (linkffn(1097925)), a story that ... well, it's hard to describe it without spoiling more than I'd want, so let's just say it's about a ghost-esque Harry sent to the past. I quite like it, and I think you should give it a chance if the starting premise hasn't already alienated you.

Third on the list is “The Elite” (linkffn(5190766)), a Harry and Draco-centric story (that is not a slash) that manages to make the part of the epilogue when they nod to each other not only understandable but also a bit heartwarming. Just for that (and I do not like Draco as a person, I will add), I think it is worth it to give this story a chance.
