As I wrote in the first paragraph, as it was not specified that they have to be from the Harry Potter fandom and they were looking for stories that people perceived as worthy of recommending and didn't get recommended here, I'd decided to add those in case some people wanted such a thing too. So, in a way, yes they were kind of possibly maybe asked for, and I decided that as I'd also added the Harry Potter stories that fulfilled the requirements it's up to the people to decide whether to pay attention to or ignore the non--Harry-Potter part. And the people instead decided to be petty ... whatever, I don't really care.
