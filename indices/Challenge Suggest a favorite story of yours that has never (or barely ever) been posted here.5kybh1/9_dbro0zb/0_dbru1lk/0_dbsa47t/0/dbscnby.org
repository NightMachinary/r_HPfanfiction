I do have to wonder why you have -15 points for noting that the OP /technically/ doesn't specify Harry Potter fanfiction. We have had requests for fics from other fandoms here before.

Besides, even if HP fanfics were specified, 40% of your post is still precisely-on-topic. That's better than a lot of people manage.
