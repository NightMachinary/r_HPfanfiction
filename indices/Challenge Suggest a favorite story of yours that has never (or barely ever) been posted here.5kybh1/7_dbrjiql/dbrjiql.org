linkffn(4948767) Immortal Weapon by Azure the Dragonlady. Impressive to me because it's a Twilight crossover that I actually enjoyed despite hating Twilight. Seems to have been abandoned just as things were getting good, however. :( Pros include no pairing for Harry, no "kid" Harry, and no stupid insipid pranking or lame attempts at humor. Cons are a few spelling/grammar mistakes, and the aforementioned cutoff just as the plot was starting to get really interesting.
