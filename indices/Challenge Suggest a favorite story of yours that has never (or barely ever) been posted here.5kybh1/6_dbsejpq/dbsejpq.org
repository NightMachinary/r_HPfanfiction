One of the hottest PWPs I have ever read is the Draco/Hermione [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/172217][The Wrong Man]]. When I googled it, I only saw it on this sub once. Definitely worth the read even if you don't love this pairing. Also, it does not redeem Draco (I know some people hate that) and everyone feels in character. linkao3(172217).

One of my favorite rare pairing fics that also isn't on this sub much(at all?) is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4552488][To Do a Weasley]] which is a canon-compliant (EWE?) George/Lee slash fic set in their 7th year. It was really well written and also I love a different perspective on canon events (like Umbridge etc.). Linkao3(4552488)
