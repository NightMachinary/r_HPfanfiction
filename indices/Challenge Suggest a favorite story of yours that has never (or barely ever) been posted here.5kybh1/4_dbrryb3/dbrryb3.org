I have high hopes for "Keep Me Where the Light Is." linkffn(12206869) I really like what the author did with McGonagall and Kingsley in the two chapters focused on them. Gives me hope that there might be something to it once they get past the teenage relationship stuff that the last two chapters have dwelled on.

I also really enjoyed "The Last Enemy." linkffn(11962029) Something of a character study continuation fic with some very nice Harry/Ginny moments. Apparently, I have a type.
