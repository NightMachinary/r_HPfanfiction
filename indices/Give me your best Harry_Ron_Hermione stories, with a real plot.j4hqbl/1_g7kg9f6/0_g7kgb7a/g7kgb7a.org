  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  Five years have passed since the end of the war and against all odds, the trio have found their own bliss. Everything changes, however, when Hermione arrives home one Friday evening to find Ron with his bags packed, telling her that their three-year marriage is over. With rumors circulating about the true nature of their relationship, Harry and Hermione find themselves alone in their quest to understand the strange turn of events and with more questions than answers about where exactly Ron has gone.
