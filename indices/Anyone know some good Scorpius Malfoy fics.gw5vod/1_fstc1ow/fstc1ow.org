linkffn(Ignite by Slide) fits all your criteria. This is the first-book in a Scorpius-centric, three-book series which is considered one of the very best next-gen fics, and one of my favorite HP fics.

The first book is very different from the second and third books; they're all very-well written but in different genres. The first one is a pandemic thriller where a mysterious disease has ridden the world, and Scorpius, Albus, Rose, and three others are the only ones who haven't succumbed to it. The second is a global adventure-style thriller as this group of friends become involved in a larger uprising, and the third is largely a romance and conclusion to the plot introduced in the second book. The entire series has fantastic writing, complex and interesting characters including a fairly unique take on Albus, and a historical perspective to much of the plot.

I personally didn't love the first book but a lot of people like it, the second and third books are pretty much acknowledged as the highlight of the series.

linkffn(House of Cards by Aebbe) is a more traditional Scorpius fic and a four-book series, he doesn't have a relationship with Rose but his relationship with Draco is really well done and is a big part of the story. It's more traditional fanfic and not on the same tier of quality as the Stygian Trilogy, but it's fun to read.
