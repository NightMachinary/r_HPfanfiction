I haven't heard of fics like this... I'm interested.

I'm currently writing a story from fifth year on where Harry has disappeared so Dumbledore has to play smarter vs Voldemort as he no longer has a trump card. Snape teaches defence in sixth & seventh year. Harry is the main character, even though nobody knows where he is. I'm trying to do it from his perspective only.
