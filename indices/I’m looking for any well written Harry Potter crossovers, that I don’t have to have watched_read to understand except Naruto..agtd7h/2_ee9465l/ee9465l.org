linkffn(Something Wicked this way comes; Swords and Sorcery:No Route Back; Slowly and then All at once Again; By Courage and Love; Mystic Knight Online) The Eragon ones are fairly close to Eragon Canon, so its like reading the books with Helena(femHarry) thrown into the mix. Both start similar, but diverge in the 5 first chapters, mostly because they have complete different personalities.

The Fate UBW is quite easy to follow, there isn't anything waahh, so there's that.

The SAO one is the same reasoning as the Eragon ones.

The Disgaea one is just Harry summons a demon. I've never heard of the game before reading this and just finished it today, without issues.
