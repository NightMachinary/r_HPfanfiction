I quite like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6832255][Harry Potter and the Avatar's Return]]. Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]].\\
Both of these are crossovers with Avatar:The Last Airbender. Ninja Wizard has some Naruto in he first book but I wasn't sure if you meant Naruto as in none or Naruto as in you've seen it so I included it anyway.

Crossover with Avengers (and a Supernatural) I feel like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020][All Hallows Eve]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/212879][Misunderstandings 'Verse]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]]. The last one I'm not 100% sure how much Avengers knowledge would be needed. The first time I read it I only vaguely knew Captain America and hadn't seen the first Avenger movie but I enjoyed it.
