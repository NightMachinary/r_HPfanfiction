You can check out my RPF HP Crossover if you'd like!

It's complete, but not fully posted yet. I'm putting up about 2 chapter a week. It would definitely make my day if you wanted to give it a go.

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?

​

Also, I've been reading this HP/Daria Crossover, which I'm enjoying quite a bit. It has a fun writing style. I haven't seen more than 1-2 episodes of Daria and know basically nothing about it, but this story makes perfect sense to me. It's a WIP.

What if Minerva McGonagall successfully persuaded Albus Dumbledore not to place baby Harry Potter with the Dursleys, but instead place him with another of Lily Evans Potter's blood relatives: Helen Barksdale Morgendorffer? What would happen as she tries to place the Boy Who Lived with a young family in 1981 Austin, Texas?
