Only one that I have read is Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon linkffn(2857962). It is a crossover with Firefly. I had never even heard of Firefly until reading this and could keep up just fine. It's also quite fun. I'm currently reading Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg linkffn(10784770). Never played Mass Effect games and therefore I've had to Google some things every now and then. Otherwise it's very entertaining and well written enough for me.
