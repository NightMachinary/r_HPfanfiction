My three favorites are: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8462437/chapters/19386787][This Gonna Be Good byGstarshine]] which has femharry/Weasley Twins and is an Hp Marvel Cross Over

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6480364/chapters/14833387][Can Your Friends Do This by Watermelonsmellinfellon]] femharry/kakashi. Harri at first pretends to be a genie and later ends up being the big sister to the rookie 12.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10672002/1/The-Biggest-Toad-in-the-Puddle][The Biggest Toad in The Puddle by Tsume Yuki]] MOD Harry is born as Jiraiya's son.

Then there is: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a Baby? by SpoonandJohn]] If you like a dark cracky fic where Harry is Raised by the Akatsuki. It gots as crazy as one would expect.
