I read a short fic years ago where the older Harry only showed up a couple of times to comfort younger Harry when he really needed it.

I don't recall the name but it was very touching - no adventure, just helping an abused kid make it through a time when he should have broken. (I only remember them sitting together in the rain when younger Harry was stuck and no one came for him.)
