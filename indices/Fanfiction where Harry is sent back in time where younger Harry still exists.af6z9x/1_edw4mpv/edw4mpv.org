linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute).

The best time travel story there is, period.

It captures the urgency of a character who is actually desperate enough to attempt something as incredibly dangerous as time travel to defeat the most dangerous Dark Lord till date (not for shits and giggles like several other TT fics) extremely well. There's no wasting time here, no befriending younger versions of his friends to make their lives easier or any of that nonsense. It even manages to describe the incredible difference between the soldier Harry has become to the average civilian of the past at the very end.
