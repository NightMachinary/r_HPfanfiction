linkffn(A Difference in Family) has an interesting spin on Severitus, and is one my favorite ones that I've read. Updates are a bit slow, but the writing is good.

I'm also going to rec my own series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all sorted into Slytherin, there's politics (but no child politicians), and a decent chunk of world building. I'm currently writing volume four of the series.
