Both of these have Hermione leaving with Ron, rather than in Ron's place.

linkffn(Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum by White Angel of Auralon) was inspired by sbmcneil's story, mentioned earlier. I thought this one was pretty good.

linkffn(Phase Shift by Bloodhawk 248) is a crossover with Fate/Stay Night. I wasn't impressed with this one, but I'm unfamiliar with Fate/Stay Night.
