Linkffn(havoc side of the force) is imo the best Xover in this genre. It doesn't have your preferred pairing tho

Linkffn(revenge of the wizard) is another nice fic, but its with Leia rather than those you listed..

Linkffn(magic of the force) has multi pair with pad me and aayla and has one of the best dooku characterisations I've seen. It is a huge fic.
