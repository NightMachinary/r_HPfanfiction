Oh i've read your stories already(actually am currently in the midfle of this whole obscural arc you've set up. Interested to see where you take that), and am greatly enjoying them. I've always enjoyed Superman stories, and have always been interested to know how powerful a fully grown kryptonian with magic would end up. Although I have to disagree with the whole less magic resistance you gave him. The comics never say his magic resistance is less than a normal persons is. It's always been stated that he is /just as vulnerable to magic as anyone else/. Taking that into account, it would mean that a Kryptonian with magic would have all the same benefits as a human with magic. Sorry just the way I see it, and one of the few things I disliked about your story.
