In the second Book in the Last Mage of Krypton series (Book [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][4]]), Harry learns how to use Kryptonian Battle Magic which relies on manifesting the sigils of the 23 Great Houses of Krypton and deploying them in various configurations to adjust their effects.

The method is explained in-story (along with the limitations and dangers) and although Harry doesn't use it many times, the fact that one spell (Zu Da Ur) effectively creates a miles-wide magic-free zone causes considerable worry in-story.

Details of the magical system (plus some of the combinations) can be found [[https://www.deviantart.com/honorablebaldy/art/Worldbuilding-Kryptonian-Magic-681127769][here]].
