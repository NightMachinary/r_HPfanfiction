I mean there are many different versions of Superman, all with different ways that the writer writes him, but before the whole new lot of writers came in, and started massively changing things, Superman was originally not invulnerable to magic, it effected him the same as any other human. Now all these new writers take 'magic can hurt Superman' to mean it's like Kryptonite, and he's especially vulnerable, even though that was never the original intent, and that's the way I always liked it.
