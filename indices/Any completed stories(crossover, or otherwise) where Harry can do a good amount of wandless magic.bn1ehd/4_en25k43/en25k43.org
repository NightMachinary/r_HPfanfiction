Well, how do you feel about partially completed series? Book one of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is complete, but book 2 isn't. Harry runs away at age 5 and is adopted by the Grangers, and he and Hermione both learn a moderate amount of wandless magic (enough to trip an opponent and retrieve a wand during a duel, for example).
