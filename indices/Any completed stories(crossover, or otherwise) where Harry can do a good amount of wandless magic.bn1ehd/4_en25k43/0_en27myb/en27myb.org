By book 2 do you mean COS, if so then no. Like I said, I in general hate incomplete stories, but if storie got to at least the OOTP I could still find interest, but stories that never get past the TWT are frankly absurd, and of little interest to me, because of the thousands(literally) of incomplete stories i've read.
