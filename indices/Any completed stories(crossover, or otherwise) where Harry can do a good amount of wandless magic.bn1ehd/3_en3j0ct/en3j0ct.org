One I'm currently reading is called A Year Like None Other by aspeninthesunlight on AO3. Little tidbit if you do not like Snape then I don't suggest reading it because he is a main character but Harry does obtain the ability to do nothing but wandless parselmagic after an incident. I'm not done reading it yet and I know there are follow up stories. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072%22%3E][A Year Like None Other]]

Basically stuff happens, Harry nearly dies, Snape basically becomes his father because they learn to get along and like each other during Harry's healing time, Harry is blind and magicless for a long time before he heals in both ways, and Draco is a brother in all but blood and name. Also Dudley redemption!!
