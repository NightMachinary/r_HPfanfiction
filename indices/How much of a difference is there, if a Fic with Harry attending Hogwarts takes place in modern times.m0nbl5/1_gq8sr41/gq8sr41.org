I imagine there will be a lot more ethnic variety in 2010 than in 1991 in terms of the student population.

Also, I imagine stuff like Snape's behaviour would get shut down VERY fast. In 1991, mean teachers were not that strange. in 2010 a school will be crucified if a teacher behaved like Snape.

edit: also Malfoy would not be able to walk around and use words like Mudblood as easily.
