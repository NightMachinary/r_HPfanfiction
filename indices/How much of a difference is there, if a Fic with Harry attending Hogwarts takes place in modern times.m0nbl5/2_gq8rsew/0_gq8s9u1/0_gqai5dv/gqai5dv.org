Personally I headcanon that it is possible for magic and technology to work together, but there's a distinct lack of interest from the Wizarding World since it's muggle and there's going to be a genuine bias. As a result any attempts towards working with it are small "homebrew" solutions and nothing supported legally, though I have no doubt there would be an easier time to finding a solution in the 2000's-2010's as it starts to become necessary to have a phone and internet connection
