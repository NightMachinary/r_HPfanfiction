I mean there has to be some way to affect electronic stuff with magic, because I refuse to believe that the wizards aren't enchanting the CCTV to automatically censor any magic it records. Not to mention the Wizarding Wireless, which logistically needs /someone/ with A) knowledge of how radio technology functions and B) Enough genius to manipulate it on a deeper level. The fact that normal radios don't pick up the wireless seems to imply that either they use another mechanism to transmit the sound or the wizards found a way to make a section of the EM spectrum go missing without the muggles noticing.
