Honestly I see no reason why it couldn't occur in recent time period. The only reason it took place in the 90s was because it was written in what? Early 2000s? That would imply if it was written now it likely would have taken place in late 2000/early 2010s.

I myself am working on my timeline for a harry potter story that takes places during the feudal era. So instead of bringing my story into even more modern times, I'm taking it back a few hundred years
