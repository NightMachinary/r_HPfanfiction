But in a narrative sense, is it bad to be isolated from the world? I think it helps the franchise to be timeless and therefore can be enjoyed by future generations without any problems.

On the other hand, franchises like Percy Jackson will eventually become outdated and strange to read because it depends on a lot of meme and pop culture reference of the moment.
