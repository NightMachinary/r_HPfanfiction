Updating with technology - in the background for muggleborn, or perhaps integrated into the magical world - seems like the most obvious difference. How would muggleborn students react with going to a Hogwarts where smartphones aren't a thing? Where they're used to computers and the internet, etc.

On the whole, the canon plot shouldn't have major issues being put in place. The Wizarding World is a wonderful insulator for things like changing times -because we can just look at everything different between the 70s-90s and 2000s onwards and say that it's unchanged in the magical world. It being insulated makes it easier to not have to connect the dots between the two timelines as much.

There's also much potential for changes. I think changing technology obviously offers up a large threat to the Statute of Secrecy, in everything being far more documented these days. We can take the option of wizards being more silly, in which case secrecy would probably be untenable, or of wizards being more competent/serious, in how they'd deal with it.
