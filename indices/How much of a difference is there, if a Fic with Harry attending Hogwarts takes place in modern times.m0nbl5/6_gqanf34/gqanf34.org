I think there would be an even bigger rift in fashion, language, and studies. There's little to no information on what the magical world thinks on things such as women's rights, human racial issues, global warming, LGBT rights, and mental health issues. Those are the only things I can think of that would have a properly large divide, but we also have no idea if they are something that exist, as there is never any talk of it, or if there is it's a one-off thing.

There's working women, Dean is Black, Dumbledore is gay, Lockhart obliviated himself, and the Longbottoms are almost braindead. We have such a small scope focused on things with just Harry and his adventures, and so if Harry misses out on things, we will too.

There's no real tell of things like how outdated ideas may be, and as a result we just don't know. Does the magical world have trans people, same-sex relationships, therapy or psychiatry? Who knows! If anything, I think it would cause even larger tensions between magical and non-magical worlds. Muggleborns would be much more used to things being modern with vaccines, the internet, multiple forms of media, multiple sports, and multiple cultures being present. To go to a stunted and isolated school like Hogwarts which is full of people who are just used to things being the same as their parents had.

There's not much we know about the magical world and new innovations. We never know what kind of new spells are being invented or new potions being brewed for the first time. I think there's just one mention of the Wolfsbane potion, but that's it. Altogether, I think the magical world itself would fail to maintain the Statue of Secrecy due to their isolation and would reveal every community for failing to keep up.
