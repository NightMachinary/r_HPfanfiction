When I was a kid, it was always one-upmanship.

"I dare you to do X"

"I DOUBLE dare YOU to do X"

"Well, I TRIPLE DARE YOU TO DO X"

This interaction was revolutionised when one of us discovered 'googolplex' and later ended when we discovered 'infinity'. :D

There was never really a saying associated with the 'absolutely must accept' dares, just a mix of intimidation and peer pressure on top of the 'whoever knows the highest number/can be bothered to count that high'. I saw a lot of kids attempting nonsense like the 'lean in real close and yell' thing and so on in an attempt to leverage their social standing and general intimidating-ness to get other kids to do things.

Even so, it wasn't common. We weren't really a big 'dare' generation, I think (I was in secondary school a little under ten years ago), and I was the weird kid who didn't really get involved with anyone else beyond my precious books. :)
