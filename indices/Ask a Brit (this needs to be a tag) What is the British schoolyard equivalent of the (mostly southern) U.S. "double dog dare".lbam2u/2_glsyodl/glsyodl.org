Hi, British person here lol

Its been a long time since I went to school (I'm 20) but as far as I can remember me and my friends just used to say "I DARE you" with emphasis on the dare.

Like for example:

"Oh, go on, do it. I DARE you."

Again I might be wrong or forgetting something if it comes to me I'll update this. I'd wait to get other peoples opinion as different kids say different stuff. I'm from the North so people down south might have different phrases.

Hope this helps.
