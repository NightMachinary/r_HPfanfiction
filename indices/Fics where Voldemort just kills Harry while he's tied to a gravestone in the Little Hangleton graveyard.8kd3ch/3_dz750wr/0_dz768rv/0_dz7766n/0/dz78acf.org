His job /was/ to protect Harry. Dumbledore made him swear to this because it was the easiest way to secure his loyalty. Snape's primary aim shifted to beating Voldemort in the years after, even if that meant not protecting Harry.

Snape continued to follow Dumbledore's orders even after he accused him of raising Harry like a pig for slaughter. He spent his final year trying to protect the students of Hogwarts, and he claimed to save every life he plausibly could. Snape's morality and purpose might once have been beholden to keeping Lily's son alive, but that is no longer the case during the time of the second war.
