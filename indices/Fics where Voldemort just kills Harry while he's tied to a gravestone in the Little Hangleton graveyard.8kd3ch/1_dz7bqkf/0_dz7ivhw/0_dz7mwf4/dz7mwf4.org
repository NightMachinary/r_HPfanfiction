Nice plot.

I still get confused by it though so please help me understand.

Voldemort (V) shoots Avada Kedavra (AK) at one year old Harry, who has just received Lily's protection. This forms a shield which causes the AK to rebound on V. The rebounding AK splinters a portion of V's soul, which attaches to Harry thus making Harry an accidental Horcrux.

At this point, I presume that the reason the Horcrux doesn't take over Harry is because of Lily's protection.

Years pass by, V and Harry meet again. But Quirrel/V can't touch Harry because the protection remains. In fact, Harry uses this as a weapon to keep himself safe from Quirrel/V. I presume that it is also the protection that keeps V from recognizing that Harry is an accidental Horcrux.

V flees and for the next few years comes up with a ritual that will enable him to share Harry's blood. The ritual is carried out in Harry's 4th year. This enables V to touch Harry without experiencing burns. At this point, I think V underestimated Lily's protection. He thought that he had overcome it simply because he could touch Harry. But the protection was more complex than that. For one, V still didn't recognize that Harry was a Horcrux. He couldn't possess Harry completely without feeling immense pain as shown in the Order of the Phoenix (battle in the ministry). And finally when he fired another AK at Harry in Deathly Hallows, Lily's protection acted up and recognized that a part of Harry was still tethering him to life on Earth. This was the blood in V's veins.

That last part was what has been really wonky to me. I thought that Harry lived because V killed the Horcrux in Harry. But in trying to understand how Lily's protection worked, I presume it was that protection that enabled Harry to get transported to the dream dimension and make a choice. Otherwise, if it was simply V killing the Horcrux, then he and Harry should not have both temporarily died. I'm imagining that they would have both remained standing but Harry's scar would disappear. Now with Lily's protection:

V shoots an AK at Harry which does kill Harry. However because of both Harry's blood that flows in V's veins and the Horcrux, V gets killed, too. Harry gets to choose whether to ride the train or go back to life in the dream dimension. He chooses to go back to life. The Horcrux is left behind. Both Harry and V live again because of Harry's blood. At this point, I wonder what if Harry chose to ride the train? I imagine V wouldn't be able to get up. The body he formed in the Triwizard Tournament would have died. However he still has Nagini as a Horcrux. So he would probably have turned into a wraith again that could easily be destroyed once his last tether to life, Nagini, is destroyed.

After having written all this, two things have popped into my mind: 1) If all of the above were true, then the Deathly Hallows were unnecessary additions to the story. 2) Lily inadvertently turned Harry's blood into a Horcrux-like thing.
