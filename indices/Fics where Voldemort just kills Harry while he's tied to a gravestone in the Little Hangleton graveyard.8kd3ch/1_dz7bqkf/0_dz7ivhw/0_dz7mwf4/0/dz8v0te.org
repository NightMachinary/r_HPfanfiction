  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time --- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

  “I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”

--------------

Regarding this matter, I think the original DH has answered well enough. Lily's sacrifice and Voldemort's maliciousness had indeed turned Voldemort into the functional equivalent of Harry's Horcrux. "Neither can live while other survives" had really a double edged meaning, which was that if either survived the fight against the other, they would lose the ability to live (forever).

Yes, the Deathly Hallows were mostly unnecessary, but Voldemort's quest for the Elderwand distracted him from what happened in Britain, and most importantly Hogwarts. If he had been paying attention, Neville, Ginny, the DA, and Snape would have never gotten away with what they had done. Finally, the Elderwand ownership shenanigan provided an easy plot device to kill off Voldemort.
