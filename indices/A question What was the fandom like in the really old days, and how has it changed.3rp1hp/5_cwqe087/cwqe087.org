I'd echo a lot of what had already been said, but I'd add in that I spent the entire time between books six and seven SWEARING Snape killed Dumbledore on his orders. I thought it was so telling. Between the conversation Hagrid overheard in the forest and and the use of the word 'Please' I knew I had it right. Everyone told me I was a fucking lunatic trying to maintain his good name.

I'd like to take this official opportunity to say: nah-nah-na-na-nah.
