Why, the infusion of asphodel and wormwood becoming the draught of living death of course....

But really it was Snape's Worst Memory not making sense. Why is a dude who we've seen signs of an unhappy and abusive home life, a brutal violent young adulthood that he seemingly is making efforts to pay for, constantly being bullied and nearly being killed by one incident of bullying (which would sensibly be the worst memory associated with bullying) given a chapter with that worst memory?

Never mentions harry's mum, deranged lose-shit-out with Sirius black but not Lupin, reading waaaaay to much into scenes with Snape, wondering why Dumbledore trusted him so much and trying to solve that mystery was a big part of it. I also had a feeling there was some great Snape payoff to be had somewhere that included love. So much of Snape did not make sense to me while reading the series and Philosopher's Stone basically trained me to take nothing at face value (I did not see Quirrel coming). It's mostly subtext and fan analyzing.

Then you just go out on a really long limb.
