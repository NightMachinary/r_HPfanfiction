Part of the problem, I think, was that the books and the movies started cross connecting and infecting the canon perceptions of relationships.

I think most people would agree that for whatever reason (the writers gave Hermione all the good lines, cutting out plot points that made Ron look better, etc) Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had better chemistry on set. This could be just a general side effect of the purposefully awkward interactions Hermione and Ron were supposed to have, but whenever Dan and Emma interacted, it felt much more organic (various parts of HBP, cemetery scene in DH, the strangely added dance scene in DH).

So while most logical folks understood that by GoF book-canon, the Harmony ship was fighting upstream, it was hard to reconcile that fact with the better on screen chemistry that Dan and Emma had. It is made even more difficult by the fact that in the movies, Harry is the obvious hero and Hermione - due to Emma's attractiveness and the writers giving her the more helpful parts - pretty much became Hero #2 instead of a sidekick like Ron.

Also, let's face it. A majority of the HP relationships are rather underdeveloped. I enjoy that the books try not to focus on relationships over everything else, but for a lot of people, H/G and B/F and R/T had very little development or just came out of the blue. On that same token, while Hr/R obviously had the major romantic subplot (especially in HBP), it was easy to say that it /felt/ more forced than anything else.

*tl;dr - Emma Watson is attractive*
