It makes sense that Harry doesn't know a lot about it, but it didn't make a lot of sense to include their relationships when the relationships had no impact on the story. Bill/Fleur's cottage could have been replaced by anything, but Lupin/Tonks really had no purpose at all.

It's not a deal breaker or anything, but it feels like more like JKR inserted that more for the shipping fans than to serve the story in any way.
