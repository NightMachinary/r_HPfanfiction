No, they've calmed down a significant amount.

The pairing has always rubbed non-Harry/Hermione shippers the wrong way because it involves making one if not two of the members of the trio OOC, and it usually destroys the third member of the trio in the process. Not to mention Ginny. Any other ship that involves someone outside the trio still allows one of the two main pairings to continue to exist. For example, if you pair Hermione/Draco, Harry/Ginny can still live happily ever after. If you pair Harry/Draco, then Ron/Hermione can still live happily ever after. But Harry and Hermione destroys both of the two main pairings in one swoop and usually destroys the trio relationship as well.

Before the books were released, there was a minority (or at least I think it was a minority) who believed that either a) JKR was just trying to hide the truth from fans and Harry/Hermione would be obviously in the final book or b) JKR was a bad writer who didn't know her own characters. Whereas now, most people who ship Harry/Hermione (hopefully) know full well that it's not supported in canon. But they're able to enjoy it for the same reason that others enjoy Harry/Draco.
