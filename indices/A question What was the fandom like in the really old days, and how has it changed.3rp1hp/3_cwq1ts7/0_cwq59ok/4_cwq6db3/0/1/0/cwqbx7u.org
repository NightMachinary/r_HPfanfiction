You're right that it still changes the dynamic, but the trio was written in a way that accommodates a Ron/Hermione relationship without cutting Harry out completely.

In canon, there are multiple signs that point to Ron/Hermione, from their arguments in HBP to Harry telling Ron that Hermione is like a sister to him. So if you're using canon as a jumping off point, you have to orchestrate the transition from Hermione/Ron to Harry/Hermione. Which is naturally going to create some hard feelings. Best case scenario is that Ron is the one-time flash-in-the-pan boyfriend. But the more likely scenario stars Ron as the angry jealous jilted OC boyfriend who's angry at both Harry and Hermione. Within canon, Harry/Hermione don't actually have a super solid relationship in one-on-one contexts. Ron acts as a buffer. So when you change their characters to make them fit together and turn Hermione into someone who can make Harry laugh and connect with him emotionally, then Ron effectively becomes superfluous to the trio. He no longer brings anything to the table.

Ron/Hermione entering into a relationship /does/ change the trio's dynamic, but in a different way. The thing is that Ron/Hermione have always had their own relationship going. We don't see much of it because we're reading from Harry's POV, but it's absolutely there. Harry takes it for granted that the pair of them will always be together, but that's no small thing. There are multiple references to them having fun without Harry being involved, like when they came back from Hogsmeade "looking like they had the time of their lives." And note that in every year after CS, Hermione met up with Ron /before/ Harry did. Harry is used to eating his breakfast while Hermione/Ron argue or meeting up with them after spending the rest of the day alone. In a way, he's already used to playing third wheel.

And not to over-simply their characters, but there's a difference between two sidekicks hooking up and one of two sidekicks hooking up with the hero.

Hermione/Ron's relationship would absolutely affect their relationship with Harry. However, Ron/Hermione getting together doesn't create a schism in the trio like Harry/Hermione would.
