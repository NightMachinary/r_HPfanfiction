It just bites a bit, I guess, to have a group of close platonic friends as the main characters the whole way through, only for them all to pair up at the end. Although at least the books aren't quite as bad as the movies in that regard - I'm looking at you, sudden!Neville/Luna in DH II.

The romantic elements along with the suggestions of 'endgame' and what can then be read as foreshadowing (the 'rescues' of Hermione and Ginny in PS and CS respectively) can put a bit of a damper on the friendships they had before. As if, despite their skills and the equality of the wizarding world between men and women, Hermione and Ginny could ultimately only be seen as 'the girls' and as romantic interests of Harry and Ron. And as if the friendship that they all had, no matter how strong or crucial it was, could only ever be a warm-up or a precursor, or an interim stage between the romance between the characters. Them all being friends and that not being a big deal, despite being of mixed gender, was a pretty cool departure for kids' book characters, for a lot of us growing up at the time anyway.
