I may be too cynical, which is a complete possibility, but I still see them shoving their belief that Harry and Hermione are perfect and Ron and Ginny are shitheads down people's throats regularly. That's what I get for checking fanfiction regularly. Maybe it was worse back in the day, but I don't think there's been a drastic improvement.
