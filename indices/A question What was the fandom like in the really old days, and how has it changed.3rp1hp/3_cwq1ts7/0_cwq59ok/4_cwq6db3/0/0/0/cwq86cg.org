That can be it. Especially the age range of people growing up with the books and how they themselves were growing and changing too. So clinging to that could have been a salve.

I didn't understand way it turned out and don't understand Hermione and Rons relationship but it is what it is.

I haven't found many fics (now lost to me) where Harmony was there and Ron stayed an integral part of the trio. Which is a shame.
