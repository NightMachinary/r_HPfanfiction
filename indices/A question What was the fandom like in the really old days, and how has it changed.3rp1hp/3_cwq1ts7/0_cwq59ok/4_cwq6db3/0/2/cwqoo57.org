I wouldn't argue that the shipping wars have calmed down, I think they've just taken on a different nature than from 10-15 years ago (just take a look at the February 2014 reignition). Back then it was all about which ship would happen based on what is in the series. A more "scientific" approach than to what we have now. Now, we've got all the books, it's become more about which is the best pairing overall and preferences.

Which is why I think it hasn't calmed down. Harmonians view themselves as the shippers who actually stand a fighting chance against the "canonistas". The main contender to R/Hr and H/G is Harmony. Same as with the Snape/Lily shippers. There is that stamp of "recognition" from JKR, even if she disses both ships. You don't see anyone as +delusional+ vehement as the Harmonians in for example the Wolfstar shippers, even if it is still as fanon of a ship as Harmony is +cough cough even if i do believe something happened behind the scenes cough cough.+
