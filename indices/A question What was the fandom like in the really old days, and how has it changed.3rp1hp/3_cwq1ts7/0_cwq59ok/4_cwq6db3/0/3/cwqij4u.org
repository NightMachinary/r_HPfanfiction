I am a Harry/Hermione shipper still. (Though HONKS always seems to hold my attention).

When the books where still being written I truly believed that JK would kill off Ron. Thus making Harry and Hermione free of the trio dilemma of which you speak.

When it turned out that Dumbledore was the "big death" that pushes them to hunt the horcruxes I was crushed. I loved Dumbledores character in cannon and have never been a fan of Ron.

I know it's a children's book but there are some dark themes that would work well in Harry Potter that were never explored. Which could have been if Ron died.
