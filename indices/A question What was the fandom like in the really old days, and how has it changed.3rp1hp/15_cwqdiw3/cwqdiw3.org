I remember FictionAlley.org, and the discussion boards for ships on Fiction Alley Park. All the ships had names. I remember the Harry/Hermione ship was called the H.M.S. Pumpkin Pie. I started reading fan fiction in the summer of 2004, right before I turned 12, so I missed a lot of truly early stuff, but I do remember how intense shipping was, with everyone frantically trying to prove their ship was/would be canon. I was a pretty intense H/Hr shipper back then.
