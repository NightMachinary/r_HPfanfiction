interesting that no one has mentioned a pattern i observed: before the final book came out (and for a bit after), fics naturally tended more toward the what comes next variety. it was often an exercise in wish-fulfillment; we may not get a book for 18 months but let's fill in the blanks ourselves. etc

now that the blanks have been filled it seems to me that wildly au and prequels and crossovers etc are more prevalent (or were a few years ago -- there's not as much new stuff in general these days)
