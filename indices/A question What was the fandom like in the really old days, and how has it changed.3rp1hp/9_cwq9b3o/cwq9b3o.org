I got into fanfic after GoF came out.

Like 50%+ of long fic at that point was intended to be to end the series. We had a lot of time on our hands at that point. I remember a lot of trilogies for fifth through seventh years.

Shipping still gets a little touchy now, but it was fierce then. Shipping was a HUGE thing. People got into legit scary arguments over it in a way I've not witnessed since.

I don't know if I'm just not as invested in the fandom itself (still very invested in Harry Potter) or have just gotten older, but it definitely seems like there's a lot less drama. I remember when Cassie Claire (now a published author which still confuses my brain) got kicked of FF.N for plagiarism and a whole new website (fictionalley) happened basically because of that. Huge divides in fandom. That became the place to be for Harry Potter for a very long time.

I think a lot of the divides are also maybe gone because things are settled now. Everyone had their theories and a lot of people were very passionate about their theories (shipping or otherwise), and sometimes they didn't get along when their theories didn't mesh. But that's all sort of over. I don't know if FB or Cursed Child will have the same kind of impact, but I kind of doubt it.

But it was great. There was nothing like that community when we got new canon for the first time in years. Everyone devouring the book, discussing the book, writing fic around the book, developing new theories for the last book and desperately trying to figure out how to reconcile favorite theories that had been crushed.
