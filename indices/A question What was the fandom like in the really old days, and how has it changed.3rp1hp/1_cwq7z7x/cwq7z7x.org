I got into HP fanfiction during the 3-year summer and it was great, it blew my mind. I feel that was the golden age of the fandom, there was so much creativity, so many ideas going around. Authors had just enough canon to write whatever they wanted without being limited by /the/ /future/.

The years after OotP weren't bad either, it introduced Luna Lovegood, it gave Ginny a personality and it killed Sirius but it didn't really tell you what would happen in the next book.

Sadly, HPB happened. The main characters HAD to chase horcruxes in some way or another in the 7th book. The ending left no other alternative.

Multiply that limiting effect about a thousand times for the epilogue of DW. That thing made everything AU and not only restricted what could happen in the 10-year gap but it also killed a lot of the "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT" thing that motivates new fans into writing and reading fanfiction.

It's not that fanfiction no longer exists or that it's all bad now but the new books completely changed the way it's written. Even random AUs tend to include what happens in the books.

I think the most similar thing to the freedom of those early years is nextgen but I can't bring myself to care about those characters.
