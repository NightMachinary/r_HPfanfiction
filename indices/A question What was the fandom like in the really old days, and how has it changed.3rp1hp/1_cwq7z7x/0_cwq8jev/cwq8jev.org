  Multiply that limiting effect about a thousand times for the epilogue of DW. That thing made everything AU and not only restricted what could happen in the 10-year gap but it also killed a lot of the "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT" thing that motivates new fans into writing and reading fanfiction.

The only book I remember reading as it came out was DH. I devoured it in a day or two, at the age of nine. But I think that's why I like EWE so much - it says, you know what? Screw the epilogue, because it limits what we can do.

And I don't really like next-gen either because it basically accepts the epilogue as immutable fact.
