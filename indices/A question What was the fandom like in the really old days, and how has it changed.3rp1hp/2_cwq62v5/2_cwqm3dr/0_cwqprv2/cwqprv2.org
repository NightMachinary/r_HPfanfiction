I remember reading the books and hoping that it would end up one of two ways:

A) None of them would end up with each other, they would be the closest of friends and find love elsewhere.

B) They would end up with each other, knowing that the three of them were the only ones that would be able to be right for each other.

Obviously B was unlikely, and A ended up only being half right, but my main issue is I hate OBHWF. I don't know why it rubs me the wrong way, I like H/G, and I like R/HR, but having both bothers me. It feels too neat.
