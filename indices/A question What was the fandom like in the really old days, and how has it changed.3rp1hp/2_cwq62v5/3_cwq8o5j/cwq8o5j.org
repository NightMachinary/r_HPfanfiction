The only book I remember reading right as it came out was DH, and I was only nine then, and I didn't know about fanfiction, though I did sort-of LARP HP with my friends at the time. I got into fanfiction around four years ago, so I really missed the boat on a lot of that stuff.

Also, I love R/S so much.
