That was never a mainstream theory, to be honest. I think someone suggested it on a forum pre-DH (back when we knew curiously little about Dumbledore's family/history), and then someone else stumbled on it and shared it. I think it's only become more popular since DH came out, even though DH and the existence of Dumbledore's family puts the theory on shaky ground. I think most people just enjoyed the idea of it, and liked how well it fit together, even if they knew perfectly well that it wasn't true.

There was a thriving [[http://www.dumbledoreisnotdead.com][www.dumbledoreisnotdead.com]] community though.
