There was obviously a lot more speculation. It would take time for theories to germinate and make their way through the fandom. For example, the "Harry is a horcrux" theory was suggested within days of HBP's release, but I think it took a long time for people to come around to it. Most fans (including myself) were sort of instinctively against the idea that Harry was a horcrux, it just didn't seem logical in light of what we knew about horcruxes. But there were a few pieces of supporting evidence (why Harry had a connection with Voldemort, some hidden meanings in past conversations with Dumbledore, etc.). One theory was that Harry was the heir of Gryffindor and a horcrux (which would make him "something of Gryffindor's,") but JKR debunked the idea that he was Gryffindor's heir.

By the time DH came out, the fandom was probably about 50/50.

There was a lot of speculation about who was going to die. There were even people putting bets on different characters. This [[http://www.today.com/id/13819658/ns/today-today_books/t/laying-odds-harry-potter-dead-pool/#.VjwHTaK4CTU][article]] from 2006 lays the odds on a lot of different characters, and I think it's relatively close to what the rest of the fandom was thinking. A lot of people thought Hagrid was going to die. A lot of people guessed that one of the Weasleys would die, though many were hoping it would be Percy.

Shipping trends depend on when you joined the fandom. Even as early as PA, JKR was already being very clear that Harry/Hermione wouldn't happen, while hinting that Ron/Hermione would. By GoF, it was blatant. A lot of people figured that Ginny would come up as well, and JKR might have confirmed it. So there wasn't as much actual guesswork when it came to the main pairings. However, there were definitely a few Harry/Hermione shippers that convinced themselves that a) JKR's insistence that Harry/Hermione weren't going to end up together was just her trying to throw people off the scent, or b) JKR was wrong about her own characters and obviously a terrible writer. There was also a lot of Remus/Sirius shipping. I can't remember any other major ships that didn't sail.
