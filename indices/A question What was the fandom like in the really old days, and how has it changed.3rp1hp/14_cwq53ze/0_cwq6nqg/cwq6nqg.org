Just having fics that ignore Horcrux's and Deathly Hallows is refreshing these days. There is an upside to having more canon information though, for example:

- Arabella Figg was just an crazy old cat lady who used to babysit Harry until Order of the Phoenix. I actually started a fic with the premise that she reports how Harry is treated to Dumbledore early on. Dumbledore doesn't care so she decides to start training Harry in secret. Enter 11 year old Harry with a full background of magical knowledge minus how to actually cast spells.
