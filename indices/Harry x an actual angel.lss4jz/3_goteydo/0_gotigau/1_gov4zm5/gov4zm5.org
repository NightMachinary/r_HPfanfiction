Nope. In dresden files, fallen angels are still angels. They are not demons nor do they follow lucipher. All the fallen angels were trapped inside 30 silver coins called denarians by lucipher because he feared the fallen would try to take over hell for their own purposes. In a way, the fallen angels of dresden verse are a literal 3rd and seperate faction from and between heaven and hell.
