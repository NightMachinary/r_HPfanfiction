I don't think there's many "purely" hp fics that include stuff like this, because these usually trend towards repeating canon instead of doing something new. Try your luck with crossovers, especially with canons that include a pseudo-biblical fantasy theme (like Supernatural, Hellraiser, Constantine, etc)
