I agree with you completely. But here's the thing, let's say you're writing a 5th-year divergence, but the earlier years also have to be written to explain some differences, special abilities, and so on. The outcomes of the years 1-4 have to be roughly the same for certain important events to happen (Voldemort's ressurection, etc.) It's a problem I ran into when writing my own story, unfortunately I don't have a good solution.
