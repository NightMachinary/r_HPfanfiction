The only place I understand this is crossovers. Nothing frustrates me more than seeing a story that looks interesting to me, realizing it's a crossover with something I've never heard of, and then three quarters of the fic is suddenly inexplicable. I have enormous love for authors who go the extra mile to make crossovers accessible to both fandoms.
