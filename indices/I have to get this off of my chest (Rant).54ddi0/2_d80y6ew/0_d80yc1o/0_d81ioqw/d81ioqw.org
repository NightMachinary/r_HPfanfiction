Somewhat related:

Several fics start off with a couple of chapters telling the readers who this never-before-heard-of "Harry Potter" character is. You know, in case someone's been living in a cave for a very long period of time and just got out.

Then they continue with a description of the normality-obsessed Dursleys, and their appearances in long-necked, horse-faced and obese details. Then they usually describe Harry in stereotypically fanfic fashion, and finally surprising the readers with the fact that he's /not/ completely Dursley-approved normal, no, he's a /wizard!/ Bet you didn't see that coming!

It's also usually mentioned where his room is, depending on where the fic (hopefully!) deviates from and branches off of the canon story line. There are a total of 2 - two possibilities here. It's very important to inform the readers properly in case they were forbidden to read Harry Potter by their witchcraft-fearing parents.

Honestly, /nobody/ stumbles across a HP fanfic without any clues about the canon story. There's /so much/ that could, and should, be left out.

And don't get me started on the impossible-to-avoid Hedwig. She's all over Harry like stink on a troll. He /always/ ends up with Hedwig, even if bloody Voldemort himself has to buy her and give her as a gift to Harry. It's the one canon rail station that it's near-impossible to avoid. Not to mention her obsession with ear-nipping and cuffing various characters over the head while flying.

Canon rails. Canon rails everywhere.

I'm starting to appreciate the modus operandi of the Joker. I wish I could blow fanfics up and laugh maniacally at the destruction.

/Boom!/ Recover from /that/, Hedwig! ... aaand she's a bloody Phoenix...
