I don't need to read every single second if its the same. Which is where this particular fic went wrong. I or whatever readers don't need to know everything. If nothing is different, skip it. Tell it quick. The pacing will suffer, but honestly, what can you do?

EDIT: Also, most readers aren't stupid. If you explain things organically as they come up then you can slowly, and more importantly efficiently explain your world.
