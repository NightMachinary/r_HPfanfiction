Also also, if the writer adds events that were not present in the original series or that were but are significantly enough changed from the original version, then it's possible to save the pacing that you'd think would get skewed by rushing through events not to repeat them.

And also times three, switching the perspective to that of another character is also a thing that allows you to write about events that are not changed much without writing about the exact same thing; for example, writing about the troll debacle from the perspective of Hermione or, I don't know, Snape, could make things more interesting because it is not going to play out exactly the same as the narration will be coloured by the character's personality and thoughts.
