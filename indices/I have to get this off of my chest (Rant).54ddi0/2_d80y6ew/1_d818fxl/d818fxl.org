  but the earlier years also have to be written to explain some differences, special abilities, and so on

You have at least three ways out that let you avoid parroting the same stuff:

- Just don't write it. You can have information about things that happened characters earlier without describing them directly. The character can talk about them, think about them, write and read about them. I remember having few fics like that in my PtR, but I haven't read any yet and don't remember names now.
- Just compress and skip things that stay the same. For example On the Way to Greatness linkffn(4745329) does that. Though it really should be even more compressed.
- Show only differing moments. For example On the Wings of a Phoenix linkffn(3000137) does that.
