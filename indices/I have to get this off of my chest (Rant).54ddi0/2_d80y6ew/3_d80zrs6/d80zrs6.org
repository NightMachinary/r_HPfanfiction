This story just hugs the rails though, the worst part is that the author teased whether or not Sirius would die, and then killed him in the exact same way, and even Hedwig I think. The excuse was that it was an important character development moment for Harry.

If you're going to follow the same timeline, atleast do some things differently, such as the obstacles blocking the philosopher's stone. Does Ron have to sacrifice himself everytime? How do they get in the same position?
