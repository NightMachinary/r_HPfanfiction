Sounds like you were reading 'Looking Beyond' linkffn(9883718).

I personally liked it, though I do agree that it kept far too close to canon for a vast majority of it. It's been a while since I read it, but I know that it went into completely new territory after Hope/Elpis (Fem!Harry) defeated Voldemort.
