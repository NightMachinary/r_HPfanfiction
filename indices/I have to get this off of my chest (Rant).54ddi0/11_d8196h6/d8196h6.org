I hate this stuff, especially all the mental gymnastics that goes into ensuring that events stay the same.

For example there is Innocent series linkffn(9469064; 10093402; 10858061; 11732213).

The first pre-Hogwarts part had quite a few problems, but at it also have some interesting ideas and set-up quite a few changes which should heavily influence plot of the following years. Harry knows of the magic earlier, Sirius is free, they know about horcruxes, Harry befriends youngest Weasleys earlier, and certain character is set-up to end up in the different house.

But in the end there are barely any consequences, things get forcibly put into the story rails set up by original books. Complete waste of time.

Other example - The Serpent's Gaze: Hatching Snakes linkao3(3764659). Author of this "work" even asked for opinions on this reddit and I my feedback sums well what I think of those rehashes - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4f6eyf/promotion_a_more_ambitious_boy_slytherinharry_au/d27yo0j]]

Why would anyone write stuff like that is beyond me, I much prefer super Harry soul bond manipulative Dumbledore wish fulfilment fics (at least until they don't go into muggles being danger for wizards, which triggers me). At least they try something new even with repeating all those generic clishes.
