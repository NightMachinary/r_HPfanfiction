So far the only Fem Harry I have read and liked (that i can remember), was Effects and Side Effects (sadly abandoned at just under 500k). Its a multi (F/F+) so not everyone's cup of tea, but I think it was the "style" of Fem harry that made it so intriguing and interesting, since hes not exactly "Fem" from the get go, but rather via side effects.

I do feel like there was another but for the life of me I am drawing a blank now.

I have also found it hard to find any good fem Harry fics, and I think a lot of the time its because either the author does not stray far enough away from male Harry, or forces a Fem Harry for pairing reasons leading to mediocre background and writing.
