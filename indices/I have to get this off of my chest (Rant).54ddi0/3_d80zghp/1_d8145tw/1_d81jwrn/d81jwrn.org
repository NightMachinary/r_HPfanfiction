To be fair to the other side, though, Kenobi could have saved Ol√≥rin from getting pulled down by the Balrog, because that would not have happened had someone watched his back.

Whether or not it would have been better or worse from there on is anyone's guess, but that's a big enough change that almost had to have happened, and yet it did not because (presumably) the author of that story did not write it as an exploration of possibilities but rather because they'd wanted Obi-Wan to be their OC-thing in Tolkien-verse.
