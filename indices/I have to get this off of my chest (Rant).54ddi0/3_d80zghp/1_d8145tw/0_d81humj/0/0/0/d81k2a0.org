What can Obi do versus Balrog? I mean, with some preparation, he could devise a trap, but there was no time, and Balrogs go toe-to-toe with Mayars in Silmarillion. Obi ain't no Lesser God, direct confrontation would multiply him by zero.

Although, I could see him saving Gandalf by sheer luckily timed Force Pull... which would give us Gandalf for Anduin crossing... which would save Boromir... But would the Brotherhood still separate, then? If no - Rohan and Gondor are deeply fucked. If yes - why?
