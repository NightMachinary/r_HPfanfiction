To be fair, the only really big point of divergence I can see is the fall of Boromir, since I doubt Obi Wan can challenge Balrog without preparation and studying the enemy. But Kenobi could stop Boromir from going for the Ring, and thus Brotherhood would continue to Mordor unbroken. Olorin goes to Rohan alone, and while he can deal with this situation alone, the Pellennor Fields battle is catastrophic without the Army of Dead. Gondor falls and Orcs continue to the West.

At the same time, Frodo's mission is much easier and he completes it a little bit faster. Yay... I guess...

What would work much, much better, is if Kenobi came to Middle-Earth a couple of years earlier and... I'd say, joined Balin's Moria expedition. Now THAT would majorly affect the plot of LOTR and still lead to a better outcome.
