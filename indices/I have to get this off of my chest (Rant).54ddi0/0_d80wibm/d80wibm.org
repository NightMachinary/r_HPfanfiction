  over 700,000 words. Typically these all go into the win column for me

I'm the opposite. Long fics (500k+) almost never entertain me throughout the fic, so I avoid anything more than 400k words unless there are stunning reviews. The problem is that rarely does the author ever actually plan out 500k+ worth of content from the beginning (or near the beginning). Often, they get to the end of the original content they had planned and have to try and find a way to hobble together the next story arcs in a story that has already met its resolution.

As far as sticking close to canon, this is a common occurrence in fanfiction and just simply comes down to bad writing. Coming up with something new an original is tough, and some people aren't willing to put in the time to change canon appreciatively. Just close the story and begin a new one.
