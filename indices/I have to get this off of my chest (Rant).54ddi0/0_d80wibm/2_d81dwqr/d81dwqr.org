I agree with you. The only long series' I've genuinely enjoyed the whole way through is MurkyBlueMatter's Pureblood Pretense and to a lesser degree Kurinoone's The Darkness Within. Pureblood Pretense in particular is amazing at dropping hints or events that seem insignificant or irrelevant, but then resurface a year or two in the future in ways which make you wonder how it was possibly all planned out.

At the very least, most fics longer than about 300k words will slowly start losing my interest unless it's vastly different from canon.
