I completely agree with your rant. I find this an awful lot in Slytherin!Harry AUs. So for the Philosopher's Stone, the group doing the canon thing is Harry and Draco with either Pansy or Hermione, and they do the EXACT same things in the exact same ways the original trio did in the book. The absolute worst thing though is when authors lift chunks of text directly from the books and put them in the same scene in their fic. If I wanted to read the books, I would do so!

And often in stories like the above mentioned PoS AU, usually Harry and Draco are best friends or will have a romantic relationship later on so the author has the Malfoys friendly to Harry, which causes problems when the author gets to the equivalent of book 6. The author is not willing or able to come up with an original plot to go with year 6 so the series is abandoned after the 5th story. I see this all the time.

Now that said, I like reading Hogwarts Era fics so obviously I don't mind some canon in my plot. But instead of a word-for-word rundown, I much prefer to see canon as the frame for the picture that is the fic but the picture itself is unique. For example, I read a story that was original but included several canon scenes such as the Battle of the Seven Potters, but the scene was was written in the perspective of Hermione on her flight with Kingsley. Changing the point of view character in a standard canon scene is a good way to get some original story telling into a canon-inspired scene.

I have also seen a story follow canon in the background but the story itself is original. For example, there was a story where Draco still has to repair the vanishing cabinet and kill Dumbledore as in canon but Draco confided in Dumbledore and joined his side as a spy, with Hermione, initiated early in the Order, as his handler. So while yes, Draco did do his HBP book thing eventually, the journey along the way was different. Another example would be writing about the experiences of a student/staff member of Hogwarts within the time frame of the 7th book and show how the events of canon are affecting them.

So there are ways to tell a story and use canon as a guide without resorting to a straight copy with new names, but unfortunately, not all authors do this.
