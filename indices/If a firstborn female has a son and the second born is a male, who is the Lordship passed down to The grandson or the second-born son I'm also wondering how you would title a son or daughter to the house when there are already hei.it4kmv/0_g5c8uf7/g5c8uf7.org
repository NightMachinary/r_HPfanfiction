Depends on the system of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture][primogeniture]] involved. Traditionally:

First-born daughter would be heir presumptive until the birth of the second-born son. The second-born son, being the first son of the lord, is heir apparent. A second son of the lord would also jump ahead of the sister/grandson for succession.

If the heir apparent has a child, whether male or female, that child moves ahead of both their cousin and uncle for succession.
