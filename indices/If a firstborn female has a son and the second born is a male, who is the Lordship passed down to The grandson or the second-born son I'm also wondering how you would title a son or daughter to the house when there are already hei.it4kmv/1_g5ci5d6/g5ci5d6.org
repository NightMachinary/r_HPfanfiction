First of all, I want to specify that in Canon, Magical Britain does not have any Nobility. No matter what the Blood Purist may think and say behind closed door, all the Witches and Wizards are legally equals. Families like the Malfoy, the Lestranges or the Black can be considered as Bourgeois, and their wealth plus personal connections can still help them advance in life.\\
Calling themselves the "Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" was just a way for the Black to show how they considered themselves superior to others, even other pureblood. The term doesn't have any legal weight and the normal reaction of anyone when asked to call a Black like this should be to laugh at their face.\\
The term "Sacred Twenty-Eight" came from "The Pureblood Directory", a Directory published anonymously by someone (widly believed to be Cantankerus Nott) during the 1930's to list which family he believed to be "Still Pure". It's just a bunch of Blood Purism propaganda and it's not even accurate since the Potters (at that time) were Pure and were not included only because their name sounded "Too Muggle" and they were seen as too "Pro Muggle". Other families (like the Weasley) deplored their inclusion and proudly noted that they had Muggle ancestors.

​

I just wanted to say this because, since the story you are writing is obviously a Nobility AU, you are basically free to do whatever you want without caring for Canon.\\
Now, concerning your question, the first thing you should do is to write the rules of inheritance you will use:

- Are the women unable to inherit a title (French law)? Are they able to inherit, but only when there is no Son to inherit (British law)? Or are they the equals of men when it comes to inheritance (no example there)?
- It's more for Muggle nobility where titles were tied to a physical land, but are the Titles divided (like in Early Middle Age) or condensed (late Middle Age/ Renaissance)?\\
  As an example, if Lord Potter marries Lady Greengrass and they have 2 son together. With the first son be Lord Potter and the Second Lord Greengrass, or will the first son be Lord Potter-Greengrass while the 2nd doesn't have any title?

​

To answer your question, if we take a Agnatic Cognatic Primogeniture system (Females can inherit, but only behind Males like in the UK), the succession goes like this:

- The oldest living son inherit everything
- In the absence of Son, the oldest living daughter inherit everything
- If the oldest son married and had children, his children have priority over the 2nd son (in the UK, the children of Prince William are over Prince Harry in the Succession list)
- In the cases where there is no sons, and the daughter married and have children, the daughter with a son has priority over his elder without a son (if the eldest only has daughter while the 2nd has a son, the 2nd is set to inherit. But the eldest will take back her place the moment she has a son).

With this system, /the 2nd Son would be the one to inherit the Lordship/, even if his nephew is older than him.

Concerning your 2nd question, I think you should just not bother with it any title and just give the house they belongs to. If we take the Canon pairing, it would gives something like this:

- Harry, Lord of House Potter
- Ginny, Lady of House Potter
- Sir James of House Potter
- Sir Albus of House Potter
- Miss Lily of House Potter

You don't have to say "who" is the heir everytime. In an Aristocratic society, people "who matter" will always know who is who anyways (just like you don't have to say Lady XXX nee YYY).
