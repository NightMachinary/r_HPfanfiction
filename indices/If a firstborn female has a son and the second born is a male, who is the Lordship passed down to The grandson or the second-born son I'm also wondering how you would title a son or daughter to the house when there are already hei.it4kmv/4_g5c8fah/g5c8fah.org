I would suggest making the heir be whoever is considered more worthy, which has some canon precedent. Sirius was disowned (ish) in favor of Regulus, until they the younger died and the estate reverted back to the firstborn.

One fic has Tracey Davis as the second born (illegitimate affair with a muggleborn), but her trueborn brother is an idiot. The brother will get the title, but be a figurehead. Tracey is going to inherit all the business authority and really run the family.

Wind Shear has Orion decide he endorses Andromeda and Ted, but 'Tonks is no kind of wizards name', and makes Ted become a Black. And there's several fics where Tonks is made Black heir instead of Harry and she grudgingly become Nymphadora Black.
