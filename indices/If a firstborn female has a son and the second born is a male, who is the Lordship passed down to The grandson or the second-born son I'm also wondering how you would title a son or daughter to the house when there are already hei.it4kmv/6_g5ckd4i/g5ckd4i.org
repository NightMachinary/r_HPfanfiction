I would use the title of Heir Apparent for those designated as the Heir of the House, and Heir Presumptive if there isn't a apparent heir. Perhaps use scion as a less formal title.

In regards to who would the lordship pass to, think of other ways the lordship passed on. Perhaps it's the oldest Male relative, or the oldest child of theres. Are you adamant on a male being the Head of the House? Look into primogeniture and the other types of how a lordship pass down. Think on the genders and how transgender heirs may work, or if the lord goes from male to female and whether they stay as head. Think on non-binary members of the house and other genders. Maybe magic plays a part and who ever has the most comparable magic to the lord. Maybe genetics? The person who is most genetically similar to the lord could be the heir.

I would maybe have a system where each house decides who is heir by the lords word. Some conservative families may have the first born son, while progressive families may have the firstborn child.

Think outside the box if you want a really good story. Having the eldest son for all houses, regardless of preference or whether the house is progressive or conservative ( often called dark, light, and grey houses in stories) Seems a bit of a cheap shot. Look into how inheritance of titles of the past worked, how the celts, Roman's, Vikings and more passed down titles and such.
