Since canon didn't tell us, you could assume magical Britain has the same system as muggle Britain, or you could get creative and make up something new. Different cultures have had all different systems.

Something I haven't seen explored yet in this thread is the issue of legitimacy. Does the son of a lord have any legal right to inherit, if he was conceived on the wrong side of the sheets? What if he's older than the son whose parents were legally married? Different cultures handle this differently.
