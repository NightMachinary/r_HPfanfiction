Extended canon had a female minister in the 18th century IIRC. How much that says about the universe in general is a different question. It could be an utopian ideal, or it could be an exception for an outstanding person. Or some weird shenanigans like you see in mediaeval history of Eastern Europe, where a Queen could not rule but a woman still could if she styled herself King rather than Queen.

Homosexuality is a bit difficult to judge IMO since the very concept of sexual orientation only really came to be in the 19th century. The Romans for example did not care where you sticked your dick in since fucking was considered manly and being fucked being feminine.
