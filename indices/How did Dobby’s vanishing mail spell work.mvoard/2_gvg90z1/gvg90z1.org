Hmm ... while I normally like powerful magic, a "redirect all mail to Harry Potter to Dobby"-spell feels /too/ powerful. Or perhaps, too simple? It shouldn't be that /easy/, anyway. IMO.

I wonder if Dobby mightn't simply have done the old-fashioned thing: We know House Elves can stay hidden (or, at least unnoticed), so I'm thinking he spent his days hanging out at Privet Drive, and summoning all incoming owls and stealing their letters.

And the Malfoys were wondering why, during the summer of '92, all their salons wanted dusting and their shoes polishing and dinner was late Â°_^

But perhaps Dobby /did/ invoke a letter-collection charm over Privet Drive. Perhaps that's a skill House Elves have, since they need the owls to leave the letters in one place, so they can present the post to their master at breakfast. Either way, though, unless you make Hedwig a super-owl, she's just a regular post owl, so whatever Dobby did should work on her as well as on any other post owl.
