Perhaps, that's a good point but it seems like a semi-difficult task to actually find the bird in order to intercept it. I was thinking maybe he uses some sort of House Elf magic that either redirects every letter with Harry's name to him (so the owls show up at Malfoy manor) or maybe just some sort of teleportation spell and every letter addressed to Harry just disappears from the owl and shows up in Dobby's possession.
