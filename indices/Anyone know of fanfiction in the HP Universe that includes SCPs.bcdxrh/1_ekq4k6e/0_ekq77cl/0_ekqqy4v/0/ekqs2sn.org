Mostly yes, except for one thing. SCP was originally a single creepypasta (from 4chan actually, iirc) about the containment of some supernatural monster, then it spawned more of the same type, which then got codified at scp-wiki.net. The game was a fan-game of this site, taking place within the "SCP foundation", which is the name of the institute, where "scp" stands for secure-contain-protect. Aside from that if you're interested I think the best way to understand it is to check out the entries in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/heritage-collection-arc][this page]] since they're the ones "everyone" agrees on and are the most famous.
