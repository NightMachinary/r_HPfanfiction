Okay, so SCP is the name of a game that has a community of fans that write stories and draw pictures and whatnot about the canon; and the community has decided that all the fanon IS canon, so expand apon it to your hearts content? Interesting.

I'd describe it as an Omniverse of canon thats identity is set by the public (much like the fanon of everything else). It's based around a world where artifacts or creatures appear from somewhere Beyond and there are multiple groups with different interests in containing that stuff. Defense or Profit and so on.

Okay. But tell me, what does SCP stand for? The wiki didn't tell me at a passing glance. It told be that these creatures and whatnot are Called SCPs, and so are the fan made stories, but what does SCP actually MEAN?
