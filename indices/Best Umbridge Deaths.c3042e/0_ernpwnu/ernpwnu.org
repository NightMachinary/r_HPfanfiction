  “How did you kill her?”

  “I sneaked into her office, ambushed her while disillusioned. I used a Full Body-Bind Curse on her, then beat her to death with her own blood quill, transfigured into a golf club. Before the death blow, I obliviated her, so even if she became a ghost she'd not be able to reveal me. Then I vanished the body.”

  Hermione felt a shiver run down her spine. Extended answers under Veritaserum were very uncommon, as far as she knew. Allan must have wanted to tell this story. But he spoke of a ‘death blow', as if... “How often did you hit her before you killed her?”

  “I don't remember.”

  She winced. “What did you do to her before the death blow?”

  “I smashed her limbs, broke every bone in them, crippled her. Then I broke her hips and ribs, crushed her shoulders. I spared her spine, so she would live longer.”
