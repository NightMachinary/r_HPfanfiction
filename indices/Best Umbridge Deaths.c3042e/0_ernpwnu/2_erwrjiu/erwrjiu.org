I like the premise of Starfox5's fics, but this line ruined reading Divided and Entwined, along with the arbitrary love triangle.

"But she was a Gryffindor because she was braver than she was smart - and she was the smartest witch at Hogwarts."

But man, Starfox5 really does a great job with the ensemble. The OCs are usually interesting, everyone but Snape is treated well.
