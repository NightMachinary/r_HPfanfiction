It's been a while since I read it, not sure.

Now that I think about it, linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is much better if you want brutal deaths of baddies (elder Malfoys and a bunch of other death eaters die pretty quickly, Draco only lasts about half of the fic). Or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) if you prefer them completely ruined instead of dead.
