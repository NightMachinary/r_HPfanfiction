"They Shook Hands" deals with a Harry who accepted Draco's friendship at Madame Malkin's and consequently is sorted into Slytherin. It's an excellent series overall and there are six fics for the appropriate years. The only downside is that it seems we won't be getting year seven, but for how much content there is, it's worth it.
