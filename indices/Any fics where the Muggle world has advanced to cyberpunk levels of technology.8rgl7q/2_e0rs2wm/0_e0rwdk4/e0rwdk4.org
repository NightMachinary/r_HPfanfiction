Actually, amusingly I would say the opposite is happening, the magical society in this fic is actually magnitudes more advanced than the muggle one, and it looks to me that muggle society advances in technology are partially due to bleedoff from the immense power of the magical revolution that occurred in this fic.

I actually quite like premises like these, because when you have power to bend reality of course your society would be more advanced.
