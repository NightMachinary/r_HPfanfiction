If you like d&d, there is this fic called hsrry potter and the d20. Its about a player character transported to potter verse, where both thematics clash. It makes fun of both worlds without bashin, has some of the best hermione, ron, draco and snape banter I had read so far, its very informative about the mentality and habits of munchkins. It stopped updating in 2015, but the author returned this January with a new chapter, so... hope you like it.
