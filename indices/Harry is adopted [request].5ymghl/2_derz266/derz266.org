Well, there's "When in Doubt, Obliviate!" which has Harry being adopted by Lockhart, of all people. It's written by the same author who wrote /Oh God, Not Again!/ which is arguably the funniest of the Peggy Sue fics.

There's also "The Butterfly Effect" where Kingsley and Mad-eye adopt Harry. (YMMV on this one. Its premise is great...but execution is...debatable. The author filibuster is strong with this one)
