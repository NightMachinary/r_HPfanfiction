I read it a long time ago, so the details are fuzzy. But I remember it was badly written in that Harry shared almost no character traits with cannon Harry. His different upbringing could not account for /that/ much change.\\
Most of details of the book, as I recall, were about Harry's romance with Hermione, in addition to every gift Harry bought for everyone's birthdays, and a lot of weird details about fancy meals, outfits, and dates.

But the creepiest part is that the author took the ship to full on sex, yet the characters were still only, like 12 years old. I imangined an adult writing about these two children having sex (while their parents celebrated) and it really creeped me out. I always have secretly prayed that it was written by a minor, because that would make the whole thing a little less creepy.
