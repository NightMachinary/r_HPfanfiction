Harry is adopted/discovered by squib relatives of the Black family in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][*Growing Up Black*]] linkffn(6518287) which is unfortunately unfinished. But it's a fun ride up and till that point.

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][*Hail Odysseus*]] linkffn(10645463) in which he's raised by Grindelwald. It goes about as cockeyed as you'd expect. Highly encourage a reading of this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][*The Reclamation of Black Magic*]] linkffn(12058516) is not for everyone, but those that enjoy it /really/ enjoy it. Basic summary: Dorea Potter (as James' mother before JKR jossed this) survives to take Harry from the Durseleys. Things change from there. Massively.

Then there's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][*no place like home*]] linkao3(4308786) in which Harry is raised by Hogwarts after Petunia rejects him. It's a beautiful story, and I really can't do it any justice other than to say that Hogwarts bleeds back onto Harry in a way that being part of a magical school only can.

Finally, [[https://media.tenor.co/images/d0d548db13df7bb5856aeaca5cf48ef6/raw][like any good pimp]], I have my own story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][*The Rezidentura*]] linkffn(12334664) in which Harry is raised by Natasha Romanoff - the Black Widow. How does both the Marvel and Harry Potter universe change by them being present in each other?
