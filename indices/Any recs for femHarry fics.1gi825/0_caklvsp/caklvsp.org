There are plenty of fem!Harry fics, but only about 1% of them are well-written, and fewer that really do something interesting with the premise. Three years after initial publish date and the painfully incomplete Butterfly Effect is still the best of the lot.

Equal and Opposite is excellent. It doesn't really fit into the traditional fem!Harry niche in that it focuses on Harry, rather than fem!Harry, but it's still absolutely worth a read.

Alexandra Potter is good... but it would be a lot better if it wasn't the author's soapbox for explaining their personal take on the intricacies of magical theory.

Question to OP: Do you have a preference between genderswap and genderfuck?
