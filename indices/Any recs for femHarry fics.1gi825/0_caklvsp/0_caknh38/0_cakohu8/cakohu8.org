*Genderfuck* is an umbrella term used in conjunction with filling an established gender role with a character of the opposite gender. In the case of Harry Potter, a genderfuck fic might exchange the Boy-Who-Lived for the Girl-Who-Lived. AKA Harriet/Lily/Rose/whoeverthefuck is born a girl.

*Genderswap* is a highly specific term used to indicate that an established character's gender has, for whatever in-story reason, been 'swapped'. AKA Harry, an established male, /becomes/ female.

Genderfuck is sometimes used to describe genderswap situations... but that's generally a misuse. Genderswapped characters typically still self-identify as their original gender after the fact, thus no genderfuck has occured.

Hope that helps.
