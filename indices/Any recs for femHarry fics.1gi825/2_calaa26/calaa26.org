The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Miss Potter C2]] is a good resource for this, in that it has the most followers of a C2 in this vein and is still being updated. The trick is filtering out the shippy insanity. I'd suggest skipping any that list primary characters of Snape, Malfoy (either) or Sirius Black. Or Tony Stark (something of a recent trend in cross-overs).

I'd also specifically recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4488250/1/Steps-Far-From-Paradise][Steps Far From Paradise]]. Though it's a story that might never see completion, the character interplay is worth a look.

Oh yeah. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/wordhammer][I]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][wrote one]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6844334/1/The-Spiral-Path][too]].
