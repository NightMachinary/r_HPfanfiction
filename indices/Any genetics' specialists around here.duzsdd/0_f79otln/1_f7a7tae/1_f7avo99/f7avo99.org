Yeah, I guess that would happen if all of the chromosomes of the other parent were replicated. However, I would again imagine that it is not that simple.

Edit: that was a lie, you'd end up with two sets of all genes from one parent, which would include some of their own recessive alleles. You'd not be an identical copy, you'd have DNA that could have resulted from their parents. You'd still die because your genetic code has changed so much that when you start producing new cells, they are not compatible with the new body, so the immune system attacks them. It's similar to organ donations in that way.
