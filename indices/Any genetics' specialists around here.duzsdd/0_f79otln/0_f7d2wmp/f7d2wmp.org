In theory it would probably be easier to slowly add a third persons genes to start to change your cells rather than deletion of other genes. This would still be an incredibly difficult and dangerous long process, but I think it's more likely possible.

In an HP context this could make your blood â€˜cleaner' by adding extra pure blood genes in.
