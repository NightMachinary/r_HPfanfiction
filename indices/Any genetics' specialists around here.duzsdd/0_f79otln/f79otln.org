I'm not a genetics specialist, but if you were to remove all the genes from one particular parent, you would, of course, immediately die. None of your cells would be able to replicate or synthesise proteins, because all of your cells would only have 23 chromosomes (though I imagine it's not that simple).

If my secondary school biology knowledge is sufficient, then all of your cells would essentially be like gametes, except for red blood cells, which have no nucleus.

TL;DR you would die.
