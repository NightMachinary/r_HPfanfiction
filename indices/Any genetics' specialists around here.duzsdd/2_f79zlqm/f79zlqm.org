Absolutely not a geneticist, but based on what little I know and the other two replies, if you must force HP blood magic and real-world genetics into the same box, I would think something more like a magical adoption ritual would make more sense.

In effect, using blood magic you replace the 'mud' with the blood of a suitable pureblood, ideally of the proper gender.

So for instance, if Snape wanted to be ritually purified before / while joining the Death Eaters, he could have Abraxas Malfoy's blood used to replace Tobias Snape's, making him effectively the union of Eileen Prince and Abraxas... and therefore Lucius's younger half-brother and Draco's uncle.

If real genetics took effect, he would then slowly start to show Malfoy-esque traits, to whatever extent those are different from what he inherited from his father.

Note that in theory, if this were possibly, it could be done twice to uplift an actual Muggle-Born. Though why anyone would do such a thing, or why a Muggle-Born would want it done, is another matter.
