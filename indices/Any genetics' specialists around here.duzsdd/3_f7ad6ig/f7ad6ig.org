  Like, a half-blood undergoes the ritual and afterwards is a pureblood since they are now "untouched by filth".

The whole point of the Harry Potter series is that there is no objective measure of superiority that Pureblood wizards hold, and in fact the most powerful actors in the narrative (Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape and Harry) were all half-bloods.

  My question is, what would actually happen to that person, taking into account real genetics, if that ritual actually existed?

Normally, things that attack and erase the nucleic DNA of an organism's cells are considered carcinogenic. Cancer would probably be the main results of any ritual that attempts this.

If there actually were a ritual to do this, it would be up to the author to determine effects. A complete body transformation? A personality transition as well? In the Harry Potter universe, souls are shown to exist after death as well as an afterlife. This would suggest that personality and personhood are not a function of the body, so the person would probably remain the same in terms of personality and personhood. I'm thinking of the pupa stage of a holometabolous insect right now.
