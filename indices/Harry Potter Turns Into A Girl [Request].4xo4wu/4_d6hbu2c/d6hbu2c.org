Harry awoke and stretched, wondering why he felt tight across the shoulders.

Then he saw it as he slid out of bed. His boxers slid right off his much too trim hips and his pride and joys were gone and his pectoralless chest now had breasts that rivaled Hermione's, pressing out his Gryffindor tee. He noticed long red hair swinging out in front of his eyes.

He screamed then grabbed his jeans from the night before, absentmindedly comparing 'his' to what he had seen of Tonks's: 'he' had more hair down there than she had had.

His door flew open and Sirius stared in shock, his "HAR---" cut off as he was hit and slammed backward to the ground by Harry who immediately began shaking him, straddling 'her' godfather, giving him mild head trauma as he screamed at him to change 'him' back.

"Wow, you're gorgeous," Tonks said to an angry Harry who was sitting on his bed, hiding under blankets.

"I'll give you you a concussion too," 'she' snarled.

"Remus told me about the new metamorph test. You're about my level. This should be interesting. Strip down, let's see what we're working with."

Harry scowled but did as told. Madam Pomfrey had already made a house call, filling him in on what Tonks was likely to have to do to help him get back to his real body.

She Resisted the urge to comment on 'his' new, and strangely alluring, fast hourglass figure. Then she couldn't help it. "Your bum is actually less cute than when you were a boy."

"I'm still a boy!" 'He' hissed.
