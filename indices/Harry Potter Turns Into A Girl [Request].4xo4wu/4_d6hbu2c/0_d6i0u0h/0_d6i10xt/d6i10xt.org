A vignette from my darkness!harry story. Scenes i wrote---chapter 43 in linkffn(anthology broken pottery) I think---for later as i wrote the original version---also in the anthology under harry potter and the darkness within---but most of those won't actually be used, especially that one, in the new version: linkffn(darkness ascendant).
