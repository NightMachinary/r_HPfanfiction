Hmnnn as someone who loves these I'm not sure how to explain the appeal for anybody else. Personally I'm a translady and I'll admit I do find it entertaining to see people thrown into random situations like this.

Honestly I think it's interesting to see how a character might cope. I mean all the ever day things people take for granted suddenly become an adventure. It can add a layer of AU while trying to keep things the same. That and if makes a character try and delve ivy who they are as a person regardless of their outward appearance. This is also why I love creature inheritance stories
