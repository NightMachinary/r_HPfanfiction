So, bit of a Dragon Age nerd incoming.

An option to keep the darkspawn a threat but secret from the muggles is have them be "hungry" for magic. Like how canon darkspawn follow an Old God's call, HP darkspawn are drawn to magic. The Archdemon or equivalent could be the stronger song, but the wizards be secondary.

​

If you want to go down the HP Blood War plot path you have a couple options:

1. Voldemort plays on the Pure blood Demon fears. Specifically the "logic" (how accurate this is is up to you) muggleborn are more susceptible to demons because they aren't taught from birth to fear their dreams.

  -- Have muggleborn be unafraid of the Fade/Spirits in a similar vein to Solas.

  2) He plays on the Chant of Light. Specifically the part that says the Maker will return when His Song is sung from every corner of the world.

  3) Plays on the stereotypical pureblood ego ("These upstarts are changing your way of life, opening the door for demons and abominations to walk the land")

  4) The Voldemort purebloods are more like Tevinter than not. "I see your blood magic laws, but I've always felt they were more like guidelines."

Unrelated to any of the above plots specifically, but you could have Voldemort be a Darkspawn/Magister Sidereal/Ghoul along the lines of Corypheus/The Architect. To hide this you could have him either work through proxies (like Sampson and Calpernia(?) in Inquisition), or have a glamor. This would allow you to have Dumbledore use the Grey Wardens against him (additional possibility, have Dumbledore be a Warden Commander).

No one would believe that Voldemort is a Darkspawn because he's not

  A) a mindless drone who's only plan is ATTACK or DIG

  B) There is no Archdemon or Blight

Hope that helps
