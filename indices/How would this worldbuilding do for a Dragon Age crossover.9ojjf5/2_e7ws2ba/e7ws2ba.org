Could Demontors or Nendu be Darkspawn instead? An army of dementors seems just as terrifying as darkspawn, while also keeping characters like Flitwick around.

I don't see why Qunari couldn't be around. They honestly seem like a blend between the strength of Giants and the culture of centaurs, no? Maybe they're a North African/Central & West Asian species that lives in mostly desolate areas like the Sahara, keeping to their clear influences from in Game?
