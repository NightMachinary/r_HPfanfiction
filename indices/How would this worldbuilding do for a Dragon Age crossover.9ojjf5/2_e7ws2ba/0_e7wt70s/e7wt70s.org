Dementors definitely make sense as Darkspawn, the reason I didn't list them was that I thought the Dementors work really well as Despair Demons. Your point about Flitwick is something I hadn't considered.

As for Qunari, your idea is far better than any I've come up with. The only complication potentially is that no one really knows where the Qunari come from, and even the Qunari themselves don't really understand it. That would be a little trickier to pull off in the setting of 20th century Earth.
