I mean, you could remove that whole aspect, have all the sentient humanoid races have similar backgrounds? A throwaway line about "qunari, centaurs, giants, and goblins all appeared" appeared. It's magic you know, you can throw some of that shit on it and make it work.

You could browse through 'fantastic beasts and where to find them' to find some kind of nasty beastie that suits your darkspawn idea, cause the dementors as despair demons is pretty cool tbh.
