Fred and George's attempt to get past the age line in GOF sends them back to marauders era. Their incorrect information (at this point they still believe Sirius is a traitor and Peter's the hero) help contribute to creating a stable time loop. For example:>! After the twins are interrogated by Snape, Snape learns that he does not become a Death Eater and Lily dies on Halloween 1981, so Snape becomes a Death Eater to try and prevent Lily's death.!<
