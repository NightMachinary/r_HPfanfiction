The only did that I know of off the top of my head is !linkffn(under the veil) where Sirius and an carry on is thrust into the end of third year, Sirius has no clue about horcruxes, although due to plot (& remus) they find the locket pretty quick. Canon divergence as of the third chapter, and involvement of a non-daphne slytherin that is Cassius Warrington. It focuses 9n the perspective of a Sirius Black and Sans "Ian" Skelton, as they infiltrate Hogwarts, hunt down a yet unknown number of horcuxes, and slay Voldemort.

Pretty good fic, avoids tropes and common failings of both fandoms.

No bashing, a powerful sans, but with some crippling restrictions, a promising side plot, and in-charactrr interactions.
