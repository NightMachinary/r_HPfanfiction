The closest thing I've found to Miranda Flairgold's work is a magic story that is a fully original fic--Mother of Learning by Nobody103 linkfp(2961893). It's a groundhog day type fic, with the main character reliving the same month at his mage academy over and over. It features extremely interesting and well-developed magic, dangerous animals and demons. It is clearly inspired by Flairgold's story (in addition to Harry Potter, and Dungeons & Dragons) and It is one lengthy chapter away from being finished.

Note one major flaw: the female characters are underdeveloped.
