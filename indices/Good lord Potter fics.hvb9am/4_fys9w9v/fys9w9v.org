I enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/][Black Sky]]... where a fem!Harry is taken in by Aristocratic Blacks, and contains a lot of Harry collecting people into her circle...

It transitions into /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/ after mostly finishing the Harry Potter story.

--------------

it's not exactly a Lord Potter of many surnames fic, but I feel like it fits well enough to recommend
