I'd say try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis][This]]. It's got a little Dumbledore bashing, and the last update (chapter 20, at 175,393 words) was July of 2017, but it was pretty good while it lasted. Basically, Harry recognized how useless the staff was (and to be honest, can you blame him?) after the troll incident, therefore forming the DA in his first year rather than the fifth. It doesn't have many tropes, "call me Lord Potter" isn't really a thing unless he's purposely trying to tick someone(usually Dumbledore) off, yes his name is HARRY, and he is still honestly kind and compassionate, trying to make the school a better place for those who come there and realizing the only way that's going to happen is if he puts his foot down. Honestly? I'd give it a go.
