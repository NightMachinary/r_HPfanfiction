In real life, easily, in Hogwarts not so much. Its quite normal to have a week or two of orientation. Maybe when Potions is normally held they're having their details taken for Madam Pomfrey or some other admin task the school would do like making them all sign an agreement that they've read and understood the uniform restrictions. We just never see this sort of thing in the books, that being said, it would be really boring to include it.

Also, for what its worth my high-school also used a two week timetable.
