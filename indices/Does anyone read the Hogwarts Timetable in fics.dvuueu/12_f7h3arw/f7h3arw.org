I've never seen it. IMO in most cases it's good to have one made up by the author for internal consistency but pointless to include in the story unless as a curiosity in AN or as additional material. Maybe give some mention if it's past 3rd year and time travel shenanigans come into play but otherwise just ditch giving a timetable in timetable format in the story, include stuff more naturally in conversations/internal monologues or narrative

As you should do with everything else with a story
