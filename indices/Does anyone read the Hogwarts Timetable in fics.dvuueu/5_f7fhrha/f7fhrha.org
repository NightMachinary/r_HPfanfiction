I read them because you never know when it's important and it's a good heads up for what's going to happen in the future. Because they could be having an average/normal day of classes and then all of a sudden they are going to "Magical Theory" or "Battle Magic" class with a made up professor's name, and I would be blindsided and confused if I hadn't read the time-table before.
