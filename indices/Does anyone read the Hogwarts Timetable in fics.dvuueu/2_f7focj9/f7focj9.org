I never read them. Along with the school song, the hat songs, bank statements, inheritance results that are longer than 2 lines, Hogwarts supply letters, bad twin-speak...

In most cases, the aforementioned and some other examples are entirely superfluous and whatever a reader might get from them can be gathered from the context. I prefer a short statement in the narrative or in dialogue like ‚Äùthe hat was a bit ominous this year‚Äù or ‚Äù it appeared that the Potter family was obscenely wealthy‚Äù it gives a sense of what we need to know but doesn't involve a wall of mostly pointless text.

I read somewhere that every element of a narrative should contribute to the plot, and while not a writer myself I think that is something to consider ü§î
