Interesting! I love both of these fics and appreciate them for their different types of humour. I think a great amount of dramatic irony in both comes from the reader knowing more than any character other than Harry, something that's used to great effect in both fics. I feel smug, along side Harry, while he's baffling and bamboozling those unfortunate characters in the story along with him.
