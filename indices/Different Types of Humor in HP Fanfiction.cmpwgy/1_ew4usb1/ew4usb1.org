I find both to be a little smarmy and not really what I would class as humour, so, neither in my view. But I'm aware that's just my own perspective.

Tbh I get from both of them the impression that they are either written by or aimed at teenagers, in the style of [[/r/im14andthisisdeep][r/im14andthisisdeep]].

I think the humour in neither of them is particularly British in the way that the source material is, so for me personally that's a dropping off point. I can see though how if the original series' humour is the one thats unfamiliar to you and this style is /more/ familiar you might feel the opposite way.
