Just read ABC because of this thread, and while I can understand how Nappy can fall flat, personally I found the whole situation hilarious. It's so inappropriate, and kind of ironic due to the fact that the Potters are the least likely family to treat their house elf like a slave, that I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it.
