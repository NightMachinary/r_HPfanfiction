I enjoyed both of them immensely.

I actually feel like they have a lot of similarities in the source of their comedy. In a similar fashion to Dumb and Dumber or Bill and Ted, the world is mostly relatively normal, but then you have this bizarre fuckin weirdo of a main character (or characters, in A Black Comedy) going through like a bull in a china shop.

Some people just don't find that kind of comedy entertaining.

Addendum: Also, ABC has aged fuckin terribly in terms of what is considered appropriate, and I doubt it would be written the same today. Seventh Horcrux, to my memory, doesn't have this issue.
