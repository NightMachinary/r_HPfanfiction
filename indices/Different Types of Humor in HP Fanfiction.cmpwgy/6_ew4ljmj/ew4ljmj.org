Seventh Horcrux: [Yay] A Black Comedy: [Yay]

I honestly loved reading both. Seventh Horcrux was amusing in that Harrymort misinterpreted literally everything and reacted accordingly. His wildly incorrect predictions about human behavior granted the audience a suspension of disbelief about his antics, because...it's Harrymort, he doesn't know what's going on. Of course he did that random crazy thing. For me, Seventh Horcrux was the kind of fic I'd read and snort at, maybe put down once or twice to look at my ceiling and ponder the idiocy of the MC. The humor here stems from the MC being dumb, I think.

On the other hand, A Black Comedy is funny because the characters are completely batshit. I have a very crude sense of humor, which did lend itself to helping me enjoy ABC. This is a fic where I'd laugh out loud and shake my head because of what the characters did. ABC, I think, is a more typical crack fanfic in that Sirius and Harry are completely irreverent and just do funny stuff for the sake of it. I found it absolutely hilarious when Harry and Sirius go do self indulgent things and bemoan the weird stuff that happens to them---like Ginny, who was always a source of humor. Because Harry is an OP badass they can get away with a big ol “eff you” to the dimension they fell into and do whatever they want.

Fundamentally, I think both fics have one main similarity. They're both about caricatures of their original characters taken to a ridiculous extreme, which is a main thread that runs through crack fics. Voldemort utterly overreacts to everything. Harry and Sirius are hedonists who have adapted to Sirius' preferred state of being---debauchery. Seventh Horcrux can get a little dry while ABC gets really crude, really fast, but I still loved both.

A note on ABC not aging well: it hasn't, unfortunately. I still however find it funny, as I think people with ruder senses of humor would too.
