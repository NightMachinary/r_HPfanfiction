While this is a good an unique story it's still a bit bashing. They fly broom way up in the sky with flying iron balls, can regrow bones ect,ect. So I don't feel causing scars via bird beaks would result in suck a hard punishment. And I wouldn't call it a betrayal. The author is picking up on a glossed over part, but clearly dislikes Hermione's character and writes such. Still entertaining.
