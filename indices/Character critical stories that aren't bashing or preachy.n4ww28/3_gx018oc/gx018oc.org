This is my own fic. It's critical of the fanon! Hermione that runs off with Draco Malfoy. linkao3(Litany of Lies by HeirGaunt) it's a oneshot and in my biased opinion well worth your time.

The old favorite marriage contract story is nothing but Harry and Daphne critical. They are essentially both portrayed as power hungary politicians. Well worth your time as well. linkffn(contractual invalidation)
