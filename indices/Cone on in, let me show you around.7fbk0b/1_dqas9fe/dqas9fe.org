It depends entirely upon the person who is asking. There's no general introductory fics since people have very different expectations when starting with fanficton. Some want stories that explain the great mystery of Hermione's marriage. Some want stories where the reader is put through 400k words of angsty teenage miscommunication where the any reader knows how it will end by page and age 5. Some want a certain character bashed to hell and back. Some want smut, harems and/or marriage contracts. Harry/Cho? Sure, we got that covered. Canon rehearsals with an OC that changes absolutely nothing? Harry/Hermione? Harry/Fleur? An absurd amount of slash that os entirely disproportionate to the real percentage of homosexual relationships in real life and in canon? 16 year old Harry getting raped by a twelve year old girl? Soulmates? The +magical Waffen-SS+ hot actors being the good guys? A Friendship story featuring Luna and Hermione that turns into romance? 2.000.000 words? 500 words? Logical inconsistencies pointed out? Plotholes fixed?

Well, whatever the person wants, we have it. It is important to consider the person's interests before recommending stories. If somebody introduced me by giving me a list of slash or a "Voldemort did nothing wrong" fic then I'd be out of here faster than you can say fanficton. I can give some recommendations but I cannot say if the person will like them since I don't know their preferences.

[[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/cho/hho/a/0/The+Headsman%C2%B4s+Hostage/Mantis%20FA/14]["Headman's hostage" is a nice Harry/Cho story that is not on FFN.]]

"Baby it's cold outside" by Potato19 is a cute Harmony story set in an AU OotP.

"Summer of change" is a classic that did not age well because many of its tropes became overused since its publication. Harry/Tonks.

"Why are you in my house? " if you want a MILF Lovestory. Harry/Narcissa.

"Rune Stone Path" for massive AU including reworked magic, somewhat accidental necromancy, polyamory and a believable legal system.

"Power of love" for fem!Harry that faces an uphill struggle.

The list goes on forever, entirely dependent upon the recipient.
