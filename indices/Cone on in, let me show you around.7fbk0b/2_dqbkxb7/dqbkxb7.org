If they're new to HP /and/ fanfiction, I'd give them something short enough not to scare them off like Cauterize by Lady Altair. It's also good enough for them to potentially be motivated to seek out more.

I remember being new to fanfic. I'd only read one shots. Long fics were okay, but time-consuming and easily forgettable if I had to stop reading. Abandoned fics were a nightmare.
