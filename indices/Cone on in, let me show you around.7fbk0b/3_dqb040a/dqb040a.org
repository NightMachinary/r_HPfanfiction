Weres Harry is one of my go-to recommendations.

On the Delights of Drinking Blood and other works by Quatermass are also some of my go-to's, particularly for comedy.

White Squirrel's works, particularly The Accidental Animagus and The Arithmancer.

One World, for an expanded Wizarding World.

Recently, The Chessmaster: Black Pawn is my person favorite Slytherin!Harry.

Rebirth of the Founders is my go-to reincarnation fic.
