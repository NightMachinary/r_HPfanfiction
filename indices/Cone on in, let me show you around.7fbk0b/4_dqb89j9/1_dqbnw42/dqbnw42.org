HPMOR is an example of what is called 'Rationalist Fiction'. Essentially, everything must make sense, everything must obey rules, everything must occur as if it was a real person doing it. Voldemort is not evil just to be evil. Dumbledore does not act like a mad old fool just for fun.

I don't think it's really fair to label it an OP!Harry story though, because nothing Harry does is something special or unique, in principle anyone could do it, they just never think of it. The major problem is that Harry acts a bit like a spoiled brat and ends up getting away with a lot of stuff he really shouldn't have. That being said, the story is very funny and quite engaging, with lots of good characterization, and some good subtle but pervasive AU elements. I recommend it, just be aware that it is not the absolute pinnacle of fanfiction.
