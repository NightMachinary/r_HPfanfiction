I've read all, but Harry Potter, And The Methods Of Rationality.

On a similar vain, can someone explain HPMOR to me, because all I get is 'science Harry' or 'OP Harry' if anyone would be willing to PM me important details or some plot points of the story so I can work out for myself if it is worth the read, that'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Warryn.
