Interesting, but i've also heard that Harry is too OP in this story, and while I don't mind a short, novel length OP Harry story, in a story with over a million words it would get old fast. Can you assauge my fears a bit on that, or at least that it's so good that you can ignore his OPness(haha(I know immature, but I was reading it back to myself, and chuckled)).

Thanks,

Warryn.
