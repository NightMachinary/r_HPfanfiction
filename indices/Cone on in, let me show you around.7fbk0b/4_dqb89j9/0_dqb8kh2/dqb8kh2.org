How to explain HPMOR?...

- Its "Harry" is not Canon!Harry+Science, but more of a new character entirely. He's a precocious child (for a very good in-story reason) who has read a lot of books on rationality and ends up in Ravenclaw. He often has internal monologues or dialogues which most people find very funny and some people find annoying.

- It's a heavy AU that "fixes" a lot of the "irrational" elements of canon. The Philosopher's Stone doesn't work that way, the Wizengamot doesn't work that way, the Horcruxes don't work that way, Pettigrew is not Scabbers, etc.

- The main element in the above changes is that Voldemort is /massively/ upgraded. HPMOR!Voldemort is a /genius/, Moriarty-level, and he is showcased a lot because throughout the story he is /actually possessing Quirrell/ --- not sticking out the back of his head, but using Q's body as his own. So we have DADA taught by Genius!Voldemort, and it's awesome. "Quirrelmort" (for a reason that gets revealed progressively) tries to mentor Harry, and Harry isn't too reluctant... at first.
