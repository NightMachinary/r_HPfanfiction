I can't see where you were going with it -- or at least, I couldn't until I saw the description.

Good points:

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation. You even used "discreet" rather than "discrete"! The cockles of my heart are all toasty now. So many people get that wrong.
- Using an uncommonly used character.
- Punching squid. Even if it didn't actually happen.

I don't really know how to write romance. I don't read romance. Going by the [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle]] guide, we have just gotten to some characters in their comfort zones. Pretty much nothing else. I'm not sure how to draw them together -- right now, it seems like they both want to get on with normal life more than anything else.

I'm not sure how to help, so [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuBrDPorB80][here's Hatsune Miku singing Matthew's Passion by Bach]].
