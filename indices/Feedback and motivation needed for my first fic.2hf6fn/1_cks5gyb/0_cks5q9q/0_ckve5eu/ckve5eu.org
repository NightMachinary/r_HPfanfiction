Maybe you could use the friendship as a step before romance, instead of just skipping into romance. Seeing the unlikely pairing it would make more sense anyway.

Maybe the fast friendship between Hermione and Gregory can become the reason for Ron to break off the wedding too. I can see Hermione wanting to help Gregory either with his mission or even in his life in general, and that not pleasing Ron at all, you know, because he's an ex-Death-Eater, because he's a slimy Slytherin and all that (Ron in not the most tolerant bloke around).

I really hope you continue writing this fic. I thoroughly enjoyed it because it was well-written (despite some spelling / grammar mistakes) and it is so original. I'm really craving some unusual pairings for a change, so please, pretty please, do not abandon it!
