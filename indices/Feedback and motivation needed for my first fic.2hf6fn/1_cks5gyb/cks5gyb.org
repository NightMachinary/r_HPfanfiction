You're a fantastic writer! Hermione is believable, and you've taken Gregory in an interesting direction that I like a lot. Good prose too.

I'm not a Hermione/Gregory fan (but really, I doubt many people would say they are) and think it would work better as not a ship. Just two childhood enemies who realize that the other has grown up, that people do change.

EDIT: please, even if you lose motivation for this fic, wire something else! There are too many shit writers or overdone ideas; we need you!
