The way I like to think of it is sort of similar to how technology worked in the muggle world - it wasn't a straight linear trajectory, nor even always moving forward. When civilisations fall, vast quantities of knowledge tend to be lost in the process. It took centuries to figure out how the Pyramids or Stonehenge were built. The Greeks could do shit with bronze that we still can't replicate, and nobody really knows what the /fuck/ is up with Damascus steel. That shit's got carbon nanotubes, yo!

With magic being as naturally esoteric as it is, I can only imagine it to be like that cranked up by several magnitudes. Modern wizards, by and large, can do stuff with magic that would blow the socks off of their ancient counterparts, but there's still a lot of relics and old magic that the ancients cooked up that still have modern magic's greatest experts saying “What the scrum-diddly fuck is this?”.

Hence how Voldemort can be the most powerful dark lord of all time, yet still be caught blindsided by ancient magic like blood bonds and the Deathly Hallows.
