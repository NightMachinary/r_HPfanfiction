Old magic being superior to new magic is an extremely common trope in fantasy. Hell, its derived in large part from mythology itself in many ways, as often old deities or humans were more powerful than the modern day equivalents in such tales. The trope has its heyday in the Tolkeinverse though, with its themes of waning magic and rising mankind in the story. It has its merits, but frankly it is more suited towards stories with mythical or supernatural powerful figures that gifted power in the past, rather than people in the past being just better.

In the Harry Potter universe, I think people misconstrue the existence of places like Hogwarts or objects like the Deathly Hallows as signs that wizards were more skilled in the past. Rather, the world indicates these are so amazing because they are /anomalies/, rather than the norm. Wizards and witches haven't grown more powerful or such, magic has not changed in and of itself. Exceptional wizards rise to the forefront in every era, same as the modern. Often their abilities are raised up to near god-like or mythical statuses overtime - this is even occurring with Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry in the modern era.

New magic is better. Why do I say that? Well look at it this way: the main charm to lift objects that is used today is the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa). However, there exists numerous other charms that do similar if not identical work (ex. the Hover Charm, the Rocket Charm, even the Summoning Charm possibly). And yet, the main one used is Wingardium Leviosa, for the same reason Google is the dominant internet search engine: its better than the competition. Magical knowledge improves overtime by finding out what works and what does not, by looking for ways around the current weaknesses. In this manner, magic is similar to technology in that its always improving, though its the rare few who are able to truly jump the game forward.

A good fic that discusses this at one point would be linkffn(Realignment by puzzleSB).
