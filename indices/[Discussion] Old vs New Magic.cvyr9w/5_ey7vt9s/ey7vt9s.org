My view of it is that it's a combination of survivorship bias and a cost/benefit analysis that modern wizards find completely unacceptable.

Survivorship bias as in nobody remembers the ancient spell to create light, because Lumos is better in every possible way (for one, you don't need 3 ounces of mouse blood).

Cost/benefit analysis as in "Yes, they could influence the weather across all of england, but they also killed half a dozen squibs to fuel it and risked the wizard casting it dying from the strain."

You see the cost/benefit one a lot in fics in "rituals" (or often even "runes") where it's a lot of work with some drawbacks, sometimes serious ones, to achieve something that's only marginally better than what wizards can do now. Usually the biggest benefit is that the ritual caster can do it /alone,/ or at least with one or two close confidants. Great for Harry because he has no support structure and, as a child and a student, not really given much independence to do these things with a group. Not really a problem for the wizarding world at large.
