Personally i like that magic as a whole is the same but certain techniques are taught more than others because its most easy or convenient to teach to teach it that way at the time. For example there are requires a sort of instinct if belief or emotion behind it. Like say the patronus which requires a strong enough good memory to give you conviction. Or the cruciatus where you need to want to hurt someone to use the spell effectively. Or divination which to a certain degree is a intuition you have or don't in some of its aspects.

In comparison things like say transfiguration potions and Arithmancy have specific things you need to do as long as you understand what you need to do and are precise you are able to pull it off well. This kind of magic is easier to teach to a large number of students . It is limiting as to truly understand all or magic that emotional instinctive aspect might be needed. But it might not be easy to incorporate into the current schooling system. At least not till higher studies.

The emotional and instinct based stuff is a older practice since spells were likely created they didn't naturally exist. There were no specific rules you could read up at the begining. You just had to rely on instinct and experimentation. But at the same time the importance of a particular wand movement wasnt something wizards made up there is a reason why it worked. So its not really fair to say its a newer magic. But its just magic that was discovered later.
