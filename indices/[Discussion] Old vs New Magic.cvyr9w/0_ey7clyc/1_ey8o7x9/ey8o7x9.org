I think, within the setting, one of the big reasons they wank ancient wizards and old magic is because old magic seems to have done some very impressive things that haven't been replicated in the modern age, like the creation of Hogwarts. For instance, we don't have any indication that say, Malfoy Manor was created in a single afternoon using modern spells. Additionally, the wizarding world seems to be kind of bad at passing down knowledge, so it is believable that there are old spells that might surpass modern ones in important ways. Your example of some old methods beating new ones except in the matter of cost, isn't really applicable to wizards for instance.

Let's imagine that Felix Felicis is a modern potion. It is very difficult to brew, and requires expensive ingredients, but replaced a much older form of ritual magic that took months of preparation and exacting practice. The ritual form of the luck magic however lasts much longer, a whole year of good fortune in fact. Now, if you just want to sell luck to people, Felix Felicis is the way to go, despite the difficulty. But if you want the magic for your self, then the ritual is the option you would prefer. Thus, our plucky up and comer might reasonably disdain Felix Felicis, a modern invention, for the ancient (and possibly secret) magic that, for his case scenario, works better.

Direct comparisons between the muggle and the wizarding are easy to make, but the details can often make things murky. I would agree that, on balance, Dumbledore is probably a better dueler than Godric Gryfindor because Dumbledore has an extra millennia of spell creation and refinement to draw from, but we can't honestly discount the possibility of Godric knowing some forgotten spell that could give him an edge, or was eventually discarded because despite the power it was difficult to teach.
