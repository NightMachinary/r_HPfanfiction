To be fair in regards to branches of magic, JKR doesn't exactly do a great job of defining and expanding on the various rules and classifications of magic within the books. Rituals are clearly a thing, even though we only see one in canon, much like Alchemy is a thing, even though it's really only mentioned in Philosopher's Stone. Just because JKR doesn't expand on the subjects doesn't really make them fanon (although, yeah, specific common rituals in fanfics that don't show up in canon /would/ be fanon, but I'm specifically referring to it's classification as a piece of magic). It's more likely that these subjects are outdated, too dangerous to be taught at school, or are specialized branches that would require post-NEWT studies, such as an apprenticeship.
