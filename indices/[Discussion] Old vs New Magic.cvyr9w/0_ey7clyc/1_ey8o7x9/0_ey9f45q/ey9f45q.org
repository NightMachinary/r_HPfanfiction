  I think, within the setting, one of the big reasons they wank ancient wizards and old magic is because old magic seems to have done some very impressive things that haven't been replicated in the modern age, like the creation of Hogwarts.

I agree is that there are amazing ancient artifacts and feats that are talked about and even shown, and that's fine. But by and large these ancient artifacts are objects to be acted upon. The feats serve as explanations of current circumstances in the setting, not expectations for what the protagonists must do. In canon Merlin doesn't come back to put Harry through a training montage that makes him super awesome and able to defeat Voldemort easily. The story doesn't hinge on Harry's use of the Deathly Hallows, but on Voldemort's obsession with them, particularly the Elder Wand.

So to me the point of canon is not "ancient magic is amazing and powerful, if you need a power up just find a lost McGuffin or old forgotten tome and you're good!". That's a fantasy trope, but one that Harry Potter largely misses. The point is that power, of all sorts and origins, corrupts. That we can't see clearly unless we stop obsessing over these trappings and start caring about what's really important, like love and friendship.

All these words to say that fics that start bringing in ancient magic (especially if someone from centuries past trains Harry) that insta-defeats modern magic or start putting the crux of the story on possession of ancient McGuffins rather than on the moral choices of the protagonist start to lose my interest. Also rituals are almost completely fanon, especially referring to them as such. Much like calling Dumbledore "the leader of the light", it's not /wrong/ but it's not canon. There were so few rituals (one really, in the graveyard) shown that there was no need to refer to them as if they were a whole class of magical activity.
