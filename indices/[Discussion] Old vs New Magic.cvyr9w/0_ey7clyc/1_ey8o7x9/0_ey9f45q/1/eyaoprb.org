I'm not sure I would agree with your idea that modernization is a major theme in the series. That isn't to say that I think glorification of the old is a major theme either; I don't really see strong progressive or regressive themes. For instance, both Dumbledore and Voldemort promise more rights to traditionally marginalized groups like werewolves, and neither of them seem to have a pronounced philosophical hardon for light or dark magic aside from personal preference.

Perhaps on a more meta level, since the founding of Hogwarts presumably served an important role in standardizing the teaching and dissemination of magical knowledge? I'm not trying to argue that within the books they glorify ancient magic. I do not believe that ever actually happens. Associations with such ideas have been absorbed into the fannon, for instance assuming that deatheaters have strong 'make wizarding britain great again' sort of leanings which presumably includes 'old magic is good magic' ideas. But that isn't ever clearly established in the books. Similarly, I don't think anyone ever suggests that newer magic is better than older magic in any real way. New things get invented, which is good because it solves problems (like wolfsbane potion) but no one seems to be really enthusiastic about invention or development of new spells. The national magical research institute is literally called The Department of Mysteries. Arithmancy is supposedly important in the creation of new spells, but its barely talked about.

If you want to talk about things we can reasonably assume about the wizarding world despite it never having screen time, then I think my earlier point still stands. New magic is likely easier to cast, easier to learn, and slightly weaker/inferior. Old magic is probably harder to learn, harder to perform (difficult potions, long incantations to spells, etc), and potentially more powerful/longer lasting etc. In terms of what most people know and cast, new spells are likely preferred. But I think it isn't unreasonable to speculate there could be older forms of magic that dedicated searchers might find and use which would suit their needs better than more modern spells. For instance, if I want to build an entire neighborhood's worth of houses, modern construction techniques are almost certainly my best bet. If I want to build myself a castle, there are lots of pointers I could take from modern architecture, but a lot of what I end up doing is going to be exactly what they did 1000 years ago, if for no other reason than no one really makes castles anymore.
