  I'm not sure I would agree with your idea that modernization is a major theme in the series.

I did not say this at all. I was just pushing back against this idea in fanon that ancient magic = awesome and instawin. In the setting magic is a technology, and like most technologies magic has generally gotten better with time. The main point of my replies is that fanfics overly focusing on McGuffins or ancient artifacts misses the point of Harry Potter, whether they're new or old.

  no one seems to be really enthusiastic about invention or development of new spells. The national magical research institute is literally called The Department of Mysteries

New brooms, faster and better than the ones before them, come out every year. Fred and George spend years creating WWW products. Pandora Lovegood was a spell researcher, and it's never said anywhere that she worked for the Department of Mysteries. Severus Snape also invented several spells without working there. I certainly don't think magical innovation and experimentation are confined to just that one institution, and in canon it's shown that people are very excited about new discoveries and products.

It must be remembered that what inventions they do have are pretty fantastic. The floo network is akin to Star Trek transporter technology, and wizards have had them for a few centuries. People often take Arthur's lack of comprehension of muggle technology as stupidity, when I think it just underlines how truly differently wizards live. A Starfleet Vulcan explorer landing on Earth would have similar troubles. There isn't much about the muggle 90's that magic can't top IMHO. Except maybe Mariah Carey!

  New magic is likely easier to cast, easier to learn, and slightly weaker/inferior. Old magic is probably harder to learn, harder to perform (difficult potions, long incantations to spells, etc), and potentially more powerful/longer lasting etc.

Which is just restating my analogy that old magic that is superior to modern magic most likely is disused because of a cost attached to it. Whether it's difficulty of learning or using the magic requires human sacrifice the concept is the same.

Anyway I think we are in violent agreement for the most part.
