The Harry Potter setting presents everyday magic as a sort of technology that wizards work on. Wands, floo powder, portkeys are all invented. Spells and potions are researched and refined all the time. The Wolfsbane potion wasn't invented yet when Remus was a student, but it was there in 1993 when he came to teach at Hogwarts.

Of course there's ancient magic like what Lily used to save Harry and defeat Voldemort. And of course in real life technology there's examples of ancient technology with advantages that we don't use in modern times (mostly because we have a slightly inferior way that's much cheaper). But I do think harping too much on how superior ancient magic is kind of misses the point of the setting. If Isaac Newton travelled through time to the modern day, most physics graduates would know more about physics than he did. Wanking ancient wizards/witches too much kind of rubs me the wrong way.
