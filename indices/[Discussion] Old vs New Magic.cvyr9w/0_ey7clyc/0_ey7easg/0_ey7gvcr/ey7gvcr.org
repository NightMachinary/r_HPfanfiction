  Still, if you go by the books, the hallows are unsurpassed and very possibly man-made.

Yes they may be man-made, but as we don't see any other items approach their power, longevity and quality it may be that the cost to make them is quite severe. Given that the legends of their origin involve death I'm sure you can imagine some reasons why no modern wand or cloak maker has succeeded in making an equal.
