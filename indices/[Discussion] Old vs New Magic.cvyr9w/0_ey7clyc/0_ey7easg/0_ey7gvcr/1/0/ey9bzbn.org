Yes, add in those too if you want! My point is that these ancient artifacts that have no modern equivalent, and I speculated that it isn't just because modern wizards simply don't know how but that the cost is too high to replicate them. When I say "any other items" I mean items of the type. Like there are no wands that match the Elder Wand, and no invisibility cloaks that have lasted as long as The Cloak.

However, keep in mind that we never see the diadem, locket or cup having any power aside from the Horcrux effect and we never get to compare the sword to any other goblin made swords to see if it's particularly superior.
