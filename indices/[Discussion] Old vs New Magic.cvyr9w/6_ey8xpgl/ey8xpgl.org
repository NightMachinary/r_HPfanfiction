You can amazing things, amazingly powerful feats of magic, with a stone circle.

On the other hand, you NEED a stone circle and it's not like you can just whip one up on-the-go or pocket it again once you're done.\\
And lets not even start trying to make some minor adjustments to your spells cast.

Oh, and a stone circle won't keep you warm in your hut or cook you dinner on a muggy winter day.
