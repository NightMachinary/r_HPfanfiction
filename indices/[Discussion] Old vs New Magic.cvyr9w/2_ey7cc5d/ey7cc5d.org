When I've seen that idea done well in fics, it's usually that the old ways of practicing magic have more raw power but less diverse applications and/or less fine control.

For example, one of the characters in "To Play the Devil" weilds a staff and channels magic more like magicians did in old folktales, with bits of music and expending small items of minor power. In a fight his magic has great offensive force, but he doesn't have the quick versatility of a hundred spells that a wizard with a wand could cast.

I think that type of world-building makes sense from a narative standpoint. It allows for the old obscure magics to be exciting, but it still makes sense why modern methods of magic became the norm.
