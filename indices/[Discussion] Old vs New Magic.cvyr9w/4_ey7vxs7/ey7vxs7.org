New magic is usually more refined and more exact.

Ancient magic has the advantage of unorthodox methods that have fallen out of favor like human sacrifice which provides massive amounts of raw power, but it's more crude than new magic.

Plus some enchantments can draw on magic from the environment which allows them to last long beyond the deaths of their creators, and if those are centuries old they hold a lot of raw power too.

New magic is precise and efficient, old magic relies on raw power to get things done.

Some very powerful spells from that were available in ancient times are forgotten because they were banned for causing too much trouble.
