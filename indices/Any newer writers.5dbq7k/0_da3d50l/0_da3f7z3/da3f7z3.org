Haha! That was something I heard from a friend and am trying to incorporate. But my friend is a real writer and I am a little too embarrassed that my first foray into the writing world is through fan fiction to ask him for advice.

what about having a descriptive sentence after the conversation?

For example, instead of saying: "Yes." She quietly said

Saying: "Yes." She said. Quietly she sat down and put her cards back on the table.

I am generally trying to take the approach of "show don't tell". I have about a 3 page outline on how I want my chapters to flow broken out into four overarching themes. I am currently writing what feels naturally as it comes when I feel inspired by a specific part of the story.

Thanks for the advice though :)
