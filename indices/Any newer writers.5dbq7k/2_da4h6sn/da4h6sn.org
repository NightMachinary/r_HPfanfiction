If you are writing canon compliant fics, research your source materials well. Readers are very strict when it comes to canon compliance.

Some authors tend to disregard canon elements that could interfere with their plots or make things too easy for their protagonists. Don't, or readers are going to say very nasty things. If simple solution exists to a problem, use it. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and Luna were all highly intelligent people and they deserve to be treated as such.

Since you are working on a canon compliant Ginny story, I highly recommend rereading DH a few times, because JKR only left a few clues in her Book that could be easily overlooked. And don't make Snape too evil or else Harry and Ginny would NEVER name their child 'Severus'. In fact, my head canon says that Snape only deserved that honor because he bailed out Ginny from multiple tight spots at his own risk, in hindsight of course.
