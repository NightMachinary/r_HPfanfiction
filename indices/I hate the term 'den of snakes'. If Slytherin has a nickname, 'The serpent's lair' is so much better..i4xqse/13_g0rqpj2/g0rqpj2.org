  It's just so underwhelming! Every time I hear that word I instantly imagine a bunch of tiny, garden snakes, fangless, smiling broadly and swinging their bodies to music. Even when a character says 'den of snakes' or 'snake' as an insult, I just picture the snek meme and get amused rather than feel the intended emotion.

That's kind of just you, though. Den of snakes is an actual insult and has no connotations of cuteness (or dancing). It means a bunch of untrustworthy, scheming people who will happily stab you (or each other) in the back. The only issue is if Slytherins use it for themselves, because it's an insult.
