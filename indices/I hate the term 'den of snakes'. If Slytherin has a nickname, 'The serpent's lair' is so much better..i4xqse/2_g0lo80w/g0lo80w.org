'Den/Pit of Snakes' is an actual idiom. It's from/also sometimes 'Nest of Vipers'. It's even century appropriate - the first use of it was 1640-something regarding some people plotting treason in England. I can't remember what it was and google refuses to tell me, but yeah. I imagine that's why it's so often used.
