I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions. Some are Harry as Snape's son... others are Snarry and slash.

Also, in this one, Harry adopts Snape after he's been reincarnated. It is really sweet... the reverse of what you're looking for, but really well done.

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.
