The key is having different categories of tag. The problem with Ao3 is that the tags are all in a generalised mass, so (for example), you can search by a character tag, looking for stories centred around that character, but in fact a load of stories where that character is barely featured show up.

So I would suggest the following categories:

Main (point of view) character: (field allows *one* character tag, or the tag "multiple")

Secondary characters: (tags)

Primary pairing: (field allows *one* pairing tag, or the tag "multiple")

Secondary pairings: (tags)

Other: (tags)

If you pick "multiple" then then the secondary characters/pairings fields allow you to detail them.
