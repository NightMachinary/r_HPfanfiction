Hmm ... a list of characters playing a major role in the fanfic (say, 2--3 characters tops), tags for characters playing less significant but still somewhat important roles in it (that can be set to be shown or hidden), a list of tags for significant pairings that can likewise be set to be shown or hidden, genre tags (you know, stuff like “comedy”, “horror”, “coming of age”, or “gender bender”), and then miscellaneous tags that are hidden by default but can be shown with a button click where the author can put anything silly that suits the story.

That said, ultimately any tag system with a bit of leeway can be good, but only for as long as the people using it to tag their work use it well. Case in point, if you were tagging “Seventh Horcrux” with what I wrote above, you'd put “Tom Riddle (horcrux)” as a major character, and maybe add “Harry Potter” there too, and then put both Hermione and Ron under minor characters because that's really it (maybe add Voldemort to that list too), and add nothing under pairings because seriously; many people who'd tag it, however, would add every single pairing that is there, even “Sirius/Severus”, to the tag list, and then add Harry, Hermione, and Ron to the major character list and then everyone and their pet Kneazle to the minor character list for no real reason, and this is really what's keeping AO3's tag system from being as useful as it could be.
