Ao3's main and crucial problem is the lack of ease of handling. It needs the ability to right-click on a tag to exclude it in a search result or start a search with it. Pull-down menus for the most common tags of a fandom wouldn't go amiss either. As it is, I'm supposed to install extensions/apps, or type out the tags I don't want to search for each time I'm looking for a story.
