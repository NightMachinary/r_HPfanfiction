Give people the ability to mark, say, five of their tags as primary. The rest are secondary. Primary tags are for the main parts of the work -- overarching themes, protagonist, primary pairing, that kind of thing.

Then I search like: =primary:"Minerva McGonagall" "Tri-Wizard Tournament"=. This gets any fics tagged with Minerva McGonagall and Tri-Wizard Tournament, but the former tag must be primary. It might be a story about student-Minnie competing in the 1940s, or it might be a fic that recounts the entire 1991 to 1998 period from McGonagall's perspective, or from Harry's perspective but with McGonagall as the major supporting character.

Also, make negative tags work directly. If I add =-Harry Potter= to a search, it should eliminate =Harry Potter=-tagged works. I shouldn't have to find the tag ID and pass =-filter_id:7723=.
