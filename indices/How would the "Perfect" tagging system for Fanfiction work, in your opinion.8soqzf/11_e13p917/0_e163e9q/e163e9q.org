Well, it's not an AI but Scryer actually has recommendations for registered users, they are just not linked to the main page for whatever strange reason [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/user/recommendations]]

Scryers recommendations are based on your activity on the site. So to boostrap them you will have to search for stuff there.
