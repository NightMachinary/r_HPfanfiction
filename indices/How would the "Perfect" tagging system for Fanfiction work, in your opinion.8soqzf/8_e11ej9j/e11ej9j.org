I would prefer a good, easy to use search engine for FFN (Scryer can be very cumbersome), which would actually be alright if FFN had metatags.

The ability to exclude more than two characters (like on scryer), characters sorted by popularity and not by alphabet (like in the FFN App), an easy way to exclude certain ships (in case that I don't mind certain characters, but don't want them romantically involved), the ability to exclude multiple genres, the ability to exclude metatags and the ability to exclude slash.
