Scryer is great if you are looking for something specific, but despite its awesome tools (especially the ability to exclude many characters), it is not good to browse. The FFN app sorts the characters by popularity, something that is great when you are exploring outside of the top 10 characters. It gives you way more feedback to your input. With Scryer you don't know if there's anything within your search parameters until you hit search.
