I actually like having the character be alphabetical, sure it makes it a slog sometimes, but there are so many goddamned characters, if you were looking for a lesser used character and didn't know right where they were, it would take absolute ages reading through every character entry. Maybe an option to switch sorting the lists by alphabetical/popularity/whatever other system?
