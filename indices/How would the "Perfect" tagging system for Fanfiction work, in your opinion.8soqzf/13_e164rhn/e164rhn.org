To me, perfect tagging means:

1. strict set of community suggested tags, possibly per fandom.
2. tags not visible by default on the search results and only used for searching.

AO3s system actively encourages authors to use tags instead of a summary, which makes searches on the site absolutely horrible AND lowers general summary quality because "who cares, everything is in the tags"

But honestly, recommendation engines are needed much more than any tagging system. You can search for tags all day and still be drowning in crap. I have my own engine that I am preparing to release into public hopefully sometime soon and I can tell you that recommendations tailored to your tastes being available transforms fanfic search for the better more than any possible tag system.
