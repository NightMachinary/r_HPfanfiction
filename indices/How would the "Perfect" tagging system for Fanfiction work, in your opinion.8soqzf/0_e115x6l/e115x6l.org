6 characters would probably be optimal for character tagging, as opposed to the free for all of Ao3.

Some meta tags for popular tropes would helpful too. They ought to be allowed to have their visibility toggled on and off though, since not everyone wants to see it and it makes the page longer. These should be preselected options though, again, not the "whatever you want to put" Ao3 has, with community suggestions for addition or removal.

Ability to search by publish date ranges (sometimes people want to read only older stories).

Probably more, but those are the main ones that come to my mind.
