Not the person you are replying to, but I think there should be genre tags, separate from the other tags. That way we could choose to have most of the tags hidden to get surprised but still see that ones that define the most how the story reads overall (so, say, you could see that the story is “romance” but have the pairing hidden ... to a degree).
