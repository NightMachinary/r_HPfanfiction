Thanks for your input. :)

I think I'm going to compile a sort of conglomeration of descriptor preferences for stories. Maybe, with some time, we could create a community-driven standard?

There's no reason, even, that it needs to be limited to Harry Potter. This is just the subreddit that I'm on the most often. Do you have any other suggestions?
