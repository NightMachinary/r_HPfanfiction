Axe the ability to create your own tags. I love AO3 but I get ever so slightly homicidal when there are basically authors notes in the tagging system. If there is need for a new pairing tag, have it created from dropdown menus to ensure proper formatting and proper spelling.

Easy exclusion of particular character, pairing or meta tags.

Limit the number of characters able to be added. If Piers Polkiss shows up for one scene, don't bloody tag him.

The main problem I have is when it comes to minor pairings. On one hand there's the argument that if Andromeda and Ted Tonks show up for two or three scenes and none of them are actually related to the Andromeda/Ted pairing, don't tag Andromeda/Ted because it clogs up the pairing tag for those of us who are looking for fics focused on Andromeda/Ted.

On the other there's the argument that some minor pairings can be huge backbutton issues for some people. Even if the fic is focused on Harry/Ginny and then you offhandedly mention that there's a Hermione/Snape or Ron/McGonagall pairing going on in the background I'm probably going to backbutton because your fic just jumped the shark and I'd quite like to have known that before I got invested.

I can see both sides of the argument and honestly, I'm not even sure where I sit on it.
