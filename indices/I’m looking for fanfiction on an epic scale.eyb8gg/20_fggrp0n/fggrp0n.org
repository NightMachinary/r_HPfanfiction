Gonna go out on a limb here and say linkffn(Lightning Dragon's Roar by Zero Rewind)

Bear in mind that while it's my favourite fic ever, it is unfinished(?) He updated back in Octiber after a 4 year hiatus so... its alive?

The first part up and till a certain point is perfect. Trust me on that, all I'm going to say is that once it reaches crossover territory it goes from epic to insane in a hood way.
