I really wanted to like this story; it's so well written except for one big flaw: there's no relationship building. Almost no dialogue. So Harry comes of as a slightly-cooky god robot. The author acknowledges this and owns it, but I lost interest in the story because I couldn't relate to Harry at all. :(
