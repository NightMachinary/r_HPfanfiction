The fic, Made of Common Clay by Lomonaaeren, has what you're looking for! Harry, at age 30, is an extremely jaded auror. He is fed up with the politics and scheming in the Wizarding world. And then, a mysterious visitor provides Harry with an opportunity . . . It's such a great story: Powerful!Harry, Independent!Harry!, which I love in fanfic when it's done right. There's no romance (a nice change, I think). Just Harry being a total badass and using amazing, powerful magic to freak people out and bend them to his will! Give it a try. At 43 chapters, there's plenty of plot. Lomonaaeren has written nearly 600 HP fanfics, so she knows her canon.
