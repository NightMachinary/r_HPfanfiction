I lurk around on the AQ sub so I've checked out your audiobooks, good work! I much prefer reading but am glad you're making the series more widely available!

Yeah, I think I arrived at that point with Noah's series too. But there is a LOT of cool Fidelius stuff (not a spoiler) that happens in the 3rd and 4th books. The magical theory starts to hit really hard around that time as well and there's some interesting stuff with some of the other professors. After the fifth book it just goes crazy plot wise and it's almost impossible to wrap your head around everything that's happening.

But yeah, it has so many inconsistencies. I agree with you that I can't comprehend why everyone's name has to start with A. I think I conglomerated Alec and Aidan's and Mia and Holly's characters until about book 6 and it didn't make a difference. The names are also just in general really stupid - there's a character in the third or fourth book that you will groan at after a couple chapters. As long as you're fine with passable writing the plot more than makes up for it at the end though.
