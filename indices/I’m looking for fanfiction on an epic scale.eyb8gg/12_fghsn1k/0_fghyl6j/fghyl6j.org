Oh you should definitely check out my audiobooks of Alexandra Quick if you haven't! I've been working very closely with the author on the voices and delivery, and am almost finished releasing the second book. The third is recorded in its entirety and I'm plowing through the editing process. Sub thread here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AlexandraQuick/comments/d7n4ne/alexandra_quick_and_the_audiobook_project/]]

Does Albus Potter (Global Revelation et all) get truly good? I got well into the second book and too many things bugged me about it. I don't know why he replaced the entire staff of Hogwarts with such forgettable professors apart from Most Interesting Professor Ever (tm) doing transfiguration. Albus going into Gryffindor is a boring take, I can't stand the names the author seems compelled to give people and I just have so much trouble caring about much of anyone. It gets so much praise though. Am I missing something?
