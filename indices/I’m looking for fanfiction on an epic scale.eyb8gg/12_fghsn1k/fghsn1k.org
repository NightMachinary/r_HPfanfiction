Alexandra Quick is the first HP fic I read and still my favorite. I've tried to find other fics that capture the same scale of it for a long, long time.

Here are some epic-level fics that you and others haven't mentioned yet. They're all truly excellent and I think if you like AQ you'll enjoy all of these. I also really enjoy White Squirrel's two long fics and highly recommend both of those.

The Phoenix and the Serpent: linkffn(637123) is a very, very old fic that probably lost its prominence because it's incomplete, but was very popular back in the day. Expansive world, new avenues of magic, adventures to all sorts of fantastical places. An interesting take on Dumbledore and a very well-written Ginny.

Stygian Trilogy: linkffn(8255131) I read this series recently and loved it. Magnetic characters and all sorts of different-than-the-books magical theory. While the first book is set at Hogwarts the second and third books see the characters literally jumping around the globe every chapter.

HP and the Boy Who Lived: linkffn(5353809) Another old classic that's unfortunately incomplete. The shortest of the fics on here and probably the one with the least world exploration, but great characters, a lot of magic creep and a vivid imagining of Durmstrang.

Pendant of Slytherin: linkffn(4324404) A lot of people don't like this one because of the writing quality, but I think it's ok, certainly better than A Second Chance at Life (which is exactly why I didn't recommend that fic, but it certainly fits your criteria now that I think about it). There's a really wonderful concept within Hogwarts that this fic explores and a whole lot of magic creep.

Albus Potter series by Vekin 87: linkffn(4380964)

This just takes Rowling's series to another level magic-wise, and in general does a really godo job carrying on the spirit of the series. Not that much magic creep. Read this before the series below.

Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom: linkffn(8417562)

HP on acid. Absolutely ridiculous execution and plotting, combined with magic creep x 10, actual Atlantis (I think), a magic base on the moon, and literally the first book is about revealing the existence of magic to Muggles.
