Started reading hell eyes at about 5pm today, didnt drop it till after midnight. Personally I have read damn near every somewhat decent HP fanfiction on this entire site, I remember running into hell eyes back in 2012; I wasnt interested in the premise at the time so I avoided it. After reading it I can conclusively say its damn near the best bit of literature to come out of this entire site.
