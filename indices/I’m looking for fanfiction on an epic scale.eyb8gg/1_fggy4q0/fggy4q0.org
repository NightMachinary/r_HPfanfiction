linkffn(Hell Eyes by Jezaray) fits the bill. In this case magic doesn't change the Earth specifically but as there are plenty of other worlds that /do/ get changed I believe it still qualifies. Very much not a crossover, all the weird shit that pops up (and there is plenty of it, believe me) is original content. Very good though.
