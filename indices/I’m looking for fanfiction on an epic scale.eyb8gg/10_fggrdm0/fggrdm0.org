I wouldn't have thought that MoR fit your criteria, although Significant Digits is certainly a candidate. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you want? Or were you referring to Battle Magic class?

Starfox5 has several rather epic tales, like linkffn(Divided and Entwined), if you like serious war, or linkffn(Patron by starfox5) for a really alternate universe.
