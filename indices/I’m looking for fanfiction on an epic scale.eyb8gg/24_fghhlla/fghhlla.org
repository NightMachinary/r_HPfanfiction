Wizard of the Kaleidoscope by OnTheImportanceOfLungs. I get the vibe that it's kinda controversial but I'll be damned if it doesn't have a huge, sprawling magic system. Probably because it's a bit of a crossover with Naruto and the Nasuverse, but you don't really have to be familiar with those fandoms to enjoy it.
