If you like Prince of Slytherin, you should give Antithesis a try: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456]]

Fair warning, it get a bit dark and heartbreaking, but it's very good.

Not quite epic scaled battles, I dont want to spoil anything but definitely worth a read. Bonus is that its complete!
