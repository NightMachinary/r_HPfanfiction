I had to google what that meant - I am totally not hip or down with the kids. When you say disturbing, are we talking like Animal Farm and Black Mirror and that Firebird Trilogy thing are disturbing, or is this more Veela's Worth and Saw kinda disturbing?

And is the Harry in 'SigDig' as irritatingly conceited as the Harry in 'HPMoR'? The whole 'I am the smartest, bow before my divine majesty' vibe was quite, quite irritating to me when I tried to read MoD.
