Ah, okay. So not overly horrifically Dark, but Dark enough to be present.

It's nothing to do with the writing or structure or pacing - I just really, really find the protagonist really, really irritating. Every time he talks it's just an instinctive eyeroll and a 'oh, that wanker is talking again, I can't wait 'til he stops'. I gave up a few chapters in and never went back. I can deal with sociopaths, depressives, and maniacs, but I just find the arrogant or the wilfully ignorant so hard to read. Kills my motivation to continue like nothing else.

Most likely, I'll either ask for a plot summary or find a synopsis somewhere and skip it.
