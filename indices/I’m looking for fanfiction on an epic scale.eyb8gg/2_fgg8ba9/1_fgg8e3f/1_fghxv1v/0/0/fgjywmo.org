Disturbing in that Muggles are chattel with only those rights that it amuses wizards to give them, everyone is subject to The Lord's whims. He will at times draft legislation by speaking an offhand sentence at dinner (every pureblood family prepares a place for him at table every single night in case he apparates in) and society generally has a pleasant veneer---if you're a pureblood wizard---that doesn't quite cover the casual cruelty that is sometimes displayed. Oh, and from time to time The Lord will take a “companion” of either sex, commonly for years at a time. Refusal is, of course, unthinkable. But it isn't played for titillation, and it is restrained in explicit description.

One should finish MoR before SigDig FOR SURE, so do that if you haven't. I would honestly say that being able to read SigDig makes getting through MoR worth it if it's not entirely to your taste. I won't go into MoR spoilers unless you have actually finished it and want me to, but I will say that Harry, while he is A main character, is not exactly THE main character of SigDig. And he is a lot wiser and humbler. A bunch of other characters get a lot of fun screen time too. SigDig is not a piece of “rationalist fiction” per se, it's an extremely well-written science-fantasy novel set in the unique and interesting (and vastly changed) world that MoR left us with. And it's important to me to note that while I am a bit of a sucker for the kind of story MoR is and have read it multiple times through, I do understand that the quality of the writing is very uneven and its overall structure and pacing are both...quite lacking. SigDig reads like a motherfucker wrote a book.
