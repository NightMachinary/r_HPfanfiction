I described Philosopher King in a discord I'm in as “Voldemort won and he fucks,” though it truly is way more than that. Synopsis: Voldemort won the first war and now rules the world as an untouchable god-king known to everyone as simply “my lord.” The world he has created is very fleshed out and disturbing, and is the main thing that I would praise it for. It is super slow-burn Tomarry, which isn't my cup of tea but does seem to be handled in a very interesting manner. It's ongoing, and currently cuts off just as things are getting truly interesting.

SigDig is arguably better than HPMoR.
