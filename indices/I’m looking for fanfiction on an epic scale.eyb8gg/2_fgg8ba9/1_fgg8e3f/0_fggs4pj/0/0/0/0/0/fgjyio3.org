Oh agreed. But I prefer to read characters I actually, y'know, like. Actively disliking a main-perspective character makes it really hard for me to keep up the motivation to read something. Especially if they're arrogant or wilfully ignorant. For background characters or antagonists, fine, but writing from the perspective of a character like that rankles my brain.
