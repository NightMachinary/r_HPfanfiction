Wastelands of time is probably this. Harry pontificates like a Film Noir action hero, drawling his way through an epic-scale time travel adventure. I don't know about power creep, because I don't really know what that means, but everything is quite overpowered and grand-scale in scope. He's also looking for Atlantis, conveniently.
