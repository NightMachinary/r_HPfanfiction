In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursley and The Chronicles of the King]] things don't reach God-levels but do eventually creep far passed canon on the power-scale. Harry starts as a real underdog, and the few times he's obliviated may turn your stomach.

Epic is a word that applies here.
