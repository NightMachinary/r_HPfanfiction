That's what I mean though. "Behaving in a way worse than would be plausible /assuming the fic is canon compilant up until whatever divergence point the fic chose/". If a Ron becomes a Death Eater after character development turning him that way, that wouldn't be bashing. But if Ron, just out of nowhere decides "yep, those Death Eaters look like a good idea to be part of", then it'd be bashing.
