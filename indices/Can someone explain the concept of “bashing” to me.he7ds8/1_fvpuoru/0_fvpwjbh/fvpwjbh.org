I wouldn't think of a Death Eater Ron as bashing just like that. For example, if he received the diary in place of Ginny and got his moral corrupted, making him join Voldemort after the fourth year, that wouldn't be bashing to me. If he decided to join them just "because why not" *that* would be bashing.

One of the consistencies I perceive in bashing is that the character concerned is always stupid and unable to question themselves. Since it's the author's catharsis/guilty pleasure, this character cannot grow out of it until and if the author has decided they had enough fun.

There's also the case of minor bashing, where the character is bashed at the beginning of the story to get rid of a flaw or force him to change his point of view (ex: a story where Harry bash Draco to demonstrate the absurdity of the pureblood ideology, leading him to a redemption arc)
