There are 2 common definitions to bashing:

- Assassinate any and all characterization of a character in favour of making them a caricature of evil. They may, strictly speaking, not actually be any worse than in canon morally, but their only purpose in a fic is to exist as a mindless foil.

- Portraying a character as behaving in a way worse than would be plausible assuming the fic is canon compilant up until whatever divergence point the fic chose. As in, a character might turn out worse than canon but "naturally" from character development, but this wouldn't count as bashing. But a character who is just randomly a worse person than in canon out of nowhere would be bashing. This is the definition I personally use with bashing.

For the latter definition, "bashing" becomes more of a dynamic scale. For example, portraying Bellatrix as a Death Eater wouldn't count as bashing since, well, she is one, but portraying Ron as one in the canon continuity would count as bashing. But a Ron the Death Eater that, for whatever reason, grew up with the Malfoys wouldn't be Ron bashing since he would have grown up with very different values from canon.

The latter is the far better way of doing it, but IMO both definitions are fic flaws. If you want to portray a person as a villain who wouldn't plausibly be one (Ron, for example), I'd much rather you explain /how/ and /why/ he got to that point with character development, because in canon they would simply not be like that.

In my experience, the most common reason for bashing is to make a non-canon ship work. For example, Harmony tends to bash Ron. The other common reason is that some tropes seem to attract bashing of certain people by their sheer presence. For example, Indy!Harry very commonly features Dumbledore-bashing and usually Weasley-bashing, and WBWL usually bashes both Dumbledore and James (and rarely Lily), and an assortment of other Order-members, mostly at random (but usually including the Weasleys).
