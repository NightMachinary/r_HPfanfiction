Most HP characters(and just characters in fiction in general) have some very unpleasant facets to their personalities that don't get focused on enough for readers to be clearly told, 'hey, that's wrong'.

Dumbledore: Manipulative, Dishonest, Controlling, Foolish, Hypocritical, etc...

Molly: Xenophobic, Slut-Shamer, Controlling, Rude, etc...

Ron: Backstabber, Disloyal(at certain crucial parts), Jealous, Rude, etc...

Hermione: Controlling, Obnoxious, Rude, etc...

Sirius: Dishonest, Hypocritical, Prejudiced, Immature, Rude, etc...

All of these traits coming out in unpleasant abundance in GOOD Characters are very annoying and don't really get addressed much. All of them have said and done some very not-so-good things and instead of being properly addressed, it's all kind of pushed under the rug and Harry(and by extension we the audience) are expected to just accept that it won't be addressed and that magically, the wronged people got over it/should get over it immediately despite the severity of being wronged.

A lot of times it's cathartic to see Good Characters held accountable for their flaws. Sometimes this is literally just holding them accountable(which many will claim is 'bashing' and 'unfair to do') and others it's just taking their most negative flaws and worsening them by 1000%(which is actual bashing depending on the context of the story).

Bashing can be very fun to read if you need a certain kind of story. Sometimes it can feel like it doesn't fit in the story's narrative though, even with characters who do a lot of bash-worthy things. Most of the time Dumbledore Bashing is my go-to but I don't want to read that all the time. Some fics don't even do it very well and just annoy me. And I don't like it coming out of nowhere and not being tagged. I read bashing fics for the 'Good Character' who is made morally bad in the fic, to get their comeuppance in a well-deserved manner, and for usually no other reason.

Also, I think a lot of us may have experience with someone who acts like the character in question does(in canon or the fic in particular) and seeing them get what they deserve is nice since irl, such people most likely WON'T be held accountable for their actions. It almost feels like you're the one getting justice in a sense.
