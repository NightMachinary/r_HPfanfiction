I think that one of the great strengths of Rowling's writing is her complex, ambiguous characters. Almost all of them are a mix of good and bad traits.

I think a lot of readers hate that about her writing. They want all characters the be either perfect heroes they can root for, or villains they can hate, so they sort her complicated characters into these two narrow boxes, filing off any traits that don't fit neatly into the “hero” or “villain” box. They feel that this simplification improves the story.

A few readers have commented on my stories to this effect: “Aargh, I can't tell if this character is a good guy or a bad guy! This is so frustrating! Make up your mind!” I'm like, “This story isn't for you. Go read something else.”
