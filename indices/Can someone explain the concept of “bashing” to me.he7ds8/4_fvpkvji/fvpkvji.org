Bashing is a way to put a fictional person down. They are not the protagonist at all. They are there to make a character, usually the viewpoint character, look good in comparison. They typically lose in every situation to the protagonist. Idk why people want to read someone constantly getting their way rather than fighting for every victory. It would make them sweeter, I think.

I want to see a fic where the viewpoint character is a kid and all the adults get /bashed/. The reality is that the child isn't winning, the adults are backing out of the situation that involves an annoying kid that just /has/ to have the last word. The child grows up and matures near the end and people talk about how they wanted to punch them in the face when they were younger because they were so bad and disrespectful.

They are glad that the main character has learned some respect and are now mature enough to hold a conversation with.
