My theory about why many authors (and readers) are attracted to â€˜bashing' fics is that it starts as a cathartic exercise, usually about a character that is held up as a person to be admired in canon but the reader/viewer notices some really negative or toxic parts of their personality and so wants to shine a light on it. I'm imaging a lot of this is driven by frustration and disappointment when things aren't addressed in canon, and that tone is noticeable in a bashing fic.

The first time I got into reading bashing fics was in the Torchwood fandom, it was Gwen bashing. I was resentful because I felt that the show-runner wanted to force viewers to hold Gwen up as the morally upstanding one, meanwhile I felt that was hypocritical & that all these other fascinating characters were left with wasted potential while the show kept the main focus on Gwen. Reading bashing fics was a guilty pleasure but it made me feel better cause I knew other people agreed and I ended up less annoyed with the canon character afterwards.
