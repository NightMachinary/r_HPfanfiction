Yeah good point, now that I think about it this also kind of covers why there is generally more slash fic in fandoms (I think someone was asking why that was a few days ago?).

The popular pairings for any non-canon relationships don't pop up out of nowhere, readers and viewers get a sense of connection and chemistry between the characters. And again are disappointed and frustrated when that's not explored in canon. Its especially annoying when you know there are all these narrow minded social and political reasons for same sex couples to be denied representation in fiction & popular media. (Yeah its getting better, but there's still a ways to go on that front).

I wonder if bashing fics end up so negative because it's mostly driven by negative emotions, whereas relationship fix-its also have an upbeat, hopeful kind of tone going on.
