If you're actively seeking it it can depend on the fandom. Sometimes it's a need to aggressively defend a character by making other characters unforgivably awful. That usually happens when there is a large schism in canon. Sometimes it's that there are two BIG FAVES and it's a mine is better than yours thing. They feel the other characters did their fave a dirty. Sometimes they just don't want that character to like the bashed character and have them reject them. Sometimes it's fandom politics. The HP fandom is weird to me because the bashing seems to come with a certain type of fic rather than the reasons I'm familiar with.
