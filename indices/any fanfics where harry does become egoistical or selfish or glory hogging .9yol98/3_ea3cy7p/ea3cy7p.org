The closest I can think of is linkffn(6050866)

Then there are fics like /Black Comedy/ and /An Old and New World/ where Harry is sort of a selfish jerk, but it's played off in a comedic way.

It would be my favorite characterization, but unfortunately in most such fics Harry is either always right or so overpowered that there are never any negative consequences for being an asshole to everyone.
