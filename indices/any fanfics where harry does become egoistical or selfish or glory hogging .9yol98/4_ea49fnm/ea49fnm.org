While not exactly what you're looking for, I could recommend "The Devil's White Knight" on ao3 - kinda canon Harry suddenly wakes up in a world where his family is alive, Voldemort was defeated ages ago, and life should be perfect... only he took the place of a Harry who was absolutely spoiled terrible human garbage, and pretty much everyone acknowledges how awful he was.. and are very confused with the change :)
