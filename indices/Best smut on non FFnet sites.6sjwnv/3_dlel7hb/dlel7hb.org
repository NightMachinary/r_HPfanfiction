Here's a couple sexy Harry/Luna stories from AO3 which I recommended a while back.

"A Life So Very Much Less Than Ordinary"

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/31644?view_adult=true]])

Harry and Luna re-encounter each other in middle-age after things fall apart between Harry and Ginny. Contains lemons, limes, and some odd background parings (Ginny/Scorpius, I kid you not). Also worth reading because we get to see Luna as a potential stepmother to Harry's kids, something you don't see in fics that often. (I think most of us prefer an AU where Luna is Harry's first wife, rather than his second.)

"Courting Luna Lovegood"

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/387057?view_adult=true]])

Thanks to a drunken incident at a party, the Wizarding community assumes that Harry had a one-night-stand with Luna (which he didn't). Everything Harry does to try and make the scandal go away only makes it worse, and of course Luna doesn't care what anybody else thinks. And, as it turns out, that's what makes him fall in love with her. Contains lemons and limes.

"In Spite of Nargles"

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2249157?view_adult=true]])

Harry and Luna have sex following a Christmas party, and it's the best sex of their lives. Not a whole lot else to say about this one's plot, but the lemon here is exceptionally well written.
