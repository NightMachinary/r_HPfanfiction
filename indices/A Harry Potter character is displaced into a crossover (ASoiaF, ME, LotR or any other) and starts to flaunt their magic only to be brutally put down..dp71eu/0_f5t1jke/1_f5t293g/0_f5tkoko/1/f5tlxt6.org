Well... the prompt is mostly about mundane, but not exclusively, people killing or defeating a wizard/witch from the HP universe. It was really to stick the middle finger to all the crossovers that try to make HP magic all powerful, when there are a multitude of ways that the story could have gone bad.

Not really about a specific fandom, although any fandom is viable for the prompt. It just depends on the imagination of the author.

So, I was not saying anything about your objection. Just clarifying the prompt.
