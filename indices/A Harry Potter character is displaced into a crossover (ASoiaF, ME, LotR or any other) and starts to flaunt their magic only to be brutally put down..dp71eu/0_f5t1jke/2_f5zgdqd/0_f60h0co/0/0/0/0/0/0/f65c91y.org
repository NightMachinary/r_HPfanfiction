I think it's extremely unclear. On one hand, the elves are supposed to be people, on the other hand, they actually go up against Valar and Maiar, who take what forms they will after having entered the world voluntarily.

I would say it's simply that the Silmarillion world is incompatible with the Worm world, so that we should never pit Scion against a Balrog, other Maiar, a Vala, or against first age elves. Instead, if we want the Silmarillion/Worm we should let something left behind influence things, like say, a Silmaril being washed into shallow water by Leviathan, or a Palantir being found.

Scion as a powerful being in a diminished world which the powers have not visibly intervened for a long time. An alternative could be to have him be a descendant of Ungolianth, so that he can in fact go up against the Valar and that's a reasonable idea considering his goals and philosophy.
