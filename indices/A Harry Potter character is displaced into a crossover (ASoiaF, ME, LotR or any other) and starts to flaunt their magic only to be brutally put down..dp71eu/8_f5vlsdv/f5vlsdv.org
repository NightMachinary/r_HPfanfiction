As others have already said, a truly competent HP wizard with a wand would be pretty hard for the ASoIaF characters to beat, but an /incompetent/ HP wizard would make things interesting. I'm imagining a 3rd/4th year Neville having to overcome his timidity and lack of a good wand to survive in a very cutthroat world.

Or even instead of an incompetent wizard maybe just somebody who hasn't had that much training. A second year Hermione determined to end all the misogyny in Westeros has a very limited tool set with which to implement changes, which would make things interesting especially if the author didn't do some kind of cop out where Hermione invents a bunch of her own spells, discovers OP! magic, etc.
