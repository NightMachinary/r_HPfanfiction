You are completely wrong, I'm afraid. Wandless magic canonically exists. Remember how a young Tom Riddle bragged to Dumbledore about being able to levitate objects, control animals, and other things? There you go, consciously directed (i.e. not just accidental) wandless magic.

There's also further elaboration with Pottermore's supplemental lore that the wand is a European invention, and not universally needed to use magic.
