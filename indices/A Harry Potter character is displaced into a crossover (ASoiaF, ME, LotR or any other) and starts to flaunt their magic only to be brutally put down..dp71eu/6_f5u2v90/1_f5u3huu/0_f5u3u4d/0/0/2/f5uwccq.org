Wandless magic is a definite thing, but most wizards can't manage it. It's usually accidental magic that is wandless. An easy way to write a balanced ASoIaF fic would be to have the character break their wand or lose it. Then you get magic in an unreliable state. There's also magic in that world that you could tap into for story purposes.

Who even knows how the magic of the Night King and the Children of the Forest would compare to Harry Potter magic? You could write that however you want.
