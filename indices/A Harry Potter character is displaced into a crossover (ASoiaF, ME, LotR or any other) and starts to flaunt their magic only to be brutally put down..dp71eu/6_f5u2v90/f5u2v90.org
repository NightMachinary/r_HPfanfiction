Harry remembered the beozoar he kept in a secret pocket on his robes, having prepared for such an occasion, and as his vision blurred and his throat closed off, he fumbled it from the pocket and shoved it madly into his mouth, attempting his best at swallowing it whole.

Edit 2: explained how he could swallow when his throat was closed.
