Ah, the good ole ASOIAF is too realistic for your overpowered protagonist prompt. Good thing Varys used his powers of omnipotence otherwise we would be dealing with a /harem/ "comedy".

In all seriousness asking for a stomp on a HP Wizard feels like a Star Wars VS Star Trek prompt that only ends with people taring their hair out. Sure a Wizard is just a human and subject to basic mortality but they still have reality bending powers.

Besides, this is Game of Thrones, a more reasonable outcome is that Harry is suddenly buried underneath several dozen Lannister and Tyrell cousins, as every family in Westeros suddenly realises that the new hand of the king has inheritable powers.
