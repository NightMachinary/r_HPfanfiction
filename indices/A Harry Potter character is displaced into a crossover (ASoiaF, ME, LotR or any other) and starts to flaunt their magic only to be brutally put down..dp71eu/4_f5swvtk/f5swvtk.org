I plan to write a story where our favorite trio get thrown into Azeroth by a fucked up spell that turned into a malfunctionning portal, with a realistic take on their abilities at 18 yo. Mostly for the fun of seeing them struggle in a ruthless world where nobody speak english and where most areas of the planet is hostile to humans.

Not sure if there will be deaths among them still, but that's the fun of it. Might roll their survival in dangerous situation like in DnD maybe, that would avoid the annoying plot armor.
