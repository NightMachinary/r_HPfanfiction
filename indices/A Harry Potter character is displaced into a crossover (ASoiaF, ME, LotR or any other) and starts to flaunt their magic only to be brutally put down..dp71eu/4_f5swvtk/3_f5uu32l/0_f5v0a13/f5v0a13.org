True, I had 3 major ideas for now :

- A few hours before the Cataclysm, somewhere like Darkshore or Stormwind for maximum Deathwing glory.

- Legion on the Broken Shore but during the attack on the Tomb of Sargeras, preferably when the giant portal for Argus opens. (Or right at that moment, for the giant space rift could be a valid explanation for the teleportation of the trio across the worlds)

- Or in BFA, either in Darhshore shortly before the burning of Teldrassil or later, throw them in Nazjatar for shit and giggles.
