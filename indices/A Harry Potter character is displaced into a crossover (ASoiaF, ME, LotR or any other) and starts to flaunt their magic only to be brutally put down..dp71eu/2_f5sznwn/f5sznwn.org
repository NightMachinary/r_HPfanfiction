HP Magic is way too powerful for ASOIF, as nobody can stop a dark!Harry apparating around under disillusionment charm and AKing pesky enemies. He can confund, imperius, and obliviate anyone he feels like it. And when it comes to killing enemy armies or mobs, just unleash Fiendfyre and apparate out.

Those medieval Muggles have no chance against HP wizards in their full power, and especially not when that wizard is dark and can keep up in the ruthlessness department.
