Further reading into the history of the world of ice and fire shows that magic in the world is powerful, unpredictable and horrific. Sure the characters and organizations in the parts of the world that are shown in canon are pretty low on magical power, but Harry would have a much harder time of it in Asshai or basically anywhere with mysterious and dangerous magic about. There's literally entire continents that are uninhabitable to humans because of the magical dangers awaiting there.
