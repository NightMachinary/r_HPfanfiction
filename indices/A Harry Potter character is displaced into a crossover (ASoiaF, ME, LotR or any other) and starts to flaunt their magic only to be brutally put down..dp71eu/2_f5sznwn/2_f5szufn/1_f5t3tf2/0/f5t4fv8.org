Ehh... first of all, anti-muggle charm? You mean the one put upon the Leaky Cauldron? How would people find his home then? It makes sense for a retreat, but not if he actually wants to live in a muggle society. Wards are overpowered in fanon, in canon there are very few "wards", apart from the ones on Harry's home and not every wizard is an expert on everything, mind that.

Why would Dark Harry be an expert on Legillimency? Even Snape, who was definitely quite proficient didn't know every secret of teenage Harry (who had no idea what Occlumency even was and was never good at it later either). I think you think too much about fanon and the OP magic that fanfiction writers invent. Consider this:

A wizard comes into a world. Starts to cast magic. Gets a crossbow bolt, sniper shot, plasma beam to the back of his head. There are tons of other such scenarios I can imagine. Magic is super useful, but a single practitioner, without a society is very vulnerable. This is not magic vs muggle, but a single wizard in a non-magical world, which can end disastrously for the wizard.

EDIT: It's difficult to get a bezoar when you're dying of poison, as the incident with Ron showed. Wizards are just humans with special abilities, they are not immortal.
