Sure, but a Bezoar is good for any Muggle poison.

He doesn't have to worry being assassinated in sleep either, since one anti-Muggle charm is enough to keep any Muggle assassins out. Of course, there are magicals in this land, but that's what other wards are for. Burning down his house will not get him either because he can just apparate out.

Assuring the loyalty of his underlings is no problem: dark Harry is of course an expert in Legilimency, and he will regularly test them. For a wizard, currying favors with the population and gaining loyalty from people is easy too: food can duplicated, diseases and wounds can be healed, destroyed things can be reparoed, and true guilty ones can be identified.

As I said before, HP magic is way too powerful for this place.

For someone like Harry and Hermione, who also happen to know about modern Muggle technologies and social engineering, a country under their rules will quickly become the undisputed superpower.
