That's hard to say outright. When /effectively/ used, Harry Potter magic would be incredibly hard to defeat for Westeros, but they only have to get lucky one time to take him out.

It's not like we've seen wizard vs muggle battles in canon, which makes it hard to be completely certain. You're right that it could be applied in a way that makes it basically impossible to beat in a fight, but getting cocky, falling into a trap, poisoning, assassination.. there's always a possibility something goes wrong.
