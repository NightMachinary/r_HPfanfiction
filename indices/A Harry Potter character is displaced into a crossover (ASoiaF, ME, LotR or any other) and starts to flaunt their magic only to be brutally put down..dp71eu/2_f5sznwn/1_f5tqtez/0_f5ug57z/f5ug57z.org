I think you're partially right in that the only way Westeros has a chance of taking out a fairly-powerful wizard would be for them to get too cocky.

With the premise of a Dark/Indie!Harry with a wide knowledge of magic, there just aren't any avenues of weakness to pursue if Harry is even mildly paranoid. Assassination is impossible when Harry is wearing clothes with permanent shield charms enchanted on them (canon) and potentially other useful charms like the bubble-head and flame-freezing and such.

He can secure his home with muggle repelling charms and/or a sufficiently high enough age line, either of which would be impenetrable defenses.

He can ensure his entire staff/employees/etc aren't planning to betray him through weekly imperio+obliviate sweeps, which would have the handy side effect of making it impossible to discern /how/ he is rooting out any spies.

Poison would probably the biggest concern since it seems to be pretty dangerous even in the HP world (though the efficacy of muggle poisons on wizards is unknown) but practically, Harry can just use human transfiguration and apparition to eat anywhere he wants without anyone's knowledge, so unless his killers are willing (and have the funds) to poison an entire city he'd be pretty safe.
