Have you read it? For Emperor, literally the only thing the protagonist has in common with Harry Potter is the name and appearance. I did say it's what I first thought of, but don't really recommend, as the only thing it has in common with a Harry Potter fic is the name. I really mean it could change the name and get published as original fiction.

Technically, you could say Lily is a genderswapped version of Harry Potter, but when does it end? The morality, mind, personality, upbringing, even looks, when every single thing about the character is different, till when do you call it a gender swap?
