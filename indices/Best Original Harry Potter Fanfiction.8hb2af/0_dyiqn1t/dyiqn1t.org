Inverarity is my favourite fanfiction author, so forgive me if I just list both of his creations:

Male Protagonist:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided]])

This story follows the first generation to enter Hogwarts that was born after Voldemort's death, and the ever increasing tension between the different houses. The protagonist is Teddy Lupin, so technically not an OC, though he may as well be. However, the vast majority of the cast, including the three other co-protaginsts are OC's.

Female protagonist:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]])

A series of fanfictions of which 4 are currently complete that follow a cast entirely of OC's, including the protagonist, set in wizarding America during the same time period as /Houses Divided/. Like the Harry Potter series, each book follows one year of the protagonist Alexandra's education at Charmbridge Academy. The first book very loosely follows the outline of /Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone/, but after that the series diverges pretty quickly.
