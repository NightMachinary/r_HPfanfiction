I would have to say linkao3(11284494). Male protagonist, and one of my favourite novel length fics/series. Its set mostly modern with one major and 2 (so far) minor parts set in founders era hogwarts, with very well written characters all around. I've never enjoyed an OC protagonist so much. Does have a distinct, important ship, but the pairing fits in around the story, not the other way around. First 3 or 4 chapters are a different POV, but that slides quickly and naturally to Nizar once the set-up is complete. There are a sprinkling of different POV parts throughout, but its all done very naturally and doesn't feel jarring like some fics/books.

It doesn't fit the letter of your request as the main character is a canon character that was sent back in time and lived with the founders until he was put into a portrait to revive in the modern era. However, except for part 3 (set in founders era) there is very little of the canon character left after 1000 odd years and growing to adulthood in the 900's and its such a well written fic, I thought it should be included.

I rec it to everyone, its fantastic :)
