  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing.

  All Harry Wiggins ever wanted was to follow in the footsteps of his world-famous namesake and attend Hogwarts School for witches and wizards. But all is not what it seems for young Harry, who must learn the secrets behind his unusual abilities. At least everything will be fine when he gets to Hogwarts... won't it?
