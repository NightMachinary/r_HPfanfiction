Linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919796/1/]]) - I liked this one. An interresting mistery, enjoyable little fic overall.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2581495/1/Blackwand-Chronicles]]) - Sadly abandonned (or in a /very/ long hiatus...), just as compelling as anything else written by S'tarkan.
