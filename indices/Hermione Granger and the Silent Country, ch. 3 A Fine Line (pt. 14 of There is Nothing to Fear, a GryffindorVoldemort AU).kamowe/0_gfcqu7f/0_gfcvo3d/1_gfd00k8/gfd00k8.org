Yeah, I definitely got the feeling that Draco is a Hufflepuff because his parents would not want him in Slytherin.

Lucius might not be this far gone yet but it wouldn't entirely surprise me either if they've made it clear to (or will make it clear when it becomes a real concern) Draco that when he marries, it'd be unwise if that person was from one of the traditionally pureblood families. Maybe they're not so far gone* as to say muggleborn but a halfblood wife could be in Draco's future.

*far gone here not meaning that marrying a muggleborn would be bad, but from the vantage point of where they started...
