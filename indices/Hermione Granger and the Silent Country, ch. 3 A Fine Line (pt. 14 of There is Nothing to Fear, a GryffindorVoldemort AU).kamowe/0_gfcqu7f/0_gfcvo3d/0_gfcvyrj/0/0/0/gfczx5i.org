They're /alive/, but they're not doing extraordinarily well. Riddle chose to make examples of just a few people, and the Weasleys were too poor and too political irrelevant to be useful for this purpose.

Most people who opposed Riddle were let off. This had a lot to do with presenting a magnanimous face (look at how decent Riddle is, letting bygones be bygones and offering absolution to former enemies so long as they accepted the new order), but also with practical realities:

1. Wizarding Britain is smaller than some civil parishes, so Riddle doesn't have the buffer to just slaughter his way through everybody who didn't side with him.

2. Purging the government in particular would also destroy a lot of institutional knowledge.
