  But why must Kingsley be renamed?
#+end_quote

Kingsley's father was part of Dumbledore's faction and, what's worse, "Shackebolt" is a very pure-blood name (they were listed as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight).

One of those might have been okay, but not both, so Kingsley took his husband's name because it was politically safer to be a Crabcatch than to be a Shacklebolt.

This is the same reason why Draco is a Hufflepuff---His parents (especially Lucius) impressed upon him how important it was that he go anywhere other than Slytherin, because Slytherin was associated with blood supremacy and the Malfoys didn't want to send the wrong signal (Lucius in particular is /terrified/ of Riddle. He knows that Riddle knows that he only changed sides because it was prudent, so he's desperate to avoid giving Riddle any reason to tie up loose ends).

  And Dora seems like a top Death Eater
#+end_quote

Yeah. She's got strong family connections to Riddle's camp, and her metamorphmagus talent /really/ made her pop up on Riddle's radar. Besides the obvious practical value of her talent, it's also a kind of a literal instantiation of Riddle's "if you fully become the mask, then anyone who wears the mask becomes you too, and so, as long as the mask remains and someone can pick it up, you will never die" philosophy (I almost wrote "theology," which...may be appropriate as well, lol). Ordinary people need to wear a mask in order to shed their normal face, but Tonks can become somebody else at will.

Riddle was Tonks' mentor through all of Hogwarts, and she remains very close to him. She's also dissociating a bit, because Riddle encourages her to think of "Nymphadora Tonks" as no more real than any other face that she might wear, but this isn't easy to pick up on from the outside.
