I was always annoyed by the potter(claysmith) etymology usage in fanfics and decided to have the first potter be the son of a christian viking king(Harthacnut) who banishes him for being magical and he's cared for by a witch and her potter husband. I then found out the potter name came from a +king+dude called 'the potterer' and realized i got close to canon by accident.

Edit: strikeout
