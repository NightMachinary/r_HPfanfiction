Of course though I'm not sure what to add. I'm not great at short summaries. The main character is raised in the wizarding world so he'll be in the opposite position to what Harry was. It will generally follow the main points of the books. But from the perspective of a slytherin. It starts before the sorting. And has some main character in all four houses.

If you want to know anything more specific please ask. Or PM.
