I've been bedbound for the last four years and this story in my head is what's kept me sane. I'm actually writing it down for a friend of mine who is sicker than me. And while I'd love people to read and like it, a large readership isn't why I'm doing this one. I understand what your saying though. Thanks for the input anyway.
