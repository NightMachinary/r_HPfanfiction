Harry died as a baby. So while main points in the story still happen they happen to other people. I will admit that not all the main things in the first book have my OC involved but some of them do and from the 2nd book onwards pretty much all of them do.

Apart from the action, a lot of it will be friendship and house dynamics. Following someone who is having to tread the line between all of the different factions, as the years go on (like Harry) he gets more and more intwined with what's happening.

My main character is a pureblood who knows that when Lord v comes back he won't be able to sit on the side lines so he has an active part in the whole thing. His family was involved with the last war and everyone knows it.
