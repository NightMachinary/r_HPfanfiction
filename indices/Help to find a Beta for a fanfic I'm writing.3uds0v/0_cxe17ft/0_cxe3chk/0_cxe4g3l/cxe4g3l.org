Ok, first question gotta be: how are events going to unfold if Harry isn't in the story?

Also, what are you focusing on? Given that for the rest of the students most adventures of the trio didn't have too much influence on their daily lives, there are between one and 4 interesting events per year for a normal student.

What is your OC doing that makes reading anout him interesting?
