  Two possibilities (alluded to by JK iirc) are necrophilia and cannibalism. Maybe they prevent the person from leaving limbo like some kind of Death Note. Regardless, they're horrific.

IIRC, there wasn't anything specific, but rather a throwaway line by Rowlings's agent or some such, who felled sickened by it when Rowling told her.

The thing is, that's a pretty low bar. Necrophilia and cannibalism --- they can add extra squick, but frankly, I think that they don't work thematically: the revulsion involved is physical and not moral or spiritual, and they are not that much worse than plain old murder most foul without them as follow-ups.

This is getting into the headcanon territory, but in a moral (rather than indifferent) universe with immortal souls, the very intent to create a horcrux compounds the original murder. The evil of it comprises:

- The /act/ of murder most foul itself: I don't think a horcrux would take if the death is not one hundred percent intentional on the part of the murderer and unwanted on the part of the victim.
- The /intent/ to mutilate one's immortal soul --- what makes one human --- on purpose and with full knowledge, rather than out of ignorance and as a side-effect of a common crime.
- The /hubris/ (in the Ancient Greek sense) of not accepting one's own mortality and passing into the afterlife, but instead instead presuming to obtain immortality on one's own terms; and the additional hubris of entertaining the belief that one might actually succeed in doing so.
- The /sense of entitlement/ that one is so important, that one is entitled to murder another and commit crimes against nature to prolong one's life.

Put together, I think that the deliberate act of making a horcrux is evil enough in itself in Potterverse that it doesn't really require any extra accoutrement to make it repugnant. Merely committing an unjustifiable murder and then just willing, essentially, that a piece of one's soul be stored in a phylactery of some sort, compounds the original murder sufficiently that the soul is torn the rest of the way and a horcrux created. Of course, this is getting deep into the headcanon territory.
