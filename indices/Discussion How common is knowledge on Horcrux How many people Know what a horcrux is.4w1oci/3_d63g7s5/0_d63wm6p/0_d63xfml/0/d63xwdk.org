I didn't know that. I'm glad that I am not alone in my headcanon. :)

  I'm just saying that there needs to be something there that makes making a horcrux worse than murder. Even worse than wholesale murder.

I think that in Potterverse metaphysics,

EvilOf(Murder + Intent to Make a Horcrux) > EvilOf(Murder)

and even

EvilOf(Murder + Intent to Make a Horcrux) > EvilOf(N * Murder)

even for a pretty big N, so it suffices to make the horcrux. (Heck, there's even some canon support for that, in that Voldemort's soul fragment settled in Harry's scar without any extra actions on Voldemort's part.)
