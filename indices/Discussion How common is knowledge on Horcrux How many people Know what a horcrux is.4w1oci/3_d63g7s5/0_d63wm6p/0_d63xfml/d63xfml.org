I completely agree. My favorite rendition of them is in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slyterin series where the Horcrux is like a Patronus.

To cast a Patronus you have to concentrate on your happiest memory. You need to have a certain mindset.

For the Horcrux ritual, you must have the mindset that out of all lives, yours is the only one saving. Basically you must never ever regret murdering someone, which is extremely evil.

(The fic actually expands on this, for example Fendifyre requires the mindset that to kill whoever you're using it on any amount of collateral damage is acceptable)

I'm just saying that there needs to be something there that makes making a horcrux worse than murder. Even worse than wholesale murder.
