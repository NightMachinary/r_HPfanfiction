  You never know. Voldemort could've transfigured one of his stem cells into a sperm cell. If they can turn mice into teacups, I'm pretty sure they can move some proteans around.

I highly doubt that any witch or wizard (particularly in Wizarding Britain during the 90s and earlier) had/have any idea what a stem cell is.
