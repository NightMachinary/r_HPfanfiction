Hmm. I always thought that Snape was included on the "in the know" list. I presumed Dumbledore filled him in during the time he was having Snape treat his cursed hand. It would probably be important and relevant info in order to brew a potion to slow the curse. Additionally, the knowledge would lend weight to his request that Snape kill him. I always read that conversation Snape had about Nagini as playing along to the very end the image of obedient servant who only knows what his master wants him to know.
