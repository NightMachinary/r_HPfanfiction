Well, from canon we know that there used to be books on horcruxes in the Hogwarts Library (presumably the Restricted Section) until Dumbledore became Headmaster in 1955 (according to the Lexicon). So, theoretically, it can be anyone who had permission to peruse the Restricted Section before 1955 and is still alive. However, from Slughorn's memory, it is implied that it is something not many people know of, and Tom Riddle/Voldemort in that memory calls it a rare piece of magic.

In canon, until Harry is told, we know outright that Voldemort, Slughorn, Dumbledore and Regulus Black all knew what Horcruxes were. How Regulus Black knew, we will never know, but that is probably why people assume that Sirius would know. To the tentative list, I would put Grindelwald (the evil Dumbledore) and probably whoever the Head of the Department of Mysteries is. Sirius hated Dark Magic all his life, so I doubt he learned what one was growing up, but it is still possible. For some reason, though it is incredibly implausible and unlikely, I have the thought that Aberforth might know. They're mentioned in some books from the Hogwarts Library (or were, at any rate), so whomever owns copies of those books AND HAVE READ THEM would know. But if a book called /Magick Moste Evile/ says that it will not speak of them, well, I doubt there are many, or any beyond /Secret of the Darkest Art/.

It is far easier to know who doesn't know. Voldemort would not have trusted one of his horcruxes to someone who knew what one was, so the Lestranges didn't know, and neither did Lucius Malfoy. Because the Lestranges and Malfoy couldn't know/be told, no Death Eater other than Regulus probably knew what one was. Snape didn't know of them either (from The Prince's Tale, that conversation about Nagini proves this).

EDIT: So in conclusion, effectively nobody.
