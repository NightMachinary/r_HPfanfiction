If I recall correctly, there were only mentions of the word horocrux but no actual explanation of it in the books because of its horrendous nature, hence why Riddle had to sweet talk Slughorn into letting him know. Also, yeah barely anyone except those who were craving for power as much as Dumbledore used to back then with Grindelwald and Slughorn being a friend of Dumbledore and most likely helped out in the old Order of the Phoenix during Grindelwald's reign, pretty sure 99.99999999% of the wizarding world doesn't know of its existence
