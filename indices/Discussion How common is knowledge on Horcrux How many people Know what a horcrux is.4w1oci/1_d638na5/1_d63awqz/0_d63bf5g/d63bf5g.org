  Knockturn Alley

I'm not a fan of the whole "Knockturn Alley is where you go to get everything illegal and super rare/super evil stuff thing." It's the Wizarding Britain version of late 80s, early 90s Compton.

As for Durmstrang, well, I didn't really think of it, but the comments about them and Dark Magic teaching is hearsay, if I remember right.
