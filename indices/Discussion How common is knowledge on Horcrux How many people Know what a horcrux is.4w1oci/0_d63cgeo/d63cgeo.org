Realistically, no matter how available the information is, we have to assume it's a very, /very/ small group of people simply because no one knew or hypothesized that Voldemort would have them. If it was even close to common knowledge before or during his rise everyone would have known about them after his death, and definitely after his resurrection. If you include Dumbledore, Slughorn, Voldemort, and Regulus, I honestly wouldn't say it would be more than seven or eight people in all of magical Britain would have known without Dumblefore telling them. I sincerely doubt any of the Death Eaters, the people that would generally be most interested in such things, would have known because Voldemort would have killed them to make sure they didn't start spreading the information around or start making guesses about whether or not he might have one.
