I think the fact that Voldemort was so certain of his immortality means that he himself was convinced that only a very small number of people in England knew about them.

Also, we know from HBP that he asked Slughorn if he knew what horcruxes were when he was still a student, so I imagine that the Hogwarts Library would have contained books that mentioned the term (which is where he would have discovered their existence), but not much information about what exactly they were and how one would make them.

I think in those books it might also have been presented as "magical theory", something that someone had /allegedly/ managed to create before, but that there really was no proof of it ever existing. So even if someone had read the entire Hogwarts Library when the books were still there, they probably would have a hard time believing that Voldemort could have created even one horcrux, much less seven of them.
