I know one story where it was pretty much down to Harry, Hermione, Ron and Voldemort (everyone else who knew was dead - according to Dumbledore before he died. And Dumbledore had spent years trying to track down the written knowledge and destroy it).

Anyway, they decided the knowledge was so dangerous, that Hermione and Ron requested that Harry obliviate the knowledge from them. The word itself, and the basics of what they were.
