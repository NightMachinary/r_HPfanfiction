World in Pieces is a fic where Canon!Harry, immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, gets pulled into an AU by an Order that's on like their fourth Harry Potter. It's been awhile since I read this, so I forgot a good portion of it, but I remember enjoying it and that a line from the AU Dumbledore went something like: "In your world, Voldemort was insane. This one isn't."

PS: while there are no Drarry scenes, the AU!Draco was romantically involved with one or more of the AU!Harry's that have passed away. However, the Harry who is the protagonist has no interest in Draco and doesn't ship with anybody in the story.
