Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Edit: I guess I need to explain this cause someone downvoted me. Voldemort in HPMOR is not only relatively sane compared to canon, but crazy smart. Like master manipulator smart. I don't want to spoil it, but the gist is that however smart Harry is due to his upbringing, Riddle is just as smart.
