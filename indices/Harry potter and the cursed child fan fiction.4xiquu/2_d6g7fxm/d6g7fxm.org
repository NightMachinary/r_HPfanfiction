Well it seems to me that if you've got a story fighting its way out, you've got to go with it and get it on to the page. But I admit I have started on a sort of fix for the Cursed Child, but it's so complex, I'm really regretting that I even started it and I'm frustrated that it's keeping me away from my original stories. But I will finish it and get it out of the way.
