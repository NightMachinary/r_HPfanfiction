Not really :( I've been reading one fic after another non-stop since November 2010... I suspect I've read hundreds of fics at this point.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4229739/Veronice][Veronice]] may have written one of them? Harry is definitely borderline immortal in these, but I don't recall why, other than that his amount of magical power keeps growing endlessly. This fics are pretty fucked up and disturbing, just FYI.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything][30 Minutes that Changed Everything]] might also be one. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] too.

Maybe ask over on DarkLordPotter?
