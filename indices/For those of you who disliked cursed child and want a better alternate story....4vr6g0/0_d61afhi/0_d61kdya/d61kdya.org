I agree that it's readable, and makes an effort to stick to canon characterizations, for sure, but browsing though the early chapters... something about it the way it focuses on detail more than plot and character makes it seem not very mature to me. Example. We fans like the nice, interesting names like Albus Severus and Lily Luna, and would naturally get a kick out of every time they're discussed or mentioned. But realistically, nobody introduces themselves with their middle names. That's why JKR herself couldn't stuff them all into the epilogue and had to tell us the names in interviews. If a fanfic can't resist from focusing too much on that, it's not a good sign...
