Just a review from someone who read the first three or four books, then sort of gave up: it was okay. It was definitely readable. If someone wrote passionately about how "book 7 will blow your mind, dude, you just have to push through" I probably would. But I found the entire plot of book 3-where albus essentially can't do magic because he got a second wand for dual wand use and his wands don't like each other-really silly and irritating. There's some cool magic and potions in there, and some interesting thoughts on wand lore. I always like seeing adult Harry and Hermione and Ron, so that was a pleasure as always. Solid 6-7/10. The 'kinesis' thing never really bugged me that much. It's different from cannon magic. Butoso are a lot of things.
