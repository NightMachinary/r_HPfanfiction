It's not though. Why the fuck would people not want to know the titles? People like to know what they're reading. Maybe they've read them already, and don't want to again, or they're already on the To Read lists. In addition, the bot shows the summaries, so they will know the proper order, the summaries, favorites, follows, and number of reviews, all of which affect whether or not they want to read them. Plus there is the access to downloading the fics.
