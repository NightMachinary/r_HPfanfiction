You know what, I've seen this before. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][The Infinite Loops]] is a big crossover fanfic series by multiple authors. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3761766/10/The-Harry-Potter-Omake-Files-Innortal-Style][one of Innortal's Loops]] (some of the first, so a bit of early installment weirdness abounds), Ron and Hermione are Awake (aware of the time loops) but only remember one where Harry was a Dark Lord. Short snippet though.

There's also The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl, linkffn(12141684) . I haven't read the end of it, but one of the plot points is that Time-travelling Harry and Hermione are used to an evil version of Ron rather than the Unspeakable (or whatever he was, I don't remember) that's found their way into their universe.
