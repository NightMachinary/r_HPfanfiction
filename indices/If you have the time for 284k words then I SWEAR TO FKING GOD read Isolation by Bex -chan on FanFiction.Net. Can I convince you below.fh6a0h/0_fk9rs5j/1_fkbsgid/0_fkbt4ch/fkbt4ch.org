Alright. As a person, romance does not appeal to me. That said, I /will/ read romance stories and enjoy them if they are well written and have an appealing plot.

Isolation has neither of those things.

While I certainly /am/ biased, it's not that I despise romance (though I won't go searching it out), but that it simply doesn't appeal to me on its own.

I suppose when I stated

#+begin_quote
  I dislike romance
#+end_quote

I could've been clearer, and said instead

#+begin_quote
  I dislike romance as the sole plot of a story
#+end_quote

I hope this satisfies.
