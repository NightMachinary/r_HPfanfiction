/TL:DR at bottom/

Alright. So a while (like 8-10 months) back I decided to try and read the top 10 HP fics sorted by favorites. I made it through Isolation in about 12 hours, and then stopped halfway through NoFP. So, having read it, I can say with experience. */It is not good./*

From what I can remember (keep in mind this way almost a year ago, and I'm not willingly gonna open this fic again), the entire premise boils down to “Draco is bored of cursing out Hermione, who wants to ‘cure' him, so he asks for a book. Hermione gives him a muggle book, which he enjoys, and then they fuck.”

Now, the plot is simplistic, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's a romance story, which don't always need complex plots. It's the way that Isolation goes about its plot that bugs me. Draco is captured by the order (iirc) and they need someone to look after him. Hermione, after much deliberation is like “yeah sure” and takes him to the Head Suite at Hogwarts or something. Proceed with fic.

Here come the problems. A: Hermione actually cares to give a shit about Draco's well being, in a remarkably out of character move. B: Draco is actually willing to fucking change his opinions about this shit. and C: there's a few scenes, where Draco just lies in bed /listening to Hermione showering, and jacking off./ And that just makes me uncomfortable.

To top it all off, the writing seems overly forced to be romantic, the “strong manly body” and “shining blue orbs” included, which just naturally puts me off of the fic.

So, to rank it... 3.5/10. Methods ranks it at a 3/10, since I didn't even bother finishing it, and NoFP, at a 4/10, cause what I did read of it was actually okay. For the other Top10 story I've read, OGNA, that's a solid 7.5/10, and I'm Still Here (technically #11 but NoFP got deleted) at an 8/10.

Closing thoughts: I'm biased, dislike Draco as a character, Hermione as a pairing, Dramione as an idea, and good!Draco as a possibility. In addition, I dislike romance, and dislike the overly prosey writing.

*TL:DR - I'm biased, but it's bad.*
