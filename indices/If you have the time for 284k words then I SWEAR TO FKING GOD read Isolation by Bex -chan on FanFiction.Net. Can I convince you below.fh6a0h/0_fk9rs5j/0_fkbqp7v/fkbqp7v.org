I enjoy pretty much everything that you dislike --- Draco, Dramione, romance, and so on---but we're more or less in complete agreement on this one. Most popular pairing fics often end up being based on the specific tropes and characterization fanon chooses to latch on to and I feel like this one is no exception.

If someone's in the mood for a lengthy romance novel feature a good girl/bad guy pairing, it isn't the worst choice. That's... about the best I can say for it.
