linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/137248]]) is one of the best fics I've read that shows the Trio's relationship (and their developing romantic relationship as well). I found the emotions really shone through in the writing - the aftermath of the battle, the hesitancy of a changing relationship - it's well done. I thought it captured the characters well and there are some very sweet moments.
