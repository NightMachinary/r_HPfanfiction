It's for the catharsis, I suppose.

For example, my college friend collects Ron-bashing fics for fun. She told me Ron reminds me of her high school best friend, a chap who professed #foreverfriendship, only to betray her by convincing the rest of her "friends" to shun her.

Seeing Ron get bashed for his year 4 disloyalty, his support of Harry's pariah status, really strikes a chord with her. It's escapism, seeing the traitor get what they deserve.

Really, I can't blame her.

Bashing isn't inherently the sign of a bad writer; it is just a more unforgiving point of view. It's therefore easier to go overboard and alienate the character's fans.
