Funny thing is, if you had removed the Weasley Bashing you would probably already have lots of recommendations.

Here are some:

linkffn(8769990) this one bashes Ron and Molly, and somewhat Ginny(in her defense her mistakes are because of Molly)

linkffn(13133746) I don't recall how much this one does it, but it may be exclusive to Ginny and Molly.

linkffn(12155794) This one starts 5th year and I like it, even if it doesn't focus on the romance too much.
