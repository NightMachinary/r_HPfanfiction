In one of my not-published oneshots a character of mine stumbles through Bergen in Hordaland and, as Bergen harbours quite a few Metal bands, comes upon a scene in which /they/, in full gear and make-up, are preparing to leave for a Gig. Naturally my character smells that there is a plot afot and follows, and then, so as not to miss anything, sits through two hours of */Gorgoroth,/* and somehow he finds the music /oddly/ good. Not good-good, but it is nice to hear. Later he meets a few more bands, and then the scene wraps up.
