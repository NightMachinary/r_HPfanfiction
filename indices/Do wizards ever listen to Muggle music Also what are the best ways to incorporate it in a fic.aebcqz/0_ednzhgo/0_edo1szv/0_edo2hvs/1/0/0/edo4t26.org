If you take Pottermore (JK Rowling's written bits, at least) as canon, it is! A muggle ended up accidentally taking a Portkey to a Celestia Warbeck concert, and even got invited up on stage with her. They were Obliviated afterward, but there were still some imprints of the concert in their memory, and they later made a hit muggle song that was uncannily similar to one of Celestina's.
