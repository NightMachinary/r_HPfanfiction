The movies aren't canon. They are head canon acceptable at best. If it isn't in the original works, the books, it isn't canon. If there is any contradiction, the books win. The simple fact that it isn't in the books also means it isn't part of canon.

Sure, you are free to pull some ideas from movie into your head canon, but those ideas are only in your imagination. At best, they are theoretically possible.
