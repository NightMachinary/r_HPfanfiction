Dumbledore's chocolate frog card says that he enjoys chamber music (classical pieces composed for only a few instruments), knitting patterns, and ten-pin bowling, so there's obviously some crossover in entertainments. For my own part, I would hate to see the characters form a band [no doubt to raise money to save the house-elves!] but I'm delighted to include a school-only radio station playing music from the 80's and early 90's.

And polkas.

Because Peeves and polkas just make sense.
