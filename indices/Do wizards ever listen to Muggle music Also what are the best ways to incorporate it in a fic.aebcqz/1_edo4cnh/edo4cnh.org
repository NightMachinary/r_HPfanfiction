One of my favorite uses of muggle music in a fic is in /The Boy Who Died A Lot/. Snape sort of becomes an ally to the Ford Anglia after it runs wild in the Forest. It communicates by playing snatches of different songs. I make it sound horrible, but it's hilarious. (FYI, that's a Snape/Harry story, but if you don't like slash it's still worth reading, at the very least in part, for a number of funny and creative moments.) linkao3(670548).
