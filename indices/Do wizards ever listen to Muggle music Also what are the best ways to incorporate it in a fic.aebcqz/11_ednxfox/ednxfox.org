I've had this idea in my head with Harry growing up learning to play an instrument and sing growing up (maybe have Mrs Figg as a music teacher of sorts). And then once he goes to Hogwarts he starts a band with a couple Muggleborns playing various covers of muggle bands at feasts and social events (Yule Ball, etc.).

Outside of song fics music rarely plays a big role though.
