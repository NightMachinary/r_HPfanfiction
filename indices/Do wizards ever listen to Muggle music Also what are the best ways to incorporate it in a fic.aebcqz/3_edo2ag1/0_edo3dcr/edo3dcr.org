yeah muggleborns for sure. sort of always wanted Harry and Hermione to talk about muggle music together at somepoint...have some bust up about blur and oasis (harry potter is set in 90s uk so it shouldve come up lol) only thing i forsee stopping those in all magic familes are by some form of magic barriers like hogwarts that disrupt muggle tech so maybe radios or cd players dont work so they have trouble getting into the music... but i suppouse they could just go into nearby towns/villages and listen to stuff there.
