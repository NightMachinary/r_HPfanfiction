Radios might work if you have an EMP protected one. Or not, it depends on your interpretation of "magic interferes with electrical circuitry"

One thing which is guaranteed to work is mechanical record players (early 20th century) because they don't require electricity to produce sound. You would just need to get the music pressed on a compatible record, but that should be doable (even if you might need more than one due to the smaller "memory" of older records).
