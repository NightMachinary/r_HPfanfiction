HPMoR, or Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality has two main premises: Harry grows up in a loving family raised by Aunt Petunia and Professor Verres, and Harry has increased logical skills and by the age of 11 is attempting to live a more intelligent life. The story is really well written and it is going to be completed in two weeks, so you don't need to worry about it being incomplete. There are moments that are genuinely funny and real plot twists that are hard to predict. The biggest reason I read it is because the author aims to make the characters rational; they don't do stupid like in the original books just to move the story forward. Harry is more powerful, but then so are the baddies. There is a lot of effort to cut out or explain away things in the magical world that make no sense. The downsides are few. There are many philosophical instances in the story where one of the sides to the debate is the author's fear of death. It's more subtle than it's made out to be and certainly not an effective piece of propaganda if that is what it is accused of. There are other criticisms of HPMoR that end up being explained by really crucial parts of the story, so in order not to give spoilers, I will just say that it is worth keeping an open mind and not assuming things. Tl;dr well written, suspenseful and sometimes funny, long story where all the characters act more rationally than in cannon. Would recommend.
