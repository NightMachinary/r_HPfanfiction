I /don't/ think it descended into shit (I still very much like it) but I think Notosk could be referring to how it gets notably less funny/more serious after the first few chapters. It starts off a little like a crackfic in some respects and if you're reading it for the funny stuff, that starts to tail off after a bit, to be replaced by more action/tension/science.
