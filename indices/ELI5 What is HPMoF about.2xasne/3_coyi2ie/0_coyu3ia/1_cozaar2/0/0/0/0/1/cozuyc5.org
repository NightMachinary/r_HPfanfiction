If we ignore for a second the fact that the intelligence of these three are explained in the story in much more detail than just "hey they're smart", I think you underestimate what a child prodigy is. Our world has seen, not one but tens of documented children making nuclear reactors by age ten. Kids who play chess at grand master level by age 10. Some people are really that gifted. It's really insulting that you don't really consider them to be real.
