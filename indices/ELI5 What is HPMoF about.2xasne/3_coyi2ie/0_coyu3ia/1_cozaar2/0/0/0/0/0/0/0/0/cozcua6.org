Yeah the writer certainly has an inflated sense of himself though. He didn't finish high school and has no other formal education, he is clearly smart and entirely self-educated which is impressive enough, but the only person who can say how clever he is...is him. Frankly from his writings he isn't as clever as he thinks and he has said several times he writes Harry as himself...a fully grown adult, not an eleven year old. Oh and Hermione and Draco not having much range at the start makes it much worse, they have had less than a year to go from intelligent eleven year old to as smart as most adults, it's totally absurd. Although that goes back to the horrific pacing.

And no I can't offer specific examples as there is very few individual things I can remember from a story I haven't read in a month or two. It's the combination of the whole thing really. He simply knows more information than any eleven year old could even if they studied 15 hours a day with no breaks.
