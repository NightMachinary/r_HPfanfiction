Fun story.

Harry is a genius fighting other geniuses.

A shame the author has to insert so much of himself and go off on random tangents. He clearly has a hand for suspense. Read it with an open mind. At some point, you either buy into the idea that magic can be rationalized or you just ignore those portions and enjoy the moments with genuine tension.
