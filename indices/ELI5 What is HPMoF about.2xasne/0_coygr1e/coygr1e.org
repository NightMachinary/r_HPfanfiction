(I assume you mean HPMo*R*.) Basically, Harry is a genius, and he does various genius things, such as:

- Doing experiments with Hermione to investigate the nature of magic

- Befriending Draco and trying to convert him away from pureblood supremacy

- Violently disagreeing with Dumbledore's view that "death is the next great adventure" and actually sympathizing with Voldemort's fear of death

Quirrell is /also/ a genius--/apparently/ evil, but it's hard to tell--and takes Harry up as his protege.

The story appears to have something of a hatedom around here, since it's a giant propaganda piece for research into immortality and artificial intelligence, the author has asked for donations to the research organization for which he works in author's notes, and lots of people find genius!Harry to be a stuck-up self-insert Gary-Stu. Still, even though it's propaganda, I find it to be an extremely enthralling read.

The author says that the story will be completed on March 14th. You can download ebook versions of it [[http://hpmor.com/info/][here,]] if you want to read it offline.
