  “A complete revamp of the course from top to bottom. It'll be called ‘Self-Protection' class. I also found a classroom within Hogwarts that perfectly caters to my needs, and is impervious to the jinx placed on the Defense Against the Dark Arts. It'll be a completely different course, and for the better. You'll see.”

Harry Potter magic isn't semantic. It is symbolic. Surface level changes like this would not affect such a curse. Self-protection is synonymous with Defense. The curse is on the job, not on the room in which it is being taught. And so on, and so forth.
