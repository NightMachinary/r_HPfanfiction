Agreed. I've seen this "just rename the position" trope several times (usually though it's Hermione-Sue wow'ing Dumbledore with her brilliance) and it's always smacked a bit of cocky FF author outwitting 'genius' Dumbledore to me.

No offense to OP, and I also completely agree with [[/u/howtopleaseme]]. I'd definitely keep reading this story.
