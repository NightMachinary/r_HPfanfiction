It will eventually be a Harry/Luna romance, but for now, their relationship is similar to what you're describing. Luna's no superhero, she's not a seer, and she's not some sex-pot. She's just a lonely little girl who can't understand why people make fun of her.

Just a warning - the same way that Luna is not a Mary Sue in this story, Harry is also not a crusading superhero who immediately recognizes what she's going through and curses every student in Ravenclaw before giving a long-winded speech about how bullying is wrong :D
