I really don't. linkffn(Defiance) has guilds, but it's poorly done (also the most cliche Daphne Greengrass in existence).

I've read a couple others over the years, but I can't for the life of me remember. One had guilds like unions. The other was the Dark Lord's equal, which used it as a throwaway line.

I lean towards the apprenticeship being the best route of Post Hogwarts education, although having guilds be like unions also seems neat.
