Personally, I enjoy the mastery and apprenticeship path mainly because I can see some basis in canon first like you said.

For mastery, I can certainly see the Auror programs as qualifying for this, considering you require further training like both McGonagall and Tonks state in OOTP. You'd likely even have to shadow a senior Auror, sort of like in the police force, which could qualify you as an 'apprentice' of sorts, or mastery even (give the definition of 'apprenticeship with oversight'). Healers too could fit into this, considering they likely have to also undergo additional training in order to be fully qualified, even if we don't know much about what they have to do after getting their NEWTs. If Healers operate similar to our own doctors, they'd have their own 'residency', which is like an apprenticeship in its own way.

I have seen apprenticeships more in fanfiction to be honest, but I haven't actually found any fanfics with guilds yet. Do you have any good ones you recommend that explore them?
