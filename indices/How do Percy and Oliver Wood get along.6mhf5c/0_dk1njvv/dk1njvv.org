Everything we know about Wood can be summed up in one word: Quidditch. So, he's probably disappointed that Percy either doesn't play, or isn't very good (especially when you consider Charlie and the twins, who were all either pretty good or damn good at their position).

I have no idea what Percy thinks of Wood.
