I've read a story once where Percy was actually the seeker they were planning on using before Harry got the position because their previous one just graduated and Percy sucked the least of all people. I know it's not canon, but I like to think that it is a possibility, and as a possibility it would indicate that Percy and Oliver got along fairly well.

That said, many people take the fact that Percy likes rules way too far. Certainly, he prefers order to chaos, but that's most likely because he'd had to deal with the twins' annoying antics as one of their prime targets (the other being Ron) and not because he has a stick up his arse.
