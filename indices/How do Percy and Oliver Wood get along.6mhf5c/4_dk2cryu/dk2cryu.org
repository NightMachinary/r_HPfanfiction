I'd probably expect Oliver to be rather annoyed by Percy. I think they'd clash due to quidditch, with Percy's strict adherence to rules leading to times when Gryffindor players might miss practice due to detention or the like that Percy got them into. And I'd imagine Percy would look down on someone who would put playing a silly game above academia.
