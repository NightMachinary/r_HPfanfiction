Two thoughts:

1. If Hermione violated the Geneva Convention, I don't think that the GC would be doing anything but having a smoke, a brandy and failing to stop smiling for upwards of a week. 😉😁😁😁😁😁

2. 'Hermione "Violates the Ginevra Convention" Granger' sounds like an EXCELLENT title for a Hermione/Ginny slashfic where Ginny goes to Hermione for help and ideas on how to please Harry in bed (once she finally makes her effort to bag him and because if you're looking for advice by someone who's read up on such things - you KNOW that she's read all sorts of sex-related things, both magical and No-Maj... hey, I'm an American! 😉), and in the, er, 'distribution of knowledge'... things move from the written to the practical applications portion of the lesson faster than either girl ever expected. Somebody needs to run with this idea like, ten years ago! 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
