I'm pretty sure it could be written in such a way that its just a moment of insanity on Harry's part that just pushes him to do it and everyone else just going with it out of panic and herd mentality. And then it kinda just snow balls from their with Harry making it up as he goes and character traits in others like Ron being a strategist and Neville growing a back bone rearing up because of the adversity of the whole situation.
