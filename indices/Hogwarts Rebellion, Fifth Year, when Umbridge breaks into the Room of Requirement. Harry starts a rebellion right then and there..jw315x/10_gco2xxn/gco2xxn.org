"Expelliarmus!" Harry's spell came first, disarming Umbridge as Hermione, Ron and other members took care of the Inquisitorial Squad.

Just as the professor's wand was flying away, another expelliarmus hit the woman, just seconds after his. This one came from Neville, and what happened next stun everyone to their places.

"Oh by Merlin!" It seemed like the expression had come out of Hannah Abbott, and it was totally valid, because the scene before him left Harry speechless.

Dolores Umbridge was curled on the floor, crying in pain after the second disarming spell reached her. Her very underpants had seemed to explode and now there were massive amounts of blood between her legs.

Harry turned to Neville, "Neville, Neville, What did you do?!"

But poor Neville was stunned in his place. He was pale and looking in shook at what he had just done.

Hermione was paralyzed, her had on her mouth as Ron seemed about to get sick.

"It can't be..." Cho whispered.

Everyone had stopped fighting, even the Slytherins. All eyes were on Umbridge who was bleeding up. Everything would go awfully wrong if she died, and they needed to know what had happened.

"What did that clumsy boy did now?!" Terry Boot asked.

"He blasted her bits away, that's what!" George yelled.

"Way to go!" Zacharias Smith shouted, but his triumph was cut short by Harry's hard look.

He didn't have time for Zacharis though. He needed to fix this, and soon.

"Neville, what di you do?" he repeated, this time shaking him.

"I-I-..."

"NEVILLE!"

That seemed to bright him back. "Nothing! Expelliarmus, as you taught us..."

"Then why... I don't get it..."

Umbridge barely raised her head from the puddle of blood to look at Harry. "You troll head. You don't get it? I didn't have a wand anymore. Your first spell made sure of that."

"Expelliarmus doesn't do this!"

"You don't get it Mr Potter." the professor said barely able to pronounce her last words, "It disarmed me. I use sex as a weapon."

Then the woman fell to the floor.

The silence extended for what seemed like forever.

"What the fuck?!" Ernie shouted.

Then, they realized their professor was not dead yet. She raised her head, blood spilling out of her mouth. "I used this weapon with your friend, Mr Lupin. He helped me get dirt on Dumbledore... that sexy Half-breed."

The woman collapsed again.

"Lupin?" Ron said, "Bloody hell! He had been shagging---"

"Ron!" Hermione stopped him.

"She did though," added Ernie.

Once they had time to process that, the Slytherins returned to themselves.

"You so did it this time! Pottah!" yelled Malfoy.

Before Harry could answer or even process what had just went on, Umbridge raised her head once more. And everyone gasped in horror.

"Your father heard about it too, Mr Malfoy, " said the professor, "My little weapon. Hope yours is not as pale and small as his."

The DA laughed. "I wouldn't laugh if I were you Mr Corner. I did your father too, at the same time than Miss Patil's.", her head went down.

"Is she for real...?!" Fred added.

Then Umbridge raised her head again, causing more gasps.

"Oh sweet merlin!" Lavender Brown complained, more annoyed than surprised this time.

"Shut up you impertinent bimbo," said Umbridge, "I did your father too, and uncle, and grandfather.... and mother. She has a birthmark on her left butt cheek... in the shape of a troll's bugger."

Lavender looked shocked.

"Stop that laugh Mr Crabbe and Mr Goyle!" UMbridge yelled, terrifying the boys. "I did not shag your parents," that seemed to relax the boys, but only briefly, "They were too busy doing one another."

Laughs erupted as UMbridge hit the floor again.

Everyone stood on their places for very long, staring at the body of Umbridge on the floor. Waiting, and then waiting more, and then some. Still, she didn't raise.

"Is that it?" Justin Finch-Fletchley asked.

Harry turned to Ron, who shrugged.

"Thank Merlin," said Marietta.

Then they waited more.

Harry sighed at last.

And she rose.

"Someone kill her already!"

Umbridge turned to Harry, "I did Hagrid as well. Big Hairy bum, that one."

And Dolores Umbridge fell again. tens of wands pointed at her, waiting. But she rose no more. She died, with the ghost of her last kinky laugh drawn on her face.
