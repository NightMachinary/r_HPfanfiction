A thirty-year-old Rose Weasley stormed into her old house in a hurry. She was out of options, she knew it was forbidden but she didn't have anyone else to go to.

Once inside, she hurried upstairs. She knew it was October, so no one in Hogwarts age would be around. When she opened the bedroom door, she was shocked aplenty, for suddenly completely destroying the timeline didn't seemed as the worst of things anymore.

"Oh my god!!" she shouted as she stepped backwards. Trying to ignore the grunts and moans.

The naked bum in front of her stumbled and fall on the side of the bed, "Who the hell!!!??" her father shouted.

"Oh god, oh god, oh god.... that didn't happened, that didn't happened!" Rose forced her eyes shut as she looked away, trying to obliviate herself into unconsciousness. Yet she couldn't. Even with her eyes closed all that she could see was her father's sweaty bum going at it. All that she hear was her mother's hurried yells.

"Who are you and what are you doing here?!" Rose's mother shouted. She had hurried to cover herself with a sheet and had her wand firmly pointed at her now. She was panting and her hair had never been more tangled.

Rose raised her hands, and very slowly turned the lights on. Trying to stop herself from seeing any more flesh.

"R-Rose?!" her mother said, "But... you're supposed to be in school, and..."

"Way younger, I know." Rose said pulling a golden chain out of her shirt.

"A TIME TURNER?! But what did you do?!" her mother frowned. With the lights on, she could see the scared face of her father, who had his wand now, as well as a pillow over his lower half. Not that Rose hadn't seen way more than she wanted of that already.

"What did I do?! I travelled through time by accident and don't know how to get back. What were YOU doing?!"

"Er... shagging?"

"Ron!" Rose's mother said, her face way redder.

"What? Is our house? Can't we go freely at it at our bedroom now?"

Rose huffed, "I just came at a random time, expecting you seeing the telly or something, which is what I imagined you did while I was at Hogwarts and I happened to find you like... like this...? That's just my bad luck."

"Not bad luck, just the odds. When we're at home and you're at Hogwarts, we're usually here...!"

"Ron! Too much information!" Rose's mother gritted between teeth, then turned to her daughter, "We... we'll help you, Rose. I'm really sorry you saw that, but you can't really blame us... it's just that..."

Rose looked at her surprised, were they really at it that often, they must be on their late thirties at this time. "What? You have fun here five times a week whenever Hugo and I were away, oh don't mind me. I understand."

"Four times a week," her mother said without thinking.

"Seven," her father added.

"Ron! Okay, seven." her mother sighed.

"Some days twice." her father added with a stupid smile, and got a pillow thrown at him.

"Oh, why did I even asked?!" Rose complained.

"Come on Rosie, everyone is inside! And me and your mother have some good--"

"Don't you dare finish that sentence... and don't "Rosie" me when you're starkers!" Rose said, then noticed something, "Everyone inside?"

"Yes, Rose, there's a pandemic going outside. People at both governments are looking into it." said her mother.

"So it's 2020? 2021?"

"2020,"

"Oh, the first year of the pandemic, okay."

"FIRST!!!?" both of her parents yelled.

"Yeah, plenty of things you don't know. Like me marrying Scorpius, or the Canons finally winning the league."

Her father jumped in joy, letting the pillow fall, "The canons! when? how many wins? Who was the coach?!.... wait... Scorpius?!"

"Dad! The pillow!"

"Oh, yes, sorry."

"We'll help you Rose, with every thing. Just wait for us downstairs and we'll be down in 5 minutes." said her mother.

"Or twenty..."

"Ron... we're not going to..."

"We we're in the middle of something here, and she has a Time-Turner, why didn't she arrived an hour later?"

Rose throw him a menacing look.

"OKay, OKay, 5 minutes," Ron said with a snort.

Rose made for the door and accidentally kicked a jar. "Oh, sorry... I'll pick it up, wait... honey?" turned to look at her parents confused.

"It was for later... your mother likes that." Rose's father said, and her mother looked away guiltily, her shoulders and face turning crimson.

"Ugh!!!" Rose complained as she put the honey away with disgust and exited the bedroom. Halfway through the stairs, she noticed that there was some honey on her fingers. "You better have not used this jar yet!" she screamed.
