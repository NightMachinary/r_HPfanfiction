"Wands up!"

Almost as one, the DA raised their wands. He could still see some trembling but most were determined, and Harry guessed most were kind of expecting this to happen.

They finally heard the odious voice say, with the same sacharrine tone, but with an undertone of cruelty.

"Bombarda Maxima."

"Shields!"

The wall exploded, but the dust did not reach them, instead.

"Aspiro!" Hermione shouted while waving her wand in an intricate motion, and a wall of wind raised in front of them and pushed the dust back, eliciting many shouts of surprise from those that were outside, who began coughing and sneezing.

After a moment of surprise at the clever use of the spell, Harry decided to act.

"Fire!"

Suddenly a dozen red spells left their wands, some impacted the wall but others hit their mark as they heard others shouts of surprise and the sound of people falling on the ground.

"What's this, Rebellion! I knew it!"

There were some return spells but the older students on the front blocked them with their shields or even deflected them back.

"Again!Fire!"

Now almost every member of the DA fired a stunner, more than doubling the amount of red bolts, and with the dust almost settling almost all of them hit.

When it finally did, they saw only four people standing Umbridge, covered in dust and with a furious and scared expression on her face, two Slytherin upper years, and Malfoy, who was hiding behind one of them. All looking more than a bit bedazzled and with shields in front of them.

Before Harry could order them to fire again, Hermione stepped forward, "Surrender! It's over!"

Umbridge turned to her, wand raised, even more furious, "How dare you! Little Mudblood! I will put you in your place! Cru-"

She moved her wand, but Susan was faster, stepping forward with a murderous expression.

"Fulgur Hasta!" she stabbed her wand forward like a sword and a spear of yellow gold lighting was launched out of it with a crack of thunder.

Umbridge's shield broke like glass and she was launched back to the wall with a scream, falling down to the ground, twitching, and smoking.

"Bloody Hell!

The two older Slytherins took a moment to react, shocked by the brutality of it, the same situation most of the DA was in. The one in front of Malfoy sneered and twirled his wand.

"Avada-"

But Harry, Fred, and George were faster, the Twins launched a blue spell with a simultaneous shout of "Arietes!" one for each upper year, shattering their shields, Harry hit the attacking one with a Stunner and with a second spell hit the second at the same time Ron's own stunner did.

Malfoy was cowering and looking around at all his fallen comrades with terror.

"Y-You, you can't do that! My F-"

"Stupefy!" the spell hit him with such force he too hit the wall and crumbled, unconscious.

Everyone turned to Neville, who was still holding his wand firmly. He looked at them, a bit of his nervousness returning, "What? I can't bloody stand when he goes on like that! And he still had a wand."

There were some chuckles, before Ron turned to Susan, "That spell was wicked! Where did you learn it? Why didn't we practice here?"

Susan blushed at all the eyes turned to her, she looked a bit winded"My Aunt taught me, for... emergencies, and well..." she gestured to the unconscious group outside the room, almost everyone nodded.

Fred and George also chipped in, with Fred saying, "The same thing for us, Dad taught us that one." His brother nodded in confirmation.

Hermione was looking around more than a bit bewildered at not only how blas√© Umbridge had been at using an Unforgivable on her, but also how quick the other students were to fire back against a government official.

"Well, it's done now, what's the next step, Harry?"

Harry looked surprised at being asked, but before he could complain, the look on Hermione's face made he think better, '/I did put us in this mess, I guess'/

/"/Well..." he looked around to see if anyone had an idea, but they all looked back at him expectantly.

"Okay, let's...talk to Dumbledore and..." he looked to Umbridge, who was still smoking, but also breathing, "Take Umbridge and her toadies to the Hospital Wing, I guess."

Hermione huffed but nodded, Harry turned to Fred and George, who nodded before taking Lee Jordan and the Gryffindor Chasers to begin levitating the unconscious people in the hallway.

"What about the other Slytherins?" One Ravenclaw asked.

Harry thought for a moment, "Go to the Heads of your Houses, they will know what to do, we are going to talk to Dumbledore, and now he will have to act.

With nods, the DA moved to continued their "rebellion."

***

Dumbledore didn't look that surprised when they revealed the existence of the DA, but was very much so when they told him about Umbridge and Harry saw Dumbledore truly furious for the first time.

***

Minerva, Filius, Pomona, and Aurora, arrived at the Dungeons to a weird, but not surprising (according to Aurora, the only one who was a Slytherin) scene, all the more "suspicious" Slytherins were bound and gagged in the middle of the common room, surrounded by other students, mostly those who were half-bloods and of foreign origin, but amount them were also Blaise Zabini, Tracy Davies, Daphne, and Astoria Greengrass and surprisingly Hestia and Flora Carrow.

"Good evening, Professors, our housemates started getting a bit too agitated and we had to take steps to, protect ourselves, know that Slytherin House is with Hogwarts, always."

Minerva McGonagall looked around the scene, her eyes stopping on Tracy Davis who was polishing her nails while supporting her feet on one of the bound students.

"I see."

***

Professor Snape was "captured" so he could "convince" Dumbledore he had nothing to do with it and that the Dark Lord had nothing to do with Umbridge torturing the students.

***

That same evening, Minister Fudge was surprised in his office when he opened the door to see Albus Dumbledore, Amelia Bones, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Rufus Scrimgeour there, accompanied by other witches and wizards, among them Aurors, Wizengamot members, and some parents from Hogwarts students, all with their wands in hand and not looking friendly. He noticed Dumbledore was holding (more like almost crushing actually) a black quill inside of a piece of cloth.

"W-What is the meaning of this?" he asked deciding to forego any posturing.

Dumbledore looked at him, and the Minister of Magic(if he still held the post) found himself taking a step back, the expression was neutral but the eyes were cold and sharp, the light blue looked to be glowing, and /definitely/ not twinkling.

"Good Evening, Cornelius."

Cornelius Fudge had been a politician long enough to know that tone meant he was fucked.

Well, he thought to himself, at least if You-Know-Who is truly back(he must be if Dumbledore resorted to this) then he is fucked too if Dumbledore is looking like that at /him/.
