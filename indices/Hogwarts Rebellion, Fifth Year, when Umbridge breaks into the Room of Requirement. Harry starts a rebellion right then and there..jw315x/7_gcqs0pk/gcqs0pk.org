The sound of cracking came again, and the sound reverberated through the walls, the first crack appeared on the mirrors.

"Harry?"

Harry turned to Neville, who was looking at him with a concerned and somewhat fearful expression.

"I think the gig is up, lads." Seamus said.

"Must be Umbridge and her Squad of Morons." one Hufflepuff said.

"More like Squad of Cun-"

Another crack interrupted Fred before Hermione could.

"So, do we surrender?" A Ravenclaw asked, turning to Harry, others soon followed him and Harry found himself gazing back at the mixture of concern, fear, and terror of the DA.

He knew what Umbridge was capable of, and that those that supported her could just as cruel, he looked at Colin's bandaged hand, and thought of his own pain.

Harry wasn't dumb, a group of armed wizards practicing combat magic in secret, he knew exactly how Umbridge and the Ministry would paint this, and the name, Dumbledore's Army, how could they have been so dumb.

Another blast and now dust fell from the ceiling and lights flickered, the mirrors had broke and the crack on the wall was much bigger, it would be at any time now.

And for some reason, Harry remembered his history lessons from Muggle school, on WWII and Germany, and with a speed he was only accustomed to see when he was in danger, he drew parallels between what was happening. What Umbridge was doing, he couldn't let that happen and they would have to stop her themselves, the teachers and Dumbledore were useless.

All this took a few moments, but many saw Harry's face harden in determination.

"Wands up! Like we practiced. We will fire on my command!"

Hermione's eyes widened, "Harry! What are you doing!? We can't ju-"

"We /have/ to Hermione! Can't you see what she's going to do to everyone here?"

"But she's with the Ministry! The government!"

"So were the Nazis, you read about that right?"

Hermione reached the same conclusion as his did, and she paled, before steeling herself.

The older students went to the front, along with, strangely, Susan Bones, who whispered to Hannah before nodding to Harry, "I studied Muggle history too, Harry. Auntie made sure of it."

Fred and George flanked the trio, Ron was pale, but nodded with determination nonetheless.

Another blast and Harry saw parts of the wall had already fallen, he idly noticed the edges reforming, but not fast enough.

"Alright, this is it, we know what Umbridge wants, and we knew what she would do if we were found, anyone that doesn't want to fight can go to the back of the room.

Harry was more than a little round when, after exchanging glances, everyone, even if some were shaking, positioned themselves around the door.

"We are with you, Harry!"

"Let's kick their arses!"

"Always wanted to hex that toad!"

"Let's see if her death eater minions can put their galleons where their mouths are!"

Harry felt himself getting worked up, his muscles getting ready for action, his magic flowing.
