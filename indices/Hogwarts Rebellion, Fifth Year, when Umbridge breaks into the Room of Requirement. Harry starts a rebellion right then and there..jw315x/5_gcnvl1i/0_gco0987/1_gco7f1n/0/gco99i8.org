That might be so, and could be enough to make things go sideways but then again, if you were doing the magical lordships and more politically based story line, The fact that so many heirs, probably from different political blocks/factions banded together and putting aside family obligation grudges and straight up feuds to take down one "person" would raise enough of a political uproar that even Fudge's anti-Dumbledore spiel would be drowned out entirely.

And then again, the fact that kids are being tortured, should be enough to get the people riled up enough so that the government really couldn't do anything to suppress or mitigate the damages. Pretty sure the possibility of being lynched is enough that a person's survival instincts kick in to the point that politics really don't matter anymore. Throwing Umbridge under the knight bus would be the best hope for Fudge at that point which would still allow him if he was cleaver to keep his position and keep on with his anti-Dumbles crusade
