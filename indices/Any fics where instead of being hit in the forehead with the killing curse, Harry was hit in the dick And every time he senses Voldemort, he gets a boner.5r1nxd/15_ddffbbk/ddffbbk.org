Well, whenever Voldemort experiences extreme emotions, Harry always feels his scar prickling and rubs it.

Imagine him furiously wanking off and saying, “Oh, Voldemort must be really angry right now!”

When his scar starts bleeding everyone's like “Harry, I didn't know you were a girl!” and “/Psst! Harry! I think you're on your period!/”

The worst part would be when the horcrux in him would have to die. Truly horrific. Even if he refused to have his dick undergo such a painful process that would probably leave his dick forever mangled, it would still be a horcrux then. Voldemort would have to possess his dick because it's the only horcrux of his left, and probably give Harry a boner at the worst of times and cause an inability to become erect when he needs it.

Now that I think about it, there's /no/ way this could end happily.
