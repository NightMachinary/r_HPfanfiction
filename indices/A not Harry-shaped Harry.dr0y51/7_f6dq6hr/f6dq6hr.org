*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have soul-bond type stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup. Very fluffy.
