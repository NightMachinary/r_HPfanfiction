Yes! I just want to read a story where she gets called out for her various shortcomings! Where she has to fix mistakes. She attacks Ron, have Lavender report her to McGonagall. She goes behind Harry's back with the broom, Harry explains the lack of trust. She confunds McLaggen, Harry cancels tryouts and reports her to McGonagall, because being an asshole does not excuse rigging tryouts as well as attacking a person. She harps on about the half-blood prince, Harry retaliates by mentioning the spell with a life sentence. Hermione is far from perfect.
