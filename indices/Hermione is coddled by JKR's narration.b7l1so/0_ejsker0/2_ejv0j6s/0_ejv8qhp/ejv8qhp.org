There could have been a sidestory where the Trio are on a fruitless hunt for horcruxes while Muggleborn are being rounded up. Hermione could be feeling guilty about running away on an adventure with her friends instead of helping Muggleborns resist or flee Voldemort's regime more directly. Taking out her frustrations on the boys and after a big blowup she leaves. She re-unites with them fighting against the snatchers. It has potential.
