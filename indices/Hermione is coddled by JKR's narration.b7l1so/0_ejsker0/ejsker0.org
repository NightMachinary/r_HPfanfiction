I agree... Hermione is a great char, but as the series went on she sort of took on this "the person who accomplishes everything" role.

Partly it was for narrative convenience (don't know something, or need to do something? Hermione's read about it somewhere!) but I also think the movies subtly influenced the writing of the books. You get a lot more "Ron's a doofus" and "Hermione is perfect" moments in the later books, after the movies had started coming out.

There were moments where Hermione WAS presented as, if not in the wrong, then at least not handling things as well as she should have. She botched the entire house-elf liberation thing, because while her goal of ending slavery was noble, she spent all her time telling the house-elves what they wanted instead of listening to them.... and of course, she was dismissive and at times directly hostile to Luna just because Luna had ideas that clashed with Hermione's. But nothing ever came of this. Luna has no problems counting Hermione as one of her closest friends even though Hermione didn't really do anything to earn this...

...and the story with the house-elves looks like it's going somewhere, but then it just sort of doesn't, and in DH Hermione is suddenly the one who knows all about what it was like for Kreacher, and Ron thinking about the house-elves in the Battle of Hogwarts is treated like this big moment for Ron.... except this doesn't really match with how things have been up until then, because Ron has been a lot better with house-elves than Hermione has. He gets along with them, he compliments their work, he gives Dobby presents. He even gives Dobby his socks to be buried with. While he hasn't been all "end the slavery," he's related to the elves on a personal level that Hermione plain hasn't done. Showing concern for them and not wanting them to be hurt in a war is perfectly consistent with how Ron has been with house-elves this entire time.

But somehow DH had to twist this to Hermione having been right all along and Ron needing to learn another lesson. Huh.

I do think you're right... Hermione was never actually forced to confront her own flaws the way Ron and Harry were. Either the flaws were quietly ignored, or she turned out to have been right all along.

In my opinion, Hermione's bigggest and most consistent flaw is that she does not consider other people's feelings. It's more important for her to be RIGHT than it is for her to be considerate. The narrative does include a few token scenes where people rightfully get upset with her because of this (no, Hermione, when someone is crying because her pet rabbit has been killed, that is NOT the time to "logically" point out that Divination is flawed!), but beyond those token scenes there really aren't any consequences for Hermione whatsoever. On the occasions when there are, it's usually turned around so that Hermione is presented as blameless or at least in the right.
