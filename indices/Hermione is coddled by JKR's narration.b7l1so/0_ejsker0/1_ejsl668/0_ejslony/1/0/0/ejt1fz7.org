With regards to "Anglo-Saxon", its widespread incorrect usage actually led to the EU Court of Auditors issuing guidance on its use in EU publications:

#+begin_quote
  In English, the term ‘Anglo-Saxon' is generally used to describe a member of any of the West Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons and Jutes) that settled in Britain from the 5th century AD. Also, particularly in America, it is used to denominate white people, usually of the Protestant faith (‘WASPS'), thus excluding large swathes of the population of that country. It follows that there is no such thing as an Anglo-Saxon country, or, as in the example below, an Anglo-Saxon agency or Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Furthermore, the Anglo-Saxon language ceased to exist in the 12th century (I am ill-informed about Brussels, but the last known speaker in Luxembourg was St Willibrord, 658-739). This term is particularly inapplicable (and, I gather, irritating for those concerned) when used to describe the Irish, Scots and Welsh, who partly base their national identities on not being descended from the Anglo-Saxons (everybody seems to have forgotten about the poor Jutes), and verges on the ridiculous when used to include West Indians or people like the incumbent US president, who, in EU terminology, would be the leader of the Anglo-Saxon world.

  Example

  "The Anglo-Saxon group of agencies reflect (sic) the previous dominance of Anglo-Saxon capitalism which was not disrupted by two world wars and the specific operational issues relating to Asian economies."

  Alternatives

  ‘English-speaking' when referring to the countries or the people, ‘British' and ‘American' (‘Australian' or whatever) when referring to agencies, capitalism etc. The term may, however, be used if you are talking about something like the (presumed) ‘Anglo-Saxon conspiracy' and you will often find it used ironically in this way in the British press (usually in inverted commas). However, it has negative connotations and should be avoided in any serious writing.

As for "Caucasian", its use to mean "white" is just wrong, being an example of completely outdated anthropology (its origin in meaning "white" was as part of an anthropological theory in which all humans belonged to either the "Caucasian" or "Mongolian" races). The fact that it's commonly used in the US to mean "white" does not really make it more correct. It just makes a lot of people wrong :p
