  As for "Caucasian", its use to mean "white" is just wrong, being an example of completely outdated anthropology (its origin in meaning "white" was as part of an anthropological theory in which all humans belonged to either the "Caucasian" or "Mongolian" races).

I feel like the only people who should be called "Caucasian" are the people from the Caucasus Mountains.
