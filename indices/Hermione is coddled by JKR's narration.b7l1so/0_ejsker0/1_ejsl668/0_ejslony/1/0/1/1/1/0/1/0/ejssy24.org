It doesn't matter if the British haven't been anglo-saxons for a thousand years if everyone calls them that anyways. I'm fairly certain that's not the only instance of words having a different meaning than in the past ;)

Now of course if the English-speaking world doesn't use that term in this "wrong" way then it shouldn't be used when speaking English, but since it isn't used as an insult either (AFAIK) I think it is a rather forgivable mistake, especially when you're from a country where that term is common.
