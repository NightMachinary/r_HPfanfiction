I think you're getting a bit confused between nationality and ethnicity.

A white British citizen with Italian heritage is of British nationality but of white Italian ethnicity.

Becoming a British citizen does not change your ethnicity. Calling Hermione "white British" is perfectly sufficient as an ethnic descriptor.

  Edit: Further, northern Irishmen are not white british by your definition, nor are people from the Hebrides, Anglesey or Skye.

That is correct. "White Irish" and "White British" are separate answers to the ethnicity question in the UK census.
