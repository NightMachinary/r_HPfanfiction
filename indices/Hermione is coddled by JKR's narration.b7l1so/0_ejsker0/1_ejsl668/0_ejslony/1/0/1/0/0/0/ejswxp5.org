If white American means an American who is a white person, then why would white British not mean a Brit who is a white person? There's plenty of Brits from Italian heritage that are still white and British.

Edit: Further, northern Irishmen are not white british by your definition, nor are people from the Hebrides, Anglesey or Skye.
