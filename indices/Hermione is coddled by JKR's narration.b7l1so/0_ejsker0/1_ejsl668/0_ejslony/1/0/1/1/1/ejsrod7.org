The French use of "Anglo-Saxon" to describe British folk (originally) and our general ethnic identity is (or was originally) a slur, a derogatory term roughly similar to how a certain generation of Brits called Germans "Krauts" and French "Frogs".

In a discussion about racial slurs, I'll be damned if I'm going to be "corrected" on not liking the use of such terms.
