  The French use of "Anglo-Saxon" to describe British folk (originally) and our general ethnic identity is (or was originally) a slur, a derogatory term roughly similar to how a certain generation of Brits called Germans "Krauts" and French "Frogs".

The equivalent pejorative for british people would be "limey", not "anglo-saxon".
