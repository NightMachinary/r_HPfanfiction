In french, "Anglo-saxon" is also (and more commonly) used to refer to "western" modern societies stemming from the former British Colonial Empire. It usually bundles the US and the UK, along with English-speaking Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

This doesn't mean that these countries are culturally identical, of course, but they do share some of their history and cultural elements.
