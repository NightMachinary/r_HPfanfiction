  ‘It was bad,' said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the table top, looking pale and sweaty. ‘Malfoy called her “Mudblood”, Hagrid---'

  Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.

  ‘He didn'!' he growled at Hermione.

  ‘He did,' she said. ‘But I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course...'

Hermione also comes off as confused rather than offended or outraged at being called a mudblood by Draco Malfoy. She recognizes that it's rude, but the story doesn't show much of a reaction other than observing "Draco is a bad person", instead of, "Wow, the wizarding world is prejudiced too", as you'd expect in someone who is a minority in a 95%+ white Anglo-Saxon society.

  ‘Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway?' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. ‘Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head?'

  Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, ‘Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do ...'

Then there are instances of actual real world /racist/ racism in the books, not just fantasy blood supremacism, and that's not remarked on by the trio later on. And again, it's used as a way to show that Draco's gang are evil little shits rather than dig deeper into the attitudes espoused by wizarding society.

Now I kind of understand JKR's twitter post saying that Hermione's race is irrelevant to the series...
