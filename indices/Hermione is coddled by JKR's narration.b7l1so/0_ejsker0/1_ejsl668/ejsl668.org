  She botched the entire house-elf liberation thing, because while her goal of ending slavery was noble, she spent all her time telling the house-elves what they wanted instead of listening to them

I hope I don't cause drama by saying this but honestly, this is a big reason why a lot of black/PoC Harry Potter fans don't think Hermione can be read as black. Handing out badges, calling useless meetings and telling oppressed people how they ought to feel just reeks of #WhiteWomanFeminism, so it really doesn't fit with Hermione being black IMHO. Not to say that black women/girls can't be bad at activism, but Hermione is shown as brilliant in so many things and for this to be the thing she sucks at, would be pretty bad.
