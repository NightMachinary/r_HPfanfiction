I sort of always read Hermione as black, for various reasons... but I agree that she wasn't WRITTEN as black. JKR probably did not envision her as anything but white. I think JKR's infamous comments was mostly as a response to all the outraged "HERMIONE'S NOT BLACK!" comments... sort of like a "Well, she CAN be black, it doesn't really change her as a character."

Your point is noted, though. :)
