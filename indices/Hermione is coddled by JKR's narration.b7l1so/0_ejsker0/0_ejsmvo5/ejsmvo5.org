Yeah, I think Hermione is not treated the same way as Ron and Harry are plot-wise partially because of the way JKR uses her to be "the one who gives information." It's like "Harry with his best mate Ron go on adventures and Hermione helps." Which gives Harry and Ron narrative room to address their flaws but makes Hermione fall into the trap of being a perfect character.
