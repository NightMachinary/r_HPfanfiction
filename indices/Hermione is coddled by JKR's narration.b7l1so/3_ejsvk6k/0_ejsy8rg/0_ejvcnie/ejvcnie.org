The whole SPEW thing is really tainted by how annoying it was to read about from Harry's POV... Because if you step back and look at it from a distance, it's clear that her view was basically right, though could have used a bit more actual interaction with the house elves to figure out the perfect solution. But the utter acceptance of full on slavery from everyone else is... gross, and I don't think that the "But they like it being enslaved!" is a good argument, or (more importantly) a good inclusion in a book series for children/young adults.
