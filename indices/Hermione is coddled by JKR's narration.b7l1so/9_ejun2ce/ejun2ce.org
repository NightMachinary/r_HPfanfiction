The bird scene. This scene always fucking gets to me because it is so clear if the roles were reversed, the fucking backlash and venom that Ron would have gotten would be wild. As it should be, because it is never alright to harm someone because your feelings are hurt. The way Hermione got framed as a victim there always infuriated me.

Hermione was my favorite when I was growing up because she was so smart and sure of herself, and duh of course way better than Harry and Ron because she was the brains. But as I got older and reread the books, its clear that Hermione never fucking learned from her mistakes, because no one in canon wanted to hold her accountable for her actions.

She threw a fit in Divination because it's the only subject she didn't get? That's fine, the professor and course are useless anyway (Never mind that in HBP when Harry was complaining about Snape, she shut him down). She permanently disfigured a teenager because she made a mistake and snitched? Oh that okay, Marietta, a whole teenager of max 16 years, deserved it. Never mind that was implied Umbridge threatened her mother's job and Marietta never consented to this punishment, and couldn't because Hermione didn't tell anyone about it. She belittled Ron knowingly in ways that affected him most? Well, Ron's a dick, so he obviously deserved it, even though while Ron teased Hermione when they were younger he ALWAYS made it clear he was on her side. She derailed Harry multiple times (Draco, the Deathly Hallows, wandlore in general) and was found wrong? Oh well, it's okay Hermione can't know everything, and shouldn't have to apologize or admit that she was wrong or that there are certain parts of magic that she just doesn't understand.

I just.... it shouldn't be so hard for there to be some accountability with her character. Like Hermione is good character, I talk mad shit, but I do really like her still. I just hate the lack of accountability she has and that fandom and Rowling seem to have for her.
