I would be more ok with Hermione's character if she was just as book wormy, but without the perfect judgement. Kind of like a well educated but disconnected/dissocialized person. It's annoying how if she doesn't think something is a good idea then she's always right. Or how she broke down the entire emotional spectrum of how Cho was grieiving and interested in harry. Like for example if she was better at the theoretical side of magic while harry could pull off the wandwork. The only mistake she made was in snapping Harry's wand in half but then that was there to serve the plot to get harry dracos wand.
