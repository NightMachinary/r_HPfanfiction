Rowling once said in an interview that the men were the ones who gave her trouble, not the women. Maybe that is why. The evil women get criticised, like the slytherin girls, or the ones who aren't nice to the main women, like Fleur. But even men like Hagrid are shown not to be the best, even if it's a small thing like not being a good teacher.
