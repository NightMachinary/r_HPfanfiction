She's also never called out on how she was wrong about Draco being up to no good, yet wastes no time calling Harry out on the potions textbook. She's constantly trying to get Harry to follow the rules, but breaks them herself with no remorse (getting angry at Harry when she thinks he dosed Ron with Felix Felicis, yet actually confounding McLaggen so Ron can get the Keeper spot).

These flaws make her character more interesting, but the way she "gets away" with them without ever being called out on them does make her character feel too "perfect". The fan theory that Hermione is an author self insert is pretty persuasive.
