It's not even a theory. JKR has pretty much admitted that Hermione IS an author self-insert. :) Though in the first book, and to some extent in the second and third, she's sort of a fond self-parody, where the author acknowledges the character's flaws and how annoying she can be. The parodic slant seems to lessen as the books go on, though, and while the flaws don't vanish, the consequences tend to.
