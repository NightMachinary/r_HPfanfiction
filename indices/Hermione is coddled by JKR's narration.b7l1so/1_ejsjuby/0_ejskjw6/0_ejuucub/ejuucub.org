Wow. That's probably still a perfect reflection of the author. Think about it this way... she wrote the reflection of her usual bossy self, with no self awareness for the first few books, the parody and sort of “oh I'm not taking myself to seriously” and “I don't care about the fame or money” attitude she had for the middle few books, where she poked fun at herself before anyone else did it. And then the darker tones, and more self acceptance written into the last two books. with more genuine self reflection. yet less real consequences on a day to day basis ... (for jk... no money trouble or business issues, she just needs to avoid a scandal and keep her head down) she escaped the problems of her earlier life by being talented and clever and knowledgeable, like Hermione. Idk, I thought your idea was cool!
