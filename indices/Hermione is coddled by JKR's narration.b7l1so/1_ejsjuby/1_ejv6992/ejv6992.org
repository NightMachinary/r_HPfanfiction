i think, we can all agree that the Plot of Book 6, the Characterizations of all People included, is not the Best one. Its like The Author was Realizing, that she was already at the second-to-last Book, so the Story was nearly finished and she had to redirect the Plot and the Relationships (Harry-Ginny as an example) to make it fit for her Origin planned Ending. The Thing that neither Hermione and not even Ron (ESPECIALLY Ron) get suspicious about Malfoys behaviour (yes, they checked him at the Beginning, but they assumed it was harmless) is OoC and even the Order Members as taken by Arthur as an example: "Harry, i doubt that Voldemort would do such a thing", "By all respect, Mr. Weasley, do any People actually KNOW what Voldemort is thinking?!" So true at Harrys side. Arthurs spoken doubt was amateurish. If he see it that way, then nobody would be criminal, even if there are clear Proves and traits that lead to said Person, but "s/he wouldnt do such a thing". So Voldemort was just an injustified Victim in the last decade or what?!

So yes, the Book was a Forced way to keep the actual Plot in line. If the Trio would have stayed together and investigated more on Malfoy, he and Snape would have been uncovered earlier. By the way, no Member does any apology to Harry for acknowledging that he was right the whole time. All acting as "well, shit happens".
