I sort of feel this way about Snape. Sure, he's hated at first, but then it turns out he was ~misunderstood~ to the point that Harry NAMES HIS KIDS AFTER HIM. She also never showed James grow or improve, we just take Sirius's word for it that he did.

Edit: I also feel like Hermione was the least fleshed out of the trio. We barely see her parents or her familial relationships. We don't see her boggart, we just hear her say that it's failing her exams. We don't know how she feels about Harry always being in the limelight. We know nothing about her childhood, and very little about her hopes and ambitions for the future, just that she doesn't want to work at the Ministry. I think JKR sees her as more of an insert than a character that exists fully within the narrative. But I also think that Ron, while he does get shown to be more flawed, also gets forgiven very, very quickly once he admits wrongdoing. Almost immediately, a lot of the time, unless it's Hermione holding the grudge.
