I like how this action show how condescending Wizards are toward Muggles. Hermione could have explained the situation to her parents "So, there is a kind of Magical Hitler that to kill all the Muggle born like me so I'm at risk. And even worse, my best friend Harry, the one with glasses and a bird nest on his head yes dad, is also like magical Jesus and I will go to a suicide mission to stop him so I'm even worse at risks, so please could you emigrate to something like Australia where you will be safe, I promise I'll come to get you when and if I survive this war".

While I understand that no parents would, willingly, agree to this plan. I would have prefered Hermione, or Rowling, to mention that the spell that a last resort occurence when everything else Hermione tried failed to convince her parents to go into hiding.
