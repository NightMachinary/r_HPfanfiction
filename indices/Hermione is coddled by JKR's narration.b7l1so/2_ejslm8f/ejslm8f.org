Honestly, what bothers me with Hermione as a character can be summed by using a quote from another series:

#+begin_quote
  Just because you're right doesn't mean that you're correct!
#+end_quote

In the context, "right" mean factually right and "correct" meaning morally right and this opposition is treated as the most challenging for a character, with a conflict revolving around what "position" is more worthy.

.

I don't expect nor want such a blatant dilemma in every fiction I read/watch but here, all of the important and recurring characters had /some/ character development except Hermione Granger who, in short, only learned a bit of tact (or resignation) while dealing with others.

Honestly, I feel that Crabbe/Goyle had more character development, beginning as a mute bodyguard and ending as an arsonist for magical Hitler (even if, granted, most of that character development is off screen).
