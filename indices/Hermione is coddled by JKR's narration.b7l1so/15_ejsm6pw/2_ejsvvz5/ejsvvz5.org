I think you're reading too much into the bird attack. Hermione was clearly hurt and fled the scene because she didn't manage to deal with the situation in any other way than to remove herself. Then later on she felt cornered and lashed out.

There's no way she could have anticipated Ron and Lavender barging in on her. The bird attack simply was her absolutely losing it. Yeah, she should have gotten /some/ flack for this later, and there really should have been a moment of recognition that maybe she needs to work on her temper, but to think that the attack was premeditated is to look for malice where there is none.
