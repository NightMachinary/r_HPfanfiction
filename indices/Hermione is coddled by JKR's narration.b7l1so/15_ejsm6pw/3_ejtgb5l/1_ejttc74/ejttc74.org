While I don't see any of them becoming abusing (thought they would have a lot of disputs), I would still back up Ron in case of conflicts.\\
Hermione is, from the start, more versed in theory, she can study spells, learn them and maybe even invent some, but she doesn't have the "fighter instinct" Harry or Ron have. Add to it the years Ron spent as a Auror and he is way most likely to win in case of fight (thought as said before I don't see him ever fight Hermione for any reason. Hell he is the kind of guy I see sticking to defense Charms if an Imperiused Hermione was trying to kill him).
