  Hermione attacks Ron with the birds: The last image of that chapter is not Ron scattering injured, but a sob being heard from Hermione as she flees.

In GoF, Ron was Jealous of Krum and he showed temper tantrum, which is quite normal among teenagers.

But Ron gets bashed for it hard, because he was being an immature git and he publicly humiliated her. He hurt their goddess. //sarcasm//

But in HBP, when Hermione reacts even worse, they easily change their tune.

If you see the para before Hermione unleashes the canaries.

  The corridor outside seemed to be deserted. ‚ÄúHermione?‚Äù He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.

Now, in this, if you remove the author's obvious coddling, this para...

Doesn't it give the vibes akin to a butcher sharpening his knife?

Or a murdering megolomaniac stroking his snowy white cat while sipping earl grey, as he watches his intricately laid plans unfold?

Nah, the second one obviously went too far. üòÇüòÇ

Anyway, Hermione was clearly practicing that spell beforehand. She intentionally wanted to damage Ron. It's not an impulsive, spur of the moment attack, like many Hermione worshippers would like to think.

It's a planned, cold hearted retribution.

It is lot similar to /someone acid attacking a girl when he sees the girl he is +obsessed+ in love with, snog another boy./

Hermione's attack, it screams of /"If I can't get him, then no one else can!"/

That... is really disturbing.

But when loads of Hermione worshippers try to find excuses for Hermione, and when even JKR condones that attack....that really is a disturbing trend.

Hermione is NOT a victim in that incident. She is a freaking psycopath!
