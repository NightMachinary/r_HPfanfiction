/Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose./

/Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight./

These events make it clear that Hermione has seen the Ron and Lavender snogging.

So, unlike Ron, instead of confronting them, she extricated herself away from the party. And Harry having a sinking feeling follows her.

Now a common excuse many Hermione worshippers at this juncture, use is that /*Ron was merely jealous in GoF while Hermione was truly in love with Ron in HBP.*/

Bullshit.

It's just Harry was aware of budding feelings between Ron and Hermione in HBP, while he has no clue about them in GoF. With that cleared..let's get back into the topic.

/He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this./

And let's assume that she was practicing /avis/ conjuration spell (also taught in sixth year) to distract herself, which is the most reasonable and plausible explanation.

But these...

/“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just practicing.”/

/when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”/

And this

/“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it./

Makes it extremely suspicious.

True, I might have exaggerated when I said, that Hermione was practicing that spell beforehand solely to hurt Ron, but still,

Releasing those birds onto Ron, the instant she has seen them coming out together, that too with a spell (oppugno) that caused /this/

It depicts the character and probably even mental stability of Hermione.
