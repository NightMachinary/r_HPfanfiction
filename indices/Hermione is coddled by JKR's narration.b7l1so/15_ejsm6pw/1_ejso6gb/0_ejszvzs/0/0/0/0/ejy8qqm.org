I mean Hermione isn't a psychopath. But I think the issue is that she was let off lightly with the whole attack issue. And scarring Edgecombe (though she deserved it). For all her brilliance, I'm surprised that she didn't try preventing betrayal. That being said, I always saw her as a sane Bellatrix Lestrange.
