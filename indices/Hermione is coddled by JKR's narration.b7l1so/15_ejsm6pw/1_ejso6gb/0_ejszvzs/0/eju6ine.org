Yeah that's a nope from me, you clearly have a bias against Hermione and are twisting things and making huge assumptions. What is this bullshit claim that the bludgers were the target of an oppugno spell? It was house-elf magic, with no incantation, on objects that are ALREADY designed to cause serious injury.

She was just getting away from the shitty situation and messing about with magic when he walked in on her, and so she threw it at him. It's the magical equivalent of trying to distract yourself by practicing spinning a basketball, and chucking it at your love interest and their snogging partner. Hardly psychopathic, you're ridiculous.
