  It's the magical equivalent of trying to distract yourself by practicing spinning a basketball, and chucking it at your love interest and their snogging partner. Hardly psychopathic, you're ridiculous.

Did you even read the book?

/The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands/

/but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach/

PECKING AND CLAWING AT EVERY BIT OF FLESH THEY COULD REACH

Now how on earth is that equivalent to chucking a basketball at your love interest?

  What is this bullshit claim that the bludgers were the target of an oppugno spell?
#+end_quote

Oppugno jinx makes an object to follow the target and attack him no matter where he goes.

So it is reasonable enough to deduce that the rogue bludgers were jinxed with oppungo spell.

And even though it is said that elves have their own magic, they can still use some wizarding spells. For example Dobby used hover charm to levitate and move the pudding. They may not utter incantation or use exact wand movements, but their intent is all the same.

Dobby jinxed those bludgers to keep attacking Harry and only Harry, wherever he goes.

Even after knowing and seeing first hand how devastating an oppungo jinx could possibility be, if not used responsibly, Hermione still doesn't hesitate to unleash that jinx against Ron in that fit of anger, while on the other hand, all Ron does is show a temper tantrum when he was in exact similar situation during GoF.

It shows that while Ron's "retributions" are usually harmless, Hermione's on the other hand are cold, calculated and disproportionate.

I'm not saying that Hermione is evil. I'm saying that Hermione doesn't consider the limits or consequences of her actions sometimes.
