They're little birds lol, way to be dramatic. It'll hurt but not cause serious damage, especially with the whole MAGIC thing that lets them play sports 100ft in the air while actual cannonballs are targeting them. It's equivalent because magical people have different standards for violence, you're being purposefully oblivious to this very obvious fact.

"Reasonable to deduce" is doublespeak for "making assumptions" - you're doing some weird Twitter-Rowling shit where you theorize about things that could technically be true but aren't in the actual books. Literally everyone thinks you're out to lunch for comparing little birds to steel bludgers.

Hermione's was not calculated - she was walked in on; it's not disproportionate - you managed to forget that magic exists and for some reason you're in love with the idea that little birds hurt as much as steel bludgers; and while she said her lines "coldly", storming out of the room in tears after throwing the first thing at hand at Ron is hardly a cold action lol.
