  Hermione is dismissive her cat attacking Ron's rat: Oh, well, Ron's rat is ACTUALLY a death-eater, but not just any death eater, no. This is THE death eater that betrayed Harry's parents.

Hermione's in the wrong here, no doubt about it. She does not take steps to make sure Crookshanks will not encounter Scabbers--even bringing him up to the boys' dormitory, effectively enabling her cat to attack Ron's rat.

Granted, it's a mystery series and an observant reader will have noted things that were peculiar about Scabbers in the first place, but that doesn't change the fact that Hermione is arguably callous towards Ron in regards to his pet.

  Hermione is jealous of Harry in Potions in book 6: NO, she weary of the book. And again she was proven right, as Harry uses as spell in said book that almost kills Draco.

I'm actually a little sympathetic to Hermione here. While experimenting with Potion ingredients is dangerous, and she's right to be cautious, it's also a very important part of the subject. Hermione dismissing it out of hand is narrow-minded. That said, she's not wrong that Harry is not actually studying the book to understand the ways the modifications actually work.

What's really bad is that when things go pear-shaped, Hermione can't resist the opportunity to say "I told you so," after Harry critically injures Malfoy.

  Hermione attacks Ron with the birds: The last image of that chapter is not Ron scattering injured, but a sob being heard from Hermione as she flees. And in the next chapter Harry and Hermione have nice conversation and don't even mention the incident. Then, later that chapter, Hermione laughs at Ron after he botches a spell, Ron imitates Hermione "jumping up and down" trying to answer a question in class and Hermione runs away in tears. All of this to reinforce that Hermione is REALLY the victim!

This was awful. Hermione has no right to retaliate to Ron's romancing Lavender with violence, especially since she never made it clear to Ron she thought of him romantically. And she doesn't apologize for laughing at Ron's mustache during the Transfiguration lesson--and I'm surprised McGonagall tolerated their bickering.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione turns in the firebolt to McGonagall behind Harry's back: Harry only has two thoughts and one interaction with Hermione before they are friends again. And his thoughts are rather favorable (she's well-intentioned, and how tired she looked).
#+end_quote

Once again, Hermione's got a more sympathetic motivation--someone sends Harry a ludicrously expensive present and does it anonymously to boot? When there's a deranged criminal after him?

But she does come off as self-righteous. Going behind Harry's back is bad enough, but to not even say /why/ until after is worse. She forms her hypothesis almost immediately and she doesn't say so until it's already done, when Harry is too angry to listen to her.
