This is going to blow up, mark my words. I absolutely agree with you, though I only noticed how Hermione never pays for her mistakes when I re-read the books as an adult. I think the only time she actually even apologized was after that business with Ron's rat. Shie mocks Luna, snaps at Ron, attack him...And,well, she is the smartest witch of her age so she can do what she wants. I know people say that movies are the reason why many people dislike Ron Hermione as a paring, but I think her portrayal in the books also played a role in this. She is that wonderful girl who is always right, and Ron just isn't good enough because he actually isn't perfect and is willing to admit it. Hermione never even admited that her attitude towards house elf liberation didn't take into account what they might want.
