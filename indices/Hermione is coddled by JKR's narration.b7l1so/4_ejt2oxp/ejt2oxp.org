I think the point in the series that you see this the most is the Lavender Brown love triangle drama. The narrative really doesn't like Lavender, despite the fact that her only crime is falling in love. Meanwhile, Hermione set blood thirsty canaries on Ron and then acts surprised that he'd rather kiss Lavender rather than her. There's a very "not like other girls" mentality to Hermione in that entire section of HBP.
