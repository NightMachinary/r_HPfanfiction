I've been playing with something like this. Utterly not canon post-war. Harry and Dumbledore end up facing off against Tom, and only Harry walks away... With all three personalities in his head fighting for dominance. Harry accidentally finds that (heterosexual) sex is something that repulses both of his roommates making them shut the hell up for days at a time.

Fortunately, a whole lot of women want to bang the Man Who Won, and being a 17-year-old horn dog, Harry is utterly happy supplying them with what they want.

Pansy comes to Harry for sex because due to financial reverses from the war, the Parkinsons can no longer come up with her dowery, so Draco dumped her. She wants to bang Harry because she knows it would annoy Draco.

For anyone who cares, a small taste of Draco's reaction...

â€‹

"Potter," Draco sneered.

"Good morning, Draco," Harry smiled up at the angry Slytherin from his seat at the Gryffindor table. "No greetings for the rest of our classmates? I thought your mother raised you better than that."

"Pansy told me what you did, Potter."

"You'll have to clarify, Draco," Harry laughed. "I've done a whole lot of things that Pansy might have told you about."

"Did you enjoy my sloppy seconds, Potter?" Draco asked, starting Crabbe and Goyle to giggling on either side.

"Sloppy seconds?" Harry echoed. "You know, I've ever really understood why anyone would consider that an insult. I mean it's not like she came directly from your bed to mine. Besides," Harry leaned forward conspiratorially, "she told me that after the first quarter of an inch, I was exploring virgin territory."

"What are you saying?" Draco demanded, going red in the face, causing his bookends to start giggling again.

"I'm not saying anything, Short Stuff," Harry winked. "It's Pansy who is saying you don't measure up."

Crabbe and Goyle collapsed to the floor with outright laughter while Ron slid beneath the table, joining them and even Hermione attempted to hide her laughter behind her hand and a very fake cough.

"My Father will hear of this!" Draco screamed before he realized what he had said.

"Hiring a necromancer, are you?" Harry asked innocently. "Seems a lot of effort to go through to let your father know you've got a tiny todger. Didn't he already know?"

Draco spun on his heel and stalked away. The still laughing pair of Crabbe and Goyle regained enough control to follow him, with Goyle offering Harry a pair of covert thumbs up as they did so.

"He was fun," Harry noted, returning to his breakfast.

"You are horrible," Hermione suggested. "And if you don't stop slutting around, you're going to catch a disease."

"I do not slut around," Harry said in a very put-upon tone. "I'll have you know that I have very strict standards."

"Strict standards!" Hermione scoffed.

"I do!" Harry said in mock outrage, "First of all, they have to be female,"

"Always a major qualifier," Ron agreed.

"They have to be willing," Harry continued.

"Or eager even," Neville interjected.

"And they must be hot," Harry concluded.

"And Parkinson is 'hot'?" Hermione asked sarcastically.

"Oh, Merlin, yes," Harry agreed with a longing sigh. "You can bounce a galleon off her arse."

"Nice chest too," Neville observed. When everyone at the table turned to look at him he continued in an offended tone, "Hey, I look at girls too. Pansy is hot. Not as hot as you and Lavender, Hermione, but she's hot."

"And great legs too, of course, being a Slytherin, she's probably kinky as hell," Ron agreed.

"Sadly, no," Harry shook his head. "All of her... limited experiences were with Malfoy. I taught her a few things."

"Like what?" Hermione asked, not sure she wanted to know that answer.

"You know, the basics," Harry grinned. "Pleasant conversation, sensual massage, multiple orgasms."

"You're horrible," Hermione said as she gathered her things to leave the table. "And you're a manslag. All three of you are."

"I wish," Neville grumbled while Ron and Harry smiled innocently.
