Nothing posted yet, but I've got about half a chapter written up.

Since you like it, here's Harry and Pansy's tryst:

â€‹

Pansy Parkinson climbed yet another flight of stairs while continuing her search. Where was Potter?

He hadn't left for Hogsmeade with his two friends. He wasn't in the Great Hall, he wasn't out on the grounds, he wasn't at the groundskeeper's hut, he wasn't in the Room of Requirements, and if that Gryffindor 2nd year was to be believed, he wasn't in the Gryffindor dorms.

That only left the whole bloody castle to search.

She did a lap of the hallways of the 6th floor. No Potter. Yet another stairway, another lap, another check of the Room of Requirement.

This time the damned room almost fooled her. She needed to find Potter, so it provided a Potter Automata that was real enough that she had started her spiel before noticing he wasn't blinking. Pansy raged from the room, climbing the stairs to the 8th floor.

And still no Potter.

It wasn't until she climbed the ladder to the Astronomy tower that she found him.

"Potter," she panted, struggling to regain her breath after her search.

"Parkinson," he replied, closing the book he had been reading. "What can I do for you?"

"What makes you think I want something?" she demanded.

"You addressed me without the traditional evil eye sneer you've always offered me and the other official */Enemies of Draco/*," he explained. "Behavior unusual enough for me to take notice. What do you need?"

"We should fuck," she said simply.

"You have my attention," Potter said with a small grin. "Explain."

"The war caused my family some severe financial issues," she explained.

"And my heart bleeds," Potter interjected. "Give me a second, I'll need to rosin the bow for the world's smallest invisible violin."

"Issues," Pansy pressed on as if he had not spoken, "that drastically limit what can be offered for my dowry."

Potter waited for almost 10 seconds before speaking. "And we should have sex because you need to raise money for your dowry? What's your going rate?"

Pansy blinked before barking out "Arse!" Turning on her heel and leaving the arrogant bastard where he sat, only to be shocked to find him at the base of the ladder from the Astronomy Tower waiting for her. How did he do that?

"I'm sorry, that was rude and almost certainly uncalled for," he said with an expression of regret on his face. "How about you explain your problem to me as if I were an uncultured half-blood raised among the Muggles who has only heard of dowries in relationship to old medieval fairytales."

"Seriously?" Pansy demanded.

"Seriously," Potter responded his grin was back.

"Because I no longer have a substantial dowry to offer," she explained, "Draco's mother has canceled our contract and signed one with the Greengrass family."

"Daphne?" Harry asked in surprise.

"Astoria," Pansy corrected him. "Daphne's younger sister."

"Oh, that makes sense," Potter nodded.

"Daphne prefers witches," Pansy noted cattily.

"No," Harry corrected her while guiding Pansy into an unused classroom and taking a seat on one of the many tables. "Daphne prefers Tracey, and Tracey herself is a bit of a hedonist. Okay, so you've lost your dowry and Draco, why should we have sex?"

"My dream of marrying Draco is over, and Draco doesn't care," she answered. Why was this so hard? She wondered. What boy doesn't jump at the chance for sex? Why did Potter want an explanation? "I want him to care."

"And you having sex with me will make him care?" Potter asked.

"He hates you," Pansy explained. "He hates you because you constantly mock him."

"I constantly ignore him," Potter sighed. "I only occasionally mock him."

"Because you constantly mock him," Pansy repeated through clenched teeth, "because you killed his father because you killed the Dark Lord because you beat him at Quidditch and because you always win. He will hate it if you fuck me, and he will care."

"Ah, revenge sex," Potter nodded. "A concept I am familiar with. Okay, so you'll get revenge, what's in it for me?"

"All of this," She said pulling her robes open to show she wore nothing underneath.

Potter's eyebrows rose, and Pansy smiled. She had him.

"Very nice," he said with a nod. "But I meant, what's in it for me beyond the bit of slap and tickle?"

"I'm not enough?" she demanded.

"Pansy," Potter said with a small sigh, "I'm Harry Potter, the man who won. Do you have any idea how much sex I've been offered since I killed Voldemort? A healer in Saint Mungos decided to show me how much she appreciated what I'd done by taking my virginity. Over the summer, witches have gone out of their way to show me how grateful they are. Once we got back to school, our classmates took up the cause. I've been with most of the girls in our year and several from the year below. Everyone, it seems, wants to bag the hero, and I'm okay with that because sex is, well, fantastic. I stayed in the castle today because, quite frankly, I thought I could use the rest and because I thought that I would be left alone. Sex is great, but it's not like I can't get it when I want. You have a plot, you have a plan, and you have a goal. What is in it for me to go along with your plan and achieve your goal?"

"Damn it, Potter," Pansy said, shrugging out of her robes and allowing them to fall to the ground. "Fuck me, damn you."

His only answer was that damned crooked grin.

"I'll... I'll..." Her mind raced, what could she possibly want from her? Had he really fucked his way through most of the girls in their year? What could she offer that he hadn't already... "I'll pay you."

"Already rich," Potter said with a shake of his head. "Besides, I may be easy, but I'm not a whore. Try again."

"I'll be your... friend."

"Now, what that so hard?" he asked.

Behind her, Pansy heard the door lock as Potter lifted her onto the table, where she found a cushioning charm covering the surface. "The others just wanted to brag that they'd bagged the hero," he whispered in her ear as his hands moved over her body. "I can always use more friends."

He pulled her down so that they were laying on the table, face to face, his clothing vanishing as he did so. Did he even use a wand anymore?

"Friendship needs a basis," he continued to whisper as his fingertips traced over her hip. "With Ron and me, it was that we're both lazy malcontents, with Hermione and me it's a dedication to doing the right thing, even if we don't always agree on what the right thing is. With Neville and me, it a desire to have the families that Voldemort took from us." Pansy found herself trembling at his touch. "For you and me, new friend Pansy, it's hating Draco. Hating Draco isn't much of a basis for friendship, but it's a start."
