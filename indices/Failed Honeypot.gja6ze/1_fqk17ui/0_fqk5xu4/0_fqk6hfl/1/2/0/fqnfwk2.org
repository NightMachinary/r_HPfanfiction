I prefer it over the

#+begin_example
  link***(fanfic title/ID/author).  
#+end_example

I think it just looks nicer, for one. Lets insert the link into the body of the text without having obvious code.

I got it from this sub's wiki, actually.

#+begin_quote
  To hide a tag, you can add a bunch of ^ to superscript the tag away. So you could do ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ffnbot!directlinks to use that tag and have it not appear in your comment! Useful for aesthetics.
#+end_quote
