I get that you're being funny and it amused me but my pedantic nature won. So sorry about this.

I mean technically everyone is above the age of consent in the country that they're in in Limpieza De Sangre. Emily is sixteen when she sleeps with Martin in the only detailed sex scene in the story.

The childhood trauma Emily endures is not sexualized, or even detailed past the barest saying that it happened as bluntly as possible, so I don't think it would technically violate the rules. Same with Harry and Hermione's post-assault interactions.

If we want to get really nit-picky we can go on about how technically Martin never consents to Emily in the bathroom when she climbs onto him in the bathroom. And given Martin's injured leg it's debatable if he could effectively get away from her if he wanted to. So really, Emily rapes him.

And then, also, Martin is more than four years older than Emily. And since Emily is sixteen that's technically statutory rape in England. So Martin also rapes Emily. So they rape each other? And since they both enjoyed the encounter, I guess that means I glorified rape? So I mean, I think I'm safe on the underage guidelines. But you could report it for glorifying rape.

This is kinda fun, wonder what else I could nitpick out of it.
