The bot should be updated to crosscheck against a set of stories known to be out of compliance (e.g., Limpieza de Sangre, Inverarity's Alexandra Quick series, most everything by Deadwoodpecker, Wordhammer, Darth Marrs, jbern, Shezza, Taure, etc.) and not post links to stories, but rather auto-flag the parent posts linking to same in order to make this more efficient for the mods.

There should also be a stickied thread where folks can post the set of all non-compliant stories.

I would bet that in a few weeks, working together, we can ensure that this subreddit is properly dead.
