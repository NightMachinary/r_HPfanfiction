Absolutely not, I will just do whatever is [[https://www.ageofconsent.net/states/colorado][legal in my state]].

My state also has something called "Romeo and Juliet Law", which is a [[https://www.ageofconsent.net/close-in-age-exemptions][close-in-age exemption]]:

#+begin_quote
  this law is designed to prevent the prosecution of underage couples who engage in consensual sex when both participants are significantly close in age to each other, and one or both are below the age of consent.

  Depending on the situation, the Colorado close-in-age exemption may completely exempt qualifying close-in-age couples from the age of consent law, or merely provide a legal defense that can be used in the event of prosecution.

As far as I know, in my state, a person who is under 15 can legally consent to have sex with someone who is no more than 4 years older. Additionally, a person under 17 can legally consent to sex with a person who is no more than 10 years older.
