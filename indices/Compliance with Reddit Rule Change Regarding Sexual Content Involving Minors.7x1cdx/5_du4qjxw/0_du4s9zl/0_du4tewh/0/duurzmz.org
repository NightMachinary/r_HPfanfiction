Since reddit is not a public property of the US, it only has to comply with the restrictions dictated by US the laws, not guarantee the freedoms sourced from them. So whatever's legal in your state is not the same as whatever's permissible on reddit.

There are some other problems with your comment's logic as well, but I'll stop here.
