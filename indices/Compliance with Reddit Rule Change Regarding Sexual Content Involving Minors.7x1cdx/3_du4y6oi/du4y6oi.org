Honestly I don't think this will really change much. This is fanfiction. I doubt reddit will care or do anything.

Instead of focusing on the letter of the law focus on the intent. Why did reddit put this rule in place? It wasn't to combat writing or creativity. Because of this, I doubt anything will come of it.
