The announcement thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7vxzrb/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_involuntary/]]

The one post that seems to comment on it is here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7vxzrb/comment/dtx02ef]]

That seems to suggest that it isn't a blanket ban but contextual: That would bring it similar to how us law works. However, it is only a comment not policy.

This seems to be called out quite a bit in the comments but never dealt with. I suspect this is one of those 'we made a broad rule so we could use our judgement/ban things that get bad pr'

The problem is although legal stateside, a lot of this stuff is hard illegal elsewhere (Germany, Canada, Aussie). How will Reddit react on their next government request to remove content illegal in that country?
