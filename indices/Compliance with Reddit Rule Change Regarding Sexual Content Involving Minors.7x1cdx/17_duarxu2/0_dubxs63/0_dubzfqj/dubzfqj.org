Scientific response: EXCEPT that the offspring carry the magical gene. Or at least there are no mentions of non-squibs being born, so albeit by circumstantial evidence, no non-magical (to at least some degree) children are born to witches and wizards.

Magic response: Plus, there's the matter of Hippogriffs, chimeras, abraxans, griffons, etc. According to that common definition, horses eagles and lions are all the same species. Magic ruins everything.
