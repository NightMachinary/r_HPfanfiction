I mean, so yeah, you keep coming back to the generally accepted definition for species, but that definition has a huge number of exceptions and while it generally works for multicellular "animals" I think that given the previous examples of hybridizations that can produce offspring that scientists with evidence of them would be forced to produce a different definition for species.

My main reasoning is still that you can't breed out the magic gene (get muggles again from any magical offspring) whereas with "normal" genes, given enough generations, you can breed it out. Meaning a muggle can make a magical given wizard ancestry, but a wizard/squib can't make a muggle regardless the number of non-magical ancestors. Magicals are practically a parasitic species, relying on non-magicals to expand their gene pool without releasing offspring back into the larger pool.

Also, just thought of a really obvious thing I should have thought of earlier: neanderthals.
