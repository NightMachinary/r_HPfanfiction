If the gene is so dominant to the point that the offspring of wizards and muggles cannot result in muggles, then I would make the argument that they're fundamentally different enough to be a different species. (i.e. Wizards and muggles can give birth to wizards or squibs -> those can then go on to give birth to wizards or squibs, muggles cannot result from any further offspring , at least not that we've seen in canon)

A Griffin is the offspring of a lion and an eagle. Therefore they're the same species? A hippogriff is the offspring of a griffin and a horse. Therefore a horse and a griffin are the same species?
