So if sexual content involving minors is not the focus of the story, and does not promote pedophilia is it ok? I don't think it'd serve the plot besides relationship development. Another question is on whose age of consent are determining the rules? For example, in Lithuania, the age of consent(for sex) is 18, while in Germany it is 16.

EDIT: So apparently the age of consent in Lithuania might be 16, and Germany 14, the point/example still stands, even if my facts may be incorrect.
