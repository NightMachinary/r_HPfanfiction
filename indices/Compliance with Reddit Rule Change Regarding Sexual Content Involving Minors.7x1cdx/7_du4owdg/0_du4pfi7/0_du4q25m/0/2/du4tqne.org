I don't think it varies from State to state: under 18 is a minor.

Now, if it is legal for minors to engage in sexual conduct, that varies widely from State to state. But why would that matter? Depictions of Sexual content involving minors that does not qualify as pornography or obscene is legal everywhere in the US, as it is protected by the first amendment. Of course this doesn't stop Reddit from banning such content. I wouldn't rely on the fact something is legal....
