I notice that the rule says no "sexual /or suggestive/ content." So does this mean that even fics where two teenaged characters make out, no sex involved or even implied, would also be interpreted as off-limits?

I hate to say it, but I am a bit worried that they're going to crack down on us before we even contact them. I mean, come on, we're a sub devoted entirely to fanfiction about a famous book series featuring teenage characters. (On the other hand, maybe they'll make an exception for creative work: after all, there's an entire sub devoted to [[/r/BigMouth]].)

Should we all delete our old sex-themed threads just to be safe? I only ask because in recent months I made threads asking for fics where Molly caught Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione in the act (which, tbh, are pretty vanilla requests compared to /some/ of the things I see people asking for here). *EDIT:* Just to be safe, I went ahead and deleted them. If our sub gets shut down, I just want to say: hey, thanks for all the fun times and good fic recommendations. I'll still see you guys around on the main /HP/ sub.
