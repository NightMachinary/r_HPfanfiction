The rule the admins established is intentionally vague, so they can use it to remove a broad array of content they don't want on the site. I'm trying to interpret in a way that won't require removing half the content in the sub. We're basically relying on community reports anyway because it's impossible to enforce this by actually examining all content that's posted.

I can try asking the admins, but I'm slightly concerned they'll take a "ban first, ask questions later" stance.
