The questions I'd ask when trying to determine if something is problematic are: is sexual content involving minors the focus of or does it make up a significant portion of the work? Does it contain very explicit content involving minors? Does the sexual content appear to be there for its own sake or does it serve the plot? Is there content involving minors and adults? Promotion of pedophilia?
