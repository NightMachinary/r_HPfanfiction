So... A big No to "The Real Us", but a Yes to stuff like "Eros and Psyche"?

We're obviously gonna tread into a grey zone area here. If we start removing any fic which has Hogwarts-years sex scenes in it we may as well just close the sub right now. Obviously fics like "The Real Us" go way below any age-limit in any country, so I would assume its a clear cut case of something unacceptable. But in "Eros and Psyche" we have 17 year olds going at it, which presents a grey zone in this ruling I'm not sure of.

Are you going to implement your own interpretation of the rule as a guideline for the sub?
