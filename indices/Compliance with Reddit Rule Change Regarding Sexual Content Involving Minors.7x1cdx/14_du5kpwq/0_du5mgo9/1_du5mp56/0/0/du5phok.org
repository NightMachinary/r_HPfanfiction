I honestly just say we stick to just not linking to sex-act-related material and assume Reddit admins won't completely jump off the bridge and start banning subs for having minors kissing.

I mean, sure, you could argue that fics containing that type of material are technically against the rules, but you'd be hard-pressed to argue that the Reddit admins are going to be /that strict/.
