I agree. My only concern is that this policy update will affect the participation of members. After all, before now, people have been able to recommend whatever they want without having to actively attempt to recall any specifics about the story, other than it matches what's being requested.

Now we run into the problem of potentially having a user be banned or otherwise get in trouble for recommending something that contains underage sex. I don't know about you, but I consume a /lot/ of fanfiction and, among other things I find distasteful, underage sex is just something that /happens/ in a lot of otherwise fantastic stories.
