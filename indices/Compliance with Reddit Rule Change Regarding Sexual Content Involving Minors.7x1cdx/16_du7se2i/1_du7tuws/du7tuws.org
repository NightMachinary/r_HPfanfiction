Exactly. There's a clear difference between writing about a character's sexual abuse as a backstory, or a sexual relationship between teenage characters, in a story, which is done in a factual and nondescript, vague manner, and writing "smut" about children, which is by definition a scene or a story written with the sole purpose of sexually arousing the writer or the readers. Child smut "stories" are sexually exploitative and encouraging sexual abuse of children, and people can't fool themselves otherwise. There's no purpose to writing it except for that. If you want to argue you're not a disgusting pedophile for writing child "smut," ask yourself why you couldn't just write a smut story with the same characters when they're already adults and out of school. Why do you HAVE to write them as children? Why do you HAVE to be so damn detailed and use flowery words? You don't. You just WANT TO, because you're sick. Anyone in this forum who wants to argue that they should be able to write and post extremely detailed and graphic, flowery sex, blow by blow accounts, you're sick and this rule is for you.
