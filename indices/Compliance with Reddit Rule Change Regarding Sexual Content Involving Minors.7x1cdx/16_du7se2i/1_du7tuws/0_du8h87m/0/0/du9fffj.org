Pedophiles always reach for any excuse and justification for sexualizing children, whether it's in person, in a story, or in an image. They always have to find some way to explain why it's okay, or harmless. It's NOT. IT NEVER IS. But they still have to try to fight for it to be okay anyways. They're just like my mother.

But yes, I agree that I think the rules aren't very efficient in doing what they were implemented to do.
