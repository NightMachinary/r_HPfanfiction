I've only started reading fanfiction this past year, and writing it these past few months. As I have spent more time on this forum, I have been seeing more and more disgusting requests, or discussions about already existing stories with these sick things in them. I don't really want to be on here very much anymore, except to use the mail to talk to my writer friends and to discuss story ideas I come up with.
