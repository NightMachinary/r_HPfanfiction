I had a good laugh at a review I got the other day when I posted a chapter where Harry (16) is over at Tonks place and she mentions that her parents are probably having some fun downstairs at the moment (and that her parents had a healthy sex life). One of my friends has a mother who can get rather vocal so the concept of children and their friends knowing about sex and being rather casual about the whole thing is based on personal experience (and it makes sense story wise since Edward actually was around 18 during the sexual revolution and Andromeda isn't exactly a prim and proper trophy wife).

  Good author note. Good wakeup for readers to realize the juggle there, mystery, politics, romance. " adults show more restraint when their children are around" Yep. Triggers a dozen thoughts. Like reviews declaring multis don't exist in real life, anyone would be too jealous, to allow it. That THAT sex scene was impossible, no one can do that (hmmm, when I could do double or triple "that". I recall (possibly exaggeration of sex sells "sweeps week"**) TV "news magazine" shows, and talk shows, debating and claiming a "trend", of permissive or overly sexually permissive parents. The touted "trend", with parents who in defense, claimed being open minded, expected their kids WOULD have teen sex, and be at risk being secretive (in parked car, outdoors, public places risking being caught) in having sex. Better their kid be "safe", safe place with or without safe(er) sex, with one or both sets of the young coupling couples' parents, allowing "sleepovers". Guess without the no "door to your bedroom stays open during any opposite sex visiting" rule. Although maybe Andromeda would prefer the open door rule stand.

  **FYI if term defunct now. Long ago at least, advertising rate based on viewership. At least in old days, including pre-cable & satellite TV (haven't watched TV in 10 years), viewership polling (count) data (TV show & networks ratings) done during specific times (like fall "sweeps week"). SEX gets attention, so from dramas to daily local and national news shows, would fill with sex, sexual topics, sex stories, sex news, sex "scandals"...sex sex sex...

  Bad though, yes we sell things with sex in advertising, culture flooded with sex. But YOU, YOU young kids ...errr, bad, sex is bad, just say no to drugs...errr sex ... HERE, PRAY, make a chastity vow, BUY and wear this promise ring or other dumbass religious political endorsed doodad. Lmfao. Abstain. There, that's THE BEST right wing & right religious ONLY Sex Ed you need, abstinence, don't, don't, just don't. Err until AFTER THE CHURCH approved wedding, then YOU MUST ...err consummate ... Fuck, cuz WE, the church ummm... own your naughty bits. And own your right to fuck. Niw for some denominations, no fucking for fun and pleasure, or intimacy, and absolutely no birth control and fuck ONLY when she's fertile, and no putting "it" anywhere but the vagina, and only for trying to do God's will, MULTIPLY and (over) populate the earth. No masturbation or any sex, but for trying to make more ... child drones brainwashed into "the faith".

Made me seriously doubt whether the US can still be called a free country since none of that is an issue in Europe. I mean, absinece as contraception wasn't even mentioned in my sex-ed class. And if you brought up the religious side to that extent people would simply shake their head and laugh, same about the chastity vow (WTF?).
