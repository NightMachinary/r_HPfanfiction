I take it from your comment that you are British? Well, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0jQz6jqQS0][this video]] pretty much sums up the state of sex ed (and, by extension, attitudes toward teen sex) in America.

I think this new rule has a good point and a bad point. On one hand, there's no reason to write and/or promote sex stories about prepubescent children. That's /sick, sick, sick./ But when it comes to teenagers, that's a bit different. An adult lusting after a teen is still a no-no as far as I'm concerned, but if it's two /consenting/ teens... well, there I think we should acknowledge the fact that some teenagers do in fact have responsible sex, and it's often an important step in their personal development.

Message to Reddit: there's a /ton/ of YA novels out there, like /Looking for Alaska/ and /Anatomy of a Boyfriend/, that depict sexual situations between teenagers that are, in fact, technically illegal. And yet those books have been widely read and sold millions of copies. And guess what: there were fifth-years at Hogwarts kissing, and even though JKR didn't explicitly say so, I'm sure there were sixth- and seventh-years getting even /more/ intimate. I guess none of you who work at Reddit were ever in an intimate teenaged relationship, though. Again, I don't want to be too harsh - I like your new rule to a certain extent - but I fear it might prove a tad too draconian, and it would be a shame if /our/ sub was the one that ended up on the chopping block.
