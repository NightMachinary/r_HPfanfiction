Given that /all/ the teenage Harry Potter characters within canon are minors by US law due to age of consent differences between the UK and US (16 in the UK, fyi if you weren't aware), this has potential to become very complicated very quickly.

Interestingly on that point, this is also a reason some of the US fandom fascinates me. What's very normal for JKR to be writing about (in her own UK context) seems to be interpreted by some US fans as something like forbidden fruit or JKR somehow being 'naughty' by having some suggestions of teen relationships or certain activities. It really makes me wonder about the state of how such things are perceived and talked about in America!
