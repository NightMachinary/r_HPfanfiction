linkffn(Grow Young With Me) has a summary that didn't impress me when I first read it, but the actual story is really well done.

Harry is widowed and raising his three children alone, devoted to them but really hurting. A quirky waitress (with her own issues under the surface) takes on the self-assigned job of drawing him out of his funk, and they slowly fall for each other. But even if she can win over his children, even if he can let himself love again after losing Ginny, there's still a side of his life that she's not supposed to know about. And the more she sees his home and his in-laws, the harder it is to keep a lid on exactly what he does for a living, how he can regularly drop his children off with their grandparents on the other side of the country, and why he has genuine /cauldrons/ in his cupboards...
