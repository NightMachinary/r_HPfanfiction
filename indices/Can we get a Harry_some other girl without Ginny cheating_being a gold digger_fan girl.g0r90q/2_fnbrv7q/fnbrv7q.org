Novocaine Anything by dorothea greengrass (she is a little bitchy but she's not too ooc the other characters acting differently makes it seems so tho) or JacobApples (she is basically non existent same as pre-hbp or the break ups aren't horrible and don't involve bashing) Surroundings by IWasJustAnotherGuy Hermione granger and the paradigm shift Hope and healing Casting shadows by Wakefan (they break up and she is shown in a slightly immature light but that's it) Double back by Methos2523 (time travel with 2 Harry's and Ron and her are shown in a negative light but it's only in passing and they aren't really a part of the story) The right of conquest by tlc1894 A fateful walk Grow young with me by Taliesin19 (Ginny dies of screen before the story starts)
