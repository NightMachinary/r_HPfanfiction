Ok, absolutely AMAZING one is linkffn(Certain Dark Things by eirajenson)

Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry and Slytherin!Hermione, Sirius has a daughter, and a lot of AU twists on various canon things - don't want to spoil but it's created such a mystery as you're not sure what's canon and what isn't ahead of time!

It's tagged as being Snarry later on, but we're at book 3 now and still no sign of it, although the portrayal of Snape has been really excellent, showing where he is still a grey and unlikable character but also creating some sympathy for him.

Writer is just brilliant, and I have to say I'm not a fan of Snarry or Slytherin!Harry so would have noped out early if this wasn't /just so good/.
