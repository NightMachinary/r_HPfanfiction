  Aunt Petunia gasped her pain out against Holly's clammy neck even as she turned, her head lolling, to glare hatefully at Bellatrix. “You will not take her. My sister---““---is dead, little muggle,” said Bellatrix. “As will you if you do not give us Potter.”Holly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her.

She'd---“Over my dead body, you stupid witch!” Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. “You've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!”Bellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. “On your head be it. Avada Kedavra!”

  A little mermaid, dreaming of a world above the surface which reflects the hope she has in mankind, once meets a little prince dreaming of kingship, honor, and glory. However, like the sun glimmering on the surface of the sea, sometimes dreams, while beautiful, cannot be held in one's hands.
