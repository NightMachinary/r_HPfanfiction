The first one is rarely recommended on this sub and yet is personally one of my femharry favs. It also features a rare alive!james and the dynamic is really interesting.

The second one updates daily and I just have to say may be steadily on my way to being my favorite marauders era fic. One of the best slowburns with fem harry and sirius and the plot is just woven together so beautifully and that doesnt even touch upon how amazing and real these characters are.

The third one is really quite funny and such an interesting dynamic (its another time travel and yes i love these!). I laughed many times reading it.
