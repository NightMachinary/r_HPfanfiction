yeah it's definitely a shame it slowed down

and although these HP/NT arent new, they're no longer on ffn so I thought I'd give em a mention: Chelseyb's /The Rebel and the Chosen/ and /Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror/. the second is unfortunently abandoned, but they're both good reads. you should be able to find em both with a Google search
