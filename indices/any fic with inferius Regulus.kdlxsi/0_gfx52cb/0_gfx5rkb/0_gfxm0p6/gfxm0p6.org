  was it actually ever detailed what inferi are?

Sort of. This is about the extent of it (from HBP), but TL:DR is they're reanimated bodies with nobody home that have been programmed via magic to do things.

Chapter 4, Horace Slughorn:

  “Er ... right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn't very clear.”

  “They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard's bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. ... He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. ...”

Chapter 21, The Uknowable Room (the ghosts are transparent conversation)

#+begin_quote
  “The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.”
