anything is possible in love and fanfiction. was it actually ever detailed what inferi are? I'm sure there are some zombie movies where it gets cured. what if it's like in that new /I legend/ movie, where the zombies actually have some mind left.

there is literally a stone that resurrects people. ok, maybe that doesn't count cause it doesn't really work like that, but... FANFICTION!

also, it doesn't have to get a cure. I just want inferius Reggie.

hell, Frankenstein's monster is just made from dead bodies and he is alive. come on, a little bit of imagination to our boring everyday lives.
