Consequence for cause Cambangst has the best instance of Snape losing all his self-righteousness and 'the whole world hates me' angst I've ever seen.

"Why does Harry Potter hate you"

"He blames me for the deaths of his parents"

"Shouldn't he?"

Just two pages of Dumbledore going: "No, no, no. You /did/ do that to her and to yourself. You don't get to blame /me/ for it."
