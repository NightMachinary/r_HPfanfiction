Any story where Snape gets fired (or at least called out on his bullshit teaching) is really fiddly. It all depends on how you address the fact that Dumbledore knows what's going on and he's allowing it anyway, because he's protecting Snape.

Does Dumbledore continue to protect Snape from scrutiny, or does he have a breaking point? How long does Dumbledore allow Snape to hold his high school grudge?

Snape doesn't get the job without Dumbledore. Full stop.
