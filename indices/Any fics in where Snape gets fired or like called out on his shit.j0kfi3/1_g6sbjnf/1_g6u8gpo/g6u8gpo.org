I would caution that the scene there is him getting chastised by Dan and Emma Granger, who use their muggle sensibility and basically disregard how important it is to keep him in the castle for the war. However there was a fic where Harry has inherited James' memories and passes the triwiz with the help of the sorting hat, in this fic a minor subplot is Harry turning the whole school against Snape (calling him out as joining the light side because of an infatuation with Lily and a quasi life debt to James as explanation to Dumbledore ) and is more or less successful. As a bonus you get fallout from that and Dumbledore's reaction.
