In linkffn(The Problem with Purity by Phoenix.Writing), Hermione is a magical animal animagus, and it is a major part of the story.

I am reading it now, as it was recommended in a response to my own, unrelated, "looking for" request; so far, no petting has been detected, sorry.

The story is very decently written, but there is bit much /deus ex machina/, and a bit much romance angst.
