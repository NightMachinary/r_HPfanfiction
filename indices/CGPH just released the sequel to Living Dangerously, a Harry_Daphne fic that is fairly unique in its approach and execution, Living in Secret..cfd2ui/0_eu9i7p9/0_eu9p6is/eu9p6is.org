A few things, and another couple major things that would be a massive spoiler if I were to say. Mostly is because of the fact that in most fics with Harry/Daphne, either Harry is "independent, badass, Dumbles, bashing, Lord, suave" or Daphne is secretly a muggle-lover that is repressed in Slytherin because of the DE juniors. And in LD, this isn't the case. She's a pureblood and was raised as such, she's not exactly one of the best persons in the world, where rainbows flow out of ass when she farts. She's flawed, and so is Harry. They're both egotistical with their relationship (which begins as a secret, because of reasons), and Harry even does some stupid shit because of Ginny (in here, they started dating in year 5 and not 6).

There's a couple more things, but as I said, it would be major spoilers.
