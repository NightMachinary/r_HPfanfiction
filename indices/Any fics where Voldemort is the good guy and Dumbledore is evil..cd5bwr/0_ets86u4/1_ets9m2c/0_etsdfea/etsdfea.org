I read it several years ago... As far as I remember, it wasn't a bad drop off point, just a drop off point. I recall being a little sad, because it seemed like they were setting up to bring Luna into the fold, and I was looking forward to that. And the revolution was just beginning. There's quite a ways to go, if the author ever decides to return to writing, /which she absolutely should/, yesplzthankyou.
