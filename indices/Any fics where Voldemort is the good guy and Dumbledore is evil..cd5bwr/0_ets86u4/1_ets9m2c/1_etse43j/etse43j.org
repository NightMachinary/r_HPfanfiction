The story has several completed 'arcs' of conflict between characters that are resolved (or mostly resolved). Those story arcs are excellent enough that I'd recommend the fic even though the big over-arching conflict with the main enemy was not close to being resolved.

The leaving off point is right after the main characters discover something crucial regarding the prophecy that may help them against the enemy. Hermione and Draco discover that they are part of the prophecy and that they have access to unprecedented magical power when focusing together. Acting on Riddle's plans, they intend to infiltrate Malfoy Manor during a Yuletide Gala to learn how to restore the Magic of every member of the conservative families who were taken captive.
