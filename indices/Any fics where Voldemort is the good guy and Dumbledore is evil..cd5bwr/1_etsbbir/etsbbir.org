I've read quite a few manipulative Dumbledore fics, but in most of the ones I've liked he and Riddle are depicted as equally morally ambiguous.

Here are a few where Dumbledore strays further into the 'evil' category:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - In fourth year Harry realizes that Dumbledore has been using legilimency to control him for most of his life. linkffn(8163784)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Harry is forced to realize that the world isn't black and white after Voldemort successfully kidnaps him in year one. The truth eventually begins to surface about a horrific tactic Dumbledore used during the first war which made the original conflict more brutal and bloody than it would have been otherwise. linkffn(11358664)
