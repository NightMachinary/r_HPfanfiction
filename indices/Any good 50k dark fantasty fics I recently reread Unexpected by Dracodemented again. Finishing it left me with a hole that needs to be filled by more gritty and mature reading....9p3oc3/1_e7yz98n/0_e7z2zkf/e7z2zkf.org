  I'm curious to know this sub's opinion on posting: should I wait until I'm done, or post what I have now week by week while I continue?

It depends on where your writing is. If you feel you would appreciate feedback to help guide the process, post weekly as you can. The readers will be more engaged if they think they might have some input on the story, especially if you can stay consistent with a posting schedule.

If you have a clear vision of what you've written and intend to write, and feel that criticism could only deflect your focus or douse your enthusiasm, post in bulk.
