I've been working on and off with something sort of similar to what you want, I think. The plot is rather dark, influenced by Irish mythology, but it is an entirely OC story, set nearly three decades after book seven with no characters from the books involved (I realize that's a deal breaker for most everyone, but maybe someone will enjoy it).

I'm currently around halfway through chapter eight, around 50k words, and I know exactly where the story is going, for the most part. I'm curious to know this sub's opinion on posting: should I wait until I'm done, or post what I have now week by week while I continue?

Edit: Sorry, I forgot reccomendations! Off the top of my head, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian]] is quite dark and has new fantasy elements like fae (?) I stopped reading after a few chapters so I can't say much more about it. One I've read and enjoyed was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11448506/1/The-Dark-Corners-of-the-Earth][Dark Corners of the Earth by Useful Oxymoron.]] It's a Bellamione romance that happens right after the Battle of Hogwarts, and Luna has an interesting arc. It's creepy and Lovecraftian and pretty well written, apart from unimaginative dueling scenes.
