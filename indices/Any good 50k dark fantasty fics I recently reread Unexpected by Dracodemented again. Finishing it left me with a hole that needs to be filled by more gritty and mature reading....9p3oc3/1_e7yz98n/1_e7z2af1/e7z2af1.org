  I'm curious to know this sub's opinion on posting: should I wait until I'm done, or post what I have now week by week while I continue?

Personally, I'd love to see what you have, because I'm working on a fic for nanowrimo inspired by Lovecraftian cosmic horror and good old fashioned Elric-esque dark fantasy, and I would love to see other takes on a Dark-Fantasy HP world. But I think better advice would depend on what your work ethic is tbh. I've realised that I have really, really shit work ethic and that I shouldn't post something that I'm only a few chapters into, and should instead wait until I've got a solid chunk of it done. But if you know for sure that you can power through without losing interest then go for it and post it week-by-week.
