I don't think it's a problem if updates slow down, so long as they don't stop entirely. Or, perhaps, slow down to the point that it's functionally the same as stopping entirely (i.e. updating once every other year). If you posted it and linked it, I'd definitely give it a read and try to give some feedback when I get some free time.

I haven't posted mine yet because it's meant to be a very, very long oneshot (like 40k words), and I'm only about 7k words in, and of those 7k I'm only sure about 2.5k of it is actually going to make it into the final product. Definitely hope to have it finished by the end of November to keep in line with the nanowrimo deadline, but even then there's probably going to be massive amounts of editing before it's really ready for posting.
