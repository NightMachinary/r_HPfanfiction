Well, it was enough, at least, and you have my gratitude for helping me purge season 8 from my brain, and for reminding me about Starnlicht. Been meaning to check it out.

And yeah, I don't expect anything. I do /hope/ for some thoughtful criticism of course, but I'm aware that I won't get many reviews, if any, and I won't be discouraged by a bad or nonexistent reaction. It's all for fun and self-improvement, and any review I may get on top of it is a bonus.

Thank you for your advice, I think I will clean it up and post it sometime this weekend. I'll send you a PM, if you like. I'd be grateful for any pointers or thoughts.
