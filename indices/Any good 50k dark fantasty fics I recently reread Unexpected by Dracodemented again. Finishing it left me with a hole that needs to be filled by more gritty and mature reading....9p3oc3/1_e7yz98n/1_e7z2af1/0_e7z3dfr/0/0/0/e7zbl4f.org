lmao it feels like I can never escape that Dexter fic. But, in my defence, that's has less to do with my shite work ethic and more to do with the fact that the show was such a heaping dumpster fire by the end that it killed any interest I had in finishing that fic.

I'd definitely give it a look if you posted the first chapter. I'd just say if you do, temper your expectations. I've never written an all OC fic, the closest I've done to that is having written a relatively obscure crossover, but even that featured characters from canon, just reinterpretations. OC fics tend to be really under-reviewed, even the ones people have mentioned a few times around the subreddit as being good, like linkffn(Starnlicht). Of course, I think you probably understand that judging by your OP, and I would never want to discourage you from posting, but, speaking from experience, sometimes writing something you're really passionate about and getting a really muted response can be a huge drag. As long as you go in with a good mindset, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't post a little bit if you want to dip your toes in.
