Ha . . . so I shouldn't do what you did to me? I just looked you up, and I had read your Dexter fic years ago. It was one of the only ones I could find that I enjoyed, bummed me out it was incomplete. I'll be checking out your new story come November.

When I run out of what's done, updates would be around once a month, at worst. I appreciate your interest. I've settled on writing more before I start rolling it out, but maybe I should put out just the first chapter? I'm anxious to know just how inadequate I actually am.
