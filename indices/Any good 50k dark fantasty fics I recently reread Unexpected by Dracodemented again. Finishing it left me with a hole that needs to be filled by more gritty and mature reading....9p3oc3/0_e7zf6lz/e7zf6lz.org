Ah, sorry, the combination of you saying trio bashing and the absolute mess of a first chapter meant I don't exactly know what you're looking for, but gritty and mature I can do : linkffn(Bungle in the jungle; Wastelands of time; Elizium for the sleepless souls; That which holds the image; The unwinding golden Thread; Forests of Valbone)

Though it isn't 50k, I'd like to recommend a Luna centric hidden gem that I highly recommend everyone try : linkffn(Innocence and Roses).
