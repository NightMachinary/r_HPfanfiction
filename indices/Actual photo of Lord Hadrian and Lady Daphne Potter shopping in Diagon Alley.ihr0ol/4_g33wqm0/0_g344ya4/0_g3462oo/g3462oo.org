It would be in DiSrEsPeCtInG ThEiR cUlTuRe! You see, they /love/ working and serving! That's not at all evidence of either a brainwashing effect of the bond or cultural indoctrination, no siree!

Honestly, have you ever actually /asked/ a house-elf if they don't like being enslaved? See, it is right here in "REINES BLUT FÃœR REINE ZAUBERER", the premiere guide for all things pureblood, that they just love being enslaved, compelled to hurt themselves, worked to the bone and living in squalor!

Because you see, they aren't human, which makes slavery okay.
