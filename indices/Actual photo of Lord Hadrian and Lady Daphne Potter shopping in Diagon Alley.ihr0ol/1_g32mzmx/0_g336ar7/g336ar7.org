Speaking of Eva Braun, she got [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Fegelein][her brother-in-law, Hermann Fegelein]], into very high positions. This man was a war criminal and an opportunist through and through.

When things began turning hopeless in 1945, he attempted to flee, but was caught when Hitler found him missing from the /Fuehrerbunker/. The next day, BBC published news about Himmler (Fegelein's boss) in negotiation with the Allies, Hitler flew into a rage and drew the connection between Fegelein's escape attempt and Himmler's betrayal. He ordered Fegelein shot later that day. Eva Braun did not speak out for her brother-in-law.
