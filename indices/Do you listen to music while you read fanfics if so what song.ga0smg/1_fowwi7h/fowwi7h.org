Sometimes, depends on how easy I'm finding it to concentrate. If I'm ready and clear minded, then yeah I'll listen to music.

I might just put some game OSTs on. Depends on the mood I'm in too. Animal Crossing is good for light, fun, filler scenes and BOTW or Undertale is good for more emotional and plot related stuff.

Another possibility would be to flip on the radio. I sometimes just go on Apple music (without membership) and they'll have a couple stations I can tune into. It's fun to let the music dictate the mood of the scene, too, or even base them entirely off the music!
