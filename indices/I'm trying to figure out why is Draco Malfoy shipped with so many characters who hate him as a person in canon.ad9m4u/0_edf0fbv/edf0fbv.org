In addition to the other reasons given, the enemies-to-lovers trope appeals to many people. Pairing together two characters with incredibly different moral outlooks or who are on two opposite sides is a shipping dynamic with a lot of versatility.

That combination makes him one of the obvious choices for people drawn to that type of story.
