I wouldn't call HP/LV a popular pairing. You will often see people requesting HP/TMR fics in this sub, but people who read HP/LV fics are rare in comparison.

For my part, I don't look for pairings. When I do like an HP/LV fic it's because I enjoy reading a well written villain or antihero who is intelligent and charismatic while completely disregarding society's morals (i.e. a fanon reinterpretation that is nothing like post-resurrection canon Voldemort). People who enjoy HP/LV might also enjoy stories about Moriarty, Lex Luther, Hannibal Lecter, Dexter, etc.
