Just because canon!Draco was mostly a repulsive little shit, that doesn't mean he can't have a moral epiphany and be a much more compelling and sympathetic character in people's fic. It wouldn't take that much, really.

What I want to know is when Harry/Voldemort became such a big thing. I turn around and leave the fandom for a short decade and the next thing I know this is a popular pairing. For Merlin's sake, why? Harry/Tom Riddle I get, especially if there's time-travel involved, and with the understanding that there's more than even odds it's going to be a tragedy. But Voldemort? Was he particularly handsome in the movies or something?

I'm not judging, really, but it seems pretty inexplicable. Do people just really enjoy the challenge, maybe? It would be one thing if it was all weird snake-themed noncon fetish kink, but I've come across a lot of fic that look like they're trying to be legitimate romances. I mean, I don't doubt that some people can do it and do it well, I'm just baffled that it's so /popular/.
