And for me too. I mean, where most of these stories struggle is making Draco's transformation (from the bigoted, spoiled brat he is in canon to a flawed, but redeemed individual) realistic. They rush it. Or they ignore it fully, just assuming that Draco is better than he is, in which case, yeah, then it's probably an element of those cursed leather pants.

/Really good/ stories are rare, as sad as that is. But I think the general desire is to redeem the character, not write-in the actor as a sex god.

Although, well, once again...can't say the latter doesn't exactly exist in the fandom.
