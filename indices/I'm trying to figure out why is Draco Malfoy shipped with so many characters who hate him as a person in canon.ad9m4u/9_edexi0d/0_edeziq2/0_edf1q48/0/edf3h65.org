Of course, some of it yeah. But a lot of it...not at all, I'd say.

I guess it just annoys me when I know that so many of these stories are constructed over themes of remorse, redemption, the Turgenev-esque Fathers and Sons drama, etc...and then someone just boils all of that down to, 'well, they thought the actors were hot.'

UGHHH!!
