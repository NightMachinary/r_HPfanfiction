Much apologies, but I'd say Snamiones and Dramiones thrive /in spite of/ the looks of their respective male actors.

Otherwise, it's because it sets up redemption arcs (who doesn't like a good redemption arc?) with a Romeo-and-Juliette-type flair, albeit lacking the tragic conclusion. Although there are those too.

And, frankly, love overcoming obstacles has been a wildly successful literary theme for...thousands of years?
