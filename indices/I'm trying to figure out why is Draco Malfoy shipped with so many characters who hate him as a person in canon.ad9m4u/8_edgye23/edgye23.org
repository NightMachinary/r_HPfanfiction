Enemies to lovers trope.

And that fanon Draco isn't actually the Draco from canon. It's pretty much OC Draco the fandom now uses.

That and "They only needs a good partner to show him/her the error of his/her ways" is also a spectacularly popular trope that is also Truth in Real Life. In that many many many many many people attempt this. Usually ends in failure a majority of the time.

In fanfiction however, you can write this attempt to be successful. Indulging in the fantasy of the trope, just like how other authors indulge in the trope of the harem where everyone is hung up on one guy/girl and showers them with praise.
