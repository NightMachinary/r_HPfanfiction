Not really. Rowling portrays Draco as realizing the error of his ways and changing, but it happens mostly off-screen during the later books/before the epilogue. Moving that change up a few years---perhaps spurred on by changes in circumstances at Hogwarts, e.g. Harry being sorted into Slytherin---isn't radically changing the character. He's still recognizably Draco Malfoy.
