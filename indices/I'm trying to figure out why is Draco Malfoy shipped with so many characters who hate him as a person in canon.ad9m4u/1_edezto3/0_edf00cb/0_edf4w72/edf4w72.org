Ripple effect from a single change though.

Why is Draco like he is in canon? Well, his father. What if he has no father or his father dies or is injured and can't teach him those things, or he has an encounter that challenges his logic or how he's been raised? He canonically is smart and a favorite of Snape's so that is also a source of how he might have overcome his prejudice. Arguably the reason Draco is the way he is is because the story needs him to be, not because it's a logical progression of his character attributes in the world he's within.
