In canon, Draco was a child who'd been raised by blood-supremacists. It is possible (although difficult) for people to reject their parents' values once they grow up. In the real world, there have been a few prominent people who started off as the white-supremacists their parents raised them to be, who reformed and are now adamantly opposed to their parents' beliefs. It's a nice story. What's not to like?
