Not sure this is 100% what you meant. I'll just list three fics that stand out in my head, for how I felt while reading them for the first time, for various reasons.

Because many tears: linkffn(3461008)

Because it is overall very well done, and it was one of the first really outstanding crossovers when it came out in 2006: linkffn(2857962)

Because it is the only well written smut fic I have read in over 19 years of HP fanfiction: linkffn(5446275)
