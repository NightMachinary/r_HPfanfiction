For an epic laugh read linkao3(The Boy Who Died a Lot) It's Snarry in the end but I think just reading up to year 4 is worth it.

Sadly not finished yet but also great is linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) So much detail and even canon history went into this one, it's one of the best world-building fics I've had the honor to read.
