I like this one. Battles with Basilisks! It's a one-shot that asks "what if Lockhart actually WAS as competent as he pretended?" The fun part here is that even if Lockhart IS genuinely smart and heroic here, he still SOMEHOW manages to be perfectly in-character! Also, Harry and Ron get a lot of funny snark.
