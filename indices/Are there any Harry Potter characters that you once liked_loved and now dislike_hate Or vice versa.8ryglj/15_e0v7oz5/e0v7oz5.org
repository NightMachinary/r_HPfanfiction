I used to like Ron and Hermione. Ron was annoying and started the friendship with Harry using Harry for his fame. Hermione is a terrible know it all.

I used to hate Draco, then he became a better person and we found out why he was like that.

I used to hate Percy but I actually like his ambition now. If my family was that less than stellar, I would also want some distance!

I liked book Ginny, movie Ginny kinda ruined book Ginny too.

I used to like Siris and Remus, now I dislike them. They dont see Harry as Harry. Just as James son.
