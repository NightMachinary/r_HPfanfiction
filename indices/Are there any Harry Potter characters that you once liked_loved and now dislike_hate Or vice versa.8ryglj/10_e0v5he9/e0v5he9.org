I really disliked Pansy Parkinson in the books, understandably, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8112955/1/Eventual-Envelopment][Eventual Envelopment]] was a fic I read that really turned her around for me. It's AU, it's femmeslash, it's fucked up, but it provided me with a sneak peek into her mind that kind of changed it around for me. Gotta love AU Pansy.
