My opinion on the canon characters has remained basically unchanged. I also generally like fanon reinterpretations of characters so long as they're used well - with the exception of Bashed!Pathetic!Ron. I /used/ to like reading that, on occasion, and still do if it's over-the-top and used for comedy, but otherwise I can't stand him and the stories that use him.
