Hm...heroic last stand or stupid death ("...Ron fell down the stairs and broke his neck after being hit by a stunning spell...") of Ron that changes Harry and maybe Hermione (as in: Drives it home that they have to fight to survive and that they are in a war, not a bar fight or something like that!)? Yeah, maybe that should be a thing :)
