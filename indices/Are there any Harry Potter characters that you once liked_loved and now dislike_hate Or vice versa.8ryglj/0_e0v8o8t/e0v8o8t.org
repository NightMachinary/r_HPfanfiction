I wouldn't say that I disliked or hated Charlie Weasley but I was more indifferent to him. However, after reading many stories with him in it, I pay more attention to the several lines he's given in the books and see him in a more positive light. I have to say that I really disliked Ginny though. I just couldn't stand her in the series, especially in Half-Blood Prince. However, after reading many, many FanFiction stories with Ginny getting bashed on an absurd level of idiocy, I do like her now and upon my last reading of the books, like her even more.

I went through stages reading /Harry Potter/. When I was younger, I always though Harry and Hermione would certainly end up together and whoever didn't see it was clearly blind. When I got a bit older, I really disliked how Rowling didn't match the aforementioned pairing and turned to FanFiction where authors did match the two together. I even dipped my own hand into the batter a couple of times and did my own spin on a Harry/Hermione love story. Now, however, as an adult, I'm completely content with Harry and Hermione being the best of friends. It's weird how some things change with age but it's all part of life, I guess.
