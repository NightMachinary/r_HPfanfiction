Ron and Hermione

When I was younger, reading the books, I was pretty ambivalent about these two. They are two of the three most important characters in the books, but I just never cared much for them as people or for their role in the story.

Over time though, and reading swaths of fanfiction, I encountered quite a bit of Ron and Hermione bashing in stories. Some deliberate and overt, while others were secondary or perhaps even inadvertent.

As I saw this more and more, I began to realize something about this view of Harry's friends, and to a lesser degree my own previous viewpoint. /That way of seeing Harry's friends is incredibly juvenille and the sort of view an angsty teenager would subscribe too/. If anything, the most flawed and broken person of the three is Harry, but he is meant to be the reader's self-insert into the HP universe (which is why he never learns anything until absolutely necessary).

I realized that much of bashing and dislike of certain characters, both by myself and seemingly others, was often a result of "having an axe to grind." Its a reduction of multi-faceted individuals (you know, like real people...) down to terrible qualities to suit a persons viewpoint. As I grew, I began to understand that is how children, and many teenagers see the world: exemplifying certain qualities and ignoring others to suit a viewpoint.

I'm not trying to insult anybody here. The short of this is that fanfiction made me realize my ambivalence and the reductionist view of characters and people was at best naive and at worst infantile. Ron and Hermione, as a practical matter, are better than the majority of the students in Hogwarts by a wide margin. Their not perfect; Ron has a strong inferiority complex and Hermione has issues with imposition and heavy-handededness. But that is how /people/ are. Their not perfect, and their not just one quality.
