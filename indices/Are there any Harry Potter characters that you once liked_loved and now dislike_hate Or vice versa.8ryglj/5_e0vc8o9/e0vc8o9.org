Since I started reading the Series after age 40, my views of characters are pretty much set.

However, my impression of Dumbledore has upgraded from ‘hate' to ‘dislike', since there's not much point to grind axe with a literary plot device.

I do enjoy fics in which certain bad characters are elevated to ‘good', among them Bellatrix, Grindelwald, Lockhart, Petunia, and Tom Riddle.

Speaking of Voldemort, this is my absolutely top hated character, both in a literary sense and his in-story behaviors. This monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain with a hopeless dose of compulsive obsessive stupidity is also primarily responsible for Dumbledore becoming an incompetent plot device, because a slightly more competent Dumbledore would have shot the canon plot instantly, as in “Petrification Proliferation”.

That being said, I really like a somewhat more sane and less evil Voldemort, as “Seventh Horcrux” is by far my top favorite fic. “Prince of Dark Kingdom” would also rank much higher if it was finished.
