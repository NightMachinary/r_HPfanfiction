My opinion on Sirius and James has changed drastically after I've grown up and taken a new look at them. They are vicious bullies and Sirius tried to kill Snape as a kid by using lupin. There is no way around it.

But the worst thing is how Sirius is portrayed in fanfiction. I gag whenever I see him get Hermione or a super hot super smart blonde bombshell of a woman, who happens to cure him of the depression Azkaban years.

Fanfiction destroyed Luna Lovegood for me. I used to love her, now I hate it whenever I see her. There are very very very few depictions of Luna in FF that are quite good
