Hermione has an arc? I don't know...IMHO character development isn't really happening in HP! Rowling isn't bad at world-building (or at least basic world building, because many fanfictions truly expand on the world she has made in ways she probably never thought of!), but her characters never change much IMHO! Harry still wants to be "just Harry" at the end IMHO!
