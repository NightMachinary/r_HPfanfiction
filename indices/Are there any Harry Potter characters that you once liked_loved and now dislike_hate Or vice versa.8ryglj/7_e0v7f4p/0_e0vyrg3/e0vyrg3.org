I think that's Rowling's point though. Hermione isn't meant to be this perfect intellectual girl in the very beginning of the story. (I'm listening to Philosopher's Stone rn and I see what you mean) Her character is bossy and annoying and a bit of a know-it-all. However, through the books she becomes more than that and that's the best part; the character arc.
