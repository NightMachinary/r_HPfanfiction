Well, it's not like their canon characterisations make them good people once you look deep enough. Between Lupin's disregard for Harry and him running from his pregnant wife, there is not really much that could be considered a redeeming quality. And Dumbledore with his "ten dark years" isn't much of a kind grandfather either.
