Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore!

I first fell for his grandfather image (we after all see the story through Harry's eyes, not to mention that Harry doesn't seem to hate the man despite him being the root of almost all the bad things in Harry's life!) and saw him as kind of Harry Potter's Gandalf, but I read some fanfiction later and it got me thinking! I examined the headmaster - put him under a microscope really - and found out that he truly is IMHO an asshole and shouldn't be an educator at all because frankly he is unfit to care for children and neither should he be a leader or a politician because he's not fit for those positions either! He might do well as an anti-social researcher in some ivory-tower, but that is it!)

All the Hogwarts teachers (from except for Snape, I always hated his guts!)! None of them should IMHO educate anybody either because most of them aren't fit to teach either (rampant bullying for example which the faculty should IMHO STAMP OUT! Same for keeping the kids save! Damned, the robot HK47 from Star Wars would do a better job if his master ordered him to keep the kids save! Hell, he'd probably murder the shit out of the basilisk and any deatheaters :D - for those who don't know: This is an assassin droid who really enjoys killing and hurting people, so not somebody who you would normally want to look after kids!)

Remus "I am a coward - Oh woe is me!" Lupin...I thought him brave dealing with his affliction, but later I understood that it made him a coward who can't deal with outside pressure (and would rather flee than fight! Damned, this man is the antithesis of a werewolf! This is probably why the transformation hurts him more than most!)

Arthur and Molly Weasley (the whipped husband and the overbearing helicopter mother who doesn't allow her kids to make up their own minds, no wounder that Bill, Charlie and the twins left ASAP, as did Percy for that matter!...I did like them once because they were nice to Harry, but I get it now that most people would have been because frankly: Who wouldn't want to keep the young celebrity at their home? Doing so might open previously closed doors after all etc.! Not to mention that they both are idiots for having so many kids! I think parents should have a reasonable number so that they can truly care for them all and give them the love they deserve (so 4 at max, but more like 2-3))

The Order of the Phoenix - thought them competent once, but now I think that most of them are useless and couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag! They can gather information, but in a straight up fight most of them are a hindrance, not an asset!

Hermione - so smart but yet so uncreative and dumb at times and deffinitely not the genius the fandom makes her out to be!

Ron - loved the guy when I was reading the books, but if you critically look at him then he's IMHO a useless waste of space and a bad friend!

As for the other way round?

Sirius Black - I once saw him as childish without a reason, but I forgot that this guy was in solitary (sure he had crazy DEs in the cells around him, but I bet they didn't much talk to him!) for most of his adult life! Not to mention that he grew up during a war and it is IMHO part of his coping mechanism (for both the war and his crappy dark family!), not to mention that you don't grow up when locked up and neither do you if the only things you know are school and prison! As far as we know Sirius migh never have had a real job, he probably never had a girlfriend for long etc.!
