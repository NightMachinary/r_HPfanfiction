I used to be ambivalent toward Snape. Didn't approve of Albus Severus - in fact I still think the choice is OOC - but I didn't outright /hate/ Snape. Then I started reading fanfiction, where he's either glorified, his actions are OOC, or both. But again, I didn't /really/ care. Then one of my best friends started dating a guy who's a /lot/ like Snape (manipulative, obsessive, possessive, borderline abusive, etc.), and I realized he is less than trash and Lily, like my friend, was better off without him. Growing up made me realize that, unfortunately, there are a lot of Snapes in the world. Now I get a vindictive enjoyment out of Snape-bashing.

As an aside, growing up has also made me realize there are a lot of people like James Potter in the world. Sometimes bullies /can/ mature, and it can even happen within a year, believe it or not.
