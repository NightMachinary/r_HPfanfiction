As Hermione watched with a shocked expression, trying to process both the massacre that had just happened and the idea that HER Crookshanks was teaming up with Harry, the boy casually got up and waved his wand to...wait a minute!

"YOU KNOW THE VANISHING SPELL?! WHEN DID YOU...WHY DIDN'T YOU VANISH THE BIRDS IF YOU KNEW HOW TO?"

"Because," said Harry as he leaned across, Crookshanks sitting on his shoulder calmly licking the blood off his paws, "I needed to get a message through to a dumb bint."
