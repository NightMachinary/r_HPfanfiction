Ok, a couple things.

1. Freud was a bit of a freak, but even then his belief in the concept focused more on a person sexual awakening or first sexual thoughts than it did long term infatuation or love.

2. He used a review of Odipus Rex to push his idea and gain popularity, but his actual theories don't truely match the story in the first place. He basically said "look, incest!" And proceeded to then completely disregard the differences in his beliefs and the context of the story.

3. If you actually think of the story instead of Freud's mother issues, Ginny fits better. Oedipus wasn't raised by his mother, and didn't even know what she looked like till later in life. He kills his father, some stuff happens, and he proceeded to marry and bone his mom. They don't know she's his mother till after the fact, and the woman who raised him is afk by that point in the story. With all that, Lily 2.0 (aka ginny) fits the mold a hell of a lot better than daphne.

4. This is kind of a dumb situation regardless. Even if a love interest has similarities to someone's mom, they're not the same person. There's nothing wrong with it and trying to twist it to look like incest fantasy is weird.
