Hate on her all you want for recent comments, but having an Asian character be the protagonist's love interest was pretty damn progressive in 2000, regardless of the name. Also, I have a Chinese friend who likes to be called Cho even though her real name is Qiu, since it's easier to pronounce and sounds similar, so let's not act like she derived the name from Ching Chong.
