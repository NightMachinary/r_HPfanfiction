I think they have some similarities in that they are both introverted which makes them seem distant and cold at a glance. But I've always seen Daphne as someone who is very self-assured unlike Petunia who is constantly comparing herself to other neighbors and demeaning others to make herself feel better. Daphne, I think, can have a good nature once Harry crosses that barrier and gets to know her better. I like the idea of Harry pairing with an introvert because it seems to fit with his personality better.
