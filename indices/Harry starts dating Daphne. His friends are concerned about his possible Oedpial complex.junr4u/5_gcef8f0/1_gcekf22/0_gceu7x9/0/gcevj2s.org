When asked who Draco Malfoy marries, JK Rowling said this:

"Astoria Greengrass, younger sister of the Greengrass family. We meet Daphne Greengrass, part of Pansy Parkinson's Slytherin posse, in Book V when Hermione takes her O.W.L.s."

Pansy's gang of Slytherin girls were regularly described as making nasty remarks at Hermione and laughing at Hermione when her front teeth were elongated.
