After watching the mandalorian I always had this headcannon where Harry discovers who she is during his early auror career and goes on a dangerous chase around the world to save her. And then raise her as his own, of course.

It would just be so poetic for him to just think of leaving her to someone else at first but then remembering his own childhood and deciding to be a better man than Dumbledore/Voldemort.
