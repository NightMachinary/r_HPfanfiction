I liked Cursed Child more than any of the films. It was apparently really good as a stage show. A lot of the parts people disliked make sense when you realize it was written to be a stage show not adapted into one. I dont consider it canon per se but canon adjacent. ( same with Fantastic Beasts) I think it would be neat if someone wrote a similar story but more within the rules of the HP verse. delphini was super interesting as an antagonist.
