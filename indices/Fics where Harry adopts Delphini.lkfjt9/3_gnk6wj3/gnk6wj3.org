So in Harry Potter and the Language of Serpents, book two of The Problemverse, Snape survives the final battle and adopts Delphini, pretending to be her biological father so there's no "Voldemort's heir!" bullshit. Harry is Snape's apprentice (this is an AU where Harry is less quick to anger and more interested in chemistry and potions than canon) and lives with him, so is a major part of taking care of baby Delphini. It's really not long enough but does definitely give some good Harry caretaking the baby feels.
