linkao3(17912252): Hear the Ocean Call You Home. Yes, it does contain the start of a relationship, but it is explicitly not tied to the creature portion. At all. No fated mate bullshit, a lot of pelt-based angst.

linkao3(3334649): That Boy Is A Monster. Harry adjusts to vampirism.

linkao3(29486223): Harry is a Dementor and That's Okay. Crack fic. Harry is a Dementor, Snape is bigoted.

linkao3(25160617): Sealskin. Pelt-based dysphoria feels.

linkao3(23391646): The BMI of a Young Wizard. The Dursleys is not a good place for a sangivore. Set in Year 1 with a competent Snape.

linkao3(15832620): The Fire that Swallowed the World. Harry died and her body was accidentally possessed by some sort of fire spirit who really doesn't get humans.

linkao3(25833736): Sparks. Orphaned dragon hatchlings will adapt to survive. Harry is very good at his disguise and very bad at avoiding suspicion.

linkao3(18152387): Hold your Breath. Friendship amphibious merrow fic.

linkao3(14495835): Cephalophore. Not actually Harry but a fun post-canon fic about a fae student's first day.

linkao3(2281026): A Flick of the Tail Fin. Cool series about carp dragon animagery. Not technically a creature fic series, but thematically it fits.

linkffn(5786099): Cold Blood. Basilisk venom and phoenix tears are the catalyst for chimerization, which happens in 4th year.

linkffn(5621051): Outcasts' Alley. Harry just wants to take care of this baby someone handed him. Chaos ensues.

linkffn(11607795): Small (Creature) Comforts. Somewhat tropey inheritance one-shot, but no infidelity from Lily.
