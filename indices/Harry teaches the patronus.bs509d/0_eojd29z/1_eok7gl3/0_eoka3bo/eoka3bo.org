I'll admit I'm struggling with that story. I have a very vivid image of things that happen in the next chapter, but the scene right after the end of the last chapter. (I'm relatively new to reddit so I'm not sure how do do the black out thing to prevent spoilers.) The fallout scene is *strugglebussing* and i can't figure out how certain characters will react which is ground any progress to a halt.
