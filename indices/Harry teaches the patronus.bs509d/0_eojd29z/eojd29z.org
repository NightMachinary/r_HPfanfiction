Pretty sure that scene is from my story "I'm Still Here." Ah. Someone linked it. It stemmed from part of my irritation with the Harry Potter series as a whole.

Harry conjures a Patronus in book three. Which is supposed to be an impressive piece of magic. BUT WAIT! We can't have Harry be at all special or talented at ANYTHING! So let's just go ahead and strip all that away from him in book 5. By having all of the 5th years and 4th years manage it with a bit of teaching from him. So that leaves Harry only good at... teaching? in canon anyway. So that was my nod to that dynamic, him teaching the patronus.
