here's one, while he's not a main player per se, if it wasn't for Sirius son in this series harry wouldn't be able to do half the things she does. It's a fem harry story, no pairings so far and the author is still updating. though it's only up to book three at the moment, they're fairly long and interesting however, deals a lot with potions and magic. very plot heavy as well.
