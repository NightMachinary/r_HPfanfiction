  1)Not believing Luna's theories. The thing is that nobody believes Luna's theories, except Luna and her father and for good reason. We never see any reason to believe Luna's theories. Why is Hermione narrow-minded for not believing absurd theories? It's like saying you're narrow-minded just because you don't accept fake news.

Right, I think people are misidentifying the dichotomy between Luna and Hermione. It's not between being open- vs close-minded, but about chaos vs structure. Maybe even idealism vs. materialism.

As a materialist (for the most part) myself I'm not unfamiliar with the notion of people claiming that this somehow makes me close minded. Being able to entertain different ideas isn't the same as accepting all of them. Clearly Luna doesn't accept all ideas either.

The only really closed minded one of the trio is actually Ron, he's barely capable of understanding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind][theory of mind]] ("Clearly Harry must have put his name in the Goblet! I'd want to be in the tournament and therefore Harry would want to be a champion too")
