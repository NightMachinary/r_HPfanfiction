Yes, it's a common argument but I don't agree with it. Hermione is not "narrow-minded" for not believing in absurd theories and in legends.

  But at least now you admit she [Hermione] has flaws. In the previous thread you claim she "almost has no flaws.

You're confused. Even in my original comment I said Hermione "barely has any flaws". This implies that she DOES have some flaws but they're minor and insignificant. It doesn't imply that she "doesn't have any flaws".

Hermione might have flaws, but it doesn't matter because she never faces any real consequences for them, unlike Harry and Ron who both pay for their mistakes and have to apologize. When did Hermione ever apologize for anything? Even when someone criticized her in the series, that person was usually portrayed as the bad guy, while Hermione was portrayed as the victim. Whenever something bad happens to Hermione, it's always someone else's fault and of course never her fault.
