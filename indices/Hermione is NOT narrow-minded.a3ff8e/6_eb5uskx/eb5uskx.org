WOW...you weren't getting brownie points in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a3d9m0/from_a_character_perspective_hermiones_backstory/][original thread]] so you had to create an entirely new one to try and prove your flawed point. This is a first. I don't think I've ever seen that done on this platform before.

But at least now you admit she [Hermione] has flaws. In the previous thread you claim she "almost has no flaws."

Also, just because "in some cases" she has proven to be more open-minded than Harry and Ron doesn't automatically mean she isn't close-minded herself. Like I said before, you argue with Kreacher and I'll argue with S.P.E.W. And Hermione not outing Lupin (initially - because she did out him later in Prisoner of Azkaban) doesn't necessarily mean she's open-minded. One could argue she was fond of him as a professor after her first two Defense Against the Dark Arts professors were complete rubbish.

  Harry is usually MORE narrow-minded than Hermione since he is more likely to be prejudiced (examples: his perceptions about Kreacher, Snape, Slytherin etc.)

You're again, cherry-picking. If you think Harry is usually more narrow-minded, where was his prejudice against Hagrid, Lupin, half-breeds (half-giant, half-goblin, half-Veela, half-vampire), and Muggle-borns?

But you do you, HellenicLady. Your non-argument is now tiring. Cheers!
