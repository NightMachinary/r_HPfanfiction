Ah, what the heck. I'll bite.

  The thing is that nobody believes Luna's theories, except Luna and her father and for good reason. We never see any reason to believe Luna's theories. Why is Hermione narrow-minded for not believing absurd theories? It's like saying you're narrow-minded just because you don't accept fake news.

It's far more than that. Hermione isn't just dismissive of Luna's theories, she's actively antagonistic.

First, you mention that nobody believes Luna's theories, except for Luna and her father. That's not true: the /Quibbler/ is a collection of articles, more than a few of which are comprised of interviews with people who saw or experienced something they can't explain. These people had nowhere else to go, and nobody else who was willing to listen to them.

Going to Hermione herself:

Hermione says /The Quibbler/ is a load of rubbish and then gives a thoroughly unconvincing, half-arsed apology when Luna interrupts that her father is the editor.

And more to the point, Hermione will interrupt otherwise neutral conversations for no other reason that to prove she's right. When Luna stands up to Parvati and Lavender for laughing at her support of Harry (the girls were laughing at Luna's radish earrings but that's beside the point--Luna legitimately thought they were mocking Harry), saying that others didn't believe in the Crumple-Horned Snorkack and Blithering Humdinger, Hermione says that those people were right.

Hermione says that Harry can find better supporters than Luna, who "only believes in things when there's no evidence whatsoever."

This is war. You can't afford to be choosey with your allies and reject them for eccentricities. And Hermione is skating on /very/ thin ice by implying that some people are better than others, when the "other" in question is someone who has not done her any wrong.
