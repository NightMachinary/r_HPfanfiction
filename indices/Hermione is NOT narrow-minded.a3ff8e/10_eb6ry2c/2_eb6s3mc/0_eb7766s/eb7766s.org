Because she always thinks she knows best, which IMHO is the very deffinition of narrow minded (when you can't conceive that others might be right, instead of you!)! It's always her way or the highway (unless people ignore her and go ahead with what they want to do anyway! Not that she is always wrong, but she isn't always right either!)

And yes, if a friend tells you: "Leve it alone! I don't want the police involved!" Then you either leave it alone (good friend!) or look into the parcel yourself (best friend!) - you don't snitch to the police yourself, you don't send them text-messages or e-mails (or mail an anonymous letter) etc.!
