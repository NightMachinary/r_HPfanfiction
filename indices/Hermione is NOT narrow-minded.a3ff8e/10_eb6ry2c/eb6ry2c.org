She also believed she could free houselves (and that they would and should be thankful for her efforts - instead she only forced Dobby to be the only one to clean Gryffindor Tower!) and that she had the right to snitch on Harry getting his Firebolt (which she didn't! She broke his trust, which is IMHO one of the worst things you can do to a friends! If you believe (note: RL example here!) that someone sent that friend a bomb? You open the freaking parcel yourself, especially if said friend doesn't want the police (teachers!) involved!)

​

So yes, she certainly is a bit narrow minded when she doesn't do her research! Over all you might be right, but that doesn't make Hermione super open minded (hell, another example: It took her AGES to accept that Lockheart was a FRAUD and a liar who shouldn't teach!) either! Hell, her correcting peoples swearing makes her a posh little nerd (Ron was right to call her a nightmare! Seriously, I hate Ron but he was right here (it's not diplomatic to say that when the person you are talking about can hear, but that doesn't make it wrong!)). Hell, with her parents she probably is a trust-fund kid (not as rich as Draco, but certainly well off!)

​

Still, she can be narrow minded, which happens when either something offends her sensibilities (enslaved houselfs, because muggles don't have any slavery anymore!) or when she thinks she is better than other people ("Harry is a dumbass, he will not get the teachers involved - so I guess it is up to me!" - that could easily have been her thought process, without taking into account why Harry might not trust authority figures (who have only hurt him up to that point and were at best indifferent (McGonagall during 'Sorcerer's Stone') towards him and hostile at worst (Dursleys and Snape)))

​

She certainly is not dumb, but sometimes teenagers don't have all the info (goes for adults too sometimes!) but they judge or act anyway!

​

ps: Harry's perceptions about Snape were spot on! Yes, he wasn't a traitor (Harry was 99% right, he just wasn't right about the side Snape was on!) but an awful human being and a murderer (no matter what Dumbledore wanted, what Snape does is still murder! Sure you can claim it to be a mercy killing which also gave Dumbledore's life some final purpose, but that doesn't change the fact that they planned this (so Dumbledore planned his own murder, but the one to do it was Snape! Good people probably would have refused, at least until Dumbledore was in unbearable pain and would die in minutes anyway!))

Kreacher was an awful elf and deserves a horrible death!

Most Slytherins (Draco, Parkinson, Snape, Crabbe, Goyle, Lucius Malfoy etc. etc. etc.) were awful people, so again: Harry was pretty spot on (yes, there are Slytherins who are like that, but if it is life and death? Sorry, I wouldn't risk life and limb trusting any Slytherins (note: I am one myself - well either that or a Raveclaw nerd! - but I wouldn't allow bullying around me, so the trio would know I am not a bad guy! While most Slytherins we know about either are bullies or thugs who support bullies or at least they do not step in (which is almost as bad!))
