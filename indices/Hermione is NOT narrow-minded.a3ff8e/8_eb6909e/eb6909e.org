I like Hermione. She is a good character although she has her flaws. Her good and bad sides make her a wonderful character. She's a great friend of Harry, although they occasionally have their disagreements. They're like siblings, and siblings don't always agree with each other.

I really don't think Hermione's narrow-minded. She's just a witch like you and me. When I read this thread, I rather think all the members of this subs are more narrow-minded than Hermione. Just take her as she is instead of poisoning the HP universe with contrived half truths.
