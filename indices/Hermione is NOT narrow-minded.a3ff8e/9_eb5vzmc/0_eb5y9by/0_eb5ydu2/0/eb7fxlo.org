Some are more outlandish than others: the Ancient Runes that can turn your enemies ears into turnips seems outlandish, but hardly out of the realm of possibility for the Potter-verse; the army of heliopaths seems absurd, until you read /Deathly Hallows/ and realize that fiendfyre is a thing....

Really, Fudge and the goblins is the most outlandish of all Luna's theories.
