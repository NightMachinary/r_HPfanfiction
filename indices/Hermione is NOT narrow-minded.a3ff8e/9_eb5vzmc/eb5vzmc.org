My headcanon regarding Luna is that she has some kind of odd obscure magical ability that allows her to see creatures that (almost) nobody else can see who interacts with the world in pelicular ways. Because she isn't really insane/crazy/whatever except for the fact that she knows about a large assortment of creatures nobody else knows about -- she behaves mostly normally otherwise.
