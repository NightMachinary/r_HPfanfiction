There are still people, including women, in my country that believe that women are inferior to men. I was part of a committee to educate them against domestic violence and almost every woman believe that it was the husband's right to beat her if he felt like it. Would you tell people who are trying to help these women that they shouldn't because they view their relationships differently than others do?
