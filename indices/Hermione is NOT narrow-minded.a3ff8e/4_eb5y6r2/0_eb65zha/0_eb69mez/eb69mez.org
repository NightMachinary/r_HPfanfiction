I dislike Hermione immensely for a variety of reasons. But we have no earthly idea if she did or didn't do any research.

Of the two characters, Luna is far more likely to make up something and believe it as fact without any proof than Hermione.

Hermione is more likely to look into something and figure it out and make a decision from that. It's far more in Hermione's character to do the research and decide it's all crap than it is in Luna's to make an informed decision.

Could she have been dismissing them out of hand like we would with say, the existence of Twilight Sparkle? Sure. But if there's any character in the entire HP universe that is going to at least try to see if there was any merit to it, it's Hermione.

It's funny that you whine about Hermione apologism and then ignore an argument that promotes one of her worst traits. She's obsessive with knowledge to a fault.

However; in this situation, she is almost certainly 100% correct. Luna's reaction is more akin to a put off child taking their ball and going home.

Hell, as a writer I'd probably use Hermione intentionally in this case. If the dismissal comes from say, Ron or Harry, who are less 'factually' reliable, it holds less weight than if it comes from the only character in the book that might have actually tried to find the truth in it.

Your entire assumption that she did no research could very well be true. But, given that she researched everything to the point that it's practically a running joke, ignores what's presented in the text in other areas.
