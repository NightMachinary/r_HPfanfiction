Hermione has TONS of flaws. She's impatient, bossy, arrogant, has few social skills, is extremely holier-than-thou, and is passive in many situations where she shouldn't be and aggressive in many situations where she shouldn't be.

The one thing we absolutely know about her is that she reads everything she can about wizarding culture and the magical world. She openly says that she's read the Quibbler before in that conversation, and then says that there's no proof that the creatures exist. That's a pretty heavy implication that she's looked them up or had already seen something else that called it a hoax.
