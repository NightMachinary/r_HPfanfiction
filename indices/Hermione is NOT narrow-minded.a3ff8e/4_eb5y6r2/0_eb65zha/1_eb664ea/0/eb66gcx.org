This Hermione Granger apologism needs to end, honestly. This place is rampant about Hermione Granger having no flaws.

Anyway, this is not the only case where Hermione has dismissed something without even looking into it, but that's fine because she's based on a human and all humans can be quite narrow-minded. I seriously doubt she looked them up prior to this meeting. She dismissed their existence instantly.
