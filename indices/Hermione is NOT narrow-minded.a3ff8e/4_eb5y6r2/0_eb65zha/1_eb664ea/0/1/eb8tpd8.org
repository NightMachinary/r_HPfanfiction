Hermione has no real flaw at all. Well, if you want to get technical she does have traits that could be considered flaws, but in the plot they're not portrayed as flaws at all, as Hermione is portrayed as being right 99% of the time. The plot is simply written in such a way that Hermione turns out to be right even if only by chance. (example: her saying that the HBP book was dangerous in some way and then it turned out that it had dangerous spells inside) The only time where she was shown to be somewhat wrong was with the house elves and with the DHs , but even then she was only "partially" wrong.

I am not saying it as if it's a good thing though. I actually think it would have been better if her flaws were explored more, but I feel that it simply didn't happen. Even when she did questionable things, like attacking Ron with birds, the text made it look like she was justified.

Think about it. Did we ever see Hermione screw up the way Harry and Ron sometimes did? Did we ever see her actually face any consequences for her mistakes? Did she ever even have to apologize for anything? Of course not. Saying that Hermione is "perfect" is an exaggeration, but not far from the truth.
