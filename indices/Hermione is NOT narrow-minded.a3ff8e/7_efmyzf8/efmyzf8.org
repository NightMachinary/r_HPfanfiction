Yes she is! It's always her way or the highway!

When Harry gets the Firebolt and doesn't want to turn it in (and seriously: Which teenage boy would turn in what would in RL be an expensive racing-motorcycle, especially if he's allowed to drive it?) she sneaks off and gets McGonagall involved!

Then there's spew! As far as we know Hermione knows nothing more about houselfs than what Harry told her and she decides that the wiz-world are all slavers and that freeing the slaves is something that she - a schoolgirl - needs to attempt ASAP!

Not to mention all her fights with equally narrow minded (and far more stupid!) Ron Weasley! Someone who isn't narrow minded would just let it go and stop fighting all the time!

ps: No, I am not saying that because Lovegood said it (I've never finished the last book, I couldn't stomach how Rowling dismantles her hero! Seriously, Harry comes accross as the worst bumbling fool imaginable in that book! He didn't even plan the 'crux-hunt! He has no provisions, no tent, no super-bag etc. that is all Hermione! He only brings some clothes and his wand and expects that to be enough! Damned, I could have planned this better at age 11! Why? Simply, I hate going hungry, so if I had to camp for an extended period of time? You bet I'd bring tons of food and even some entertainment etc.!)...I don't like Xeno at all! He's a bad father IMHO who never got over his wife's death and who therefore wasn't able to really take good care of Luna, who now has similar delusions to her father! Really sad IMHO!

Not to mention that Xeno is a bad businessman who basically prints fairytales!
