I was reading one recently which was H/Hr/Daphne, and it just tripped over itself from the get go. The author had to LITERALLY deus ex machina to make sure no complications arose from silly things like parents being not on board with a "triple soul bond." I think my favourite part of it was when the author writes that Daphne and Hermione are also soul bonded, and then they continue to essentially ignore each other in favour of dangling off Harry as "his girls." Creepy fuckin' fic. I could complain more, but yeah lol
