[[https://www.sugarquill.net][www.sugarquill.net]] is a pretty old site, it's not updated any longer but pretty much everything on there is good because they had actual standards of grammar and spelling for everything posted, with "editors" who would review new fics as quality control before posting. A lot of their stuff is pretty fascinating because it was written pre-OOTP when nobody knew how the series was going to end, but still was expected to be canon compliant.
