Don't have a link on hand, but it's been posted a ton of times here so I don't think you'll have much trouble finding it.

It's from Space battles, a fic about Harry having a secret dream vacation home type list, and drops it in Diagon Alley. The shopkeepers and whatnot find it, and create it, bigger on the inside trunk style, as a pendant and gives it to him.

Sadly was abandoned, last I heard.
