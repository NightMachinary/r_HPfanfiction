There is a fic with the same name and premise in ffa, but it's an old one. This one's (I think) an adoption of it and is much bigger.

Harry becomes a bloody dragon at age 8. Super Intelligence included. Unfortunately for him, super intelligence does not mean super maturity.

This fic has a collection of extremely unique characterisations and very interesting (and mature) world building.
