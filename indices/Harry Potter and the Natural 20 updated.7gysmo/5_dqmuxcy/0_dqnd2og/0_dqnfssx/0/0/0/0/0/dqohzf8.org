Which is missing the point again.

You asked a question. I gave you an answer to that question: it's different because Madame Rowling asked while at the same time giving something of an endorsement for fanfiction in general (and people are doing it out of respect because she asked). Then you tried to justify an opposite view by rules-lawyering in a way that no court would ever take from you, which implies that you do not respect her asking at all.

You are free to disagree with any point made. But in this specific case, by doing so in the way you are doing you have shown that you do not, on a fundamental level, have any understanding of the answer (rules-lawyering against people asking to please not do something generally is a sign that you do not respect them at all). Which means what you did does count as missing the point. I may have phrased the answer better, you could put that one on me, sure, but even if it were only about the legal side of it your attempt at rules-lawyering would ... not exactly be a positive thing.
