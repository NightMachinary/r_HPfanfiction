What makes this different is that while most authors quietly pretend that fanfiction is not a thing, Madame Rowling did actually speak up and say she is fine with fanfiction for as long as no money is being made on it (there was a bit more, but that's the important part here).

That's what makes it different, because in this fandom getting money for it does not go against something that is forbidden implicitly but rather explicitly.

Personally I don't really care (not that I'm going to pay anyway, if it's required to read something then I'll just not read it), but it's generally good to know of things of this kind when you get into a not-so-legal area.
