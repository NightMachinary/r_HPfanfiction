I'm guessing s/he is talking about the fact that FanFictions are based on another person's work and you shouldn't make money out of it. A Patreon to write HP FanFiction she kills le purpose of it. And JKR will definitely not let that slide. I know I wouldn't :) You want to make money, create your own stuff, don't make it on someone else's work.
