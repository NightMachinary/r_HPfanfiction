Anecdotal, but I know of two other fanfic authors who've tried to set up Patreons and it hasn't gone well.

S'TarKan of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) did so and hasn't touched his fanfiction (to my knowledge) since then because he's been writing original fiction (I mean, that's not a bad thing overall, but rough for the people who wanted more ffn)

Brainthief of linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) started a Patreon to help support his writing of the fic and dropped off the map shortly afterwards.I thought I remembered someone saying he stopped writing entirely because FFN.net didn't want him soliciting money for fanfiction, but that could be totally wrong.

Again, those are just anecdotal cases though, so maybe it'd work out this time around.

Edit: Whoops, there's a thread on the front page right now talking about what happened with 0-800-Rent-A-Hero. Doesn't seem like it had anything to do with FFN.net, I guess the author just set up a Patreon and then stopped writing even after doing that. Sounds like burnout I guess.
