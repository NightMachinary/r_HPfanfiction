Any criticism of a character or their actions isn't bashing. After the second year, Dumbledore sending Harry back to his relatives gets less and less excusable every time (In a Watsonian sense. It's clear the Doylist reason is for a consistent starting point for the next novel), but especially after Voldemort gains the blood protection.

It doesn't show Dumbledore as anything that he's not in canon, so I don't think it's bashing at all for a more badass Ron to have a go at him for it.
