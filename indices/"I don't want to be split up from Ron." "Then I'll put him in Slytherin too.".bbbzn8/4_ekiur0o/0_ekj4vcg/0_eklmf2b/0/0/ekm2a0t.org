None of the "shit" Ron said was made up, it's just handwaved in canon. Ron has a watsonian reason to be mad at Dumbledore, and Dumbledore has a watsonian reason to want Harry to stay there. All the fic shows is a Ron who was willing to go off at Dumbledore. Canon shows Harry going off at Dumbledore. It is massively upsetting to realize that the hopes of an entire world rest on a teenage boy's shoulders.

Harry was emotionally harmed by his summers there (by his whole childhood there), and the isolation he was put in the summer before 5th year was just plain stupid. If there were invisible guards around his house, obviously they could have delivered letters to him without him seeing them.

Dumbledore clearly made some sub-optimal decisions. That doesn't make him a bad person, it just makes him human. For example, had Dumbledore given Harry the book on Occlumency during that summer, when Harry had so much free time, and insisted he learn it in order to be more informed, so much could have gone differently. Harry's capable of great feats of magic when he knows they're needed, such as a corporeal Patronus in 3rd year. It could have helped him with his grief and trauma from the graveyard. It could have stopped us from reading about an angsty wanker protagonist all throughout the longest book in the series.

If you think that's bashing, I don't know what to tell you. You probably only read incredibly boring fix-it fics where nothing ever goes wrong for Dumbledore. I'd absolutely believe a 3-dimensional, regretful Dumbledore would listen to Ron, who's speaking (yelling) out of concern and love for Harry. Dumbledore understands and respects love, unlike Voldemort.
