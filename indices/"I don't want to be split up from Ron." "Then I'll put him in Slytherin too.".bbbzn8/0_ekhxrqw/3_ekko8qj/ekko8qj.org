The currently-updating story /Fate/ deals with this very well. It really explores how Ron thrives in the Slytherin environment to become his own person, as well as the resistance he faces from his family as he does so. In one of the more recent chapters, Percy admits the Sorting Hat gave him the choice of Slytherin as well, but he was too afraid to take the plunge.

I definitely highly recommend reading it if you're a fan of Ron!
