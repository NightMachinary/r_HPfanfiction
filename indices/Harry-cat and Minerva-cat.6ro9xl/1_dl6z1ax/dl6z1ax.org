Heh, I was reading about servals (a kind of wild cat species with big ole pointy ears), and the thingy I saw mentioned how the Ancient Egyptians worshipped them for their power and grace.

And while that might sound silly and backwards, remember that in those times, cats, domesticated or not, were pretty good at taking down household pests like mice which would have otherwise eaten precious grain.

Imagine that; when Harry finishes his animagus transformation amazingly early (like the Marauders), Trelawney wanders by and delivers a prophecy about blah blah 'ancient guardians of the great river's grain' and 'legendary foe' and 'forgotten power of the past', Harry and McGonagall end up using their cat animagi forms to research an Ancient Egyptian counterpart to Parseltongue and Parselmagic; Catgotyourmagic from Catgotyourtongue (working title).

Can Peter Pettigrew in his rat form, bolstered by Voldemort's magic to spread pestilence and decay and eat all the potato chips, defeat these two feline masters of lost magic when they wield their massive powers of protection, pest-control, and yarn-ball manipulation?
