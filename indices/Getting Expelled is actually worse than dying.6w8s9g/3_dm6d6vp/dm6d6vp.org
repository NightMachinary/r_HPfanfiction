A lot of stories do this, as clearly it's worse for Muggleborn like Hermione. She already knows people out there want to kill people like her, even in first year. She actually pays attention to history, both mundane and magical. No /way/ she hasn't read up on the last genocide in her country.

And Harry is told before the trial that not only will he lose his wand and get kicked out of school, but he'll lose the ability to do magic at all. So there is some sort of extra "fuck you" to people kicked out for violating the Statutes, unlike merely kicked out of school like Hagrid.

No evidence that Hermione would face this just from getting expelled. But both her and her parents will be serious threats to the Statute even if it is only her wand being snapped. Mind wipes all around is certainly in the cards for a violently incompetent government, like canon's, even if it isn't "official" policy.

Still, JKR is a terrible world builder, so it was obviously in canon a "ha ha look at the swat" line, and the author intended nothing more. Propping up the jocks and mocking the nerds is very much JKR's thing in Harry Potter, for some damn reason.

Maybe that is meant to be Harry's point of view? Isn't clear to me.
