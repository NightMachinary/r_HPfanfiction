What you're describing here is all reasons for a bigoted, power-tripping Ministry worker to arrange a mind-wipe on expelled Muggleborn. Just to make sure.

Hagrid's dad was a wizard, and ALL squibs are already in the magical world. Muggleborn aren't, and without a child (held hostage) in school, what's to stop a stupid, pissed-off Muggle parent from blowing the whole thing?

The bigot's point of view here is clear. And what you're suggesting with Hermione is only the /second worst/ scenario for them. And one that wouldn't be available to completely unknown Hermione in first year.
