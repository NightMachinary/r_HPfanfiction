I think we're talking past each other.

Even magical law isn't literally magical in canon. That's why I'm saying the law doesn't matter, on either side, but especially for the Death Eaters.

Canon Dumbledore is a Neville Chamberlain type figure. He clearly didn't clean up enough after the war, and it comes back to bite him in the ass later. He compromises with "ex" Death Eaters instead of directly confronting them, because he wants peace. The canon magical UK isn't post-WWII Germany, with the Nazi party outlawed. It's 1932 Germany. It's 1960s South Africa.

I'm sure your point of view of how the law works is the kind of thing such a character as canon Dumbledore would use to salve his mind. But that doesn't mean people wouldn't be doing wet-work behind his back, if a Muggleborn were expelled. Which might be why it never seems to happen in canon.

Except maybe that one Hufflepuff. What ever happened to her?
