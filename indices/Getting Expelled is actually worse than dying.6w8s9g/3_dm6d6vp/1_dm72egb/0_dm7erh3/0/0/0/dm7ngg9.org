I don't mean actually stepping in personally as you seem to imply. I mean legally arguing in the Wizengamot against the unfair laws and supporting motions to repel them proposed by Minister Bagnold, in his authority as Chief Warlock and Chief Mugwump. While he didn't actually go out and /Finite/ cursed biting doorknobs, I'm convinced he encouraged giving more funding to the Department of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, and supported the Muggle Protection Act in the Wizengamot.

As Hogwarts hadn't turned into Durmstrang by 1991, I think Dumbledore may have failed as leader fo the Order of the Phoenix, but not as a pro-muggle political figure. Also, I have read a very convincing theory of why he didn't push for Sirius to have a trial, ask me to PM it to you if you want more detail.

Obliviation of an expelled Muggleborn would, methinks, have to be a matter of law, not of corruption. Obliviating the parents perhaps, but calling in Obliviators to obliviate a /wizard/, that would have to be on the books for it to happen.
