Who said anything about "laws"? And what would even canon Dumbledore do to stop it, exactly?

- He does nothing to stop Muggle-baiting that Arthur Weasley handles day in and day out.
- He does nothing to stop mind wiping being the go-to solution to handing Muggles, even when wizards intentionally expose it during sporting events.
- He does nothing about Dementors being used as guards, or even ensuring due process for friends.
- He does nothing about clearing Hagrid's name or finding the Chamber of Secrets for about thirty years.
- He does nothing to find Voldemort for a decade.
- He does nothing to prepare for the next blood wars /for a decade and a half/.
- He does nothing to fix Hogwarts' house system even after decades of being headmaster, despite the well-known 1960s Robbers Cave experiment results on RCT--something a school teacher knowledgeable about Muggle means to the extent that he regularly goes ten-pen bowling and brags about it should /really/ be aware of.

In short, something corrupt and abusive /not happening/ because Dumbledore would fix it is not credible world building to me.
