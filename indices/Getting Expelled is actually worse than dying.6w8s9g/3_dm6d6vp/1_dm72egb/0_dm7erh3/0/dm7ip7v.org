Hmm... well, you make the bigots' case pretty convincingly, but /are/ they in power? Especially as in 1991 Cornelius Fudge had only barely started his term, and most measures passed under Bagnold (with Dumbledore's approval) would still have been in place. To me, while what you describe is what the bigots would /like/ to be able to do, such laws weren't on the books because Dumbledore and Bagnold had kept them off it. Certainly, under the unholy triumvirate of Minister Fudge, Advisor Umbridge and Grey Eminence Malfoy, the laws could have changed, but I refuse to believe Dumbledore would have let it stand pre-1994.
