But I'm not seeing your point. Unless, like the Dursleys or Tobias, the parent of the muggle-raised kid /already knows about magic/, I think people simply don't /notice/ accidental magic for the most part. The only person who might take notice is the muggleborn themselves, whose fear disappears once they learn about the wizarding world. I find it very unlikely pre-Hogwarts muggleborns are chronically subject to bullying in the muggle world.
