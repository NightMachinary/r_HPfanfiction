After seeing it mentioned here, I read it. Basically on the train ride back after 6th Year, Harry starts seeing things which result in a series of events leading to him meeting said child of post. (this shouldn't be too spoilerish considering it happens in first opening bit) Basically child is an orphan and communicates a bit like legilmancy. I enjoyed it considering I started it yesterday and finished it this morning. Started to get a bit wordy at end but got better.
