#+begin_quote
  This is a crossover between The Hunger Games and "Shia LaBeouf" by Rob Cantor (the Live Performance version), which is a three-and-a-half minute video that can be found on YouTube. It's the beginning of the 74th Hunger Games when Katniss has her first encounter with one of the Careers, actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf. Who will win?
