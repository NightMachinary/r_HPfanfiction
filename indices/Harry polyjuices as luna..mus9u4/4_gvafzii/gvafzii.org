A similar plot happens in [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/73][chapter 73 of /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], during a 10-chapter arc about heroism and bullying. Anticipating a bullying encounter, one student gets an older student to pose as them, to catch the bullies off guard. I won't spoil in this comment who those students are.

(Warning: /HPMOR/ is a polarizing story, and many commenters on this sub-Reddit dislike it.)
