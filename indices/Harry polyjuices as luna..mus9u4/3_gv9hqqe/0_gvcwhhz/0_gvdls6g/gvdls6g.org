Yes definitely- this fic follows Hermioneâ€˜s life through years one through seven at Hogwarts with one point of departure: before she reaches Hogwarts, there is a prophecy told about her. She ends up having a very different experience and the author does a great job of building a complex, deep magical world.

Each chapter is one scene. It's an uncommon structure for chapters but I really enjoy it
