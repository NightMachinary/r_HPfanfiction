  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Angels have their shadows. Shining in silver and tomorrow, world rotating upon its shoulders, stands Metropolis, and with him, his guardian, bright and forward as the city himself.    Angels have their shadows. Within these shadows stands a symbol cloaked in the night, crouching behind a gargoyle of stone.
