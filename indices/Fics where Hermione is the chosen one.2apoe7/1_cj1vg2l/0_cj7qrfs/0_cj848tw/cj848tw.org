Not sure what you mean. Of course she is /a/ protagonist in Harry/Hermione stories, but in most such stories that are not entirely romance --- where the characters actually affect the outside world --- Harry tends to do most of the acting, while Hermione's job is to help him learn spells and occasionally get kindapped and rescued. (I am exaggerating a bit, of course, but not by much.)
