Yh, I'm thinking of a harsh kind of traditionalism - she's described as haughty so that would make sense, especially as the daughter of a Pureblood fanatic clan. I can imagine Nymphadora and her husband wearing her down though.

  It's one thing for Sirius to become a Gryffindor and reject the pureblood dogma but Andromeda married a mudblood for goodness sake.

Interesting, I never thought about it like that - and more so because she's a woman, she's the (traditionally) property of the family and is supposed to be 'wedded off'.

As fierce as Bellatrix, brave and less insane seems to sum her up.
