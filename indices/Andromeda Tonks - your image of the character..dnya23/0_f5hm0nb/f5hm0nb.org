When I think of Andromeda I don't think of kindness...I'm sure it's there but that is not her defining trait. I think of confidence, defiance, willingness to stand by her principles. Sirius' bravery to standing up to his parents is lauded (as it should be) but Andromeda was an even better example. It's one thing for Sirius to become a Gryffindor and reject the pureblood dogma but Andromeda married a mudblood for goodness sake.

She is just as fierce (maybe more) than Bellatrix...just less insane and less aristocratic because it is clear that she rejected those tropes.
