Sounds great, good luck! I think there are a few things from canon that can be deduced from her.

She gave her daughter a completely ridiculous first name but she did not give her daughter a ridiculous star-name, which would have suited the Black family tradition. With a name like Nymphadora, she must either have quite a wicked sense of humour or be quite stuck up.

I think based on her being the middle child of the family, her date of birth means she was barely out of Hogwarts when she married and had Tonks. Her husband is described as a bit untidy and with a potbelly (I think?), but the books give the impression that she's elegant and well put-together. So an opposites attract situation. She might also be good at either household spells or be very neat in her style of magic, as Tonks says something about her always getting even socks to fold themselves when she magically packs into a suitcase.

Like Bellatrix and Sirius, when she talks she talks 'haughtily' in the books.
