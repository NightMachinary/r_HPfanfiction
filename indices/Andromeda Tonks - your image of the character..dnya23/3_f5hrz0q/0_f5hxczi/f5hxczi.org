Yep, the haughty aspect to her tends to be missed in fanfiction depictions of her. It should be subtle but present. We tend to have an idealised version of the people we imagine or like in our heads but they tend to be complex. I can imagine her staring down at muggles. (She married a 'good' one.) Thanks!
