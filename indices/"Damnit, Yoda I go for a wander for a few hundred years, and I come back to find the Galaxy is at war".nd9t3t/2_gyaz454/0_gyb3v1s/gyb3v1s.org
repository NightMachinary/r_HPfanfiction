Ah, but would he consider /himself/ a Jedi?

Plus, there were Jedi that were okay with emotional attachments, even though they were frowned upon. I think it'd upset the Council if this legendary "Jedi" was chill with emotions and love.

Plus, ya know, that thing with Faye, if he's older.

Yoda chuckling at their antics while the rest of the Council/Jedi see these two revered Masters squabbling would be hilarious -- especially since Faye is supposed to be serene, kind, and chilled out.

Edit: And Harry pitying the more rigid Jedi could cause some of the younger members, and indeed some of the existing Knights, to question themselves. Ripple effects right there, I think. :)
