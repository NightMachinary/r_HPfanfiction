I know this is a prompt but I can never see Harry becoming a Jedi during the timeline with Yoda, considering Love and attachment in Harry potter is considered a good thing, where as in star wars the jedi seem to think anything considered attachment is a bad thing, Dumbledore and Harry would pity the jedi more then anything. I Also think Harry would be against using a slave army.

'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities" ". ... Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love" -- Dumbledore
