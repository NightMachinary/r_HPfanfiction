Nobody really noticed the man step out of the junker onto the spaceport's platform, cradling an arm and swearing to himself. "Bloody Mando nobs and their bloody blood debts" he muttered, passing through the security checkpoint without either Mandalorian noticing him.

Nobody noticed him when he got onto the hover platform. Nobody noticed either him or the platform as they sped down the military priority lane, weaving through squads of oblivious, Beskar-clad idiots. "Bloody tradition-obsessed knobheads. It's like dealing with the fucking Prussian Ministry all over again."

Nobody noticed when he docked at the prison. Or when he knocked the guards out. Or when he panicked upon noticing he'd accidentally knocked out Kenobi again. Or when Kenobi snarked at him all the way to Satine's cell. Or when he put his hands on their shoulders and apparated them to the platform his junker had just landed on.

Then, someone did notice him. Harry had developed a very literal interpretation of the meaning behind 'curse word', so when he noticed his ship burning away merrily on the concourse, he strung together just enough foul language to keep himself calm /and/ send the flames of his ship off to set an arsonist or two ablaze. That level of rage fuelled cruelty drew the attention of what looked like a Sith Warrior straight to him.

"Oh bollocks." He groaned as he sent the big bastard flying without the benefit of a jetpack. "Aren't there supposed to be like two of you left at any one time nowadays? I'm getting Sith Empire flashbacks here."
