Ah, I see you've become a bit jaded by the fandom's obsession with "hot Poly!"/harem caricatures, too.

I mean, A romantic relationship/pairing is fine and to be expected, really, but three-way/poly relationships are either written by "one hand" by the author or are the focus of fantasies.

Unless it's a love-triangle, which is actually completely different to a Poly, I never think of Poly relationships in my prompts/ideas.

Unless it's where he dates one girl, they break up, he dates another, and the first girl is still around, and there's tension/issues/lingering doubts/feelings there with the Ex -- but that's more life than some idealized version of Polys.
