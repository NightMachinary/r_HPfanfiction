I could kinda see Ahsoka filling a sort of adjutant role, if she still leaves the Order: I mean, while she wouldn't be a Jedi, she'd still be under the wing of a "revered" Jedi "Master" and still helping the war effort for the Republic.

If Harry isn't younger and it's not an Ahsoka pairing, her being considered a little sister figure, much to her indignation, could be hilarious.

Heck, it may put Anakin's mind at rest compared to Clone Wars canon... er, except for when she gets caught up in his shenanigans. Then he'd likely have a heart-attack or twelve after finding out, haha.

"She rode a rancor!"

"Ah, no."

"Oh, that's a relief. I knew Snips would be a handful, but that sounds too risky even for her to try."

"...It was a mutated rancor."

"Please tell me she didn't scream like a little girl."

Maybe he could offer Bariss a choice for redemption, too: I mean, her reasons for turning against the Jedi were pretty sound, even if she acted pretty scummy about it. If she realizes he's not like the rest of the current Jedi in attitude, she might consider a deal where he "rehabilitates" her. But, that might be a bit too far fetched/convoluted.
