There's a reason I mentioned the era, not the plot. I mean really, PLANTS are the main villains!? Why not say; the Mandalorians(there was a brief battle between the Jedi and Mandos in the time period in Legends), or the Hutts, or the corruption in the Senate, or an earlier version of the Stark Hyperspace War, or borrow a page from Legends Second Galactic Civil War and have Correlia start something, or explain how the heck Yoda knew about the Rule of Two by having him have a run in with a Sith, or have there not really be an overarching threat at all other than background Sith manipulation like in Legends, or all of the above really!? Sorry about the rant, if it wasn't for the Filoni ran projects I might have dropped anything not feasible in Legends or directly tuned into the original Saga and instead jumped headfirst into fanfic and expanding my Legends portfolio. And yeah, Havoc!Harry can't use the Force but Magic definitely has an impact on it if I'm remembering the plot correctly.
