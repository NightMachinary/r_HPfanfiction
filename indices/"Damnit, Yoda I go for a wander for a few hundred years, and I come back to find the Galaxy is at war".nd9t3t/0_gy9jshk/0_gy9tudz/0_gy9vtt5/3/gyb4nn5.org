Yeah, High Republic is just... wow. Then again, it's a Kathleen Kennedy project, so, 'nuff said, heh.

Just use Old Republic for old timey stuff and Pre-Clone Wars for stuff closer to the Prequels/Originals, otherwise you might get leapt on by people who think you like that shit (out of all the SW fans I know, no-one likes the High Republic. At all).
