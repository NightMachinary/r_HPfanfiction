There's a lot of stuff out there. If you give some information about what you like I can probably do better.

I think my overall favorite that I think most people would like is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes). It's a goofy retelling of canon that had me laughing constantly.

My favorite canon-compliant worthy sequel to canon is the Theia Higglesworth trilogy. If HBO or whoever wanted to make a sequel I want them to hire this person. Fwiw I have a fairly large Harry/Hermione pairing bias, this is canon pairings, and I liked it anyway.

My favorite canon divergence is linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) It diverges at the beginning of HBP and changes most of the things that annoyed me in canon to things I like better.
