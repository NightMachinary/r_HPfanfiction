My favorite is probably The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie it's extremely long but it's very well written and I love it. She has some other really great stories as well, such as Storm of Yesterday. She's also on FFN under the same name.

I'll probably end up coming back to edit my comment for more, FFN really screwed me when they completely redid their app and I lost just about everything. Still tracking down stories I really liked.
