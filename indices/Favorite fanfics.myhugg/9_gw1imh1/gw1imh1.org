I've posted this elsewhere on the subreddit but my recent goto fic for a reread is linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help. Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching. Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

Second I'd recommend is Linkffn(Stages of Hope) which is a brilliant dimension travel story. It shows the other side of my first recommendation; how horrific child soldiers/martyrs truly are. With the war against Voldemort entirely on their shoulders thanks to canon!useless adults and actually competent villains, four such child soldiers are accidentally thrown into a different world; one where the adults on their side aren't useless or callous. This is the first story to make me choke back tears, with its themes of tragedy, healing and most importantly, /hope/.

On the fluffier side, linkffn(Home is where the Heart lies by SweetShireen; Imagination by Potato19; Baby, It's Cold outside) are all relatively short and sweet romance stories. Harry/Hermione. And linkffn(Twelve Days by TheEndless7) which is a post war Harry/Gabrielle.

For a longer romance, my favourite is Linkffn(Vox Corporis) which also has a unique take on the animagus transformation.

Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker) is about Lily surviving Halloween 1981 along with Harry. A good story about grieving and family.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) is also a recently favourite canon divergence story mid-way through 6th year. Same for Linkffn(Live Forever by Petrificus Somewhatus) for summer before fifth year.

Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat; The many deaths of Harry Potter) are two of my favourite overpowered Harry stories.

For action and friendly banter, my go-to is Linkffn(Wind Shear) and if you like James/Lily, I'll suggest linkffn(Where the Air Is Rarefied)
