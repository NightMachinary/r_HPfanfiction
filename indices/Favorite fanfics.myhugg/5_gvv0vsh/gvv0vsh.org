Some of my favorites:

The Like None Other series has been a favorite of mine for years. I really enjoy the developing relationships between characters who once hated each other and how they grow to be a family. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

The Pureblood Pretense. I didn't expect to like this one going in but I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the fear of discovery kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past. My favorite time travel story and the one that set the genre for me. I wish it was finished, but I reread it about every two years regardless. [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305]]

Leo Inter Serpentes is my favorite Harry/Draco, and has some of my favorite representation of Slytherin House. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

The Perils of Innocence is my favorite pre-Hogwarts fic, but it's also not finished. I really enjoy what is there though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/495672/chapters/86771]]

The Changeling is my favorite Ginny focused fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Getting the Hang of Thursdays is my favorite Snape focused fic, also includes Hermione. Time loop. [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/]]
