  His characterization always seemed slightly off-key to me.

Unfortunately, no one is JKR. No matter how hard they try, I've not found a fanfic that has any character close to their canon equivalent. Some do it better than most, but nothing is even close to 100%. I like how he writes his characters so it doesn't bother me here.

I don't think it's weird to invite old friends and new friends to a house warming party? There's every reason for Harry and Ginny to be friends with Jackie and Mike. They have kids of the same age, going to the same school, that have already become friends. The parents are of a similar age and hold the same values in common. I can't see Harry leaving the Muggle world completely and would bet he'd want his kids to be comfortable in either world. Whenever two friend groups mix it's awkward but it creates the chance for intergroup friendships which are nice. I also think it was a chance for the author to show that Muggles and wizards can get along.

Everyone experiences grief differently and there is such a thing as delayed grief! Some people can best weather grief by throwing themselves into their work and carrying on. Others are more visibly and immediately affected.

I don't think Northumbrian is perfect, but he is canon compliant, a decent writer, and I like his characters. I also think he does a good job adding to the wizarding world. Some authors just don't resonate with you and that's fine.
