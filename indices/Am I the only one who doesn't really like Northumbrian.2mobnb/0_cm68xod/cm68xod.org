I think some of these objections are simply the fact that in /Strangers/ Harry and Ginny are older. They're used to married life, parents, and comfortably middle class. Of course they're going to be different to how they were at 17.

I haven't read any of the fics other than /Strangers/ so couldn't comment on those.
