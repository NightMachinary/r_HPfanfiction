When goblet of fire chooses champions it doesn't spit out the name of the champion but the paper they put into the goblet. It's only function is to select the paper that has been putted in by the most capable witch or wizard for each school it has been set to choose champions for.

It doesn't have the capability to place anyone under "magically binding" contract nor judging the hearts and minds of the champions continuously during the tournament and be on the constant look out for breach of said none existent contract.
