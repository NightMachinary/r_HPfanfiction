1- magicals have a natural aura of magic that weakly affects continually the world to make it better fit their expectations. Depending on if the magical believes they are good at something, have confidence that they will succeed, wish's a certain result, or think themselves lucky then this aura will tip probability to the side the magical believes it should be, how much is defined by the individual's power. FÃ©lix Felicis works by powering this aura up to the n degree while making the magicals mind focus on their desires and simultaneously block any negative though or belief that failure is even possible.

2- Many of the inherited gifts we see in cannon are the result of magicals using blood magic, specifically: the werewolf curse was someone trying to make the animagus transformation inheritable and lock the animal as a wolf, the reason most lose control when transformed is that their inner animals aren't wolves and the curse is forcing them to make a natural transformation into a unnatural form, which screws with their rational thinking abilities; on the other side werewolves like Fenrir Grayback are naturally wolf animagus, and so the transformation makes them instantly master the ability with the collateral effects of making their mind more wolffishly, their senses sharper and shot their self-control to outer-space. The Crabb and Goyle's families sub-par average intelligence level is due to some ancestors deciding to try making occlumency an inheritable trait and mucking it up to the point where their minds are occluded from themselves. Slytherin was trying to give himself the superior ability of perceiving heat and smells of snakes, parseltonge was just a happy accident -incidentally while not perfect the experiment made his descendants have bad eyesight and good spatial awareness, so Harry actually did descend from him.

3- There are much more wizards and witches in the magical world than we are lead to believe, immigration in the form of muggleborns + no emigration at all + families forming of magicals that have magical children + better health-care/less child mortality (over centuries) + better ways of multiplying resources (including space) results in a population worldwide between 800 millions to 2.5 billions of magicals after the wars, maybe even more.

4- It is possible to truly resurrect the dead by calling their souls with the resurrection stone and bind it in a homunculus body made with the person blood, though the person won't remember the world of the dead because their brains can't process the experience.

5- House-elf's are actually an organic version of robots, made with a complex homunculus enchanted with many complex animation charms similar to the ones of the sorting hat, which prevents them from going against their programmed behavior. Because of this Dobby rejecting serving wizards actually makes the purebloods very nervous as it is comparatively a foreshadowing of the revolution of machines that is so used in scy-fy.

6- The reason a person goes crazy if they see themselves while traveling back in time is that the fact that the past version have free-will and will change their behavior according to what they experience will make the future self be forced to assimilate the memories of every possible variation of what could occur between the time of contact and the time of the traveling, which would be essentially an infinity amount of information that would instantly incinerate their mind.

7- The reason magicals agreed to teach muggleborns is actually to prevent them from experimenting with magic on their own without the theory the magical world managed to figure out as they could potentially cause immeasurable damage by committing mistakes that the magical world would be able to warm them against. Fex.: attempting alchemy resulting in a great-scale nuclear fusion reaction, trying expansion charms that colapse a part of the space-time continuum opening a hole on reality that could range from letting Eldritch Horrors from Beyond Creation passing into our world to creating a black/worm-hole that would almost instantly eat the whole planet and possibly the galaxy too; trying to make wards that would instantly fail compressing everything in the space they were supposed to protect in the space of a needles head, or in the case of aversion wards make it impossible for anyone inside the wards to assimilate information about the space they are, locking them in a permanent limbo of insanity from which they can't escape because they can't register anything about the area, including any sense of orientation on space.

8- The brains at the DoM are the magical world's version of a computer, the unspeakables are just trying to find a way of making it less disturbing to sell to the general public.
