Bright students, teachers, and headmasters continue to add secret passages and quirks to Hogwarts.

There is a lot of spell theory, study of concepts, runes, study of wand movements, and how magic works to invent a spell. The final step is to take one's proposed theory for a spell and use arithmancy and divination to divine the incantation. One only divines an incantation if the theory and spell construction is sound. The better the theory, the better the incantation. Arithmancy is part of spell theory and is considered to be more reliable, if often slower, than a purely divination based method.

Aberforth killed Ariana. I find it hilarious that Aberforth, the one who is the most angry, is the one who cast the fatal spell.
