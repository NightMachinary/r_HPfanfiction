In GoF, Harry was not under a magically binding contract (I'm not sure any of the Champions were). Crouch Sr and Moody only said because they were the bad guys (though one unwillingly) planning to kidnap Harry at the end of the Tournament.

Bagman agreed to this because he was incompetent and didn't read the rules. Dumbledore had his doubts but decided that risking Harry life/ magic on a hunch was not worth it, and that he was more likely to survive the Tasks after all the new security measures.
