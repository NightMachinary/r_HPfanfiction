  Herbology and Potions are classified as wandless magic and are the majority of the useful wandless magic.

Potions maybe, although in one of the Pottermore entries, I believe JK describes wandless magic as the act of casting spells without a wand. In Herbology they don't really do any magic but learn about magical plants and their properties. However I see no point in not allowing students to use their wand if they need to take care of a plant using a spell.

  Legilimency and Occlumency aren't the only Mind Arts.

You're right. Memory modification and possession would fall in the same category, I believe.
