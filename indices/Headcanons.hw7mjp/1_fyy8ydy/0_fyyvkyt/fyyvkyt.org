  There is no "Inner Circle" of Death Eaters. There are Death Eaters who are currently in favor (pre-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix, Snape) and those currently out of favor (post-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy).

I think the Death Eaters /are/ his Inner Circle. They are in direct contact of Voldemort thanks to their mark, they meet him regularly, they receive missions directly from him. The Death Eaters are the closest person to Voldemort, and that's why they were tasked to run the show when he was abroad looking for the Elder Wand.

Outer Circle would be all the direct support of Voldemort who were not granted a Dark Mark : Greyback, Umbridge, maybe Auror Runcorn . . .
