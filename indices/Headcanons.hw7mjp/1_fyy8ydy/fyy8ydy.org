  Does anyone have any good headcanons they feel like sharing? I'll start- Horcruxes aren't basically indestructible, but anyone who makes one absolutely goes to the trouble of making it unbreakable, through magical means. It just so happens that fiendfyre, which consumes magic to fuel itself (is this fanon? unsure but, eh) gets rid of the enchantment, as well as a basilisk's venom, due to basilisks evolving to have their venom burn through magic to help kill their magical prey. With how rare and dark horcruxes are, anybody who studies them has no reason to share their weaknesses.

About half of this is canon. It is explicitly stated in /DH/ that a dark wizard should put powerful enchantments on their horcrux to make it nearly indestructible. Where you fall into headcanon is the fiendfyre. All we know of fiendfyre from canon is that it is cursed fire, and that Hermione considered it too risky to use to try to destroy the horcruxes. It can be inferred that there is something about fiendfyre that made it impossible (or difficult enough to not be worth it) for even Voldemort to make his horcruxes immune to it. But fiendfyre consuming magic is a fanon thing. On basilisk venom, canon is clear. The only thing that can cure basilisk venom is phoenix tears. This actually seems to imply that if Voldemort had phoenix tears, he could have used them to protect his horcuxes. Of course, why would he bother on trying to get phoenix tears? Not likely that (in his opinion) that a) anyone would learn he had horcruxes and b) that they could find all of his horcruxes. For a different dark wizard, who somehow learned that Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore used basilisk venom to destroy horcruxes, a clever anti-basilisk venom strategy would be to make an object of goblin steel your horcrux. As goblin steel, as shown by the Sword of Gryffindor, will imbibe basilisk venom and incorporate it into its own magic.

As for my headcanons:

1.  Arithmancy and Runes have nothing to do with spell /creation/.
2.  Runes is about 99% a field of language study, with mild applications in the field of enchanting.
3.  Herbology and Potions are classified as wandless magic and are the majority of the useful wandless magic.
4.  There is no "Inner Circle" of Death Eaters. There are Death Eaters who are currently in favor (pre-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix, Snape) and those currently out of favor (post-Department of Ministry Lucius Malfoy).
5.  There were not large numbers of Death Eaters. There were the ones present in the Graveyard, Snape, Karkaroff, the ones in Azkaban, the ones we know of who died, Draco Malfoy and probably a small number of others we never saw/heard of (because they died prior to series start).
6.  Most of the /classical/ Death Eaters (from the '70s) likely would have been dark wizards even without Voldemort.
7.  The Death Eaters (of the 70s) made up the majority of what could be considered the number of active dark wizards that would be expected in Britain during a roughly 10 or 11 year period.
8.  Aurors are strictly dark wizard investigators/Dark Arts specialists and Ministerial bodyguards (if needed). They do not investigate all crimes as a police force and are not large in numbers (less than 20).
9.  The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol handles investigating all non-Dark Arts crimes, and are analogous to local police, beat cops or sheriffs.\\
10. The Hitwizards (mentioned in /PoA/) are a group of volunteer wizards and witches who are essentially the Ministry of Magic version of a SWAT team. Some Aurors and members of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol also do double-duty as Hitwizards.
11. All acts of murder are classified as Dark Arts.
12. James Potter, Sirius Black and Severus Snape were better at magic than Lily Potter and Remus Lupin.
13. James Potter and Sirius Black would have been on-par with Snape during Harry's school year if it weren't for the whole dead-at-21 and imprisoned-at-21-in-a-prison-staffed-by-the-literal-embodiment-of-soul-draining-depression-for-over-a-decade things.
14. Legilimency and Occlumency aren't the only Mind Arts.
15. Places, over a suitably long period of continuous magical in-habitation leads to a location becoming more magical. This can be magnified by the numbers of people who have been spending time at the location, and what they were doing. As such, the about thousand years of students and professors at Hogwarts are at least partially responsible for Hogwarts being so magical.
16. The Killing Curse, the Imperius Curse and the Cruciatus are Unforgivable for social reasons, not magical. This is because their only purposes are murder, near-absolute control and torture. Of the three, only the Killing Curse can't be blocked magically though a sufficiently skilled wizard (read: Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort) are capable of summoning or conjuring objects to tank the hit instead.
17. A decently significant number of magical children don't attend Hogwarts. If this wasn't the case, Voldemort wouldn't have put the "all magical children must attend Hogwarts" rule in place after taking control.
18. Unspeakables are not spies or assassins. They are magical researchers, theoreticians and philosophers. The closest thing they have to "Field Agents" are essentially archaeologists and field researchers.
19. There are no post-Hogwarts/Beauxbatons/Durmstrang formal education in the magical world. Some professions do utilize apprentice-like programs to onboard new employees. Examples include Healers, Gringott's Cursebreakers and Aurors.
20. There is no such thing as Auror school. There is assigned/voluntary mentorship by a full Auror, which involves training the assistant/trainee/associate Auror in investigational skills, Ministry procedures, needed dark-wizard-hunting skills, and potentially tutorage in further areas of the Dark Arts. To become a full Auror, the associate needs to meet certain minimum requirements in a variety of skills (such as Stealth and Tracking, which Tonks nearly failed).

And that's all I have off the top of my head.
