  There once was a tale of three brothers and the gifts bestowed upon them by Death. Such a tale is one of intrigue, of adventure, of tragedy. Such a tale is a lie. Or; a story of time travel, genocide, and a boy who just wants to live.

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him.---------------------------------------AKA that unnecessarily long and complicated fic that will lead to an overprotective Harley Keener.Or- that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU literally nobody (including me) was looking for.

  “Just tell me you've got somewhere to stay kid.” Stark practically begged.At least this one Harry could answer positively.“Oh yeah, it's fine. My house came with me."...“I've changed my mind. You're not Oliver Twist. You're Dorothy.” Thanks to good old Black family paranoia, Harry finds himself stranded in a world full of superheroes.Peter's got a crush, Harry's oblivious, and Tony thinks his kids are hilarious.

  In the several millennia he had existed Loki Odinson, Norse God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things, he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before, in his thousands of years of existence had he been a loving father, but all it took was a single glance at the perfect little creature before him and he knew, he was gone.
