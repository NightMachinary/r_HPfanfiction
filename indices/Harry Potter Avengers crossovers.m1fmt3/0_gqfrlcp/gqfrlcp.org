Yesterday someone posted this question and someone responded with a comprehensive list: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lzomx3/hpavengers_fanfictions/gq3mt95/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3]]

Out of those I can vouch for Cyrogenics and Cupboards, Heroes Assemble, blood on my hands, and Of Wizards and Heroes.
