I'm somewhat sure that every subject has a club. Especially subjects in which very involving, long-term projects could be done, such as Herbology, Care and Potions. I think I've read about "The Gardeners", a multi-house group of Herbologists, in three or four fics now.

Then you could have various fanclubs (Quidditch, wizard culture, maybe even muggle culture), political clubs (such as SPEW), sports clubs, game clubs and interest groups of all kinds.
