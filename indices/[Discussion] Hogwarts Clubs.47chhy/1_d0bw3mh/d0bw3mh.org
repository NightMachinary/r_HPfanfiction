There's a mention of a Charms club and Gobstones club in OotP.

Similarly, the games have introduced a Potions Club, Divination Homework meeting, House duelling clubs, etc. Also, there was a Wizard Card Collector's club in the early games. (While I don't consider the games canon, it does give you a few ideas.)

There are also advocacy groups (Such as the SPEW and probably for other magical creatures as well) that could be considered as clubs.

Movies introduced the frog choir and Hogwarts orchestra.

I would guess from these things that there are, or once were, clubs for core classes and interest groups. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a club of Quidditch fans (of certain teams) and some sort of arts club.
