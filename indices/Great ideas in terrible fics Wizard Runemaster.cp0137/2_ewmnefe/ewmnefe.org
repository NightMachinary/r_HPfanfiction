It's just full of terribly written smut scenes and the plot only moves forward when Harry needs to add a new woman to his harem. Plums had said they won't be getting into any of the big stuff that the players get into in the actual game, so the only reason to read it is if you get off on reading about someone fucking characters from WoW.

It's not like it'll ever be completed anyways. It was years between updates, and if you read the update that came out a few months ago, it's pretty obvious plums had written those chapters years ago when he was writing Wizard Runemaster, and put them up this year saying he was back.
