I think it's a sad sign of how jaded I am that eight women doesn't seem like an "excessively large" harem, at all.

I blame fics like The Harem War (both Radaslab's and Vincewossname's), where they quickly reached double digits and just kept climbing. When you have to use a Time Turner to give your ladies any attention, it's too much.
