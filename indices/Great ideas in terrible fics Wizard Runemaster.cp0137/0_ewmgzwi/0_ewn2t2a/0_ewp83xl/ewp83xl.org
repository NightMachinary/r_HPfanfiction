  I think it's a sad sign of how jaded I am that eight women doesn't seem like an "excessively large" harem, at all.

Well....

  The 6th-century BCE King Tamba of Banaras (India) is rumored to have had a harem of 16,000. Kublai Khan, the 13th-century Mongol leader, had four queens and 7,000 concubines. He habitually culled and refreshed the pool of concubines every few years. The 15th-century Sultan Ghiyas-ud-Din Klijn's harem of 15,000 necessitated the construction of a separate walled city to house them.

Harry needs to do better, really. Eight women is pitiful.
