I feel like overly explicit atrocities usually have the opposite effect on me because, at some point, it stops feeling believable. I mean, who would even invent a ritual where you had to rape a child, eat her nipples and then take a dump on her corpse precisely during the Winter Solstice? Or liquify half of London and then use the goo as skin lotion? Killing a dozen or so people sure, but when you require the population of a small country as a sacrifice, that does not seem feasible before the 20th century.

The "Black Queen" series lost me over this. Murder and rituals for sure, but the whole "black magic" seemed exaggerated as if taken from a crackfic.
