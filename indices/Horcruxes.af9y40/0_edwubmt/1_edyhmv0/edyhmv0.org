What's interesting is most of the things we see are speculation, because there isn't really a canonical description of the exact process. Apparently, Rowling did write how to make one, but it was so vile they didn't put it in. Like it's reported her editor felt nauseous at the idea of it. Makes one think about what exactly is involved because all we have to go on is cold-blooded murder is necessary.
