I prefer that the only 'evil' action involved in creating the horcrux is murder, with the remainder of the process being some sort of complex magic ritual. I like the way [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] handled it, where splitting the soul requires acceptance of an innately abhorrent act, but not necessarily killing a human. In that fic killing a unicorn accomplishes the same thing.

I've read a few stories in which creating a horcrux requires eating the heart of the person killed, but to me that just seems like the author is stretching for something visceral to horrify the reader because apparently murder wasn't enough to do the trick. To me that seems gratuitous and doesn't really fit with the intent of the magic.
