I have two stories still up on ffn that I think are around ten years old now. Each only one chapter so I didn't really have time to fall into established tropes or clich√©s too badly, but one of them has the "convenient character death to make two characters bond even though they dislike each other" thing going on. Like, that's all it was. But people liked it? Idk.

But it was upon rereading those ages later that I realized, I'm just not a 'character' writer. I can't do personalities no matter how I try- can't even do it in D&D. Oh well.
