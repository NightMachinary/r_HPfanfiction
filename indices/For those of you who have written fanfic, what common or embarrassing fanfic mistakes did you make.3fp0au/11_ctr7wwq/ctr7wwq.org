Tainted pumpkin juice.

If I could redo it (and still generate interest for a story already told), I'd skip the idea of Dumbledore adding a loyalty potion to the pumpkin juice served at the Valentine's Feast. More accurately, the story suggested that the taint had always been there but no one had noticed until it was implied by Gilderoy Lockhart that love potions make the day more special.

The whole thing was inspired at a time when Dumbledore was supposed to be a villain in the story. I've grown out of my pop-Machiavellian-Albus phase.
