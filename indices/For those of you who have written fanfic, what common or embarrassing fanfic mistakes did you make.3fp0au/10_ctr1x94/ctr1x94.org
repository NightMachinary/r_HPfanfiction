I got my first bad review when I was like 13, and I deleted my story and account. While I was doing that FFN sent me an email of a private msg from the guy saying that he had reviewed his wrong internet tab, and his review hadn't been meant for me. Of course I got the email well after I had deleted everything. Very embarrassing.
