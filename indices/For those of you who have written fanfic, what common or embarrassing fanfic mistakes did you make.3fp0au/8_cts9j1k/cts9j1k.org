The prime fanfiction mistake I've consistently made is writing to make a point about something. The problem is that it gives the fic a rather temporally limited appeal. Almost inevitably my own tastes move on or the point being made no longer feels important, and I'm hit with a crippling dissatisfaction with what I wrote. Alexandra Potter is full of these: the level of inequality I put into the HP society, the point I was making about the cruelty of innocent children who aren't mature enough to think about others before they act, the fact that children often change friendship group during their school years, exploring the idea of immature kids with dangerous magical abilities etc. Each individual element felt like it was legitimate, but it added up to create a much darker fic than I intended.

The other major mistake is to write a fanfic based on an idea for an opening, not an ending. If your prime interest is in the opening of the fic (aka the "plot bunny"), then finishing the opening will excise the plot bunny and you lose the desire to finish the fic.

The worst mistake I made was combining these two errors into one story. In The One He Feared, I wanted to make a point about how it is that Voldemort can be able to out-duel so many Aurors but still not be able to simply take the Ministry by force. So I set the fic up so the first arc ended with Voldemort trying a frontal attack on the Ministry and it failing. This involved an epic Harry v Voldemort duel.

Unfortunately I realised after finishing that scene that I had already achieved what I had wanted to achieve going into the fic. To make matters worse, the epic duel meant that there was very little I could do that would top it for the fic's actual climax. The plan I had to make a point about how Harry could not defeat Voldemort through strength alone, even if he had Dumbledore's ability with magic, suddenly felt rather empty. It's one thing to have a clever idea about a point to make, it's another to write a fic that's paced in a way that engages and entertains. Having the biggest duel early on in the fic may be clever, but it doesn't constitute good writing.
