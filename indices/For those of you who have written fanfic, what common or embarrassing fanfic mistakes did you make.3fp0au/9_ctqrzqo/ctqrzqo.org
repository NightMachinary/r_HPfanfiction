The problem was, I was my own worst critic. I would write something, MAYBE post a little bit, and then I would immediately delete it. It's still a nasty habit of mine. I've read a few of the things I've managed to stash away on my computer, and it's honestly not THAT bad. I wish I could break that habit. I would be a better writer if I'd let other people actually critique it other than just labeling it a lost cause myself. When I was a kid, I used to write all the time. I wrote stories about Harry before I even knew fanfiction was a thing. By age 10 or 11, I was an incredible writer (you know, by middle school standards). A teacher accused me of plagiarizing, and then, after a tearful interrogation, she realized I was just really good for my age. Unfortunately, however, she acted like she had found a prodigy. She forced me into competitions, which I did very well at (even earning money). I thought I was destined to grow up to be the next great American novelist. Nope, now I just work in education (which I love, don't get me wrong). I'm trying to relearn how to enjoy writing. It has it's ups and downs. NaNoWriMo seems to help a lot, especially since you aren't allowed to delete anything.

As for awful plot lines...I had one where Harry had a blind daughter, another about an American at Hogwarts falling in love with Remus Lupin, a hilarious Lily and James story following the plot of Dirty Dancing...just typical 12-year-old daydreams of what I thought life and love was supposed to look like.

I recently discovered one I wrote when I was in seventh grade about Sirius Black in Azkaban. Surprised the hell out of me. I had so much potential.
