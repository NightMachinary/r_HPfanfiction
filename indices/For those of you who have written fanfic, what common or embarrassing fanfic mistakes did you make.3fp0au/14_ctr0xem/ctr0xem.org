I have one story up on FFN and it was terrible. I'm not gonna bother linking it here but based off my user name and description you can probably guess at it.

Harry's twin is BWL and he's neglected, becomes super powerful, trained by the founders and soul bond with Ginny because why not.

I basically tried to hit all the worst cliches. Yet a majority of my readers seemed to actually enjoy it and I don't use the e-mail anymore but I occasionally check the reviews and it gets a new one every once in a while asking for an update.

It's never getting an update it was a flaming pile of crap and I rightfully abandoned it.

That story did teach me a lot of things. Don't release a story unless it's finished. Make sure the entire story is consistent. It's ok to change things but make sure the rest of the universe reflects that change. Bashing is ok in small doses but don't completely change a character just to vilify them. If I ever write and finish another story hopefully it will be better.
