Oh...god...

I was 12...13 ish. I wrote a Mary-Sue In love with Draco...

Which lots of 12 and 13 year olds do. But mine got picked for one of those threads that would completely tear you to SHREDS! It was a long time ago. It was one chapter. And those people destroyed me with very vaild.. and not vaild and super mean criticism.

I deleted that story. I deleted that account. I even left that email address. It was humiliation at its finest.

It was the golden age of HP fanfiction, and I got to enjoy the fruits. And I got to enjoy over 80 people having a very good laugh at my expense. Wish I could remember the name of that forum. I'd like to go there and tell them that in 03 and 04. They were assholes...
