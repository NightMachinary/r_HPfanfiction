1) Embarked on a massive AU with a bunch of different schools. Forgot that Crabbe wasn't at Hogwarts and had him do something stupid (luckily it was in passing, so the error didn't need a massive fix.)

2) Albus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore. Do you see it? Do you /see/?

3) Starting aforementioned AU at Year 1, giving Harmony/Drarry/Snarry shippers a good while to catch feelings if their pairing doesn't show. I've been PM'ed already, by family no less.

Like seriously, why not send a text instead?
