Orbs. Just...what a horrific use of imagery. Go tell someone, /"hey, I like your orbs"/, there's no way for it to end well.

Honestly though, I applaud you for writing, and growing as a writer. If I wrote, I'd finish a chapter, feel good about it, and then look back and realize it is "orbs", "coal-black eyes", and  a shopping trip every other paragraph.
