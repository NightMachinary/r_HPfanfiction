When I was 13 I wrote a horrible fic where Dumbledore threw Harry in Azkaban at the age of 6 because he had a suspicion that Harry would become a dark wizard. It was the prelude for what I thought would be an epic dark!harry/Wrong BWL fic + lots of bashing. At that time, I thought it was awesome. Remarkably, most of the reviewers liked it! (It got to 20k words before I abandoned it)
