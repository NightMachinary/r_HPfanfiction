Years ago, I was writing a Twilight fic (Yes I know!) and got the term 'imprinting' wrong. It was so bad that I had one of the actual characters actually explaining that they were confused about imprinting just as a way to explain that I was confused. Probably OOC has hell! Basically just ruined the whole thing.

It is still published on FFN. But I am just ignoring that story and writing Harry Potter fanfiction. Which I am SO MUCH better at.
