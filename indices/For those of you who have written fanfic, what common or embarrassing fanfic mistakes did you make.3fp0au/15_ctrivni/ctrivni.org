I think it was around '04 that hpff blogs were extremely popular (where I'm from). Most people made up a character and stuck them in the story, and almost everyone was MS/GS.

My character was a beautiful, tall, slender blonde, an Animagus Pure-blood with some sort of muggle peerage, who was Harry's girlfriend but also Draco's best friend and Dumbledore favoured her as well. I think the plot wasn't bad, and I did finish the whole thing with a spectacular battle at Hogwarts, but.. I killed off my own character to torment Harry and show how much he loved "me". It was really long too.

Once someone from school recognised it was me writing, I was terrified for weeks.

Other than that, I posted a HHr story to Mugglenet, told from Draco's perspective that was meant to make people cry. I refuse to read it now, but I think it was wayyy over the top with the dramatics and angst.
