It did get me into writing quite seriously. It remains to be seen if that's a good thing or not because it has sometimes knocked my confidence in my own ability.

But I'm attempting to write a novel, and I've joined several creative writing groups and made some good friends. So there is no doubt that it has changed my life in that respect.
