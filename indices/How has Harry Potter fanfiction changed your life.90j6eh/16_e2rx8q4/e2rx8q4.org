It's both good and bad. It got me addicted way too much that it interferes with me enjoying other books and stories outside of HP. It also t interferes with my day to day activities (I found a solution though with a text-to-speech android app, now I just listen to fics while doing chores and work). But the greatest thing that HP fanfiction did for me was it pulled me out of depression. I still get depressed from time to time, but reading HP fanfics distracts me when I fall into those moments of hopelessness.
