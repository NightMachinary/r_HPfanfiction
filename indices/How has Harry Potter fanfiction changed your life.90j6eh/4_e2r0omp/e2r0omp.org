I spend half my time reading fanfiction instead of regular fiction.

I spend +half+ way more than half my time writing fanfiction instead of regular fiction.

I have more confidence as a writer now that a few hundred people have liked my stories. This is accompanied by crippling self-doubt, because that means a few hundred people will be /reading/ what I write, and it has to be good, and I don't know if I can pull it off aaaaaaaaaaah.
