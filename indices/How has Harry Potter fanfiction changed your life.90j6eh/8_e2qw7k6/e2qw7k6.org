I don't know that it's actually /changed/ my life, but it's certainly enhanced it. Reading and writing HP fan fiction when the books were still coming out introduced me to a great group of people, several of which became lasting friends. When the Goblet of Fire movie came out, a bunch of us got together to wait on the sidelines of the premier in NYC. That was my first trip to NYC and I've been back to visit my friends there several times. Through sheer chance the beta I hooked up with in 2005 happened to be a local person and we've become pretty good friends.

It's introduced me to writing as a hobby and I've found I'm pretty good at it and it's fun and relatively cheap with a very low bar to entry. I don't have any ambitions to become a Serious Published Author because frankly, that's too much work and I already have a job. I would say that writing HP fan fiction has increased my confidence in myself and my skills.
