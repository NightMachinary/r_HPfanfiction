It's ruined my life, I am so addicted to HP fanfic that I am reading almost 8 hours a day, sometimes more. My eyes are almost always staring at a bright screen and I sometimes even skip sleeping to read fanfic and forget to eat meals. I also cannot read any new books because I end up comparing it to HP and that ruins it for me. What's worse is it's not like I read particularly good fanfiction either, it's all cliche wish fulfilment fics...

I suppose the one good thing I have gained from reading HP fanfic is a better vocabulary for some reason.
