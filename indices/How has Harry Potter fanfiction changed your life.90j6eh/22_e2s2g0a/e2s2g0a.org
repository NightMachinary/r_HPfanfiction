It got me in shape.

See, I got disgusted with wasting my free time mindlessly consuming media, so I made a list of more productive things to do. My goal was writing 1,000 words of fanfiction a day, but sometimes I didn't feel like it at all, so I added alternatives like working out or updating my website. Having a choice somehow made it less daunting.

It kind of... backfired. I'm working out regularly now, but still only write sporadically.
