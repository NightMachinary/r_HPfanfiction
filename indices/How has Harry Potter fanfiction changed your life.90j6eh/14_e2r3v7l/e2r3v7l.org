I first caught on to HPFF after the long wait was finally over and OotP came out. After reading through that a dozen or so times over the summer, I simply wanted more. I don't remember what exactly I was looking for when I found it; could have been through fan site speculation, could have been looking for more stories, could have been 10 year old [[/u/heff17]] looking for his first smut. I really don't know. I can't even remember what my first stories were. Hell, one of my first bookmarked stories on my ffnet account is a meta story about tropes, so it clearly goes past that. But for whatever reason it was, I found them and I was enamored.

Those stories helped get me through adolescence. I had a rough time of it there for awhile, and being able to come home and disappear into the latest story helped me more than I could even begin to describe. Hell, even my first girlfriend and I bonded through our love for fanfiction; though she read Voldemort/Harry and I was and continue to be a Harmonian.

Basically, I can't give enough credit to the hundreds of stories fanfiction has given me over the years. It gets harder and harder to find quality or quantity the farther we get from DH's initial release, but I still look because a good story still gives me the same sort of escapism I got when I was 12.
