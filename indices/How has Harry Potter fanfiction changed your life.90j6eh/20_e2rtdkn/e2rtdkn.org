It was through HP fanfic that I learned that people would post all kinds of shit online -- not just uncomfortable 'kinky' stuff, but also borderline illegal content. It was a bit of a shock -- I was so young and naive I'd get nightmares just from glancing at paintings of Jesus on the cross. Now I often found myself thinking "I've read worse on a HP fanfic" whenever my friends mentioned some sick so-and-so content that would haunt them for days.
