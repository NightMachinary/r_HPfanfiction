There have been two big changes to my life. 1) I've gotten so used to reading on a computer/my phone that I no longer read paper books anymore. Even when I'm not reading fanfiction I still read on a device instead of paper. 2) I'm pretty sure all this reading on devices has increased the strain on my eyes and has resulted in the need for glasses. Worth it!
