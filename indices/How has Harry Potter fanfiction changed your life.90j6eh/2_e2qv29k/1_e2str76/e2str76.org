It definitely made me aware of a lot of rookie mistakes in bad fic, only to see it repeated in subtler ways in published novels. Even if the said novels weren't /bad/, per se, that's still 17.99 down the drain for a new book. I think there's a mainstream perception that fanfic is all porn and bad writing, but a lot of fanfic writers clearly love what they're creating and some even enjoy having a dialogue that helps them improve upon their craft and there's also something exciting about seeing that"new update" notification on a WIP fic.
