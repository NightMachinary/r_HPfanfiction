Yeah, I bought my dad a crime novel about a chef doing "hobby investigations" because he thinks it was murder and not a hunting accident. He liked it and told me to read it as well. I dropped it 60 pages in because the protagonist always got "so angry" (various German idioms) again and again. Just reminded me of every bad IndyHarry and the whole "I will not be controlled" rants.
