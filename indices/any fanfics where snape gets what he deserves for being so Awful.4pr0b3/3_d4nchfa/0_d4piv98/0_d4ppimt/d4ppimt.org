The linked post explains my position on why I don't consider Snape's conduct as a teacher to be an issue in HP. Personally, when I encounter any sort of Health&Safety wank in a fic (Snape is abusive, Dursleys deserve Child Protective Services knocking on their door, Dumbledore is a terrible headmaster for allowing stuff to happen, etc.), I click the red X. Maybe not all of it inherently bad, but in the overwhelming majority of cases it's the author thinking how they're so smart for doing it and why doesn't everyone do it, it's so horrible oh my gosh. It tells me they most likely don't have much insight into what makes HP what it is and that the fic is probably bad.
