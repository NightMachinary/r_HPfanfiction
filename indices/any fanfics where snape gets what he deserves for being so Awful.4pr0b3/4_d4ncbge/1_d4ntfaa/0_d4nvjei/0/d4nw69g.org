I agree that Snape was definitely a Dark wizard (Sectumsempra, for example), but there isn't any exact evidence in canon that he tortured/killed muggleborns. In the Pensieve chapter in GoF, Dumbledore is able to quickly brush off concerns that Snape is a real Death Eater. No one around him seems to point out any particular crimes Snape has done, besides being a Death Eater.

Given his upbringing, it's definitely plausible that Snape is prejudiced against muggles, but being the Half-Blood Prince, I find it hard to believe that he hates muggleborns.
