He joined and supported (I doubt Voldemort cared about Tourists) an organization that murders and tortures muggleborns. Blood purity is the first point on their political agenda. He can't have cared about them very much (also, you don't call your black best friend a nigger if you aren't at least a little bit racist).

Whether he ever did the deed personally seems insignificant considering he was basically supporting someone with ethics comparable to Mengele. Was Snape ever truly (ideologically) reformed? Or did he just change sides because he felt betrayed and wanted revenge? The enemy of my enemy...
