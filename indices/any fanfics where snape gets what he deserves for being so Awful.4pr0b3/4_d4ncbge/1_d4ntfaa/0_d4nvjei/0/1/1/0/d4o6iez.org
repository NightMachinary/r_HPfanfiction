  Well, he didn't mind killing a baby (indirectly, yes, but he might've as well done it himself) and I suppose that tells you a lot about Snape's moral compass.

I think Snape saw that as a moot point. There was no way of convincing Voldemort not to kill a baby, so he would try to do some damage control, like tell Dumbledore.
