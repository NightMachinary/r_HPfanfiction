I think when Snape said "what about my soul?" when Dumbledore was trying to talk him into killing him to save Draco's soul makes me feel that Snape's soul must be relatively intact.\\
Plus the seventh book implied that remorse could repair the soul. So even if he had killed before, if he was truly remorseful then his soul would have been repaired. If he wasn't, and his soul was still damaged, then why would he be concerned at all??
