i guess my feelings are some to do with a 'muggles' view of photos and some to do with the prevalence of photos. people don't take great care of the Daily Prophet or the Quibbler.. to me it's a lot like being vegetarian, that's a great lifestyle if you like it but I'm not too upset about ending the life of a tuna so I can have a tuna melt. I do agree any memento of his parents would be precious to Harry. It always rang a little false to me that Harry doesn't do more to learn about his family as they are a central desire of his.
