Voldemort is very powerful, and I am sure there exist some readable Harry/Voldemort fics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&g1=2&r=10&c1=1&c2=348][here's a search to get you started]]. :-P

More seriously, there are some decent ones that 'ship Harry with a powerful!Hermione or plan to, in all evidence:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)
- linkffn(Rule of Two, Dreams Come True by Darklooshkin)
- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen)
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]]) stuff tends to have a pretty powerful!Hermione. He has the advantage of actually finishing his fics, though.

Other than that, I'd recommend looking into Harry/Fleur stuff.
