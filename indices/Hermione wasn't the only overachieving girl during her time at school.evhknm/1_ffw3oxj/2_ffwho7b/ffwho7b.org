“a nosy, eavesdropping Slytherin who likes to impress” - so basically me when I was 11 - shots fired, JKR, lmao.

Now I'm definitely motivated to write a fic on this prompt. Especially because after getting into my dream college, impostor syndrome hit me so hard at age 19. To me, Hermione represents an unrealistic standard that I'll never reach. But I wouldn't want to be me without ADHD. Damn this is becoming really personal, yay for working out issues through extreme nerd stuff!
