I wish she would have added her.

It would have done so much. Made the weasleys not as good, as well as an unlikable muggleborn (or would she be a half blood?), and made another interesting slytherin who is also smart and not a pureblood.

Edit: Taure I didn't realize this was you and was about to message you saying you need to add her to VP. Lawl.
