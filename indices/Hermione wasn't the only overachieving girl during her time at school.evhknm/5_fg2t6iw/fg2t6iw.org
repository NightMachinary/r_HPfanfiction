Alright I'm trying hard to deliver on my promises while still living my best ADHD life, so here's a preview of what I'm working on [[/u/Chess345][u/Chess345]] [[/u/Team-Mako-N7][u/Team-Mako-N7]]

ETA the summary cause of course I forgot it: basically, Hermione encounters ADHD Astoria and is not feelin it but the real WTF moment is when she finds out Astoria's OWL results and totally has a booksmart style freak out

By the end of the first week of term, Hermione had become inexplicably intrigued by Astoria, to Harry's amused satisfaction after she subjected him to a rant that sounded far too similar to one of his own regarding Malfoy. Astoria seemed to be on a different wavelength than everyone else. Not in the way that Luna was, though. Astoria was radiating with energy and overflowing with ideas--but less like a bubbling cauldron of Felix Felicis and more like a Chernobyl nuclear reactor. It was exhausting just listening to her sometimes. Like the time Hermione was forced to hear her talking to a Hufflepuff sixth-year in the corridor, because Astoria could be both a fast talker and a /loud/ talker.

“I had a very productive summer,” she said. “I agitated Slytherin House into a state of youthful rebellion, facilitated a takeover of Malfoy Manor, and learned how to do liquid eyeliner. Oh, and I decided to take up the guitar, because I thought it would make me look cool...But anyway, was there anything interesting in the Transfiguration reading? I didn't have time to do it because I was up until three a.m. reading about Lethifolds and now I'm fucking obsessed. Did you hear about the bloke who staged an attack in an attempt to leave his wife? If it were me, I would never have been caught. What a fucking amateur! But let me tell you, If Draco tried that shit, he would wish the Lethifold had got him. Because I would slowly and painfully murder him myself. And you can take that to Gringotts!”

This one-sided conversation was just one of hundreds of items on Hermione's list of why she was grateful not to be in the same House as Astoria. There's no way she would have been able to tolerate the overdue library books and mugs missing from the Great Hall that apparently cluttered not only Astoria's bedroom, but numerous nooks and crannies of the Slytherin common room. In fact, so many mugs went unaccounted for that one of the house-elves threatened suicide and Astoria solved that problem by personally purchasing a large order of mugs with the Slytherin crest and proceeding to leave /those/ all over the castle. As for the library situation--Astoria apparently thought it was a better use of her time to create various disguises to elude Madam Pince instead of simply making the effort to meet a /very reasonable/ expectation. It was not a laughing matter for a student to so /obstinately/ refuse to return the books in the /respectful/ and /orderly/ manner that befitted a sanctuary of knowledge. It /really/ bothered Hermione, alright?
