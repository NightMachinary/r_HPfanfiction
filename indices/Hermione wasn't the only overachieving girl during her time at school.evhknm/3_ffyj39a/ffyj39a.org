Many people had many things to say about Luna Lovegood. She was loony, insane, crazy, weird, not quite right, her wand was twisted, and more the would say. They would never say, that she was of poor breeding, that she came from a poor family, that she wasn't an absolute powerhouse of magic, that she was not the smartest person they had ever met hands down.

That last one had Hermione in a bit of a twist. She worked hard for her grades and received genuine joy from getting good ones. The feeling of being called on and having the answer brought delight to her soul. The deep sense of satisfaction she received when she got back O's for her work. It spurred her on, driving her to seek that pleasure of perfection.

Luna Lovegood seemed to be at best only loosely related with reality. Hermione had never seen the girl in the library studying, or at all come to think of it. Yet she heard nothing but incredulous praise at how intelligent and gifted the girl was.

She would see the girl dancing in the greens. Sitting on eaves relaxing in the sun or just wandering around.

It frustrated Hermione so much she was beginning to lose sleep over it. She finally broke down and spoke up about it after Professor McGonagall confronted her.

"Ah, I see the problem here. Hermione you have two options I will present you. First I give you the answer right here and now. Secondly I guide you on the path to find the answer yourself. Take you time and think about it."

Hermione wanted nothing more than to just get the answer now. If she had the answer she could research it and find how to close the gap.

Yet she hesitated, Professor McGonagall had hinted just by giving the second option that it was the one she preferred. She battled with her indecision until her desire to please and gain their praise won out.

"The second option please Professor McGonagall."

Minerva could clearly see it pained the girl to take this route but she had.

"Excellent choice. I believe you are having a bit of trouble with the color changing charms correct?"

Hermione nodded, personally ashamed of her perceived failure.

"Perhaps it would behoove you to visit the astronomy tower tomorrow afternoon before dinner?"

Hermione nodded completely unsure of what was going on but trusting her Professor.

Hermione made her way to the top of the tower and say Luna Lovegood there already.

The girl was sitting on a cushion with one beside her on the railing looking out to a sunset.

Hermione walked over and Luna patted the cushion and smiled at her. Once Hermione was seated she started to speak only to be stopped.

"Shhh... you'll scare away the tortoise winged bumbles. Look, watch them dance."

She waved her arm out encompassing the Black Lake and the growing horizon as the sun set.

Hermione looked hard trying to find any such nonsense creature for a few minutes before huffing.

"Look, see, don't use your eyes silly."

Hermione huffed again, how was she supposed to look without using her eyes.

Closing them she started trying to meditate, perhaps that was what she meant.

"You can't see anything if you close your eyelids silly. Look, see, truly open and see. Stop thinking and see."

Hermione was getting frustrated but Professor McGonagall had set this up and she wouldn't fail the Professor.

Trying to keep her eyes unfocused she felt her breathing begin to slow. She watched as the colors of the lake and horizon changed as time passed.

She soon found herself lost to the world as she felt the magic of color and change happen in front of her.

It was dark when she looked away and she pulled out her wand. She felt the color changing spell in ways she had never dreamed of before.

The magic itself was dancing in the way a sunset fell into a rainbow of colors. Looking around she noticed Luna Lovegood was gone but she understood a little bit now.

"How Professor, I understand but don't understand. It's incredible and makes no sense at all! Please help me understand what happened!"

Minerva was sure this was what would happen. She was glad the girl had at least learned some of the lesson.

"Hermione how do you think the first spells were made? What inspired the first spell, what drove witches and wizards to creating spells? How do you think new spells are crafted?"

She gave the girl plenty of time to work through it. She could tell Hermione was almost there.

"Picture what you saw tonight again and think of what it means for wizarding kind."

Minerva could tell it clicked finally.

"That's the heart of magic, the base components of spells! The natural magic of the universe! That's amazing! Why don't we learn this in class?"

"It's not something you can teach. You are exceptionally lucky young miss Lovegood is attending Hogwarts while you are here."

"Not even once a century does a Child of Magic such as her come along in the whole of the world. She sees what little she helped you see last night in full around her all the time. I'm told it's an incredible experience, though Children of Magic are not fully in this realm with us."

"They live in magic itself, a foot in two worlds so to speak. They create wonderous bases for spells that we refine and refine for centuries. They are the layers of our foundation. The rest of us are the builders who create the buildings of magic atop those foundations. We need them, they most assuredly do not need us."

Hermione was stunned. This was an insurmountable gap. She could feel that moment had been unique and she was gifted to have ever felt such a moment. It put her entire life into a new framework of perspective.

"Thank you Professor, I have much to think about now."

Hermione may not be a foundation layer, she did promise to herself she would be the best builder though. Luna would need friends as well. Harry and Ron would soon be joining her in her quest to cherish Luna Lovegood.

Hermione was the best at whatever she did, so she would be the best builder to the best Child of Magic ever. This she swore.
