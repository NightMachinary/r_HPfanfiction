Oh no worries at all! I love knowing I'm not the only weirdo out there haha

I'm in my late twenties but I wrote my first fic in November when I was unemployed and having a quarterlife crisis. It got me through that time and things are so much better now. I feel like my own personal stuff is totally buried in my fics and I'm ok with that lol
