This is really different than how I'm responding to my own prompt, and that is a great thing!! I love Hermione realizing that the things that make Luna stick out from the crowd are actually a great thing instead of pitying her from a high horse. Also love her confiding in McGonagall & then Minerva giving her solid advice without criticizing her.

And yes I did read the whole thing, I just read really fast. I always get a vivid picture in my head when I read and I'm like not even aware I'm processing words anymore if that makes sense.
