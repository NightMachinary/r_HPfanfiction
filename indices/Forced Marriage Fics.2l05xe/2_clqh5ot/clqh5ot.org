[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3217498/1/]] A Higher Law. Hermione/Remus. Law affecting werewolves instead of the usual Muggleborn or pureblood laws.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3924523/1/]] Innocence. Hermione/Sirius. " What happens when two people with lives manipulated by the ministry and harmed by pureblood mania decide to fight back? Begins with a marriage law and follows them through their struggles with the wizarding world." (I personally love this one, but characterization is a little off)
