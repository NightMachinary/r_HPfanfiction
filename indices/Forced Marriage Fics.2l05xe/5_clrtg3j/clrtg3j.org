[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6776/1][This]] one is way the fuck out of left field, so I could understand why you wouldn't like it. That said, I enjoy the hell out of it. It's a Harry/Hermione story set in the 1800s~, with all the mannerisms you'd expect from a Victorian time period. It's a short, sweet read that I rather enjoyed.
