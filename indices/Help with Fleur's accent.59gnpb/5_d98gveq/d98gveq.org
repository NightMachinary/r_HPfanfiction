I just wrote one, and I agree if she's the main character, you aren't going to want to use her accent. So what I did was make a point of not using contractions, as though she is still considering what she will say in French before she says it in English. And a couple of times I gave her a rather formal construction for a sentence as opposed to something more idiomatic. But I was careful to not go overboard on that either; as long as you make it neutral, people already know her as a character and will cast your words in her voice.
