Hm, first, it's really not that uncommon for girls to go after older boys, I guess (especially at that age, speaking from experience).

And you've hit a nerve with this comment, because I've moved to Germany two years ago and it's just so /hard/. I don't know if it's because I speak three other languages, or is it German. /crawls into a hole/

But I see your point. It's a matter of good writing and knowing when it's too much.
