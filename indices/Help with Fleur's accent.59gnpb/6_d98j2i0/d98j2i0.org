Yes you can, just don't do the accent (or say that her english doesn't sound great without actually writing it that way...also: I think Fleur does her utmost to improve her English, she probably hates sounding like an imbecil - especially if you stick with the canon romance (which I myself don't actually like...sorry, but Bill IMHO is much too old for her, he's what? 25? 30?)...I mean who wouldn't improve his or her language skills if they have a foreign GF/BF? I surely would...ok, unless it's English (which is a foreign language for a German guy like me!))...it's frankly one of the things I dislike about people who include her in a story:

The exaggerated accent (I mean sure: Her English isn't great at first, but after a year talking to British people (hell even if she'd only listen!) it will get better - rapidly! I myself learned English this way (with a good grounding from having English classes at school of course!): I watched American TV-Shows and read English books! (For example Harry Potter...haven't ever tried it in German and I don't really want to either!)...school alone wouldn't have given me enough become fluent (the school way of learning - any - languages just doesn't work for me...it works for grammar, but not for becoming fluent and knowing tons of words, expressions, idioms etc.))

ps: That's why school failed so dismally at teaching me Spanish (I didn't have any Spanish books to read or movies to watch so my Spanish is still pretty bad!)
