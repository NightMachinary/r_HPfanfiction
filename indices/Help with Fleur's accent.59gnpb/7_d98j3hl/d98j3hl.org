I don't think you have to make it very strong. If she's the speaker, she would be aware of her own accent but not to the same extent that someone like Harry would be aware.

Maybe just substituting z for th and dropping H's at the beginning of sentences would work.

You can also just make her constructions somewhat awkward/simple. Maybe not all of the time, just when she's nervous or upset or trying to express a complicated thought.

You might even want to get someone French as a beta, they might have a few suggestions for ways to make the accent seem more natural and for Fleur to feel more authentically French. JKR did a good job because she's somewhat fluent and spent time there, but it's not easy.
