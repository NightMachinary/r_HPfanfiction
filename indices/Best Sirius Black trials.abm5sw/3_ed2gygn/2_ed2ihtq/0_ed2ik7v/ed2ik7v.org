We've seen multiple trials in canon so we know that veritaserum is not used. We also know that there are multiple ways to trick veritaserum, including occlumency, so that provides a good reason why this is the case.

In any event, it's usually unwise for a defendant to "take the stand" in their own trial, and lawyers will almost always advise that defendants take advantage of their right against self-incrimination. The reason for this is that under intense and clever questioning, even innocent people giving truthful answers can be made to look guilty. Defendant is nervous and keeps glancing at their lawyer? Jury thinks they look guilty. Defendant is inarticulate and hesitates frequently in their answers? Jury thinks they look guilty. Defendant forgets a minor detail about an event that happened a year ago? Jury thinks they look guilty. Etc.
