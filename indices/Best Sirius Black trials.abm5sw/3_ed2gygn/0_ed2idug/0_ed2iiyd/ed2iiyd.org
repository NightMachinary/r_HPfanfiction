A decent lawyer will be able to undermine Dumbledore's hearsay evidence that Sirius was the secret keeper. They will be able to point out that Dumbledore's evidence only goes to James and Lily's intentions, and does not show that Sirius Black was /actually/ their secret keeper.

Nonetheless, on the totality of the evidence and considered in conjunction with the other evidence (in particular Pettigrew accusing Sirius of betraying the Potters before his apparent death at the hands of Sirius), a jury would likely still be confident that Sirius was the secret keeper and killed Pettigrew.
