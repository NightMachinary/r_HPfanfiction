The only real evidence is that James and Lily told everyone that Sirius was the secret keeper, and that Sirius was at the crime scene having a mental breakdown. That's not enough to send someone to Azkaban without a trial. At least Dumbledore should have asked Sirius about what happened. But no, he was too busy leaving Harry on a doorstep in the middle of the night. Any decent lawyer could get Sirius out and Dumbledore arrested.
