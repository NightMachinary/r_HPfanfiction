IANAL, but I see a few problems with your arguments:

1. If Peter is dead, where is the body? They found just a finger, but apparently enough remained of the other victims involved to determine how many bodies there were. Which casts reasonable doubt that Peter really died there.
2. Since there were two wizards involved and one is not accounted for, this is not enough of an argument for either side.
3. Fine so far, apart from the last part of the sentence. No body, no victim.
4. Supposed perpetrator had a mental breakdown. No argument for or against.
5. This one presupposes that Sirius has been properly questioned - which is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the books. As far as I remember, there has been some sort of questioning while Sirius was still dealing with his mental breakdown and clearly didn't even register the questions, let alone was aware enough to realize this was his chance to explain himself.
6. Character evidence doesn't fly here, since Sirus was also known to be James' closest friend. The issue with the secret keeper being known has been discussed by you elsewhere in this thread - no conclusive evidence for or against.

I am not really happy with your defence arguments as well:

1. Nowhere in the books does it say that illegal animagus are punished by sending them to Azkaban. Also, nowhere are any clear guidelines listed when and how an animagus has to register. Do they have to as soon as they achieve this, dow they have to do that when reaching a certain age (17, age of majority perhaps, or some other age with the implied reasoning that people usually start the process after finishing Hogwarts and take a while for it)? Also, while this is admittedly splitting hairs, technically the defence is that (James and) Peter were animagi while at school, and that is why Sirius knows their forms. Sirius being an animagus himself is not really the point and only useful for the prosecution if punishment for that crime is applicable and severe enough. Since Sirius was incarcerated at a young age, around 20 according to the books, it is possible that he didn't have to register while he was free, especially considering there was a civil war going on and Sirius was working for law enforcement. His years in Azkaban do not count against him, since no prisoner is expected or able to register.
2. I refer to point 5 above: If he had a proper interview, yes, probably. Not English, therefore I can't speak for that part, but it does make sense. But what if his interview was not conducted properly?
3. There is no convincing evidence against him as well, so along that line of reasoning we end up at "in dubio pro reo" -> Sirius has to be let go because of insufficient evidence.
