I'd really like to see a fic where Sirius gets a trial... and is then found guilty. Unless they have captured Peter Pettigrew, this is the most likely result by far:

- Sirius was the only wizard at the scene of the crime, other than Peter Pettigrew, who is dead.

- A curse has clearly been used.

- Multiple eye-witnesses recall Pettigrew angrily confronting Sirius and accusing him of being responsible for James and Lily's death, after which there is an explosion which kills Pettigrew.

- When Sirius was found at the scene of the crime, he was laughing.

- When in custody, Sirius offered no explanation for his actions.

- Character evidence: Dumbledore can testify to the fact that Sirius was Lily and James' intended Secret Keeper and that the only way Voldemort could have killed them was if Sirius betrayed them.

In response to this evidence, Sirius has his story about Peter being the real traitor and faking his own death. There are three problems with this defence:

- The defence depends on admitting that he is an illegal animagus. Not only is this a crime which will independently be sufficient to send Sirius to Azkaban, it is also further character evidence against Sirius. Why should the court trust the word of a man who just admitted to years of criminal dishonesty?

- He didn't mention this story while in custody. Waiting until trial to provide a defence makes it look like you've thought it up while in custody. Under English law, if you remain silent in your police interview but then later seek to raise a defence, an adverse inference can be drawn against you i.e. the jury is free to conclude that if your defence were true, you should have mentioned it at the earliest opportunity. Magical Britain may well have a similar position.

- There's no evidence to support anything of what he says, except the fact that Sirius himself is an illegal animagus.

In brief, unless Peter Pettigrew is produced as evidence, pretty much any court in the world would convict Sirius.
