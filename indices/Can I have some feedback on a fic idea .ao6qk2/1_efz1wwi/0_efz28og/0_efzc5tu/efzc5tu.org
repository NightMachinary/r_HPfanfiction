Hermione is quick to resort to violence when she feels that it is justified and she does not feel bad about it afterwards (she got Umbridge either gang-raped or brutalised by centaurs and didn't bat an eye).

It would make more sense if there were multiple groups of hitmen. Harry, Hermione, maybe Ron, (although he seems to be rather black and white when it comes to morality) as well as the DA group you have in mind. The trio goes after the big fish (Malfoy, Umbridge, anyone from the Muggleborn registration), the DA starts with the collaborators (first from Hogwarts, then in the Ministry).
