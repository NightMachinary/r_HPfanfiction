I would argue that Hermione would be leading the hitman group. She is shown to have a strong sense of justice, does not stand for unfair treatment and can be utterly ruthless if need be. And she could easily use emotional blackmail to get Harry on board (Do you want me to be murdered? Don't you want justice for Teddy's parents?).
