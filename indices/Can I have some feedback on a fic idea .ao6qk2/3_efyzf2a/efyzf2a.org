I would think the group would be the ones who lost someone close to them like dennis and george. I dont remember the other people you listed as having a loved one die. I'd say hannah abbot would make a good member as a large portion of her family was murdered by Voldemort.

What if it were lead by say andromeda Tonka though? She lost her cousins (Sirius and regulus). husband, daughter and son in law.
