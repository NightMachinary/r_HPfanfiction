Well, I'd totally read it. I agree with Hellstrike on that Hermione (and maybe Harry) would get in on it, though I really do like the idea of it mostly being from minor characters' PoVs.

Does this mean Lavender survived Greyback's assault? Did he survive too? That could be great start---Lavender getting back at the werewolf who tore most of her throat out...
