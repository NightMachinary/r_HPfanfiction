Now that I think about it, doing an after the fall thing would be pretty easy: Someone discovers that magic was added to the world when the aliens visited 1000's of years ago, and thus is closer to muggle science than you would think. Could do a neat thing with this allowing muggleborn's to better understand the nature of magic once it is revealed.

However, you are right, it isn't really what you originally asked.

The problem with what you ask is it changes the concept from being 'someone with special powers' to 'someone without special powers'.

"A secret society of magic users hiding under the surface of a world of non-magic users" fits a lot better than the inverse. I mean it is possible just.. not that interesting. "A secret society of people with no hair hiding under the surface of a world of harry people".

And putting 'technology' in place of magic doesn't really fit: By its nature, technology is not some special skill but is something everyone can learn. I suppose you could do something like 'this group chose to give up their magic in order to do this', but it isn't really the same...
