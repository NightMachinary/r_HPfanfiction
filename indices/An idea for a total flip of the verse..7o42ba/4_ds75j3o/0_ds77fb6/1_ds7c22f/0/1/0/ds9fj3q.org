I watched only a few eps, so I can't say yes or no.

One thing I can say for sure is that they wouldn't have any ESP. All their skill would be tech based. If there's telepathy, it's not because they are telepaths, but because they have brain-to-brain quantum entanglement communication network. If someone can move stuff without touching it, it's not because they are telekinetics, but they can wirelessly control femtomachines that can redirect graviton waves.
