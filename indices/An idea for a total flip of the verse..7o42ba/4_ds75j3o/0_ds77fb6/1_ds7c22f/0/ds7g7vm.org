The idea evolves in my head as I read the responses, and here's one such thing.

You see, you think of the technology like a toaster or a cellphone. I think of the tech that lets you manipulate gravity, create matter out of quantum foam and move whole planets. The world is filled with nanomachines. Ground, air, and people carry them around. Unfortunately, high technology doesn't see eye to eye with magic, so only those with the low level of it in their bodies are able to cultivate great numbers of them and achieve quantum level manipulation.

Be aware, that if this idea takes flight, the magic will take significant nerf. After all, it plays the role of the mundane in the story. Some spells might get removed, and overall it'll be much harder to achieve substantial results. After all, an 11-year-old kid that can take the rule of conservation of mass and without much effort bend it over the desk is moronically OP.
