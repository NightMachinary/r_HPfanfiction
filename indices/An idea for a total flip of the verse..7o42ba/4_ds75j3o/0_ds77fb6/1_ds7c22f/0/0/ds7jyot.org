That is just magic by a different name though.

The very nature of science is that you achieve great things via an intimate understanding of the universe around you. There is no intrinsic value to it. Even in 'magicie' sci-fi like Telepathy, where there isn't any hard science behind it, is that it is something that fundamentally could be understood by the characters in their universe, instead of say, 'mind magic'. The wonder of it is the idea of being able to do basically magical things purely through having a grand and intimate understanding of how the world works.

Thus, by definition, those with magic would be able to use tech. It is easy to flip it around (you lose magic by doing science). "Magic requires belief, and a scientific viewpoint is incompatible" (You see this alot in the 'grow up and lose magic' ideas). But not being able to use technology because of magic?

I know some people try with the whole 'hey electronics don't work around magic', but that doesn't block science at all. Any decent electrical engineer (or scientist), when presented with a situation where electricity and magic are interacting that way, would immediately hunker down and start experimenting to measure and quantify the effect. The engineer would then try to find a way to use the properties of magic to his advantage (Remember, rapidly dampening electricity is a very important concept to electrical engineering). They would totally find a way to use the phenomena to their advantage.

Oh a side note, there are no-where near enough fics with scientists scienceing the shit out of magic. You know the first science professor who has a magical child would subject them to all sorts of tests.
