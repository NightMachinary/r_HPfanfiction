Ehh I am still not seeing it. The thing is, science is a thought process not so much a particular set of technologies. When you want to do 'suppressed scientist' narrative s, usually it isn't the entire notion of scientists that are hidden but the practitioner's, out of fear due to the climate ("religious society that rejects them")

What you need is a reason that your subgroup would be more critical/logical thinkers than the rest of the population, and would keep it hidden.

Maybe something like "magic World was populated by starship long time ago and nanites provide 'magic' to the population. The population has lost knowedge about their origins. The ship selects kids at age 11 to join it's official crew, when they learn about how their world works."

The motivation stays the same: secret population keeps itself secret because general population would prosecute them for power. The scientists can do things the general population can not through their greater understanding and access to the mothership.

The general population could understand the science behind their wonders but there is no motivation for them to do so. As far as they are concerned it is just 'forbidden magic'.

A couple of themes in the book can shine through, including the belief crew membership should stay in the direct line of the original members, the scientists still operating under a military type hierchy, while the magicals have moved on to democracy...
