Who said the magicals can't use tech? It's just that they don't have access to anything more advanced than a gas lamp, that already is more magical than mechanical. Higher tech won't work at maximum capacity in hands of someone powerful, because of interference, but it will work. Average Ron (or rather Dudley) wouldn't be even able to pas the filters to take it below 100%.

Those that developed it had little to no connection with magic (as in they have low mana capacity), so at the beginning, the tech was sort of a crutch for them. Those that had magic in abundance didn't care about developing tech because whatever they wanted, they could get by waving a stick. That's why the magicals are happy with living in (sort of) renaissance times, while techs smash together moons to create new planets. And by the time tech was able to do things magic couldn't, the "worlds" were in separation for a long time and techs aren't very keen on "giving a nuke to a toddler" so to speak.

As for the "sufficiently advanced technology...", the difference between this and the actual magic, is that it isn't magic.

BTW. I too would like to read a "scientist(s) vs magic" story. The best I ever found was a geneticist taking a look at dragon DNA.
