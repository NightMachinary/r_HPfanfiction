I know this trope kinda exists already. I thought it out to be more "parallel evolution", than "after the fall" though. You know, they were developing together, like in canon HP, but at some point, the science guys had Oppenheimer's "I have become the destroyer of worlds" moment and decided to fall back into the shadows.

BTW. Is the "magic erodes logic" thing canon or fanon? Cos I'm pretty sure Rowling said that, but I'm not sure if that was in real life or in my imagination.
