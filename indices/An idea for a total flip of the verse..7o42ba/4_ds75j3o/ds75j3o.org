"Magic World with secret science" isn't that uncommon of a trope to run into in general science fiction/fantasy. It is often portrayed as the magic civilization being the fallen remnents of some more advanced technogical civilization. The understanding of the nanites/applied phlebotinum has faded but still operates unseen and allows for 'magic' to be preformed.

I don't know of any fics set in HP that use this, but some books come to mind.

"There will be dragons" cronicals the fall of a technological civilization into a swords&sorcery situation

The "Pern" series started out so strongly as low fantasy that the publisher put it out as fantasy, only to have the later books go 'sci-fi all along'

I also recall "The Practice Effect" having this twist in the end.
