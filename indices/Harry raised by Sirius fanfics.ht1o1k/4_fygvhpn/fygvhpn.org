Living with Danger - Sirius is in Azkaban, but Remus finds out he is innocent at the time that Harry is ~2. He then frees Sirius and they raise Harry together. Eventually they manage to redeem Sirius aswell. This is a really great story, it actually might be my favorite HP fanfic. Sorry tho, idk how to link stuffðŸ˜…
