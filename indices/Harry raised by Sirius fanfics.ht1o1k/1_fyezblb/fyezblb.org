I remember really enjoying the linkao3(Stealing Harryverse) Harry starts out with the Dursleys but meets up with Sirius (and Remus) when he is 8. Continues through 3rd year although that story isn't complete there is a wrap up and notes discussing what the author had planned for the “rest” of the series.
