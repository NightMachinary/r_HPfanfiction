So I feel you always have to compromise aesthetics and logic for your story with those things. Because principally, everyone could wear a simple shirt for everything, and the different functions (protective, warming, supporting ...) would be achieved with magic. However, it's extraordinarily boring if you do that.

On the other hand, you also don't want to go into /too/ much functional garments. It just makes no sense that wizards have to bother with countless layers to keep warm, or bulky protective gear that's a hassle to wear, when they could simply use magic.

So the bottom line is that I'd keep an eye on style -- fluttering cape-like things just look /good/ when flying, or leather looks sufficiently martial -- and symbolic items like gloves that without magic wouldn't be protecting at all, and with magic not strictly needed, but make conceptual sense, the way magic in HP is conceptual: E.g. for "gloves", they help with "grip", and magic worked into it makes it so.
