Yes, exactly!

The fluttering thing is actually a big thing. There are rules, like you need to have at least 45% coverage of the team colours, but then other things like I envisage that a lot of the old families have different armour Wes, and so there are different family traditions of styles of â€˜armour'.

And then there are things like there is a certain amount of dramatic flair expected; showmanship. In my mind the Holyhead Harpies for instance have uniforms a little like the Amazons of Themyscira in the first Wonder Woman movie with the leather skirts that show off quite a lot of their body but also look badass with the kind of movements that are involved on a broom, and quidditch witches who are hoping to be scouted for that team will have that kind of accent on their uniform. Others might have capes or half capes, so that the audience can enjoy the show.
