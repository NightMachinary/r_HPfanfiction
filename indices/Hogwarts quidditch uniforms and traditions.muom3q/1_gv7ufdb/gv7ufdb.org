Bear in mind that professional players probably wear very different gear to children, who may have very little money and grow quickly, so will need a lot of replacements. Unless you are making magically enhanced objects/clothing completely ubiquitous, probably Quidditch gear for Harry or the Weasleys would be mostly mundane (although the likes of Malfoy could be another matter).

I would assume that the primary consideration would be the fact that the Quidditch season runs through winter in the Scottish Highlands and they are explicitly stated to practice/play through storms, so they will need to be very weatherproof. Also different positions may wear different things (e.g. extra keeper padding, shock absorbing gloved for beaters). Maybe they are quite modular (you can strip off layers as you warm up or if they are soaked through). Finally you might consider referencing styles or enhancements that are banned, making yourself too buldgerproof maybe or too grippy gloves.
