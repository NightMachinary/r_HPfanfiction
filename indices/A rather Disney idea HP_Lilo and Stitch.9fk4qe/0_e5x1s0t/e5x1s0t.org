I have an idea for the set-up:

Luna, a bright girl, who is distraught about losing her mother. She became very quiet and withdrawn, and her father could never seem to help her. But then a strange creature named Stitch crashlands in the nearby woods. Luna being Luna, they are instant best friends. She's afraid Xenophilius will take him away from her, but he loves the strange creature as well. She can keep him and they have a lot of adventures.

One night Ginny steals her brother's broom and goes into the forest to practice in secret, and she discovers Luna and Stitch (it even sounds catchy!) there.

I don't know how it would go from there but I love how cute and wholesome it could be.
