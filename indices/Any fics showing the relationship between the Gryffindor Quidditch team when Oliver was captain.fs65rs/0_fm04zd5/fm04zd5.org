I'm currently looking for one fic like this - Harry's scars (can't recall whether they're from his adventures or his beatings at the hand of the Dursleys) are seen by the Quidditch team and they, quite reasonably, make a fuss over it. No idea what the title is, but I saw it on a rec here and can't find it again to bookmark it.

Also, second rec is a mildly weird one which sort of meets your request, but also not really? It's called 'Play up, play up, and break the game' and it's the story of what lengths Oliver will drag his team to in order to win.
