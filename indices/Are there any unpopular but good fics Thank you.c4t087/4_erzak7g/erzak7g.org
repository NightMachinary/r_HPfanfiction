Linkffn(Nymphadora Tonks and the Liquor of Jacmel) Edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3435122/1/][link]]

I skimmed the first couple chapters of this and it seems to be written well enough, grammatically (though it's a bit blocky). It's about Tonks' first case as an auror. Not many reviews, but they're positive.
