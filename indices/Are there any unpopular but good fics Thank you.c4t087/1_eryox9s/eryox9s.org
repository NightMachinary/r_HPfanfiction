Understand that these are fics I think are unpopular, but believe are written well enough that they deserve overall to be labeled as good. Others can and will disagree, as they should.

Linkffn(Black Luminary): a slooooow build, but the writer generally has built a unique AU and it's relatively entertaining, if occasionally over-the-top.

Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): this is an entertaining read, but lots of people can't deal with the 2nd person perspective.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): a great, if only 2/3 complete, AU from the post-gof days.
