I don't think I ever see these recommended here:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563043/1/The-Real-Memory][The Real Memory]]. Harry died, goes to a different world where magic doesn't exist, died again, repeat a few times. What make this fanfiction great is how the author can make us wonder 'What the fuck is happening?' at the same time as Harry does.\\
  Most of the alternate world is Muggle!AU though, so YMMV.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13912332/chapters/32017587][sleeper]]. Harry goes to a different world when he sleeps. The characterization, the trio (plus Ginny) mechanics, and the (kinda) mystery in this fanfiction is amazing. Although the ending is a bit disappointing.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15687453/chapters/36450108][proof]]. The usual Harry takes over the Wizengamot fanfiction, but he also bakes Rhubarb Tart, Lemon and Almond Ricotta Biscuits, and a three other desserts. A fun and quick read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7914675/1/Mother-s-Love][Mother's Love]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8512041/1/Normal][Normal]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992638/1/Settling][Settling]]. AU where only James lived and Lily enters an abusive (well, for Harry) relationship with Snape.

These are the ones that doesn't get recommended enough:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]]. AU where Harry goes to Stonewall High because Hogwarts start at 14.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3916129][you will bleed to death with the pain of it]]. Harry-Tom soulmarks. It's not what you thinks, trust me.
