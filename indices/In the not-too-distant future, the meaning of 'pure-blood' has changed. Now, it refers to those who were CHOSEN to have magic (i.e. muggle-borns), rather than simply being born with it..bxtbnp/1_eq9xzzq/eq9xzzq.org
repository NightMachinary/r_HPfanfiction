It's a great idea, but doesn't sit right for me. For a group to have superiority, they need to be the older group. Muggleborns will never be considered superior, since they're essentially outsiders.

The whole thing is a metaphorical reference to immigrants. No one will ever herald immigrants as superior, not unless they come in guns blazing.
