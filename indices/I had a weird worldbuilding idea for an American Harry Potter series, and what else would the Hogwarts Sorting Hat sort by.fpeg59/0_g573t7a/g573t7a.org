I think maybe instead of the high school stereotypes, you could have them sorted by learning type? Like, kinesthetic learners vs auditory learners vs visual learners. That would make it easier to teach them effectively, too; just shove a class of kids who learn in similar ways together and you don't have to worry too much about other learning styles in a classroom.

Of course, this is just me. Do whatever boats your float, my guy!
