It starts off a bit strange which may not be your cup of tea. However, it moves on with the plot fast, but sadly it's abandoned (pretty short at 26k words).

Oh and check out by the divining light and Conlaodh's song by the same author. It's not what you're looking for in this case but amazing stories in my opinion.
