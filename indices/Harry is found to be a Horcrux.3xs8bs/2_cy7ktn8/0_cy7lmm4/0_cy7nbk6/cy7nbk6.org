To Persevere is an excellent alternative DH story, and from memory isn't slash (or it is very minor, I can't remember). It does get very dark linkffn(10175118).

Mine is slash and only just complete, but is pretty good (warning, not a happy ending) linkffn(11538927).

Not really dystopian, but certainly excellent is Fates Favorite linkffn(5725656).

I would also recommend Some other beginning, which is slash and does have Mpreg mentioned but not in detail linkffn(9591343).

The Vitruvian Man isn't really what you describe looking for but... well it does have LV ruling and a link between LV and Harry. linkffn(9214710).

+Dark Times isn't finished, and hasn't been updated in a while and is slash, but started out with a lot of promise linkao3(2615639).+ After re-reading isn't what I remember and isn't what you are looking for.
