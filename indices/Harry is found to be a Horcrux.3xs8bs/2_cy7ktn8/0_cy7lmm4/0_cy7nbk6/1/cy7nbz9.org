  He opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by an icy statement that caused the hairs on his entire body to stand erect. "I know what you are, Harry Potter... Death will never touch you." SLASH, HP/LV. Darkly disturbing and all sorts of tragically twisted... this is not for the faint of heart.

  When forgotten Dark forces work with those without magic, yet still consumed by darkness, the Wizarding World must band together and the two Lords of Magic must set aside their differences if their people are to survive...

      A ChibiAyane spawned Monster bunny that she dropped on my head to work with\. \-GenukaIt is a pretty gargantuan bunny\.\.\. \-ChibiAyaneThis will also be a slower and more randomly updated story than any of my others since we're both working on it\. \-GenukaI'm a bit of a stickler\. \-ChibiAyane

            Harry and Voldemort learn that there is something more important to fight for than the difference between Light and Dark\.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
