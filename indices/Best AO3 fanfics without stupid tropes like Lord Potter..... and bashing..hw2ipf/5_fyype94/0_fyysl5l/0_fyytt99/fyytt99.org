Linkffn(Heart over Mind by Regann) IS JUST SO SWEET AND AMAZING. slow burn that kills me in the best of ways and just amazingly done.

Linkao3(Black Magic by Mysticalpapaya) I love this one so much! Is really sweet and mature, Hermione is older and coming back and is just a cool and normal relationship with no extreme shenanigans like magical bonding, contracts, potions and etc. Is just natural and amazing.

Linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger by OracleObscured) Porn with plot, not for the faint of heart and kinda problematic in some ways? was rly skeptical about it, but ended up loving it after so many people reccomended, is better not to judge based on the first chapter tho.

Linkao3(Quartet by OracleObscured) Also porn with plot, but just so effing amazing and not problematic(lot of kinks, but not problematic in a sense that everything is very explicitly consensual)

Linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur by ShayaLonnie) Dramione. Just gold. Really. The plot is so freaking amazing and I love the Regulus sub plot.

Linkao3(A Kiss for the Netherfairies by Zaubernuss) Chamber play but so cute!!

Linkao3(Getting the Best of the Gloomilows by Zaubernuss) Sequel to the previous one, very amazing.

Linkao3(Cloak of Courage by WendyNat) Haven't read it yet, but everyone reccomends a lot. Apparently very dark.

Linkao3(311126) Second Life Amazing, amazing, amazing!! I found it to be a great introduction to the pairing.

Linkffn(2290003) Is just every sshg shipper favourite. Not my favourite but still an awesome fic rly.

Linkffn(7170435) Not for the faint of heart, but one of my favourites rly. Dark premise but soooo amazing. Is a wip and I only read complete fics as a rule, but that really got me.

Linkffn(The Problem with Purity by Phoenix.Writing) Really amazing, thick plot, there's drarry as subplot, but they are just amazing, the war efforts are great, the lycantropy issue is just 10/10 and is somewhat dark. Love it with all my heart.

There's more I can't recall now but if I remember I'll come back here :D
