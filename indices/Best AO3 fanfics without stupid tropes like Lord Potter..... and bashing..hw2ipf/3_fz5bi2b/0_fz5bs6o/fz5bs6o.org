  Seamus and Dean met in first year. They were friends. Best friends. The very best of friends, even, and that was how it always would be. The world of magic was a gentle wave and then roiling madness around them, but throughout it all that one thing would never change.From first year to seventh, together or apart, some things were constant.

  Jason's returned to Gotham to find things oddly different, but mostly the same. As he reacquaints himself with the Bats, and as they begin a new case or two, it might just turn out that the Red Hood belonged there all along. Reunions are uncomfortable, but sometimes they just might be worth it.

  No one died in the bowels of Shido's palace; the Phantom Thieves, plus one, took down the ship's captain, the complacent public, the Demiurge itself.But for the conspiracy to be dismantled, someone had to take the fall.Goro spent three years in juvenile hall, unmoored and deserted on a metaphorical island with no ship in sight. He never planned for a future beyond ruining the man who ruined him.(The funny thing about futures is that they have their own way of finding you.)

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

  -Itachi never answers his question. No matter how many times Kisame asks, the words bounce off as though the boy were made of stone.Kisame pretends he doesn't mind. But he always wonders-"Where are you looking with those eyes of yours, Itachi-san?"

#+begin_quote
  What happens when you rewrite a modern fantasy epic to star the brightest witch of her age? Mayhem, magic, and a girl taking charge of her own story as she grows up in an increasingly volatile world. Through twists of the plot and her wand alike, Hermione endeavors to figure out who she is, and maybe also save the world along the way. After all, life as the Chosen One's best friend is far from easy. Book One: Hermione Granger is eleven years old when she receives a letter telling her that she has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, catapulting her into a realm beyond her wildest imaginings. As she adjusts to her new life, she must learn to navigate the struggles of making friends, fighting evil, and, scariest of all, growing up.
