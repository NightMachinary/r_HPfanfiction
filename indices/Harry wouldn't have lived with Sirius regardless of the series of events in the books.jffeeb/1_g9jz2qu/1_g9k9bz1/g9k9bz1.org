Dumbledore was a secret keeper of 12 Grimauld Place when the order started using it as a headquarters. Why he chose not to be a secret keeper of 4 Privet Drive (maybe so not to disrupt the daily life of the Dursleys) or the Potter House is unknown. Likely for drama building but in-world there is no reason given. Lazy writers choose to create a manipulative Dumbledore who for some reason chose to get rid of his equivalent to Lucius Malfoy in order to replace him with an unknown.
