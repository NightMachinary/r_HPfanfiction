Legally, as a godparent, Sirius had no rights towards Harry. Also, Sirius wasn't cleared until after his death in the books, which would have made adoption impossible.

On the other hand, if Sirius managed to clear his name, and adopt Harry, Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to do anything about it. Sure there's the blood ward argument, but 12 Grimmauld Place was under a fidelius charm with Dumbledore as secret keeper, so it would have been a pretty save place for Harry.
