I mean, the usefulness of the blood wards is strongly debateable - it only stops him being harmed by Voldemort and the man was a spirit, plus he had a couple dozen followers that could've Killing Curse'd him at any point on the way to and from school - but you're probably right about the in-world sentiment and trust of Dumbledore. There are a few stories that try break that trust first, usually with Sirius getting the full story of Harry's life and getting pissed that it all happened under Dumbledore's nose, but without that work to change the situation first, I'd probably agree with you.
