I am sure I have read (and thought it logical) a fic where there was a mouth cleaning/refreshing charm, but it was considered a quick convience thing that one might use in a pinch, the same way we use mints/gum or a drink to get rid of a bad taste or feeling. Wizards still have baths and showers and do laundry/dishes - though they have magic to enhance or speed things up - so I suspect that there are variations on toothbrushes. I think they use manual methods for a lot of things because no one wants to set their dishes on fire when washing up in a bad mood, or sleepily scour the inside of their nose instead of cleaning their teeth. There is a lot more margin for error with magic.

A toothbrush that sings and lights up for little kids, grown up ones that do extra things like flossing...

I'm sure Fred and George would also have a line of ones that turned your teeth blue, made your breat smell like farts, or repeatedly bit your face.
