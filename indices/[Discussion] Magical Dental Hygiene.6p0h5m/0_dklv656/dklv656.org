In POA, Hermione does consider buying her parents some Toothflossing Stringmints in Honeydukes. Presumably, those do exactly what it says on the tin, which is flossing your teeth while you eat them.

One thing I have noticed is that even when witches or wizards have a magical method for doing something, it's usually just employing magic to do something manually for them. Like setting dishes to scrub themselves as opposed to just using a spell that instantly cleans them. Or, the stringmints above.

So, I figure that everyday toothcare may involve magical implements that marginally speed up the process or allow a person to do it while focusing on something else (e.g. eating candy to floss your teeth). Anything that would involve pain or discomfort is going to fall under the take a potion category of healing. See cleaning, whitening cavities, etc. Any physical adjustment would involve spell work (e.g. Hermione's buck teeth being shortened). See straightening, aligning, etc.

Although, I imagine that magical folk generally have worse teeth even if the overall fixes are easier, because they don't take the regular precaution of a dentist's visit to catch problems before they necessarily become visible.
