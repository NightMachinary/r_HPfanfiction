Yes and no, there are also spells that do stuff instantly.

For example OotP, see Tonks:

  She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage. 'Scourgify.' A few feathers and droppings vanished.

The same spell can be used differently on humans, James Potter uses it to fill Snape's mouth with soap.

So yeah, it seems to be an weird mix-thing to me.
