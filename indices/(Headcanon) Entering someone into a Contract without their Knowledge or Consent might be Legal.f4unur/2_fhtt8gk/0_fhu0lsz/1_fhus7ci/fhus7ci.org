There was no fine print, since nothing was written at all. It was a verbal agreement: Hermione said, "/So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to,"/ so she did trick them.

So I would call it a magical contract, in the sense that it was an agreement enforced by magic. Any magical contract is, in the end, simply an enchantment that curses whoever breaks the contract. And it was unwillingly entered, since they knew only part of the terms - the obligations, but not the punishments.
