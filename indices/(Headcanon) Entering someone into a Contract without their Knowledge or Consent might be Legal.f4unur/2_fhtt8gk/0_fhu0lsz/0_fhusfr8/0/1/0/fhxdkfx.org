There's consideration - the right to compete and the chance to win the prize. The big problem is the privity issue: the contract is between Barty Crouch Junior and the goblet or whoever it's magical agent for. Contracting for the benefit of a third party is tricky enough - under Scots and English law alike, as I recall, although I've only ever passed exams south of the border - but contracting to impose a burden on a third party is where you've got to go for something /really/ exotic that Harry can't get out of with the utmost of ease.

(I mean, if I /had/ to construct an argument in favour of Harry being bound by the Goblet, it'd be around the idea of Crouch constituting himself as Harry's agent as a matter of fact, with Harry only unaware of his right to disavow the agency through fraud. He'd be entitled to disavow within any reasonable time of him becoming aware of his right to do so, leaving Barty Crouch Jr. liable for performance of the contract or in the alternative to pay whatever penalty the goblet imposes.

It's at moments like this that I'm glad this came out /after/ I passed exams in Contract Law because the people who set those exams at my alma mater were /exactly/ the kinds of bastards who'd use it in setting exam problems. And nerdy enough: there was a question with bloody /Red Dwarf/ references on one of my degree finals papers.
