Hogwarts would be subject to Scots law, though, not English law. Which arguably plays a probably unintended role in the books, as the contract between Harry and the Goblet of Fire is gratuitous and thus not binding under English contract law. Scots law doesn't have the doctrine of consideration, so no problem there!
