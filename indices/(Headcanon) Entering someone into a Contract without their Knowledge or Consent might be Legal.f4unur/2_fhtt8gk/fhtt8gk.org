I don't think Hermione's contract is the best evidence. Complaining about her contract would mean admitting signing it which made you a member of a banned club. Not only would the penalty clauses activate but you'd get in trouble with Umbridge. It might be legal, it might be illegal, but nobody would come forwards about it.
