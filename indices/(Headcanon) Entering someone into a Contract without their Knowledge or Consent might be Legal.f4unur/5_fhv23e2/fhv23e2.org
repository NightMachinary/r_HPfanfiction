You can't bind someone to a contract without their knowledge and consent under modern common-law and civil law theories of contract. Which, bluntly, only go back a few hundred years. There are older theories of contract - even ones that deny an overarching theory of contract entirely like the pre-modern versions of the /ius civile/ - where /consensus ad idem/ is less fundamental to the thing.
