I think /legal/ and /magically sound/ might be two different things.

Is it possible to curse a book, so the reader can't stop reading once they start?\\
Probably, yeah.

Is it legal?\\
Probably not.

Hermione's contract might not be legal, but as long as it's magically sound, the curse will take hold. I think it's rather important to view these things separately.

Why didn't anyone report Hermione?\\
Because snitches get stitches. Literally.
