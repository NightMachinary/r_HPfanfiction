I wrote one a while ago where McGonagall stopped by the Dursley house as a cat to check on Harry and he was gardening, and then he fed her bacon to get her on his good side. I never really went anywhere with it cause I didn't see a point, but it stopped right about the time Petunia started acting like a bitch and then Minerva accidentally grew her animagus form in a supposedly impossible feat of magic and Petunia was suddenly confronted with an eight foot tall cat that loves Harry very much. Her reaction was amusing.
