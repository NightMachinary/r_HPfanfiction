One of the biggest for me is that I have to remember Ginny is supposed to be the love interest. I used to be all about Draco/Ginny back in the day and that ruined my perception from then on. Nowadays, while I prefer a good Harry/Daphne or H/Hr, I will still read any pairing with good writing and plot.
