I recall starting it... But the only really outstanding ASOIAF fanfic I remember is "The bloody wolf of the north", although there are some cute Arya/Aegon VI one-shots and a few decent SI stories around (I love the ones where the SI drives the Industrial Revolution). Sadly that fandom is suffering a deluge of modern/High School AUs and some rather questionable ships involving Sansa.
