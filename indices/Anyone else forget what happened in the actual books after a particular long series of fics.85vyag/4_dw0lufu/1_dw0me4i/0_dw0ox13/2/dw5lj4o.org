Look up A song For Dragons on Ao3. The plot and writing is incredibly good especially after the first two or three chapters. It's over 200k words too if I remember - it's pretty heavily AU too, but it's done very well.

Edit: Also try Dragons of Ice and Fire, and A Coat of Gold on Ao3 they're both long and we'll written too
