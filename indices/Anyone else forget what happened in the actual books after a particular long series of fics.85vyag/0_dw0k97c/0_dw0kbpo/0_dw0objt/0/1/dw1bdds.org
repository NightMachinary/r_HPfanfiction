i wish ff.net would recall which ones i read for me =( too many times i get a chapter or 2 in and go oh yeah its this one that ends up sucking in 50k more words.

Along with a i have read this checkmark it would be nice if there was a rating system or at least a i liked the fic but its not a favorite button.
