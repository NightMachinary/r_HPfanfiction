I watched the movies first. Was never that much into the fantasy world, but then randomly decided to marathon through the whole series in a weekend. Didn't bother with the books because I had lots of other books on the go. Eventually ran into someone who wouldn't stop talking about a fic they were reading - The Accidental Animagus. From there, I read The Arithmancer, then pretty much everything else by White Squirrel. After I ran out of stories, I went to the favourites tab, found the top rated story, and did the same thing. Then repeated over and over and got hooked. Been reading almost nothing but HP fanfics going on 2 years now.
