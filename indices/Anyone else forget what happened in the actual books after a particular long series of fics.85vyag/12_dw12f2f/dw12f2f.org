My last full reread had been around 2013, and I've read a lot since then and collaboratively written quite a bit as well. One of the things I noticed myself (and my current co-writer) do is accidentally bring in things from fics or collaborations that were upgraded to 'headcanon accepted' but even more so, I find myself running through the books frequently to make sure I'm remembering my canon facts correctly and they're not fic distorted or distorted in some other way. A really odd one ended up being Cygnus Black's birth date, which we would have sworn up and down was the same as Orion's but according to the BFT, isn't. I finally remembered the fic it came from.

Our current work is following the Book 5 timeline (for now) and I've been doing a readlong and realising how much I've been impacted by fics and the films by how much is different than I thought. There's been a few random things, for example, fics seem to have a No Muggles Allowed In Magical Spaces but then re-reading to find that one is treated at St. Mungo's at the beginning of HBP. Some are just headcanons neither approved nor disproved in canon that have just snuck in after reading a few fics with them in but it is also really jarring to actually have one directly contradicted in canon and realise I'd remembered it wrong.
