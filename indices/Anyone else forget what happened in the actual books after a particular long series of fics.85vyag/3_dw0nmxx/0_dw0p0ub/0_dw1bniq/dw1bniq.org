I fuckin hate that idea "I cant change anything or it might ruin the timeline" There are a million reasons its a shit piece of reasoning but only 2 i can thing of that it is ok.

1 is that you have knowledge of the future, the more you change the less you know. But you are there to change things so get the big shit out of the way asap and CHANGE things!

2 is that you might be afraid to change peoples relationships or people might not be born but if you think about it (and yeah its just scifi anyway but still) no one would be born the same after time traveling, random chance would change any children born after traveling back.

But even without all of that being an issue we want to read about things being different, not things being the same.
