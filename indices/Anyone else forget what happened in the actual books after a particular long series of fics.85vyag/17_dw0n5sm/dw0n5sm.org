I tend to do that more between the books and movies. I'll forget something that happened in the movie went differently in the book.

I do have favorite fanfiction that has parts I wish were in the canon. But I think there's only been a few times were I was reading canon and looked for a particular scene, only to remember it was in a fanfiction.
