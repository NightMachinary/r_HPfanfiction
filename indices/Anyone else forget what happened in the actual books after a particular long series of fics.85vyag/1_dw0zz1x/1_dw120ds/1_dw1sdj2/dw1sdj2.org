Sometimes if it's long enough I'll read it, only to hit the inevitable end. Then I'm stuck waiting for the next chapter, but usually by the time it's out I've gone through another fic or 2 and I have no idea what that original fic was. So I end up have to read the 60k+ fic AGAIN, only to start the cycle all over again... Or I give up after a chapter for 2.
