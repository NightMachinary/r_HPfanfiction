That's why I don't read anything that isn't marked as complete. I know I must be missing out on some brilliant stuff but I just can't do the 1 chapter a week/month/whatever thing. I love getting stuck into a really long story, I can't bear them not being finished and having to try and get back into the story again later. I do have a few that I get alerts for but only because it's a sequel and I just ignore them and check every so often to see if it's finished yet so I can start reading again.
