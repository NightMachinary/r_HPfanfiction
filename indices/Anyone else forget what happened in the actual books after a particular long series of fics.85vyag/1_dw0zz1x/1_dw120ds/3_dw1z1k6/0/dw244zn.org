Yep, I've actually started checking for that, it's so frustrating when they've done a 1 fic per year thing then given up halfway through GOF. Before I start a new story now, I go to the end of the last chapter and check for an Authors Note mentioning a sequel then go to the authors page and check if any sequels are marked as complete too.
