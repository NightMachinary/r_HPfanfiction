SpaceBattles forums has two that I like very much:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff?]]: an SI OC who, as the title suggests, gets sorted into Hufflepuff. She is +prevented by the reincarnation magic from telling anyone what she knows about canon+ *paranoid*, so she has to fix things herself. Updates slowly but regularly.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][Perks of Survival]]: SI reincarnates into Sally-Anne Perks, the girl who in canon is named at the sorting but never showed up for the OWLs---and we have no idea why. The SI sets out to /not die/, and, with this sort of attitude, gets sent straight to Slytherin. Last updated in 2015, so probably abandoned.
