Most of these are oneshots,but:

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]: “Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying.” Fluff with light angst. Has a great trio portrayal, and is pretty sweet. (Can be read as gen or Harry/Hermione/Ron, Shortfic) linkao3(9191315)
2. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]: “A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.”

A great trio friendship oneshot I loved.(Gen, Oneshot) linkao3(15275916)

1. for as long as you need us: A post-war fic where Harry turns to his two best friends to help him survive the losses of the war. A great fic, with a heartbreaking plot twist. (Harry/Hermione/Ron, Oneshot) linkao3(16957743)

4.A Clean Shave: “In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.”

Edit: Added the link for the first two fics as the bot doesn't seem to be working.
