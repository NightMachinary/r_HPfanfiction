  before the shitstorm that Hogwarts created
#+end_quote

Trying to change the dynamics of that shitstorm. He'd be healthier if he weren't relentlessly bullied and had some measure of control over his environment. I argued it wouldn't escalate with the Marauders bc he wouldn't have first interacted with James and Sirius, nor would James have targeted him bc of Lily. Severus first responded to James when he made a snide comment about Slytherin and Sirius joined in, I don't think he'd just walk up to a group of popular four boys and provoke them, he'd be more sensible. Lily and Severus' relationship is obviously hugely important to the characters/narrative, but it can develop in a different dynamic. And they don't have to be torn apart. They can start apart, and glue together.
