JKR said that Snape's relationship with Lily was a factor in James' behaviour to him. Snape came into the compartment because of Lily, where J & S were. No Lily, different compartment, they never cross paths, never clash over Slytherin, no 'Snivellus'. Yeah they dislike Slyths, but they singled out Snep. No reason to suggest that wouldn't change if you change the scenario.
