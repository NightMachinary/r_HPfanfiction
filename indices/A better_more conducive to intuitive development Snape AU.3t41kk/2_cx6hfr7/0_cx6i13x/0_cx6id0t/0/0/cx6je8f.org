Later on, not at the beginning. James and Sirius cared nothing about Lily at that point. It was house rivalry bullshit and childish name calling at first. When James started zeroing on Lily did that layer to the animosity was added. Hogwarts was meant to be a haven from the hell that was Severus' home where Lily was his only beacon of hope, instead it drowned him. Perhaps without Hogwarts, Severus might have been different. Then again, if James and Sirius hadn't been pricks, perhaps things would be different.

There are too many variables in the equation that lead to canon events. The childhood friendship was happiness, why take that away?
