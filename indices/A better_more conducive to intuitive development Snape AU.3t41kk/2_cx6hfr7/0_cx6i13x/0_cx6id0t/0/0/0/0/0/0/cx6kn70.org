It was his desire to fit in and desire to protect himself and perhaps wanting to know more about magic that lead him to the dark arts, plus the pureblood idiots he was housed with.

His childhood friendship was innocence and gave him hope, but circumstances led to it's break. Regardless, he still had love, he still loved and though it caused him great pain, Severus would go back and change to just remain at Lily's side. Without that childhood connection, I think Severus would be lost. Sure he talk about his home life, he felt ashamed by it and of course he didn't want to tell her that she would face prejudice because of blood, he didn't want to ruin it for her. Lily was a saving grace for him.
