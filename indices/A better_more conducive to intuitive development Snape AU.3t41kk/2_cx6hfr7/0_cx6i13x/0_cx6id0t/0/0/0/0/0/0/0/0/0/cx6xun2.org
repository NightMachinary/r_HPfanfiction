We're arguing in circles. She was his first friend, because of circumstance. Nothing suggests he wouldn't have made other friends. She was his only true friend, yet they couldn't communicate because of their massive differences, and his relationship with her likely isolated him because of what it caused. Magic gave him hope to escape from his family. His ambitions ran counter to Lily, and he didn't want to give them up initially, even for her. Clinging to a singular childhood friendship when you're drifting apart isn't healthy. Don't romanticise their relationship. The only reason he's dependent on her, is /because/ of his relationship with her. He wouldn't have closed himself off, he was already hopeful before Lily, and made friends in Slytherin. /He/ pursued her. We don't ever really see her pursuing him for his own sake or being supportive of him. You're not examining the consequences of their experiences. Hogwarts was a second hell /only/ because of J & S and all the frustration his relationship with Lily caused, which was /because/ of their relationship. He'd choose her, because his life and circumstance made him emotionally dependent on/obsessed with her.
