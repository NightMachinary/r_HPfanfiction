Lol. Mate. Those one/two years aren't that much. He'd find people at Hogwarts soon enough. Like I said, his friendship with Lily arguably /ruined/ his childhood, not improved it. His relationship with Lily set him up to be crushed/disappointed. He'd find Slytherin friends. He needs space to pursue who he wants to be (a Dark wizard), around people he chooses to associate with, in an environment he can control. He /couldn't/ share everything with Lily, and they held on to their relationship until they couldn't communicate and it became toxic. She also wasn't very supportive of him, even from the beginning.
