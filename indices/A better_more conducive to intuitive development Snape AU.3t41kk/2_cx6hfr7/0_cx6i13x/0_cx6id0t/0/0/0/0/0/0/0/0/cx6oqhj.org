Riiiight. He had his first friend in Lily, actually his only true friend for quite some time. Magic gave him a way out of his home, Lily gave him hope that he is worth something. It was their pride and naivety that drove them apart. Severus was an insecure young man who just wanted to be worthy of his existence and he had that as a child with Lily. Love is a great and terrible feeling, with the love Severus had for Lily it was a blessing and burden. It truly shaped him, take that foundation before Hogwarts and he just might have closed himself off from everything.

Severus wanted to be a Slytherin not for the propaganda but for what the house stood for, those with cunning and ambition. What his original ambition was, we do not know, but it probably involved keeping Lily in his life as that he wanted her in the same house.

If given a second chance, Sevwrus would choose Lily. That shows just how important she is to him. Their friendship, her being apart of his life made it worthwhile. I believe he would be emotional stunted without their childhood friendship. With her, he began to learn, though regardless he is a prickly fellow.

You are disregarding other factors that make up his character, other people who shape him. Lily showed him love and hope, during a crucial development stage. Severus came from a neglectful and most likely abusive home. Lily was his sun, a reason to hope for a better day. Magic was a means of escape. This was for the betterment. Hogwarts is was suppose to be wonderment for the both of them, instead it became a second hell, but it wasn't their friendship that did them in, it was what they let others fill their heads with and do that help sever them. Severus wouldn't be the character he is without ALL of his life experiences.
