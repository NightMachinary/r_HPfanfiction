Magic was his beacon of hope. He liked Lily, but he'd still derive happiness from magic, and he'd associate with his other like-minded Slytherins. And I'm not saying his relationship w/ Lily has to be taken away, just that it would come later. Instead of breaking apart, they can come together, so happiness in the long term. I'm not sure what you disagree with, exactly? The reason Hogwarts was bad for him was because of J & S, which began circumstantially. We don't know how long James crushed on Lily, and you can say it also encouraged them that he associated with a Gryff, a member of their house, so they'd see him around, which would spur on their bullying. And Lily's Gryff friends don't like him, nor he them, so they'd talk/argue about him, again fueling the fire for their bullying. This AU makes things exponentially better for him.

And I'd argue their friendship causes more emotional frustration/damage to him in the long run, because of everything mentioned. I'm not sure why you'd prefer him to be bullied and eternally unhappy at the lack of closure his relationship with Lily caused. It ruined his life.
