Magic gave him hope, not Lily. Lily was just circumstantial. He liked the Dark Arts, because they represented power. He was always going to be in Slytherin anyway, so always influenced that way. He's always going to be capable of love, that wouldn't change just because Lily isn't in the picture? I'm not sure how you can claim his relationship with Lily was good for him, at any point in his life. It permanently stunted his emotional growth, and lead to frustration when his romantic feelings weren't reciprocated while she associated with people that were abusive to him. How would he be lost? What did she do for him? She constantly criticised his Dark Arts, and like I said, his relationship with her catalysed a lot of his abuse, effectively isolating him. He would have made other friends without her.
