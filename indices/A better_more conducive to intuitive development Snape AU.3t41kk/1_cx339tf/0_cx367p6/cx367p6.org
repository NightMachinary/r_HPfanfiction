I meant that they have fundamental differences and wouldn't be friends otherwise save for in that specific scenario. Not unlike Albus and Gellert. Their relationship was based on grandiose idealism and mutual genius, but it was divorced from the reality of the other's methods/personalities. The more they (Sev & Lily) ignored those differences, the more it built up to eventually combust when they were put into a different social context. It was more in response to all of the fic. I see that change an element in canon, that usually start from the same places. 'What if Lily forgave Snape after SWM'. Why would she? At that point they can't communicate at all. You'd have to have Snape drop all the social infrastructure he has and make a complete 180. Also, that's boring. 'AU where Lily and Harry survive, but James dies and they get together'. Again, not emotionally intuitive. Just like 'AU where Dumbledore forgives Grindelwald for Crucio'ing Aberforth' makes zero sense. 'AU where, on his death bed, Snape is thrown back into the past'. There are so many things wrong with that I can't list them. The point of an AU is that circumstances can change, but characters can't. Best friends--> broken trust/enemies--> lovers isn't intuitive. Best friends to lovers is a trope that usually requires trust, stability and fluff, none of which are things I associate with Snep.
