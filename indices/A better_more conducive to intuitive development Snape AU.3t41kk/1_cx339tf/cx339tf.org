This is a great idea. However, there are some things I'd like to be clarified...

What do you mean by "bonding over magic and Hogwarts in the abstract"? By this I understand that this relationship is purely borne out of necessity, with a newbie witch needing guidance, and okay with whatever source it comes from- like the weirdo Snape kid from the other side of town.

Also, your entire post seems to be a rough summary of an epic re-imagining of canon that you want to read, complete with a wonderful marriage of Arcane Might and muggle science in the style of not-so-snobby HPMOR.
