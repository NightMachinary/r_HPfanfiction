It's an interesting idea. I actually really like it.

Another option I'm using in the story I'm writing, Severus never really had the feud with the Marauders because James wasn't a jealous weirdo in my fic. James just knows Lily, at least in the beginning, as that annoying redheaded prefect. I still can't decide whether I want Severus to be protective of Lily because he had feelings for her or because they have a brother/sister type of relationship. In my experience, most relationships with someone you know from that young of an age are closer to Brother/sister than romantic partner. I have a best friend who lived across the street from me growing up and we've always seen each other as a brother/sister type of thing.
