I never bothered to read the original English books and the last time I dived into my native books has been 10 years ago, roughly.

I just finished reading the first book and I must say: wow. It was bad. Probably like my phrasing back in middle school when I was getting started on English as my third language. While the storytelling is okay for the first book, it is nowhere as great as I expected it to be. -

I also think that the story was supposed way darker, but alot had to be cut out for the final release as it was supposed to be a childs story. Nobody expected it to hit off as well as it had.
