Bashing!Draco. Bashing!Luna. Bashing!Voldemort. Good!Weasleys. Evil!Slytheryns. Plot holes, such as forgetting about magical cores. Author mixes up the functions of different spells (ie. Harry uses Expelliarmus to kill Voldemort...). Inadequate character descriptions (ie. Harry's eyes are merely described as being green like his mother's. Left out the most important part that they're EMERALD AVADA-KEDAVRA green. How else could he be MoD and attract all those girls like Romilda Vane? It just doesn't make sense without it. Plot hole.). Magically weak Harry. Pairing feels kind of random and underdeveloped. Good grammar. Long AND complete!!!
