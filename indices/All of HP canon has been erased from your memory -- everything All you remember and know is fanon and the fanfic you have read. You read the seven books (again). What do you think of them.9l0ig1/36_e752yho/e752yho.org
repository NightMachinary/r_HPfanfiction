Where did you lose your spine, Harry? Do you have one single thought of your own in your head?

Canon Harry is a flobberworm. He wants to be an Auror because a Death Eater gave him the idea. After the war he starts working for the Ministry, the same ministry that worked so hard against him, a ministry that at best is merely corrupt and incompetent.

Why did Hermione marry Ron after years of ridicule because she did homework and wanted to learn something? Opposites may attract, but that's just ridiculous. They have /nothing/ in common except Harry as a friend. The fact that they bicker like an old couple is not a good thing, it means that marriage is doomed to fail.
