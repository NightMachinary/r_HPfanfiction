It's mostly because of my short attention span. Books, you need to go to libraries or bookstores to find stuff you like, and while they're organized by genres they aren't really... Tagged? If I want to find stuff like time travel or soulmates or magic it's really hard unless I google. Fanfics are tagged, so you know exactly what you're getting into before getting into the time sink of reading. The review section is literally a click away to skim if this is a good read or not. Plus, since fanfics generally assume that you know what's going on, they tend to go straight to the point instead of giving me exposition about the world. Then if I grow attached to these characters, boom I can just click on the tags of the fic and look for similar stories with the same characters in an instant. Books, unless the fandom is huge, I'd get attached to the characters but then never see them again, and it's kind of sad.

... That said, I don't recommend reading fanfics before the Canon. My friends get really mad when I do that.
