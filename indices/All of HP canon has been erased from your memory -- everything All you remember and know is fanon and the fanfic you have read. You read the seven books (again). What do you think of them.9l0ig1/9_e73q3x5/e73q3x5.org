This is kinda me, since I've been reading a ton of Harry Potter fanfiction without watching / reading the Canon. Its kind of hard to get into because I already know what happens, but I like how the first chapters have a lot of childlike wonder the fanfics are missing, which is great. But it also feels so empty, like reading a summary, because fanfics like to cram so many details in.
