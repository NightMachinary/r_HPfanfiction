Jesus Rowling made Harry into a gutless wonder, how could anyone expect a boy who was scared of his own shadow to do anything! Sure the quiet hero and all that but jeez! He only got by on luck! Meanwhile we have Neville over here, standing up for what's right and cutting a snakes head off.... A snake who used to be a woman! How metal is that! Neville basically cut a woman's head off with a fkn sword!
