Remus marries a WOMAN?! Sirius DIES?! Tonks dies OFFSCREEN and we rarely see her in action at all?!

On a broader note, I actually think coming from fanon, canon would feel really mean to Harry. Everything goes bad for that kid until he's an adult really, and then he has all the combined and compound trauma to deal with. Of course JKR had Doylist reasons for doing that, but still, sheesh. I feel like a lot of fanon gives him more tools or balance to deal with his situation or certain aspects of it, unless it's an overblown grimdark AU.
