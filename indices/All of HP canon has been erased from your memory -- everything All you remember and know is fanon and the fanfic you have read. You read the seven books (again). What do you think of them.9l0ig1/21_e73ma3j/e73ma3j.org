Books one through four I would consider god tier fanfiction, /definitely good enough for printing/. Books five would be still good but I'd dislike the shift in tone, because wasn't I reading kiddie fiction? Fuck off with all the YA angst (it didn't bother me back then because I was exactly at the age when my tastes were switching from children lit to YA, but it sure would bother me now). Book six I would probably finish, but between the pairings and the ending I'd probably dislike it enough not to even bother with book seven, which would get dropped pretty fucking quick regardlessly, totally jumped the shark with that one.
