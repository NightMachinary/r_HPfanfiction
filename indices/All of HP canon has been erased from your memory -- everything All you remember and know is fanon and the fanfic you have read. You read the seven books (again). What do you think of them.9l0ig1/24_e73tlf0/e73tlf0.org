Well, looks like we have incompetent adults again.

And an incompetent Ministry. Oh, it's also corrupt as hell.

Why didn't Harry go with a girl he actually liked? Cho likes Cedric, so what? There's plenty of other fish in the sea. And if he went with Parvati, why did he ignore her. That was such a self-cockblock.

Why is there so much set-up for bashing (Molly, Lupin, Dumbledore, Snape) and yet no follow-up?

Well, instant romance 2/10. Also, what the fuck is the author smoking, taking and drinking to come up with these pairings?

Wait, so Lupin ran from his wife - Why didn't Harry score her then?

And wow, how could they fuck up the Horcrux hunt that badly? They have to know about supermarkets, right?

So they take Ron back, just like that? 0/10, spineless protagonists.

Why didn't Harry just shoot Voldemort? Or at least suicide bombed the Death Eater camp? He could have easily stabbed Bellatrix from under the cloak.

Wait, that's it? Where was the sex scene?
