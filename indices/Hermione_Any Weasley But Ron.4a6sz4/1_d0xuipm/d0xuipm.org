While I have no /actual/ recommendations, let alone ones that are long and well-written, this request made me curious. I asked myself, are there any Hermione/Molly fics out there? And therefore, I decided to ruin my mind by finding out. A cursory FFN search has informed me that the answer is yes.

And they are:

linkffn(Second Chance, Prewett by SilverFoxen)

linkffn(Serendipity by Sela McGrane)

linkffn(Colder Weather by drippingwithsin) I don't think I've ever seen a more appropriate author name.

linkffn(One Big Gay Weasley Family by architect 2010) And I think this one wins my "I Hate this title more than any other" award.

And if you'll excuse me, I need to go and find a way to remove this knowledge from my brain, before madness claims me.
