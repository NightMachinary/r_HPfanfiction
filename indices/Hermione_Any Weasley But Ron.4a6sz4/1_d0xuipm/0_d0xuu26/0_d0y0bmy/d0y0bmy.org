Further research has restored my faith in the possibility of good existing in the human soul when a search of FFN has found 0 Hermione/Victoire pairings, 0 Hermione/Fred II, 0 Hermione/Dominque, 0 Hermione/Hugo, 0 Hermione/Louis, 0 Hermione/Lucy, 0 Hermione/Muriel (though not a Weasley even though FFN claims she is, I had to check this possibility), and only 5 Hermione/Arthur.

Sadly, that hope was dashed by the existence of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10000910/1/Is-this-really-how-it-is][this fic]]

EDIT: Almost forgot a couple. 0 Hermione/Roxanne, 0 Hermione/Molly II.
