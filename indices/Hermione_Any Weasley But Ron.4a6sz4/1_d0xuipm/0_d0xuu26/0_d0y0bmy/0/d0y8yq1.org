  Sadly, that hope was dashed by the existence of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10000910/1/Is-this-really-how-it-is][this fic]]

I think that pairing for the fic was a misclick by the author, possibly clicking Rose instead of Ron Weasley's name. Because there's no mention of Rose anywhere in said fic (or so control+f tells me). So /hopefully/ the count remains at zero for that particular pairing.
