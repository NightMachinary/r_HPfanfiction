In general, I remember both Inell and atruwriter having decent quality Weasley/Hermione fics. Lots of one-shots, but you know, you take what you can get with this kind of rarepair. ;)

The books_freckles LJ community is also worth a look (and you don't need to have a livejournal to read fic recs): [[http://books-freckles.livejournal.com/]]

-->I found one post on this LJ community called "the ultimate Fred/Hermione fic listing" which might be of interest: [[http://books-freckles.livejournal.com/458364.html]] (can't attest to the quality of all the fics, but it's a good place to start)

Also, a Hermione/Fred/George fic:

Now you have me looking for Hermione/Bill fics instead of working on my thesis...whoops. I'll report back if I find any great ones.
