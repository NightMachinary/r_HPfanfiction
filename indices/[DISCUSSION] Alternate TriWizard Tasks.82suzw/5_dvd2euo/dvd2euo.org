One alternate task I've seen done a few times is a broom race with lots of course hazards. That or something similar is a good choice I think.

Another simple one is a talent competition where champions have to impress the judges with some sort of magical performance routine.

Dueling competitions are commonly used if not all that creative. Though I've seen them done with extra rules added on to make them more challenging and interesting.

A Jeopardy!-type magical trivia challenge is a viable option. Though I'd try to add some sort of extra game-show-style extreme twist to it to spice it up.

Some sort of magical puzzle/obstacle course a la the philosopher's stone protections or a generic dungeon dive would be good.

How about something like in the Fastastic Beasts movie where the champions all have to track and capture a bunch of magical creatures in a fake town while competing against each other and trying to minimize damage.
