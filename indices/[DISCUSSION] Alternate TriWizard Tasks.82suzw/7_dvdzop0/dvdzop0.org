I've actually designed three before for a writing site I own. I had a replica pyramid, with Indiana Jones style traps. A clue had to be solved to work out which item they had to retrieve ad then get out in one piece with it. The bricks were like one-way glass, so that they could be seen but not see out.

I'm struggling to remember the second. - I'll try to look it up. - The third was a maze of some sort again, but in the forest and they had to find and stick as closely to a randomly chosen route as possible. The further they deviated from it, the more points they lost. I suppose either one could work for Earth. Unless you wanted to put a Pyramid under water and call it Atlantis, I guess.

Otherwise... water in the US... Hm. Everglades? Mutant alligators? Horned Serpents live in rivers, that could be useful?
