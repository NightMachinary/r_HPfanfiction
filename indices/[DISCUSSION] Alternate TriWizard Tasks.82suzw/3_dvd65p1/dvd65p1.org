Well if you want to make it a mental and magical test for Water instead of being in water. They could enter a giant room made of ice and magically cold. The center of the room has an indentation for a sapphire, but they have to find the correct blue gem in order to pass the task.

The twist is if water goes through the indentation it seals it and they fail. So spamming fire would fail the task. They need to be creative to find and get to the gem while also being careful not to die themselves since warming charms would melt the ice beneath their feet. The timer would be how long they can stand the cold.

...

For earth? Hmm... You could invert my first idea. A flat field with a topaz floating a good distance above. They now have to get to it using the earth beneath their feet. No flight or Spells allowed. They have to physically get to Gem to properly claim it. Growing plants or controlling earth or something creative. No floating a big rock while standing on it.

Unfortunately the more earth you use there are hidden golems and mines and such. That react when the earth near them is disturbed.
