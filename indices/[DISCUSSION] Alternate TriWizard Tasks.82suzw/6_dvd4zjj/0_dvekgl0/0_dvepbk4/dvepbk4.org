Maybe a less structured form and more every mage for themselves? Oh, idea!

A game somewhat similar to Capture the Flag, with 13 flag type items. The one with the most when time is called wins. But they're extremely fragile, and the play area has a bunch of Earth type beasts to mess with the contestants/"flags".

Or if you wanna do it with Water, have them dissolve very easily. That one would probably be better. I think. You decide.
