Water- they could have to retrieve something from a sunken pirate ship. With ghosts and nasty things guarding it.

Granted, that's a pretty American task, not British-themed....

Reenact the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada? Swim to France across the channel? Ooh what about retrieving weaponry from ponds a la Merlin/Deathly Hallows?
