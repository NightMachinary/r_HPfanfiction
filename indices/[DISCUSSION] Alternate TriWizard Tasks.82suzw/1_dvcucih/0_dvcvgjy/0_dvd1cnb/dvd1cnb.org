Oh cool!

You could do tasks set in different parts of the USA- the air task in the desert or prairie, the water task in the Great Lakes (or the Louisiana/Florida wetlands, but the Lakes are better for underwater tasks), the earth task in a mountain range, and the fire task in a forest with controlled forest fires. The USA has enormous ecological diversity compared to Britain and I don't think it's featured in fics much.

The USA is enormous in size and very unpopulated compared to Britain too, so all tasks could be very spread out over large rural areas without tons of concealment spells.

Bonus- It would be hilarious if some of the contestants stumbled on a modern day US â€˜militia' training with assault weapons in the USA heartland and had to obliviate a bunch of armed muggles already prone to conspiracy theories and they accidentally started a new conspiracy featured on the Totally Not Fox News channel.
