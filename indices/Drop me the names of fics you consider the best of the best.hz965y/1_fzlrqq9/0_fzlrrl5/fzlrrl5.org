  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Dora allows it, because she thinks it's sex. That's what Remus tells her, tells himself, tries to tell Sirius. It's physical, and only that, something the wolf needs and needs to take but not something Remus needs, oh no. Remus suspects that deep down ― or possibly not even that deep ― Dora knows that it's more, knows that Sirius is under Remus's skin and inside his bones in a way that one fuck a month can't even begin to sate. But if she has more to say on the matter, she has yet to say it. Remus knows enough about repression to guess that silence doesn't really mean there isn't something to say, and the weight of that feels heavy enough to bury him.
