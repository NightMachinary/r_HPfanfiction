All I have are slashfics but this first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes) Marvel crossover

One of the best Harry/Voldemort fics out there. Harry and Voldemort share their dreamscape. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic and Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom Riddle pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini) This series. I linked the first work. I love the characterization.

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers. Harry jumps dimensions as the MoD and starts to work as a Medium in the Sherlock universe
