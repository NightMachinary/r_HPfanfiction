This is the first in a three story series that focuses on female Harry and in my opinion is absolutely fantastic. It is very lesbian and has mature content so be warned before going in. It dives into interesting magic, is very feminist, and does one of my favorite takes on a female Harry so I cannot recommend this enough.
