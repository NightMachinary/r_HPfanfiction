That's a good series to recommend, but needs more detail :). The summary is correct but doesn't really sell it; it sounds like something ordinary and straightforward, just retelling canon with a girl in the boys' dorm, when actually it's clever and complex and goes far off the rails. It felt like the more I read, the more layers of the story unfolded. New and creative dangers to face each year, with much higher stakes than canon (the gauntlet protecting the Stone has nothing on /this/ first year). Deeper exploration of branches of magic, especially potions. Bringing the back alleys behind Knockturn to life. A more cunning and less sociopathic antagonist who is both more and less of a threat; he's not aiming for mass murder, but he's not Mr Nice Guy either, and he already has a body (he never lost it) and extensive political influence.

Even the basic "Alanna the Lioness" premise is further complicated by the fact that they have to return home every summer and switch back for months. Which leads to all sorts of tangles, especially when they don't just keep their heads down and put life on pause during that time. It was a really gripping read and I'm looking forward to the next chapter of book 4.
