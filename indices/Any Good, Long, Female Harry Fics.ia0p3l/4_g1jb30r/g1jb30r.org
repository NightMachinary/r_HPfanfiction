I posted this yesterday for a long fic recommendation!

A good long read that I enjoy is linkao3(536450) at 550k. Has a sequel in progress. It's written by someone formally trained in writing, and it shows. Quality of prose is incredible. Just as a note, the main ‘pairing' doesn't happen in this fic or even the sequel yet, it's tagged for future purposes but the fics been going since 2012 and it hasn't happened so far, so it's pretty much genfic. (Fem!harry/Snape. )

The opening paragraph is what hooked me and pretty much sets the standard of prose and heavy imagery for the whole series:

“Summer lay thick across Hogwarts, the sunlight like butter. Hagrid was reporting a record number of bowtruckle births; Sprout had gone to holiday in Egypt; Minerva was up to her whiskers in preparations for the upcoming term. Dumbledore spent the time being inscrutable and mysterious, but that was so typical of him it was hardly worth remarking.”

I love it. It focuses on genuine friendships between Harriet and others, and also very convincingly follows her growing up, including the psychological development of teenagers, like learning to manage anger, emotions, connecting with others, opening up to others and encouraging others to do the same. No bashing. Nobody is OP. Nobody is OOC. As an aside, I often don't like Lupin/Sirius Black fics because it's over the top but this fic presented it in a really age sensitive and background sort of way that I appreciated. Thoughtful, wholesome, carefully thought out and idk, rich characters written in genuinely convincing ways. I hope you like it. I sure did.
