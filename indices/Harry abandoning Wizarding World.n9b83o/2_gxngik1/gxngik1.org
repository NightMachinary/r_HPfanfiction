There's a story that I can't remember the name of wherein: Auror Ron and Professor Hermione are assigned to "introduce" muggleborn to the Wizarding World. Harry's wife and daughter are home but he isn't. They refuse to attend Hogwarts and then the mother is obliviated. The daughter is kidnapped. The daughter has a magical protector of sorts and they're all trained shaman or something? Anyway, Harry comes home and goes to Hogwarts to get his daughter and winds up taking at least one other kidnapped muggleborn (maybe Dudley's daughter?).
