If you don't want to make it cliche, *create another environment, rather than the same-old Hogwarts or Department of Mysteries.* (That's /way/ too overdone - I'm not sure why people are suggesting that.) Look up mystical "places" in the real world, or create your own. Stonehenge. Some ruins Harry might be exploring, perhaps. Atlantis, maybe? That's been done before, though. An ancient crypt. Perhaps a relic of WW2 that's been preserved in time, somehow? A stray magical "field" or artifact Harry might come across in his travels around the world.

The key being - don't use the normal HP fanfiction universe and location. It's awfully restrictive in what you can do and plan for. If you create your own "magical" location, though, you have the entire world open for access when you write your fic - something that might become /very/ useful when writing a fic in a time period with /international/ conflict.

Try reading these for some ideas on creating a post-WW environment, once you've had your starting point done - some of the best WW1/WW2 time travel fics out there.

In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?/

The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend./
