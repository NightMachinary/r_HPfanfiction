That's a great idea!

A central problem I've noted with many fanfics that don't make it "to the top" is that they are a bit too restrictive when it comes to world, location, history, culture. They keep the entire fanfic in one or two countries, barely mentioning anything about any other nations, communities, conflicts. But the few fanfictions that do - it makes you truly feel like you are in a world with a /global/ history.

 

For an example of what I'm talking about, read joe's acclaimed Wastelands of Time. He takes advantage of the fact that the wizarding community exists around the world, and throughout history - so he comes up with some truly amazing imagery, plot lines, and history for his fic. It adds another dimension, another layer of depth. It doesn't seem easy to pull off, but if you /can/ manage to do it - to expand upon the canon world and make it something cooler - then it pays dividends.

It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time./

 

On another note, try visiting the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][*Dark Lord Potter forums*]], for ideas. You can put your story up there, too, in the forums - I've seen writers often do this in order to have avid fanfiction readers (and writers - almost everyone who has a story in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][*DLP C2*]] is on the forum) review and comment on a chapter-by-chapter basis (or even part-chapter basis).

Edit: You could try taking a page from Magicks of the Arcane for creating a vast, dynamic, and amazing world. The author truly does that aspect well. Also another great read, if you want ideas.
