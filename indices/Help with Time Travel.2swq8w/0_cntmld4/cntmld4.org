Have it work from the other end. Gellert Grindelwald does some complicated ritual and it either goes really wrong or has unexpected results. This ends up summoning Harry from the future. The Deathly Hallows could be involved* -- Grindelwald was trying to summon them or some such.

Maybe Grindelwald tries to summon to him the closest one using the Wand, intending to get the Stone, but Harry wearing the Cloak at some point in the future turns out to be the /physically/ if not /temporally/ closet Hallow. They both show up, antics ensue.

This helps introduce the setting and jumps right into things without being too cheesy.
