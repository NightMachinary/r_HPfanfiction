  I'm really searching for another underdog main character who is able to pass the challenges it faces because they are able to examine what magic can do and its potential and exploits it without caring for other peoples' feelings (except their friends).

I recommend linkffn(7613196) Pureblood Pretense + sequels. Fits what you're looking for regarding exploring the potential of magic and exploiting it, although Harry is much less ruthless than Valeria, and generally tries to resolve her conflicts non-violently.
