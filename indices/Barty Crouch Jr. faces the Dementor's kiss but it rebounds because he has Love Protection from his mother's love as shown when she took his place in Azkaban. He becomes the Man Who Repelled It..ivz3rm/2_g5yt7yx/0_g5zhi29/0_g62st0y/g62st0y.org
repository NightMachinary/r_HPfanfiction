He was truly his most loyal and capable. I like to imagine the second prophecy being about Barty escaping the clutches of his father, because I prefer, when all characters are operating with the knowledge they're supposed to have and are reasonably competent, that he gathers allies and brings back Voldemort earlier. If everyone was actually following their character goals, Voldemort would be back waaaaay sooner (and you don't necessarily have to have a revival ritual in the way it was done).

As it is in canon, it seems like Barty broke the Imperius, happened upon a wrecked truckload of alcohol and polyjuice and formed a plan.

It didn't even seem like he was in contact with the others, at least not much, since he was so insistent on getting Harry's perspective of Voldemort's reaction.

Barty wanted validation over everything, and godamn is that sad.
