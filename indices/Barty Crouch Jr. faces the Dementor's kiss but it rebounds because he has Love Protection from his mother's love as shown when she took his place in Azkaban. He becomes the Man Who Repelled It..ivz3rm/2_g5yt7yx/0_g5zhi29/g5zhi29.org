I think Barty Jr. might be the only death eater voldemort might have actually cared about.

Voldemort even mentioned Bartys issues with his dad, which means that voldemort must have known about those issues and cared enough to remember.

I imagine voldemort must have been livid when he heard barty had been killed as barty was his most loyal and capable servant.
