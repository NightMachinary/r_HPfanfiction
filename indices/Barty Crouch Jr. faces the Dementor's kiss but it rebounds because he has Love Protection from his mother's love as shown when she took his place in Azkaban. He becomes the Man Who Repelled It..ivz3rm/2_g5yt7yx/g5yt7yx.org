Barty Jr. is a real tragic character and rife for more exploration, IMO. There seems to be so few stories that really explore his talent, and canon sells him way short on the decision-making front while simultaneously painting him as a prodigy.

Here's a guy who somehow broke the Imperius, ambushed and captured one of the most notoriously paranoid and competent Aurors, somehow got his hands on gallons of Polyjuice, /taught Defense Against the Dark Arts while impersonating said Auror/ under the watchful eye of /Albus Percival Wulfric Brian/ Fucking /Dumbledore/ no less, engineered the confunding of an ancient artifact to the end of getting a 4th-year Harry Potter to win the whole damn tournament, *also while his dad was overseeing the tournament*, only to be concerned that when Harry returned with the cup that his old boss had successfully returned and that he didn't hate Barty.... like dude knew he was going to be caught and just repeatedly asked Harry about details on who Voldemort's fave-five were.

Oh yeah, and all this after being in Azkaban + under the Imperius curse for years. Which, admittedly, might have addled him a bit, but it certainly didn't take away from his competency.

Like, holy shit. I don't think /anyone/ on team-Voldemort was nearly as successful in getting shit done as this guy. He's like if Hermione had gone full dark-mode but had a lifetime passion for acting, in relative terms. He's the perfect spy / sleeper-agent if you needed one. He pulled off being Mad-Eye Moody better than Mad-Eye himself.

On top of all that, he doesn't seem to show any remorse to the fate of his mother or father, if I recall (can't really blame him much on the dad-front).

It's pretty tragic that such a dynamic and competent villain was reduced to being Kissed by a scared Fudge.
