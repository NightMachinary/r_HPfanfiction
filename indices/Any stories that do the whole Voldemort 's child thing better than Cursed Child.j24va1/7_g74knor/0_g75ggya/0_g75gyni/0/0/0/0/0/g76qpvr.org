That is such a Flamel thing to do.

I read one where there was a secret research society of immortals. They all had their own way of becoming immortals and they just researched whatever they really wanted. Dabbled in money making to fund their research but most of them just wanted to find cures to diseases and such. Quite and interesting take.
