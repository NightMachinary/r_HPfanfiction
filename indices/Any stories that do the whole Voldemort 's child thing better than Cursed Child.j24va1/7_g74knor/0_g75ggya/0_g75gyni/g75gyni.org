I read one fic where what you said was the whole purpose of a horcrux. That all of Voldemorts attempts to create a horcrux only created cursed objects and only the Accidental creation of the one in Harry allowed him to cheat death.

Originally the first horcrux was used in ancient Egypt where the Pharaoh put a horcrux in his own son and when he was too old, committed ritual suicide and then bonded with the horcrux in the son and killed the host soul. He did that over and over, but eventually made the mistake of the Gaunts and married incestually until a child was born as a squib and wasn't able to hold onto the horcrux and then died.

Voldemort didn't know this and didn't know he could do that as he also thought putting his soul in objects was keeping him alive, so he worked on reviving himself in another way.
