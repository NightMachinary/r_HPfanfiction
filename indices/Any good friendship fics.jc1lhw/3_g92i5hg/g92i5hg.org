linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso) has a looooot of angst and abuse but the friendship between the Golden Trio is so sweet. I usually can't take overly abusive Dirlseys or overly self-sacrificing Harry but idk something about this fic got me.

linkffn(The Best Revenge) has a lot of great friendships and Hufflepuff Harry being friends with people he wasn't friends with in canon.
