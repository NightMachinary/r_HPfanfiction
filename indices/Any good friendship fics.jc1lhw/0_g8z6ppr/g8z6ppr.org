I would categorize [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] as more of a mystery slice of life, but it could definitely suit your needs. No pressing overarching plot, just Harry and Hermione solving a small mystery in the castle together. Hope you enjoy!
