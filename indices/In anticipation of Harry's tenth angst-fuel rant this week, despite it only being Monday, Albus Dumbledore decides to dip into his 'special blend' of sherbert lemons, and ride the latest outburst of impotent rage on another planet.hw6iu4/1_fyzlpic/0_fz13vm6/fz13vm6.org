“And now we here we are Old Man! I've discovered that you were responsible for sealing my magical core, stealing my money and locked me up at the Dursley's to be abused for ten years! I am not your boy anymore and I will have my revenge!” Said Indy!Harry while spitting in all directions in a heroic (/not really/) way and strutting around in a manner not dissimilar from the Malfoy family's prized peacocks in his new high-platform dragon-hide shoes (bought so that he may seem taller -didn't work).

“/sigh/ Mister Potter, for the thousandth time, the money I took from your vaults were the school fees; I never ‘locked you with the Dursley's' as you say, I honestly don't even have this kind of authority over your personal life, when your parents died I had to choose on the behalf of the Wizengamont where to put you, and considering that your parents didn't have a will my only choices were a man I believe had betrayed them and your Aunt's family, the choice was obvious; and lastly there is no way of sealing someone's magical core because THERE. IS. NO. SUCH. A. THING. AS. A. MAGICAL. CORE. If it were possible to bind a person's ability to use magic rest assured that it would se standard practice for prisoners in Azkaban” Said a tired Dumbledore while rubbing his head to starve off a headache -it didn't work.

“All else that I did in regards to your summer accommodations was saying you couldn't pass the summer at Hogwarts, as it would create a nightmare in dispenses and planning to make the castle stay usable with no faculty members, get enough supplies for you to live for two months, make sure that you didn't damage by accident or otherwise school property, ensuring that you didn't run afoul of the DMLE by breaking the underage magic laws and finding a babysitter to stay around you all times of the day and night as otherwise you would be a child without supervision in a castle with many pointed weapons in which you could hurt yourself, I once let a student stay during the summer and quite frankly don't need this headache again. If you want to pass the summer out of your Aunt's house you will have to find other place to do so”.

“Of course you are trying to control my life! The goblins have already said that you declared yourself my magical guardian scant hours after my parents died!” Replied a still indignant Harry while trying to feed Fawkes with chocolate frogs despite the Phoenix's best efforts to keep distance from the clearly insane child.

“Magical guardian?” Asked a confused Dumbledore.

“Of course! The goblins said that it means that you were the one in control of my financial matters and investments, plus anything else that Gringotts would have to deal with, they were so annoyed with you that I barely had time to utter the formal greeting of goblins before they pushed me out of the room” said Harry while crossing his arms imposing (/childishly/) and glaring with all his might (which had the effect of making him look constipated).

“And what exactly is this... formal greeting of goblins?” Asked Dumbledore dreading the answer.

“Oh, of course you wouldn't know, after all you must never have felt like speaking with goblins as an equal or learning about them!” Said Harry self-importantly “the greeting is: /I hope you get to eat your enemies flesh, bath in their waste and take their gold/” intoned Harry.

“Of course” groaned Dumbledore, what else would he expect Harry to say to a society formed exclusively of herbivores, to whom thief is the worst insult of all and that had a deadly allergy to human waste. He briefly wondered what else did Harry do to offend the beings to the point of inventing a completely bullshit pseud-legal position of authority in an attempt of redirecting his attention. Then he got an idea.

“Oh yes, that greeting. Only does who are considered true friends of the goblins may use it when speaking to them, they must truly respect you. But on the matter of being your magical guardian I must say that I was never given the honor. You see, this is a decision made exclusively by your parents without any input of the government, so I couldn't take the role in question”. Said Dumbledore in his best serene and wise elderly man impression.

“Yeah, right. If you're not my magical guardian then who is?” Asked Harry.

Dumbledore thought quickly ‘/who do I know that is deserving of this kind of annoyance and Harry would hate enough to responsabilize with absolutely no proof?/' “Why Harry, professor Snape of course!”.

“WHAT?! Why would my parents chose that -that pile of garbage to be in anyway responsible for me!?” Asked a shocked Harry.

‘/Because you deserve each other/', though Dumbledore maintaining his serene mask while answering “You see Mr. Potter, your mother was friends with Severus until they had a falling out somewhere around their OWL's year, after you were born she insisted and then guilt-tripped your father into giving him some role in your life, and as they had already chosen Sirius as your godfather they gave him the position of your magic guardian” answered the headmaster with the biggest amount of BS he though at an instant notice. Really, as far as he knew James grew to regret somewhat his actions against Snape, Lily on the other hand wasn't so quickly to forgive and kept her grudge until death did them apart.

Hearing this Harry's mind immediately started working on overdrive to assimilate the new information in his version of reality. “So all this time it was Snape's fault! That greasy old bat is the responsible for me being sent to the Dursley's and for the yearly amount that is taken from my vaults! Hell, he was probably the one to seal my magic so that I couldn't curse him to Hell and back as he deserves! He probably used the imperius on my mother to get her to agree to this!” Said Harry furiously while walking in circles angry.

“I am afraid so Mr. Potter” Said Dumbledore solemnly while deciding that getting the child to drop his baseless assumptions was a lost cause. Really, as if Lily would be affected by the imperius, every member of the order trained exhaustively to resist the curse, something that Harry seems to do innately with his sheer pigheadedness -Dumbledore is still not sure if he should be impressed or not by it.

As Harry left his office for a hopefully long time, angrily strutting away, Dumbledore wondered for a moment if he should try to give Severus a heads-up on his approaching torment... ‘/Nah, the overgrown man-child already gives me headaches enough without knowing that I was the one to throw him under the *crucio/*'.
