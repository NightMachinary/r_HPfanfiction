Harry has decided to showcase how he's beyond the old coot's manipulations by stealing his sherbert lemons - which he's sure Dumbledore has filled with potions designed to dampen his magical core and create a submissive mindset - and replacing them with his own sherbert lemons, which contain the potion that will reverse the damage that being starved for years at the Dursleys did to his frame. He intends to grow into his rightful strength as Dumbledore watches, to show him that even his attempts to control Harry are laughable before Harry's superior intellect.

So when Harry enters the office, it's to the sight of a fucking swole Dumbledore, who's now about 7'6", flexing shirtless in front of a mirror.
