Lucius would have been born between 12 September 1953 and 11 September 1954. (Second Monday in Harry's fifth year is 11 September 1995.)

Narcissa's age isn't stated explicitly in the books, but 1955 sounds realistic enough, considering Lucius' age.

The two characters whose ages are most tricky are Charlie Weasley (who should be at least a few years older) and Bellatrix Lestrange (who should probably be a good few years younger that in 'canon', having gone to school with Sirius and Snape).

I don't recall if it's explicitly stated, but Andromeda at least has to be born before 1955-56, if she graduated before birthing Tonks by 1974 (+11+7(hogwarts)+3(Auror academy)=1995)

EDIT: Just checked OotP. Bellatrix is older than Andromeda though, according to her placement on the family tree, so I suppose that Sirius just messed up something in GoF (or refered to Rabastan and the woman /he/ was about to marry...)
