Lucius age is as mentioned previous in cannon, 41 during Harry's 5th year. Also cannon is I believe the order of birth of the black sisters.I believe Andromeda is stated as being the oldest, with Bellatrix and the lestranges all in the same year as Lucius, which despite not being specifically mentioned in cannon would put narcissa a year or two younger
