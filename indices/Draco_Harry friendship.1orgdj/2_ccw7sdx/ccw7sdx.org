Harry/Draco. Draco has found and fixed an 'If Sieve', a magical device which can show alternate realities if people had made different choices. He tries many combinations to see if he could ever have been friends with Harry Potter. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78806/chapters/104944]]

Harry/Draco. One-shot sequel to the above. Makes the open ending of 'The If Sieve' a little more complete. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78822]]

Not hugely long at all, but this is easily my all-time favourite Harry/Draco fic.
