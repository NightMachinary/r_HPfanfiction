I sure do! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/]]

Saving Connor is first- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]]

It really is just amazing! asksubthrowaway is right though when he says they are so so so long, but I'm telling you it's so worth it. Also you have to keep me updated on how you like them!!! I've never had anyone dislike them though. Even my friends who didn't know it was Harry/Draco pairing later, they got so hooked by the first couple books that later they loved them together as friends so much that they actually wanted them together. You are going to love this. I'm so excited for you. I wish I could re-read them and not know what happens.
