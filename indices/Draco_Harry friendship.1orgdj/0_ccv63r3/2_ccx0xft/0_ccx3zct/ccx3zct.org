I can see why you would find it boring, it takes a while to pick up, like the fourth book is when things start getting more adventurous. I liked that Harry was sort of a Robot though, in later books it's Draco that helps him become his own person and get past the abuse of being made into a child solider. I think it made their relationship so much deeper and stronger, because Draco was always able to see past that.
