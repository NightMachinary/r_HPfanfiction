I found it kind of boring. After reading the first book, I know I won't be reading the next ones.

It's well written enough, but Harry acts like a robot (more like a little Terminator, actually) and it just doesn't appeal to me. And the story just didn't grab my attention.

But if you're looking for a well written Drarry, this is definitely the stuff.
