Having read further - this Harry is not so ridiculously overpowered as in Enter the Dragon (where he is large and strong enough to destroy mountains, has near-perfect magical defence, and so much magical power that he overloads every spell), but he is in a softer and gentler world. Enter the Dragon is a crossover with Shadowrun, and is bubbling with all the horrific abuses of magic that are possible, from blood sacrifices to enthralled human trafficking.

Both are interesting stories in different ways.
