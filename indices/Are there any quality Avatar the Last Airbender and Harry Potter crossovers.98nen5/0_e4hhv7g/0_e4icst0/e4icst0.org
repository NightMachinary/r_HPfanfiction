Actually a fusion instead of a crossover (the two worlds are merged), but yeah, the best HP/Avatar story ever. I messaged the author a year or two back about the story's state of abandonedness and they insisted it's merely on hold and they fully intend to finish it some day. Which, you know, is hopeful.
