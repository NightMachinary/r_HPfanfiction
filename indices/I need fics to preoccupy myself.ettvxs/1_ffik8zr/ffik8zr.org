  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Reptilia28 Challenge. Harry learns the fallacy of forgiveness at a Maternal!Reaper's knee. He realises that maximum control is the only way to destroy the Voldemort ideology. ALL Death Eaters(inc Snape) are bad. Max Revenge, Min romance, CRACK/heavy tropey/OTT elements, so distrusted but not bashed Weasleys and Dumbledore. (Add pinches of salt to taste!)

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

#+begin_quote
  Harry has died, again. This is his last shot, his last chance before he gets written off forever. This is his 48th life. But he is not alone, the game plan has changed and he's got a plan to fix everything. Hopefully while avoiding dying again. Death at his shoulder. Warnings language and possible mature situations later. Hiatus Pending Rewrite
