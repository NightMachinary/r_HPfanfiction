How about advice on how to make fics more engaging and entertaining? I've come across some fics that would've been great stories if they weren't so dry. As in some writers seem afraid to use dialogue or vernacular... You also could address character and relationship depth. Some authors spend too much time going into minute details about a character/relationship whereas others just rush things through.

I always thought "how to get hopping when a plot bunny hits you" would be a good topic of discussion.

Congrats on the panel, and let us know how it goes :3 !
