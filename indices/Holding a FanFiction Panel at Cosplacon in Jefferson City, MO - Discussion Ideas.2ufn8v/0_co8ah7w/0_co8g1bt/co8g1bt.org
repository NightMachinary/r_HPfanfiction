I agree with this, I personally have an awful habit of going into detail / focusing on relationships and forgetting about the badguys. Hell the first 25 chapters or so of SFTP were summer hols at Grimmauld...

But then.. my stories are all character / relationship / smut. One thing people do not complain about is me having empty characters. Every girl (except Cho and the Patils) are not easy to swap out with any other in that story.

I'll make sure I have a section on how important it is for you to know every character, including ones that only appear once "on screen" and including the bad guys. Character Depth is what makes them engaging!

I like the "how to get hopping" bit, that is an awesome bit of wordplay!
