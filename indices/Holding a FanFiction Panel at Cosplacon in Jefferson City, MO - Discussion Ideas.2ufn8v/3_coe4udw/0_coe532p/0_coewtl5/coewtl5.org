  there are authors who can keep from making the protagonist completely OOC

Not to put too fine a point on it, but that doesn't ever happen. It has less to do with the characters and their OOC-ness and more with the subgenre being escapist fantasy for aging virgins who assume promiscuity as the apotheosis of masculinity. I prefer fics with stable believable relationships, not those with /a stable/ of women. But to each their own.
