And not to argue to heavily with you, but basically every one of my stories is harem and promiscuous, and I am far far from being a virgin. I take great pains to ensure that every character has a real backstory and motivations, and that you cannot simply switch the names during any scene to imagine a different girl.

And I'm sorry... I've gone and made this personal. I'll stop now, obviously this IS a good topic for a panel but I will need to remove my own bias on the issue.

It IS escapist fantasy though. But that is true of any fiction worth reading.
