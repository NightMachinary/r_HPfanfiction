I can agree with this topic, thank you. However while I agree there is a "degree" of self insert in all harem fic, there are authors who can keep from making the protagonist completely OOC.

The problem with any Harem Fic is that you have to contrive the situation. Threesome fic is easier to do with the right girls without making it all about creating and maintaining the harem. Once you add a third girl or more well... We don't read harem fic for the plot as much as the PLOT.
