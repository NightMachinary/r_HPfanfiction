There is actually one extremely well done panel that I go to every year at Anime Detour in Minneapolis. They focus one the “Do's and Don'ts of Fanfiction” and focus on several things

- The importance of a summary: either using a vague snippet or quick overview of your fic without giving away any plot twists. They emphasize the importance of NOT putting “I suck at summaries, just read” bs. If you can't write a summary, people are going to assume you can't write a creative story either.

- Giving the nod to the original creative team. They emphasize that it is just good manners (and a cover your own ass practice) to not simply write “this show and its characters are not mine”. Give a nod to the show's creative team (Hayao Miyazaki, et. al) in the “disclaimer” so if push comes to shove credit is given where credit is due.

- Avoid the Mary Sue unless you are very, VERY good at making them

- The importance of giving you OC a flaw and not making them perfect (that's why people hate them --following Mary Sue)

- The importance of criticism -- taking criticism. Never lash out at your readers. Take the high road. No one wants to read a writer who is going to bash you on their fic. In addition, don't ask for constructive criticism unless you can take the harsh and the constructive stuff. Know that a negative comment does not define your fic, but can help you get better.

- Do not hold your story ransom. No one likes a writer who threatens to take down/end their story unless they get a certain amount of reviews. Most people are lurkers now. Make then want to give you great reviews.

- Get a beta. Most people can't effectively edit their own work. Some can. If you aren't comfortable getting a beta, make yourself wait a few days after writing a chapter or fic so you can come back with fresh eyes and see your own mistakes. Reading them out loud also can help with this.

- Get a soundboard. If you can, have someone to talk over ideas with, they will usually stop you from making unpopular character choices or give you a look at what the initial reaction will be (readies you for hate mail if you intend to do something unpopular intentionally).

- Most importantly: GRAMMAR!!!! Can't emphasize this enough.

- Always have a notebook with you. You never know when an idea for a fanfic or a break of your writer's block might happen. Have one in your bag, keep one by your bed. Do whatever you can to catch those little ideas, because they one's you will "write down later" are the ones you lose.

- Create a music box. Find a set of songs that remind you of your story. Maybe a song for each character you are writing. One for different stories. Whatever you decide. Use these songs to play while you write certain tics because when you become stuck these songs can help you concentrate, get yourself back on track, or even find ideas you lost. That and when you hear them, you feel a need to write again. For instance, I use This is War by 30 Seconds to Mars for one of my fics and each time I hear it, I get a new idea or the desire to work on it again.

- Figure out how to do description effectively. No one really wants to read a three paragraph description of a landscape, no one really cares how the character laces their shoes, and no one needs to know about the mole above the character's eye if we are never going to hear about them again. If it is a major character, more and more of them will be described over time, so don't feel the need to detail purge about them the first time we meet them. Find the balance of necessary detail. Many of the experienced writers that come to the panel I attend usually say you should be able to describe something in two sentences (I usually give it three if it is important). It won't bog down the reader.

They also encouraged those that had been writing longer to give some advice they had learned along the way to those that were newer. They also discouraged plugging of fanfics so that it remained constructive for everyone (unless the individual had a point to make about a certain group of readers).

These are just a few, sorry for the excessive rant :) . If you want any more ideas, I can try and remember more of what the panel discussed.
