Don't apologize! This is great!

I haven't attended any panel discussion on FanFic myself but I have been actively involved in Yahoo Groups for years and most of this is a collection of what is repeated over and over when people ask for advice.

It is all constructive and very helpful.. I will probably get myself a music box :)

The description section is especially good, When I first began writing I was heavily influenced in style by Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordon.... both authors who write epic length novels in multiple parts with WAY too much description.
