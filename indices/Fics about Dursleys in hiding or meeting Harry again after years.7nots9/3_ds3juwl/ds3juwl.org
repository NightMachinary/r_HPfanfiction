[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur would be exactly what you're looking for. This story really redeems Dudley as a character. It basically starts right after Dudley and Harry said their goodbyes with each other.
