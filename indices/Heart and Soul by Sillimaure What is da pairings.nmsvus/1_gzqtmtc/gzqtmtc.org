It's not a Harry multi, but an eventual poly, between Harry/Hermione and Fleur. It's one of my absolute favourite fics. Fair warning, the pacing is kind of slow, and it is really quite bloated at times and could have been 200k words shorter.

Still, I love it and the characterisation is great, especially Dumbledore. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this fic has the best Dumbledore of any I've read.
