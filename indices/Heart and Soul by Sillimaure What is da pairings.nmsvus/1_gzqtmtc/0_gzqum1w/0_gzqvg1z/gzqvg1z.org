Well, I don't mind the multi trope. Hell, I'm writing one. It's just too bad how for most authors it's just a smut fest, and they're either not willing or capable of giving each person of the group their time in the sun, so to speak.

Anyway, the dynamic between the three main characters in Heart and Soul is very interesting, and how the writer goes about it is somewhat realistic, I think.
