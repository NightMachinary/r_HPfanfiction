It's important to remember that this is about legal precedent. If one person starts selling t-shirts, another sells an encyclopedia, a third sells tickets to a stage show, somebody else starts selling their own fan-fiction on amazon, if she doesn't act against them legally it's considered tacit approval, and a judiciary /can/ (doesn't mean they will) interpret it as her waiving her copyright. Then we start having movies about harry potter in vegas.
