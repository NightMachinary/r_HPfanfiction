I think you might be right there. I was thinking of trademarks rather than copyright. I'm not sure what Harry Potter falls under in this sense. Is the character name copyrighted? trademarked? What about Hogwarts, quidditch or expelliarmus? She can definitely waive her right to something, whether it's terms or characters I'm not sure, if she doesn't act to protect them.
