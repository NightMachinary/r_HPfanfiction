JK Rowling is being far too punitive. She created something, and prospered from it more than she could imagine. Why not just be cool about it? Before George Lucas sold Star Wars he was cool with his fans. He never took any fans to court, nor did he go around trying to get fan art obliterated. He just let it be.
