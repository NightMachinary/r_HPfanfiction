It is an interesting idea from the standpoint of exploring the constitutions of reappropriation and collaborative pieces. In fact, it's been a subject confronted for quite some time. Happenings, pop art, fluxus, exquisite corpse... its a serious question that artists address constantly across every discipline.

But do these secondary creations contribute their own form of legitimacy if they're distributed in the same way as the original? I personally wouldn't agree with that. If the argument is to create a more collaborative manifestation of a novel then repurposing the same format that requires direct reference for fundamental understanding deflates any sort of progression into that realm of controversy. Actually, if a secondary creation or fanfic that is so much so assisted from it's predecessor at such a degree and earns profit for the assisted author then it has already terribly stagnated under the restriction of copy right laws instead of validating itself as it's own entity while simultaneously drawing from existing materials and lending itself to future recreation.

Quite honestly, I really haven't come across fanfics that generate sincere reflection in order to defend their validity. It's fun yeah and a quarter of them really do a god damned good job for what they are. But when it comes down to it, they exist to speculate nuanced preferences. And that can't compete with revolutionary action towards communal ownership while requesting the same treatment as the original within our current model of capitalism.
