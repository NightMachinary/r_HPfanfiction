For books its absolutely makes sense to not do copyright on the contents. Unless fanfic authors all turn into psychics overnight, the original author gets the first shot at using the characters and location in a published work and therefore the majority of the profit if its quality work. From there, the fanfic keeps people interested potentially increasing sales of the original works.
