Yes. I've read the first Clockwork book, and the first 3 MI book (before she decided to extend to 6). She changed enough of the universe mechanics to separate it from her Draco series, but the characters are at minimum expy of her HP fanfiction characters. There is also that falcon scene (I spent like 2 weeks thinking "huh I've read this before somewhere").
