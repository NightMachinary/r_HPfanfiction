The falcon scene is the only thing she directly reused from the DD trilogy for MI. She still wrote the scene, and it had nothing directly to do with HP anyway, so who cares if she reused it?

I've only read City of Bones from MI, but aside from the falcon scene, I didn't think it was a clone of her fanfiction.
