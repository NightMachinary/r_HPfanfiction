So we get canon from Harry's point of view, and he never calls her Gin, we see enough other Weasley-to-Ginny interactions in canon to know that they don't call her Gin, same with Hermione... the only time I'm okay with it is if it's a pet name used by either Corner or Dean, and just knowing Ginny's character it would probably greatly annoy her, or perhaps in an AU or post-Hogwarts story a significant other or even a friend or Harpies teammate has shortened her to Gin (I'm picturing a quiet reserved teammate of Ginny's who is also her roommate and has earned the right to call her Gin because she's a good friend that likely takes care of Ginny who has gone down the wrong path a few times in life).

But as others have answered, unless it's Cursed Child it's not a canon nickname
