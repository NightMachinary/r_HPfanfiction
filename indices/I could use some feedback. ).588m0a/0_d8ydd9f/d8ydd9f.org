  Due to unexplainable circumstances, James and Lily Potter, along with their son, survive the attack on their home in Godric's Hollow. Lily does what Albus Dumbledore told her not to do and makes a deal with the most powerful Dark Lord the wizarding world has ever seen. Little Harry, who was born with an incurable disease, fights for his life at every twist and turn. He makes unlikely friends and foes and turns the wizarding world completely on its head.Warning: the tags span across most of the entire series (7 planned parts) and are subject to be altered and/or changed. This story also closely follows canon, with a lot of the dialog slightly changed and situations made different. I have also taken some inspiration from J.K and added in a lot of foreshadowing. If you find it, congrats!Part 1 of 7.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone rewrite.Rewritten: 29/March/2016 --- revised: in progress (13/August/2016)
