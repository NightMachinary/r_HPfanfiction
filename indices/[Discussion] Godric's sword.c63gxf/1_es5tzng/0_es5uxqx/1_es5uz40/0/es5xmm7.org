Yeah, but contrived conflict (i.e the Basilisk being actually difficult to deal with when you have foreknowledge of its existence and weaknesses) is also not good plot.

The tough part of time-travel fics is finding a way to create new conflicts while not being able to treat the canon conflicts as too threatening. Best way of doing that is unintended consequences.

Like if you killed the Basilisk 1st Year and outed Pettigrew, but this meant that Lucius Malfoy never gave Ginny the diary, instead being scared by Pettigrew's capture into keeping it safely at home. This has the knock-on effect of making acquiring the Diary much much harder.
