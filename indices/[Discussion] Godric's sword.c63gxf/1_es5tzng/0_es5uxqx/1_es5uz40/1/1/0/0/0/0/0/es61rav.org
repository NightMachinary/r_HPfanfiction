Phoenix Song is generally exaggerated in fics, including my own. In canon, it just strikes fear into the hearts of the evil. Given that Dementors have more in common with Boggarts and Poltergeists than they do with real, sapient beings, it's dubious if they would be affected, even if they are Dark creatures.
