I do think this sort of thing probably happens sometimes, but more because the Ministry don't want to bother with the hassle of punishing the Dementor as because they can't.

Even going strictly by canon, they could just lock the Dementor in a room with a Patronus for a few days, that would probably be pretty unpleasant for it. If the Ministry really wanted to execute a Dementor, they could keep it locked up until it starved, of course, or take it back to London and kick it through the Veil --- though I think doing so would be seen by the other Dementors of Azkaban as breaking the wizard/Dementor "agreement", and they'd have a rebellion on their hands.

And there are hints in canon that there /are/ non-Patronus ways to hurt Dementors, besides (Snape disagrees with Harry on the best way to fight them, it's offhandedly mentioned, leading me to speculate that there is Dark Magic which works on them; possibly Fiendfyre).
