I'm fairly sure that the Dementor's Kiss isn't a regular punitive sanction that the Ministry dispenses based on the severity of the crime, but rather a last-ditch line of fire against wizards who have proven themselves so dangerous that Azkaban cannot hold them. I don't think the Wizarding World otherwise approves of capital punishment.
