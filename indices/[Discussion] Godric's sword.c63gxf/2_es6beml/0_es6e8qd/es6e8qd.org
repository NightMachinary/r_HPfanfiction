I feel like this should only be a last resort if you can't subdue the Basilisk non-lethally. This goes both if you do or don't consider Basiliks to be sapient beings, actually. If she's sapient, you don't just murder someone without looking for another choice. If she's not, she's an animal who cannot be blamed for what her trainers made her do, and jumping to slaughtering her is sheer animal cruelty --- not to mention, she's the last Basilisk on Earth. You might instead want to give Newt Scamander a call, I'm sure he'd love to take her in. Or perhaps some Dragon preserver or other would be interested.
