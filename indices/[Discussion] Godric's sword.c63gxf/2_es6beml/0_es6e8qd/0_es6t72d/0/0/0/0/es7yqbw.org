Well, maybe they're still rare but there some somewhere. Maybe hidden somewhere in India (I'm just thinking about snake charmers and that maybe there are more parselmouths there). Or it's injured and serves as an exponat in a magical zoo. Who knows.

There are so few of them in England because breeding them was banned in Middle Ages. And because if a breeder is not a parselmouth then he will face (heh, a pun) great difficulties in interacting with it. So there should be more in areas with parselmouths and not so vigilant ministry.

Also we can't be sure that basilisks aren't widely known. We experience HP's world through Harry himself and he's not very informed person (come on, he didn't know about Knight Bus until his 3rd year, and it's a usual magical method of travel). Also the trio was in the 2nd year and students start studying magical creatures only in the 3rd year. Also we can assume that there were no studies of basilisks' killing stare due to, well, their killing stare. So it's understandable that nobody in HPCoS could even think about a basilisk because victims were alive. All these facts can make us think that very few people even know about basilisks' existence. In my opinion, they are more widely known than that.
