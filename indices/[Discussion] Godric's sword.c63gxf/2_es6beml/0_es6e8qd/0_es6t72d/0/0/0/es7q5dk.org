Hm... fair observation, but, I dunno, I feel like Basilisks would be more widely known if there were others roaming around. Lord Voldemort would also likely have gone to greater lengths to protect his Horcruxes from Basilisk Venom in that case. (I'm fairly sure the main reason he didn't bother is that he thought the only Basilisk in the world was loyal to him and hidden away where no one could find her.)
