HP wiki (and so canon) states that

#+begin_quote
  the serpents remain mercifully rare; in fact, until the incident in 1943, there had been no confirmed reports of Basilisks in *Britain* since the 16th century.

Also Newt Scamander writes that there were no *recorded* sightings of a basilisk in *Great Britain* for the last 400 years.

But nowhere the canon tells about the situation in the whole world. So I think it's quite possible that she wasn't the last one.
