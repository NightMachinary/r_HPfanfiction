She was the only Basilisk on Earth at that point, as far as anybody knows. It's true that you could always breed a new one with a chicken and a toad, of course. But there's no telling how long one takes to hatch and grow up, if nothing else. Considering that a Basilisk lives hundreds of years, it could take 10 years for one to hatch, and still more for it to grow to adult size.

(And as the creation of Professor Slytherin himself, the Basilisk would, on top of the sheer rarity of a fully-grown Basilisk, have great historical value, methinks.)
