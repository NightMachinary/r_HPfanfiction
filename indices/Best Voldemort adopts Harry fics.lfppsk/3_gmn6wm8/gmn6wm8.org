If you're looking for a story where Voldemort kidnaps Harry as a baby, and raises him ( where Voldemort sorta grows fond of him, but he's still evil and always puts himself first ) until Harry realizes that he's evil and rebels against him, check out the one below.

(There's a good chance you've already read this one, but if not do it. Like do it right now. It's the best thing ever, just read it.)

If you're looking for about the same thing except Harry always remains loyal to Voldemort, at least for the most part try this one.

(This one is a tragedy, so beware. It's a very sad ending.)

And then there's this one.

(This is just a crack/humor story, but it involves Voldemort raising Harry so I thought, what the hell? Check it out if you want. It's funny.)
