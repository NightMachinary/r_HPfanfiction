I'm not aware of a "true" map of Hogwarts, but [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/castle.htm][here is]] a pretty well-known, extremely detailed analysis of everything we know and do not know about Hogwarts, including possible locations and orientations based on references to time of day/season/angle of the sun in canon.

It's honestly pretty overwhelming, but at the very bottom of the page is a map which tries to reconcile where rooms could/should be in relation to each other, /if all canon references are treated as factual./
