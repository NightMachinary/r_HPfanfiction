Mmm, I have enjoyed reading that several times. However, I do have two issues with it:

Firstly, as you alluded to, sometimes it takes figurative language or visual metaphors as literal descriptions.

Secondly, it's tough to reconcile the map with the events at the end of PoA. Here's the problem: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Lupin and rat!Wormtail are on their way back to Hogwarts from the Whomping Willow. On their way back to the castle they pass by the shore of the lake. On top of this, time travelling Harry and Hermione start out at Hagrid's hut, pass through the forbidden forest, and end up at the same part of the lake, /only on the opposite shore/.

Trying to account for all of that is very difficult, and the linked map doesn't. I've found that the only real way to make it work is to have a pretty irregular shaped lake.

This is my own attempt:
