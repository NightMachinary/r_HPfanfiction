AFAIK, there is no such thing as an accurate map of Hogwarts because it is never provided in canon. Only landmarks and specific areas are mentioned in the books. JKR did a rough hand drawing and [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/atlas/hogwarts/atlas-h.html][there are other maps on this site]].

If you just do a Google search for "Hogwarts map," there are many beautiful renditions out there.
