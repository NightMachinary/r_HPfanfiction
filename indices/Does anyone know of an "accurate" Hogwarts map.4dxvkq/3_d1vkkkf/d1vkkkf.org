Like others have said, there's not any "true" map. Having said that - weirdly, I've found the HPCoS PC game to have the representation of Hogwarts most true to my imagination and close to the movies/books. The outside is necessarily lacking but the inside has a lot of things including the moving staircases, Hospital Wing, various classrooms including DADA, Myrtle's bathroom and quite decent approximations of the Slytherin common room and so on. It draws on the films, necessarily, and there's the to-be-expected "and here is the room where students with enough XP can unlock a specially challenge", but I'm mentioning it because you can walk around it and explore pretty freely and as a result I now feel like I know my way around a great deal of Hogwarts.

Might not be what you're looking for. I always appreciate an opportunity to talk about that game either way.
