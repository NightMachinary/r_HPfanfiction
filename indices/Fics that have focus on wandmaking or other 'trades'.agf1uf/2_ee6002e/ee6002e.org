[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4399301?view_full_work=true][Old Soul Reborn by Glaux_Bryonia]] is a Bleach/HP crossover, but entirely in HP-verse. Harry discovers his wand has a spirit and is sentient. He teaches his friends how to connect to their wands. It's a really interesting take on wandlore. linkao3(4399301)

My absoute favorite take on wandlore is from a Buffy/HP/Adams Family cross by Tenhawk. There are two fics *SCAU-DC Stranger in a Strange* *Verse* and *Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council*. The first is a Xander Harris goes to Hogwarts fic with Harry as a side character. Xander becomes a wandmaker and it's really fantastic world building. The second has Xander stranded in DC-verse and he spends a lot of time on wandmaking. Alas the website has been down for a while but you can join the yahoo group for access to the fics.

In The Apple Tree by Philo Harry makes his own wand and there's some interesting wandlore. linkao3(4241040)
