The main language of England before William the conqueror, 1066, was most likely a Scandinavian dialect, as the past 5 rulers had close descent and there were many invasions of the area by them. Normandy, where William was from, is named such because the people there were North Men, aka Scandinavian. Latin wasn't likely til war of the roses era most like.
