My headcanon, if you play with the timeline a little bit, is that Slytherin was against the Christian church, specifically in Ireland, where [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Saint_Patrick_Catholic_Church_%28Junction_City%2C_Ohio%29_-_stained_glass%2C_Saint_Patrick_-_detail.jpg][Saint Patrick]] (who looks pretty fucking wizard) was trying to oust the "Snakes" from Ireland. St. Patrick excises Slytherin and his kind from Ireland, which leads to Slytherin meeting the rest of the founders. Cue Ireland becoming predominantly Catholic. Essentially, it's a metaphor for Catholicism vs. Paganism, and both sides were using magic, however, in very different senses. Over the centuries, this debate transitions from a religious one, to a cultural one (maintaining traditions versus embracing transition), to a matter of race/blood purity when Mendel's ideas gain traction. Mendel wasn't the first to discover these things (humans have been breeding wolves into dogs, plants into better plants, etc. for centuries before Mendel, but he was the first to use the scientific method and write shit down).

Perhaps Slytherin's family was originally Irish and after they were kicked out, settled in the Fens of England. Salazar chooses green and silver as a slight against the Irish Catholics his family tussled with, and his connection to magic and tradition.

Paganism involved a lot of rituals, and we see in Harry's time that ritual magic is considered very dangerous and mostly dark. We don't get a clear explanation of what is considered "Dark" except for the Unforgiveables, and old pagan concepts were embraced by magical and muggle alike. To the magical population, organized religion like Christianity represented a shift away from ritual magic, sacrifices, and an obedience toward something other than magic and minor gods: to acknowledge "the" God is a massive cultural shift if your entire life is based on loosely understood ritualistic magic and praying to gods of nature, while relying on the few magical people in your area to work miracles via magic.

In my head, Godric Gryffindor was Roman Catholic, or closely agreeing with those beliefs, and while originally great friends with Slytherin in their youth, their ideological differences just became too much for the population as a whole. The wizards could see big changes in the future and some in Slytherin's camp were very afraid of that change. Gryffindor's views sort of win out in the end, and the magical world follows suit.

Merlin and his escapades further this tension between traditional vs. new ways of thinking, while wars wage between Saxons, vikings, and Europe in general.

Old magic is like that as depicted in ancient texts: rituals, sacrifices, prayers. It heavily involves forces of nature. It involves a lot of people working in concert to do magic, except for the gods and those chosen by gods (ie. wizards / witches). This is very different from wand + spell based magic that modern magicals exercise. Old Hogwarts classes likely taught a mix, with individual magic becoming increasingly popular while the old, group magic becoming increasingly dangerous.

All the "old" families, like the Blacks, have family magic that dabbles in these old pagan traditions. Over time, and due to the increasingly dark association of ritual magic, they relate dark magic with old magic and become increasingly "dark" while trying to hold on to their family traditions. Dark, Old, and Ritual become obfuscated over time, which is why the Blacks are increasingly associated with madness and darkness, but /are/ increasingly mad and dark through that obfuscation.

The Statute comes to play as tensions between these various ideologies comes to a head: pagan muggles are dying out and becoming increasingly religious, pagan wizards are dying out and becoming increasingly religious, but nearly all known magic users by the English Renaissance era are borrowing from their pagan origins. This is a long and hard struggle, many centuries in the making. It's not a "Muggles started burning witches so we decided to cut off" -- it's more like "there are more and more people in the world, muggles and wizards both, so we need to decide our future." The Statute represents a concerted effort of organized wizard kind to leave tradition behind and embrace the newer ways of thinking, while ironically isolates themselves from the technological advances muggles discover. Magical society embraces a new world order, while essentially locking themselves in a late-Renaissance era of thinking. All the old conflicts eventually shift and change over time, especially as the written word becomes more prominent, and newly self-discovered "scholars" try to justify the old conflicts by re-writing the old conflicts in light of newly realized conflicts like blood purity.

There's no reason magical society could not have had "advanced" ways of thinking, like Democracy and an emphasis on individual rights, (Democracy was a Greek ideal, and while somewhat failed in that ancient society, nearly all Western societies are based on their ideals with modern social, technological, and political systems in place). There's even the possibility that muggle society followed wizards in social / political / economic standards but just pounced ahead due to technology.

Anyway, that was a ridiculous word vomit at 4am after work while drinking, so take those thoughts with a grain of salt, but I love lore / worldbuilding type discussions like this.
