I greatly doubt that. It is I think the whole point of Hogwarts to teach wizarding children magic as soon as they are /able/ to do magic of worth, so as to avoid having a lot of untrained, excitable youths running about and causing who-knows-what disasters through accidental magic and misused half-known spells.

I think Hogwarts and the other schools became prominent not because the wizard families were keen to have /others/ teach their children (in opposition to the old way of personal apprenticeships, most of them kept all in the family), but rather because as wizarding population grew, the high numbers of children running about without proper education became an outright /hazard/ for the public at large.

Adults could always get into apprenticeships under powerful wizards, or, better yet, teach themselves --- the iconic image is after all of wizards learning by staying up all night reading ancient spellbooks.
