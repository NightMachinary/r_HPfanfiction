Even for non-magical people, arranged marriages were not as cut-throat as you seem to believe. So long as the two individuals were of similar status and the families respected eachother, there was no problem with a son suggesting the name of a girl he fancied. Purely parent-arranged marriages were most common among royalty and those close to royalty - lower nobility (barons, knights, etc) and other folk were more interested in their children marrying than in them marrying someone specific. This would be doubly true when considering there is a lot more gender equality among magicals.
