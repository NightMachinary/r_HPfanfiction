Agreed. Arranged marriages were mostly a noble matter to keep political power and wealth within familial lines. No clue if this tradition would be similar among wizard families, but it was distinctly seen as a necessity among oligarchical / wealthy lineages in order to protect wealth and power. Headcanon says that older wizarding families would probably look to arrange marriages with other powerful magical users, or keep certain families from warring, or arrange stronger political blocks with strong magical lines to uphold social standards or ensure that magic stays in family (depending on how Squibs actually work).
