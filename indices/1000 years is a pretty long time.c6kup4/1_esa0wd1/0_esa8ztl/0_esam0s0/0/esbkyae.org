Yep. What do wizards have to do for work? You can essentially live with zero income if you're clever enough with spells. You can even earn a modest income if you're growing spell material or raising animals for said materials. Everyone who falls out in wizarding society is either not powerful enough (maybe a sub-race) or is extremely lazy / depressed in some sense. You can be completely ostracized from society and just do whatever the fuck you want if you're learned enough (as is displayed in many fanfics). If you aren't concerned with the moral implications, you can duplicate tons of material to sell to muggles and disrupt markets to be a millionaire and just keep running from the IWC.
