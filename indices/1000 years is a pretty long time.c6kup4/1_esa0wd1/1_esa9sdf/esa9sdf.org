Maybe it meant muggles if they ever managed to get into the school to cause trouble. If they can't use magic then they'd definitely be unworthy of it. I don't remember who used that quote but I'd bet that as time went on, the legend began to change a bit and the original meaning was lost. Maybe muggle repelling spells are from the statue of secrecy time period which is why it was feasible to hide the magical world. So muggles getting to the school would be a risk when hogwarts was founded.
