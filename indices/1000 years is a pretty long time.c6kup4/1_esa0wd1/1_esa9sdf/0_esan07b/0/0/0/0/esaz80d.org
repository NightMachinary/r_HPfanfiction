lets be honest, Jk never put much thought into it

she wanted to write a children's book, which is fine but now she is trying to make it into this epic universe when frankly the world building does not scale with what she wants

I mean harry spent several years at wizarding school before learning about what an Auror was

as I got older I see more of the flaws, like wizarding culture will basically be destroyed due to all the immigration

and that's a massive issue facing our world today where countries are having so many immigrates that they form enclaves and do not adjust to the country they are moving too

There is a weird thing is that JK rowling also spent zero time establishing wizarding culture

they celebrate Christmas and Halloween and easter but from a wizards perspective Jesus, should be relatively unimpressive he turned water into wine, wow my 13 year old gets taught how to do that in class

its one of the things the old starwars eu did, there where time periods and you could see how things changed over time
