I've always hated that because I don't support what the death eaters did but can understand why there were so many people who hated muggleborns coming to the wizarding world and wanting to change it to the muggle world. Like sure there's the argument that they can read books or whatever and the argument for that would be â€œyou came into my country from yours and want to change us to your country. What should be done is at 10 years old, muggleborns should learn about the magical world and the values/how to act. At least a crash course and give them information on the best way to get more information to understand. Because you are going into another country. Wizards hide in plain sight out of choice. I've seen one argument that the magical world is dependent on the muggle world and can figure out why.
