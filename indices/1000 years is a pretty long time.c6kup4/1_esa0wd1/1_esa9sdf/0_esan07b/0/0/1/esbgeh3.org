For me, it made sense that this class doesnt exist because I an not convinced the Wizarding World even have a "culture ".

Dont get me wrong, they are definitively different to Muggles, but wizards seem to be very "individualistic". They all keep to themselves and even official structures such as the Ministry is more there to assure a basic control and ensure that the Statut of Secrecy is enforced than to really "govern " the people. In the end, every wizard seem to do anything he want as long as he respects some loose rules (like dont attack a Muggle without reason, or dont try to raise a dragon in your garden).

You could almost say that every wizard family has its own culture (the Weasleys, the Lovegoods and the Malfoys all have very different values and live different lives, and they are all purebloods ) And the closest thing to common values seem to be Hogwart Houses (an ex Gryffindor will raise his children with Gryffindor values and same for th√© other ones ) which would explain why family members tend to be in the same house. But even this is not an assured result (with people like the Patil twins, or Sirius Black ). In this situation, except the law that can be covered in Defense and in History, what could be taught in a Culture class ?
