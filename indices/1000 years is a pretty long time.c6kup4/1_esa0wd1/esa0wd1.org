The problem with Salazar Slytherin and blood politics is that JKR's history differs significantly from reality. Look at Binns's explanation of the Chamber of Secrets in Book 2:

#+begin_quote
  "[I]t was an age when magic was feared by the common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution."
#+end_quote

Centuries before the witch hunts. True, he doesn't specifically say witch hunts or trial, and people did fear magic long earlier, but you have to stretch it for it to make sense.

#+begin_quote
  "[Slytherin] disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy."
#+end_quote

Seeing as this was long before the Statute of Secrecy, when simply letting the secret out would be untrustworthy, it seems likely that this is also related to active persecution.

#+begin_quote
  "The heir alone would be able...to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic."
#+end_quote

/This/ would suggest a modern view on bloody purity, although "unworthy" is still pretty vague. If I'm rationalizing the legend, I would put the highest confidence on this being a later addition, but none of it makes a whole lot of sense given actual history and JKR's later (canon!) writings.
