[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] kind looks into this - The writer ties the hollows and Merlin into why Slytherin gained a reputation against muggleborn. It's complete and 440k long, the slash is for minor characters - Harry doesn't really get into any meaningful relationships. The writer has another similar story (slash, 900k) that draws a line between what it means to be muggle and what it means to be magical.
