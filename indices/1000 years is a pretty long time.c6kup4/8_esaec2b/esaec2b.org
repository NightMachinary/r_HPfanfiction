Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]]) is incredibly long and is centered around addressing anachronisms/differing lifestyles between 990s and 1990s. The writing is well executed technically

I enjoy it cause I enjoy thinking about how language evolves, but the characterization gets kinda OOC and samey towards the last parts. If you like a LONG read it's great. Also!! It's updated regularly.

About half the series is set in the founders era, featuring founders who aren't depressing and/or boring, which is amazing cause most founders fics suuuuuck

(The fic also centers around the fact that the past was more socially inclusive/less socially shitty than the 1990s, which seems a little silly and tiresome, but it's a magical world so I just kinda rolled with it)
