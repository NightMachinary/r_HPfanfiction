Even the upper class weren't literate half the time. It was pretty rare until the beginning of the industrial era (and the adoption of the printing press). You are talking about less than 1%.

With magic, books could be magically copied or written. With easy access books, and a way to instantly teleport across the country, it was probably much more likely for the common wizard to be literate. You have the three key components that muggles lacked until quite recently. 1) A big school, 2) not having to worry about travel, 3) easy access to books.
