  Imagine the other things that they still believe that are no longer true...?

Exactly! Or, sort of; essentially Voldemort represents a political party, right? One of the things his party supports is segregation form muggles. Slytherin would probably be down for that. But Voldemort also has vaguely defined ideas about the rights of magical creatures like werewolves and giants. Would Slytherin also hold those ideals? Probably not; he wouldn't even think to associate those two issues together.

On muggles, they've really only been barely tolerable for like... 2 centuries? Since the 1800's? I'm not sure when open sewers in the street stopped being a thing... Okay, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stink][Great Stink]] was an epidemic caused by sewage dumping in the Thames in 1858. So, I can seriously imagine Dumbledore's granddad telling him stories about how filthy and smelly muggles are, and being factually correct. 'improvement' is very general; muggles have only begun to do everything wizards can do (more or less) for the last century. Cold food, convenient stoves, adequate sanitation, more or less effective medicine based on experimentation... Muggles have been getting better, no mistake, and hardline purebloods are being unfair in their perspective, but its easy enough to see where they're coming from, particularly if the average wizarding lifespan is longer than a muggle's. Nobody really likes change once they reach a certain age. Things are always better when we were younger.
