  If Slytherin was looking down on muggleborn students, it wasn't because of blood purity as Draco Malfoy understood it.

Muggles in the 990s are completely different from the 1990's. Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

The problem is that Muggles improved drastically improved over the following centuries, and wizards refused to see that (or acknowledge it). The blood purists, I assume, don't like change that much, and with new muggleborns brings more change from a source they are unwilling to work with. They took an argument/belief that no longer exists today and ran with it. Imagine the other things that they still believe that are no longer true...?
