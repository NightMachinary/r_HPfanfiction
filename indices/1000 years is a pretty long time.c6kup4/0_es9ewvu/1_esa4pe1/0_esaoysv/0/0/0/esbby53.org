I agree, but J.K never painted wizards like that. They were never sorcerers who sat in a tower with scrolls, tomes, and books scattered everywhere. Humans had schools thousands of years ago. They are not a new concept. In fact, some claim the first school was built sometime in 3500 BC.

Also, spells may not have been advanced back then. I mean, it took them until around 1700 to create levitation. If magic was powerful and wizards were living better than Muggles, Salazar would not have feared the Muggles so much.
