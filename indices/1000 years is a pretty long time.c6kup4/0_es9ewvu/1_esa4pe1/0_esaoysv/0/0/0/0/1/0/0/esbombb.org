Most likely.

However, you are completely missing my point and misunderstanding what I am trying to say. I am not saying that there were no wizards in that time period that could read, write, and were intelligent, I am saying the vast majority of them were most likely the same as Muggles. Also, a lot of the cool spells we see in the current era are recently invented spells. There is nothing to indicate there were healing spells or cleaning spells back them. It all could have been a simpler version that did smaller things. Think of herbalism and potions.

However, I am pretty certain the four founders were more than just simple â€˜powerful' witches and wizards. I am sure they were learned and scholarly and set out to teach that to the youth. They could most likely read and write, were able to do things others could not.

However, as I said above, this time period is where people believed reading and writing was a gift from God and could not be taught. Most of the people who could read and write were monks and such. Christianity was massive at this point in time.

Perhaps the Muggles considered magicals to be druids of some sort, but Salazar knew the respect and tolerance would not last, hence his fear of them.

However, at the end of the day, there is literally zero canon information on this. For all we know, wizards could be superheroes back then.
