No, they were not. Dumbledore is seen as the rare exception with his behaviour. Again, nothing he really did screamed a traditional wizard. He was far from wise, really. He was intelligent, yes, but not wise.

Also, the Hogwarts we see in 1991 - 1998 would be vastly different from the one in 970. You are overthinking it and stepping food into the trope we see when authors want to make Muggles look stupid and wizards smart.

Modern day education is vastly different from medieval education. Reading back then was not something that was important to the average person. Sure, people read and wrote, but as much as you would think. Wizards being literate and ahead of Muggles makes no sense seeing as they would be such a minority.

Also, back then, people assumed that being able to read was something God gave you. It was not something you could 'learn'.
