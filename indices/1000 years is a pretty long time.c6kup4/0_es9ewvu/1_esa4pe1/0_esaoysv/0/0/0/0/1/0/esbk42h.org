Assuming you mean setting foot? Of course reading wasn't important to the average person, but then, the average person didn't attend school, either, did they? And a large portion of the British wizarding population /did/. Again, with a founder of the school who declared that "wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure" and had a house dedicated to learning.

I'm assuming that the people who believed being able to read could not be taught were, erm, not the ones who could read. Because since there was a portion of the population that could read, they would've had to have been taught, and taught others.
