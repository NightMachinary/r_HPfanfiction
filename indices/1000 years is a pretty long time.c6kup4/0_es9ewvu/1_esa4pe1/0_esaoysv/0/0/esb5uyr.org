The image of wizardry has often been that of a robed scholar sitting in a tower somewhere, the gatherer of arcane knowledge. "Wizard" even means "wise". Plus they had a school a thousand years ago... it seems to make sense that reading and writing would be included. It wasn't like no muggle could read back then, monks and such could, and wizards would have a lot of free time since they had magic to take care of their physical needs.
