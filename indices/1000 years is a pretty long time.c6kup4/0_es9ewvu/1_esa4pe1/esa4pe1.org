  Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

Nobles were just as illiterate. Literacy was confined mostly to monks and some of the ladies of the higher nobility who had the spare time and inclination for it.

And JKR apocrypha indicate that wizarding hygienic practices mirrored those of muggles - they just vanished their shit afterwards.
