Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is a time travel fic where a good chunk of the story takes place at the founding of Hogwarts and it handles the era in an interesting way. Just be forewarned, it's a slash fic. I don't recall finishing it, but the relationships were low key it didn't get explicit or anything.
