Sure does feel good to have this obscure knowledge be useful somewhere. The first thing I learned about Ogham was how to spell my own name too so I can totally believe that! And yeah my name itself takes about an inch of space at the minimum to be legible so I can't think of epics being written with that.

Isn't that culture largely lost to us too? Perhaps the difficulty in preservance of such information was a contributing factor.

Edit: I just remembered, there was also that small arrow at the start to signify from which direction it is meant to be read.
