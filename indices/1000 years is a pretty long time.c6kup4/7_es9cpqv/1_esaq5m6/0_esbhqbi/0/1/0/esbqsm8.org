  wasn't Ogham a single line down the middle with separate dashes on either sides representing different characters?

They absolutely were! As far as we can tell, there was a pretty dramatic shift in usage when you compare the stone inscriptions to the books. The stones were mostly names, while the books used the alphabet to teach Gaelic grammar and poetry. It is doubtful that ogham were really used to write down stories, however.
