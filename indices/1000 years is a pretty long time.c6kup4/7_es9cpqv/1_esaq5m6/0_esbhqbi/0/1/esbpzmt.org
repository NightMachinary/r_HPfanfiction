Huh, I guess I was wrong then. I just thought that while runes are somewhat similar to the Latin alphabet, wasn't Ogham a single line down the middle with separate dashes on either sides representing different characters? I just found it hard to imagine that on a book but I guess it wasn't /that/ hard.
