  Very true. Mind you, I think it likely that most of the old spellbooks are written in Latin or Greek, not any form of English. Or, better yet, in Ancient Runes.

So, "ancient runes" was not a language, it was an alphabet. Specifically a group of alphabets used for Germanic languages and that includes Old English. The Hogwarts founding took place during the transitional period for Old English between Anglo-Saxon runes and the Latin alphabet, which was imported from Ireland to "Britannia" via monks. (I can't recall if it was England in 990 or still separate kingdoms and the Pictish vs Alba transition happened around that time too.)

I'd agree that many old books would be in Latin and Greek, but there would certainly be books written in the Germanic and Celtic language families as well. And those Germanic books would be a hodgepodge of the runic and early Latin alphabets - assuming that early wizards didn't shun the Latin alphabet because of it's introduction to the island via Catholic monks.

Edit - the early Irish and Pictish books /might/ be written in Ogham. (There are untranslated inscriptions in that alphabet for Pictish, even though it's usually associated with Early/Old Irish.) The Irish dropped ogham in favour of an 18 letter Latin alphabet much earlier than the Anglo-Saxons dropped runes, however. I'm not aware of an alphabet other than Latin for early forms of Welsh/Briton/etc.
