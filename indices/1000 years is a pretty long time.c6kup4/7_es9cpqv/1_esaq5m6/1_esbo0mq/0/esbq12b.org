I actually agree with you in your interpretation and have a rather similar head-canon about the subject with the exception that they are used both ways: as an alphabet and as a tool for magic, with the basic alphabet coming first and being the basis for the magical applications that came later. That, at their core, they're just an alphabet.

Here's a bit more debate, just to explain my reasoning (using muggle examples, of course! Can you tell that I kind of adore this subject?)

  Consider that The Tales of Beedle the Bard is said to be translated "from Ancient Runes into English", creating an equivalence.

Consider that The Tales of Beedle the Bard would have been written in middle English, which looked like this:

#+begin_quote
  And it was don aftirward, and Jhesu made iorney by citees and castelis, prechinge and euangelysinge þe rewme of God, and twelue wiþ him; and summe wymmen þat weren heelid of wickide spiritis and syknessis, Marie, þat is clepid Mawdeleyn, of whom seuene deuelis wenten out, and Jone, þe wyf of Chuse, procuratour of Eroude, and Susanne, and manye oþere, whiche mynystriden to him of her riches.

It's mostly legible to be sure, but a bit of head tilting is still required to read it. Add in a different alphabet, and the translation factor goes up a bit. Then there's the subject matter of the book: it's the magical equivalent of the Brothers' Grimm or Aesop, which suggests multiple uses for the runes themselves. Reading/writing vs magic. To me, the fact that it's written in runes just demonstrates that there was more pushback against the Christian latin alphabet in the magical world.

  I choose to consider that these Ancient Runes are a sort of magical cipher
#+end_quote

Cipher runes exist in the muggle world as well, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6k_runestone][this runestone]] is a rather well known example of both ciphers and displacement cryptography alongside the standard use of runes at the time of carving.
