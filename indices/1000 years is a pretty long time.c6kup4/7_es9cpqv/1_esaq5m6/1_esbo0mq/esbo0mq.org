  So, "ancient runes" was not a language, it was an alphabet. Specifically a group of alphabets used for Germanic languages and that includes Old English.

That's what /we Muggles/ call Ancient Runes, but I get the strong impression that Ancient Runes as taught at Hogwarts means something somewhat different. Consider that /The Tales of Beedle the Bard/ is said to be translated "from Ancient Runes into English", creating an equivalence.

In my stories, I choose to consider that these Ancient Runes are a sort of magical cipher, a way to encode magical meaning that has never been spoken, but was instead developed by sorcerers as the most efficient (and hermetic) way to write down the complexities of magical theory; one Runic sentence can contain a spell, its incantation and wand-movement, its effects, /and/ the matrix its magical forces.
