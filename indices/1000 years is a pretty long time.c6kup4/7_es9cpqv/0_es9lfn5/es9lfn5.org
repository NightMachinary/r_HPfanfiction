  Make up your mind as to whether you're following Pottermore or not
#+end_quote

Sorry. Most of Pottermore is kind of... tedious, so I general only get factoids from there in cases like these, where someone else corrects one of my assumptions. Has JK ever talked about if Hogwarts has a school charter, and if so, what's in it?

  It could just as easily be the discretion expected of a servant to the powerful --- e.g. the influential wizards wouldn't have agreed to let their children go to Hogwarts if there was no guarantee that their secrets would be safe.

Good point. That's sort of what I was angling for; it feels like a lot of writers explain things by comparing it to the modern day, which is silly. I think it makes sense that the Sorting Hat /does/ keep children's secrets, at least to some extent, but the /reason/ for that behaviour is very unlikely to be because of a 'right to privacy' such as in the US constitution. 'To keep proprietary/family magics secret' makes a lot more sense. I'm angling for answers to 'why?' type questions here.

As an example, the books never directly address the whole 'a significant fraction of Hogwarts library can't be read by schoolchildren' thing: why? What if the entire library is under the effect of some large scale translation spell, like they have a modern English dictionary and all the books in the library are set to reference it to know what translation to show, and the library can just swap out what dictionary is referenced as language evolves as needed?
