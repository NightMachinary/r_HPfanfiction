I try to let my worldbuilding be consistent in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) and my other stories, though it's not the focus. Various replies to your points, because frankly, this is as much a Discussion as a Request post:

  If books are added to the Hogwarts library at a relatively constant rate each year, then half the library is going to be written in something the average schoolchild cannot read.

Very true. Mind you, I think it likely that most of the old spellbooks are written in Latin or Greek, not any form of English. Or, better yet, in Ancient Runes.

  There are lots of other minor details, such as how Hogwarts would not have been built with flush toilets since those weren't invented until something like 1592,

That's acknowledged on Pottermore. The entrance of the Chamber of Secrets was originally a run-of-the-mill trapdoor, but in the 19th century, the construction of the modern plumbing system threatened to expose it, so a Gaunt (who still knew where the Chamber was) arranged to be put in charge of the operations and took the opportunity to completely redo the entrance mechanism.

  or how the Sorting Hat probably doesn't have specific instructions about protecting children's secrets since the concept of universal rights like the right to privacy is a modern notion.

The Wizarding World is more progressive than the Muggle world about many things, even though it is backwards in its own ways. I don't think this sort of concern can necessarily scale from the Muggle to Wizarding customs, even prior to the Statute.

Regardless, "not spilling the children's secrets" isn't necessarily a matter of "universal rights". It could just as easily be the discretion expected of a servant to the powerful --- e.g. the influential wizards wouldn't have agreed to let their children go to Hogwarts if there was no guarantee that their secrets would be safe. Or, to be less cynical about it, just plain kindness; just because it's not widely seen as basic universal human rights, doesn't mean that spilling someone's secrets without their consent wasn't seen as a crummy thing to do.

  Maybe the reason everyone is looking towards the Minister for Magic so heavily is because wizards only very recently switched over from magical kings and this whole 'democracy' thing is regarded as a newfangled and weird idea.

Make up your mind as to whether you're following Pottermore or not; per Pottermore the Ministry followed from a Wizards' Council, not a monarchy. Which makes sense to me --- I get the sense that wizards are fundamentally individualist sorts, who'd really rather not have to deal with any government at all and just sit in their towers and manors minding their own business.
