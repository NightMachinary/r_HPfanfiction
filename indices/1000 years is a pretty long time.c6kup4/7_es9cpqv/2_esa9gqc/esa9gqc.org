Personally I would think wizards mirror muggles quite a bit. Think on what it would be like if the president controlled the major news sources. Especially if not believing what you're told by the prophet/ministry is frowned upon and you're looked at as only a conspiracy theorist. A lot of people blindly believe what their chosen news source tell them so if the vast majority of news sources were the ministry's servants essentially then the vast majority of the population would likely believe it. We see through Harry's eyes only in the books and other information is pretty limited in scope and a lot of people don't like considering other things canon /cough/ vanishing poop /cough/ cursed child /cough/ and Harry is a special case in that world. How many people do you think met the minister personally in more private settings who wasn't one of the people in his direct employ or other higher ups in the government. Combine and control over the news with blackmail or bribery and people who know the truth would probably keep quiet.

There's also that if it doesn't effect you personally you're less likely to care.

I've always hated that a gaunt (proud descendants of Slytherin) would be willing to make the chambers entrance into a girls bathroom. My headcanon has always been that there's a portal in the sinks that can only be accessed through parseltounge. It would explain why it couldn't be accessed without a parselmouths help as destroying the sinks would destroy the portal. Granted someone would have to find it and want to destroy it and thats the reason it would still be there. Plus other doors maybe in the dungeons because if Slytherin dorms are in the dungeons it seems likely that Slytherin spent a great deal of time in the dungeons.
