In later books he try's to unite the houses. They're not close, but no Ginny bashing.

I think in only a few of the ones I listed are him and Ginny friends, but pretty sure none of those have Ginny bashing. Must love quidditch they are friends though. If a Ginny bashing one did slip in, I'm super sorry. I have not read some of these in a while, but I'm pretty sure these don't have it. Oh wait... No the M preg one has Weasley bashing, but Ginny died... I can't believe I forgot that! I just remembered a scene where Harry was thinking fondly of her, so I linked it.
