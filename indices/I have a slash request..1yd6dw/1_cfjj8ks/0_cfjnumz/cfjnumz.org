Thanks, you've given me a nice long list that should last me a while :)

I didn't realize that Harry is friends with Ginny in Saving Connor. I read part of the first one and didn't get into it, but I got the feeling that he was going to drift away from the Gryffindors as time went on, and he became more and more a part of Slytherin.
