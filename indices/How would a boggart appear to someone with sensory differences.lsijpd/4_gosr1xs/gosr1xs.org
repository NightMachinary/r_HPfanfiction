I really like an interpretation of boggarts as using some rudimentary mind magic to determine what you fear. The boggart would simply grab a potential eminent fear from the person if the fear is more "edible", then fill in the other senses if there are other people around.

On that note, I really like interpretations that the boggart in 3rd year was "trained" to only do banal fears. Not necessarily intelligent, but roughly at the level of a particularly smart dog.
