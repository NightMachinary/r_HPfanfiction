We don't really know too many details about boggarts, but my guess would be that the boggarts would turn into the beetles, even though the victim can't see them.

My reasoning is that boggarts seem to simply turn into what their victim is afraid of (or some loose representation thereof), regardless of whether or not it actually scares them. When Lupin, for example, was faced with a boggart, it became a full moon. But Lupin is almost certainly not actually afraid of the moon, but of what it does to him, so I don't think the boggart is likely to actually get much fear out of him.

There almost certainly would still be other sensory inputs. I am almost certain that boggarts make sounds in canon, and I am fairly certain they are generally solid, so they should be able to be felt too (though I don't think we ever see them try to actually attack anyone, even when the thing they're pretending to be would, so they might generally not be interested in touching their victims). We know that Harry's boggart produced an aura similar to that of a real dementor, but weaker, so it's probably safe to assume that they can replicate smell and other sensory inputs too.
