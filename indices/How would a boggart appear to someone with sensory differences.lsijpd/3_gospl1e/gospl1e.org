Well boggarts seem to be able to do a very thorough job of duplicating the creatures, not only sound and sight, but even strange things like a dementor's despair-inducing presence.

These transformations are the same for everyone and described as shapeshifting.

I'd therefore assume they physically turn into whatever is feared, with all that entails regardless of whether you can actually see/hear etc.

If that wasn't the case then just closing your eyes would be a very easy way to handle boggarts.
