Grow Young With me is the best of that genre imo. One already commented, Behind Blue Eyes. It's decent, but too angsty to my taste. You can also try:

It's a fine read if you can overlook the fact that it was a love at first sight story. Literally, they looked at the other and fell in love right there. Almost ruined the story for me tbh, but the author fixed that and it turned out to be better toward the end.

A quirky story where you get to experience it from the OC's POV. Quite interesting despite its length. The part where the OC looks forward to Harry's return each summer, and her imagination runs wild when he was away at Hogwarts really put a nice spin on the canon events that we all know too well already.
