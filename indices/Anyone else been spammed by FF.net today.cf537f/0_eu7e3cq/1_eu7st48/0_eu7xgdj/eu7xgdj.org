While its true that it is needless, if we are being honest it merely seems worse because it is so plainly stated on the internet (like reading internet text without emotional or context clues).

Things like this happen a lot in the real world too (have seen it both in my work and social life), but they are rarely ever broadcast publicly the way the internet does. It generally goes along the lines of:

1. Small tizzy between two or more parties
2. One party takes small measure to stymie other because of position of power
3. Slighted party gets angry, reacts to power play by trying to use leverage of their own
4. Retaliation places outside parties in line-of-fire as well, grievance becomes public
5. Results in one or both parties being neutered, but generally nothing systemic changes

Blunt, but it happens quite a bit.
