I'd love a Chrestomanci X Harry Potter crossover. Diana Wynne Jones seems to have a better handle on what government for a small population of Magical Britain should look like. Magical Houses too, imagine if The Burrow were more like The House of Many Ways.

Stonewall High becomes the school from â€˜Witch Week' and when Chrestomanci comes on the scene he whisks the witches to an alternate dimension where magic hasn't the same stigma e.g. Hogwarts.

Harry can travel in his dreams much like Christopher Chant, Voldemort's Horcrux is actually an anchor akin to the multiple Chrestomanci lives.

The Magicians of Caprona give material for an Italian Triwizard competitor.
