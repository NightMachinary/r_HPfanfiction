I've been planning to write an AU with elements from Howl's Moving Castle (both the film and the books), but haven't got around to it just yet. less replacing characters one-to-one, and more taking elements and converting them. So Harry might open a magic shop similar to the one's Howl runs, I might introduce the idea of a magical oath to the crown like the one witches and wizards have to swear in Howl's universe, etc.

So far it's not very fleshed out though, so I don't have a plot readily in mind.

I haven't seen any already written AUs/Crossovers for this combo yet, but if I turn any up i'll be sure to come back and comment them. It's always fun to look at HP AUs with other proprties and seeing how it effects the characters, the magic system, and the world! :)
