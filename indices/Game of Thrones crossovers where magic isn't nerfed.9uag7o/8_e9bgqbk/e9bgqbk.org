There aren't many worth talking about.

I would say that "Last Hero's Heir" by Newmic should be on this list. The story is set prior to the book or show canon and starts in the late 270's or early 280's AC. Basically, Harry and the house-elves arrive in the world of ASoIaF/GoT and unleash holy hell. Some minor spoilers for the setting: turns out Godric Gryffindor fought against the Others eight thousand years ago and house-elves are Children of the Forest. How that all came about is actually pretty interesting and definitely a step up from the typically /very original/ methods of "Harry is reborn in Westeros" or "Harry travels worlds for no believable reason whatsoever". Sadly the author never properly finished the story and when I looked just now, it seems to have been deleted.

As unlikable as I find the Harry in Noodlehammer's recent work, the author knows how to worldbuild and knows how to work in original ideas. Because the story begins two or three generations earlier there won't be any stages of canon in this one.

My favorite out of that genre fitting your request is "The Wizard of Harrenhal" which has already been mentioned. I'm a bit sad though that the author won't be writing the Dune crossover he teased us with at the end.
