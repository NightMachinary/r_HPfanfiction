I want to add one thing to this fic recommendation:

Every single wizard and witch in this fic is a psychopath. Harry, Neville, Daphne, Blaise,... everyone. You could argue that they are just stone cold soldiers at the point in which the fic introduces us to them, but if you want recognizable Harry Potter characters, this fic is not for you.
