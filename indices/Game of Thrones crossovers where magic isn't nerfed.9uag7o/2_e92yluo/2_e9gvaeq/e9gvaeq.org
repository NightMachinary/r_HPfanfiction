That entire intro is plagiarised from another fic. I remember the other fic having voldemort doing a ritual to go to another world, but until that point, this fic's intro is a pretty nast copy paste job.

You can tell as well, the writing not copied has a much worse quality and a weird tonal shift. Really shoddy work, and pretty disgraceful to steal others' work.

EDIT: Found the fic its copying as well, "Im still here," by kathryn518, linked: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/]] Just compare the intros. Its pretty pathetic.
