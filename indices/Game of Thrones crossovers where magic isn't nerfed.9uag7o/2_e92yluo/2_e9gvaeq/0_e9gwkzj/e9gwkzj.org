Sure, and the your point is ? OP asked for a x-over of GoT where magic isn't nerfed. I gave a suggestion. Never said it was a masterpiece. Don't see your need to bash it. Also, kathryn seems to be real nice when it comes to people using her ideas, considering there's a fic where even the whole premise of I'm Still Here is identical, called From Ruin. So I don't see your point of "plagiarizing" a FANFICTION. But Ok. You're free to do and say whatever you want. Best of luck.
