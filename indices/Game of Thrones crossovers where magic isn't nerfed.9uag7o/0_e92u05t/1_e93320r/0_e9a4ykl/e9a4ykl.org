I have just read it myself, and it is good in quite unique way. It is way better than most crossovers that make Harry respawn, so to say, in a new body. This Harry has a big story-background that enables him to do as he pleases, because we already have an established count of his abilities. And while the views of the author certainly bleed into the story, one must treat it like what it is: fantasy. There is no need to be offended if one disagrees.
