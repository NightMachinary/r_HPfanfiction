I hit this thread last night wanting some reads and did most of the ones noted here.

Best one was Winter Witch, by far. Hermione felt a bit OOC at the end due to how fast she accepted medieval standards related to justice and killing, although it felt more like the author just skipped over some critical development than truely OOC. It is written in a more 'HP' style, heavy focus on individual characters and their progress.

The other one that worked well was The Wizard of Harrenall. This was written in more Game of Thrones style narrative rather than HP narrative (Lots of jumping around and skipping critical events, leaving readers to fill in).

I skipped A Road to Hell as it was described as everyone being psychotic, and I hate it when GOT fics insert characters and they gleefully dive into brutality, as if the only reason they weren't murdering killing bastards was because society was stopping them.

​

I also skipped Discordant Note, as it was a sequel.

Difference one Man can Make needs an editor. It suffers badly from the 'whole first chapter of background that has no impact on the rest of the fic and could be cut'. Harry's motivation seemed way off for why he stayed in the north, he is entirely too comfortable with leading/politics given his previous development (and why not go south if he liked politics). Romance also wasn't great. Unimpressed

Legend of the Gryphon had an interesting concept, but I couldn't read their version of Ginny/Sirus as related to HP cannon and they didn't seem be challenged much by their situations. Didn't make it far in.

​

State of Grace was... meh? Certainly a fix-it, with things going way too well for everyone involved given that it is an insert where the character doesn't know the plot beforehand. Also the romance is forced and not convincing.
