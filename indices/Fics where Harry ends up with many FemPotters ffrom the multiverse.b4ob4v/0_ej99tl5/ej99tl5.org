Sounds potentially hilarious, but there's a lack of fem!Harry fanfiction tropes to draw on.

When it comes to male Harry, you've got your usual indy!Harry, super!Harry, abused!Harry, whatever. Put them all into one fic and a seasoned reader will instantly recognize the tropes. But fem!Harry fics just don't exist in large enough numbers for this.

Of course, you can still make up distinct fem!Potters with their own backstories, but you'll be missing out on the parody aspect.
