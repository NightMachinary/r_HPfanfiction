I've got a few:

linkffn(8233288) is Lunar Harmony going back, though it's also full of Dumble-bashing, as well as Molly, Ron, and Ginny bashing.

linkffn(5511855) is Harry and Bellatrix - Haven't read it myself yet, but it's been on my queue for awhile\\
linkffn(5725656) is a twist in that the travellers go to the future\\
and linkffn(4101650) shows Harry, Ron, and Ginny travelling

There's also linkffn(5664828) - which features Harry and Hermione going back in time, but honestly this isn't very highly recommended by me, because this guy makes robst look subtle.

I also have linkffn(4655545), which is a parody of this sort of thing
