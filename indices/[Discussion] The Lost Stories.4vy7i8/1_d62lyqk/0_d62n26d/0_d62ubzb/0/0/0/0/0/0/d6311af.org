I will probably reread them all. My problem is that I have been reading fanfic for so many years that the plots get muddled when I try to remember a title or theme. Sometimes I will start a fic, then start to remember it when i'm a few chapters in and it feels like reuniting with an old friend. I cried when that harddrive when down. I am slowly creating a new backup with google drive, thanks again!
