I might be able to help you here if who I'm thinking about is Maya. She did pull all her stories down and put up a PDF of her complete works. I just combed through it and it does have "The Kids Are Alright". It's not a terribly long story, though and focuses on Harry and Draco, I think? I haven't read it, just skimmed it.

Does this sound like it?
