Not Harry, but Ginny finds a lot of Voldemort's old journals in Chamber Girl when she gets stuck there. (basic story: The Trio never figure out where the Chamber is. The Diary Horcrux is killed by sheer dumb luck because the Basilisk is hungry enough to drip venom and it lands on the diary. Ginny remains in the Chamber until Harry's fifth year, surviving on her wits.)
