I like how linkffn(What's her name in hufflepuff) addresses the martial arts knowledge trope:

  Funny thing is I actually already know martial arts.

  I've been practicing in and out of various dojos since I was 14. I had six years of karate, four years of aikdo, and a year of jujitsu. And as the years went by, and I accumulated more and more knowledge; I finally realized one undeniable truth.

  I kind of suck at it.

The next paragraph is great as well:

  Although, if Bellatrix Lestrange ever tries to hold me down and write mudblood on my arm, that crazy bitch is going to be very very surprised. That's a pretty rare example though of being attacked by someone with similar height/weight (assuming Bellatrix isn't built like a tank and Rowling forgot to mention it). Hell, maybe I could teach Hermione a few tricks? Although, I don't know how 'Hey you wanna wrestle?' wont' sound insane and weird.
