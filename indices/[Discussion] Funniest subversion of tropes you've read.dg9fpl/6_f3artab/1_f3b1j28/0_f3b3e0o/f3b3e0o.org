The first seven chapters suck because the MC is mute and therefore, there is not a lot of dialogue. They are also pretty dark. But once you get to the end of the first year, it gets a lot better (Susan learns sign language, so you get dialogue, the fun begins). It's an OP Harry power trip, but ot avoids a lot of the pitfalls usually associated with them.

I have to say that, despite being a completly bonkers crack fic, it's the only example of a good Hermione redemption/reconciliation arc I can think of.
