The silent world of Cassandra Evans has a wonderful "sibling" arc which is introduced in a manner that you'd expect bloodshed, but a few chapters later FemHarry and her sister are pulling a Taylor Swift dance routine while cosplaying Sailor Moon (might have been a different anime, not sure). Obviously it's a crack fic, but it does crack very well.

Then again, the entire fic is one giant trope subversion as it starts in a really dark place and 7 chapters later I was laughing a lot.
