I think what really made me lose my shit with that one is that the story went out of its way to appear somewhat /plausible/ while still having the dumbest premise in the world. Like it ran on whimsy, but it was closer to say a British sketch where characters behave absurdly but still adhering to some human beheaviour than to say Thirty Hs just nonstop crack.

Something about the fact that Harry defeating Voldemort with a wrestling move would /technically/ work with canon since this was book 1 era where Quirrelmort would die to his touch just makes it even funnier to me. Everything about that story makes me laugh.
