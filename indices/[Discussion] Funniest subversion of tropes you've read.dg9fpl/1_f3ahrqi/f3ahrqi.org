I'm not quite sure it counts, but I know that "Harry but raised by X" stories were really popular for a while and they all seemed to take themselves really seriously while still bordering on self-parody.

So when I was reading a random story that appeared to take itself deadly seriously up until the reveal that Harry was raised by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson I just burst out laughing and didn't stop until the story was finished.
