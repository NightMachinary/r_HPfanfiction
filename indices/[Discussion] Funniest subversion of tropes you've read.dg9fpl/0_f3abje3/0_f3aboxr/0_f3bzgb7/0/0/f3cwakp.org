Linkffn(A Black Comedy)

It get a lot of hate on this sub. But honestly I think most of the hate comes from how often it gets rec'd and held up as the paragon of funny/semi-crack fics. It's definitely a hell of a fun read, but I'd liken it to the new 21 and 22 Jump Street movies. Silly and immature with a few really clever moments
