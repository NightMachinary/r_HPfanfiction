There may have been some criticism further back, but the first time I saw people heavily panning the fic was about 10 months ago in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a1vbb8/which_objectively_amazing_fanfics_do_you/?depth=15][this thread]]. The caveats of "this fic is funny, but..." or "it hasn't aged well" seemingly only became common after Draquia [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfx8ar/fic_review_a_black_comedy_by_nonjon_the_au_in/?depth=15][posted a critique]] five months ago.
