What Would Slytherin Harry Do?

Short (40k words), but really good, almost good as I 2nd on the way to greatness.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

Perfect Slytherins - Tales From The First Year

a funny Adams family cross over with slytherin!harry

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape. Feared Potions Professor. Head of Slytherin House. For years, he had eagerly awaited the son of the person he hated more than all others. And if there was one thing he discovered, it was that Harry Potter was NOT the son of James Potter. What he was, would change his life, and the lives of everything around him. The saviour had returned, not as the Perfect Gryffindor, as so many had hoped, but as the Perfect Slytherin, and the fall out would be felt for all time.
