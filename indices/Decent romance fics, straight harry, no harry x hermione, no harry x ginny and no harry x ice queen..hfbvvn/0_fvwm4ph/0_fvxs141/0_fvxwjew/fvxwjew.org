This fic is set a few years after Hogwarts. So I believe that would make Gabrielle 16 (or older). In addition I don't remember if it uses the common veela trope of veela looking much younger than they are until they are able to handle their allure and then their looks quickly catch up. (I.e., That at the tournament Gabrielle was really 12-13 but looked 8)
