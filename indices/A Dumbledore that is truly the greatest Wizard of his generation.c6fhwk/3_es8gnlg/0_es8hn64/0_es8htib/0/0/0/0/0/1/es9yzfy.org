Malfoy Sr. and the like definitely do not pop in often, and Dumbledore undoubtedly wants to know any time that they do. Random adults showing up and wandering around is obviously not good.

If someone wants to schedule a visit, they can be approved ahead of time.

  Hogwarts wards extend to hogsmeade - the surveillance ones, not defensive - and the forbidden forest has loads of named creatures, and is definitely under the wards.

Marauder's map covers Hogwarts. The castle. Dumbledore shouldn't have any problems with this either.

  Last but not least, I doubt dumbles himself is capable of making such a spell, given he's good at transfiguration, not charms

Dumbledore is not McGonagall. He is said to be great at every school of magic. He published articles in a scholar journal for charms while he was still a student.

He was said to have done things that the examiner never thought possible with a wand, and that included his transfiguration /and/ charms exam. He came up with the communication method for the patronus spell.
