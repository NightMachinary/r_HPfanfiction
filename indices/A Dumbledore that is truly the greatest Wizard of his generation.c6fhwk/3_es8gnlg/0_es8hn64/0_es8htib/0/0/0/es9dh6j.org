The marauder's map works based on the data picked up by the hogwarts wards, so, while it was certainly an awesome invention for a bunch of school kids, but dumbles really should already have access to those same wards - not just the lockdown function, but also the surveillance functions the map piggybacks off. _____

The question here is - (besides for plot purposes) why would dumbles not already know about pettigrew, or moody, or quirrelmort? I think it's the fact that the wards, if queried, give either a broad sweep of data without specifics - 261 humans and 56 house elves and 48 centaurs and(...) (or maybe just 549 living creatures) Or tell him about one specific person - Harry Potter, human, powerful magically, malformed soul infection, 1 active prophecy.

After all, dumbledore is just a single human, and I somehow doubt occlumency turns his mind into the veritable supercomputer (realistically mainframe but whatever) it needs to be not only to store the data on all the students, but also check them against his memories for security purposes.

Also, if he set up the wards to feed that data into a spell that checks the data against a list of "not authorised" people, the only successful intruders would be voldy (who dumbles knew was alive but who was not only a wraith, but himself a DARK LORD. Sneaking past the wards doesnt seem that impossible a thing for one of the greatest - terrible, yes - but nevertheless one of the greatest wizards of the age) and Sirius Black (In this case I honestly suapect dumbles forgot all about him being innocent and probably assumed him guilty of something or other - and he was not present for the meeting deciding sirius' fate, as the... 'chairman' (I forgot the terminology hehe) was someone else (either Crouch Sr. or Bagnold). It's also possible sirius and the marauders changed their names for the hogwarts wards through the method the map called on the wards. And that guy's Padfoot, not Sirius Black, the name on the list, so the wards didnt detect him). Fake-Moody (Crouch Jr.) and Peter Pettigrew, being presumed dead, were likely not on the list.

- all numbers and the report were random things as examples, not thought out according to research into canon details on wards

Damn, I made a textwall...
