Again, even if he's a charms master himself, I doubt he's an expert at the charms equivalent of programming an AI to manage it. Marauder's map covers only hogwarts, but there are secret areas that the hogwarts wards can pick up, but which the map can't. Weasley twins discovered one such secret passage in canon.

Dumbles Shouldnt have a problem with using his brain to process the location and name of each and every person in hogwarts? I dont think so... And I doubt the wards cant pick up magical creatures, so as I said, The amount of data involved requires a mainframe to handle by human tech of the year 2019. Can Dumbles accomplish the same in his own time? Without a large nunber of geniuses sharing their innovative ideas to develop the framework for this?

Not to mention, Dumbles was not the only headmaster. All the headmasters before him probably had ways to do the same thing. Maybe the same one technique, maybe they had a number of techniques between them, maybe they all together built the list thing we're talking about. It's honestly the logical thing to do, and the only reason that wouldnt have happened is the perpetual stupidity of the wizarding world infecting the headmasters.

Regarding the hogsmeade thing, in DH, there was something about the wards letting people in hogwarts know that there were DE's casting spells in hogsmeade.
