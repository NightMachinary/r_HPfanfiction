With the list, there's the problem that people like Malfoy Sr. and the like often pop in, as people on the board of governers, and Hogwarts wards extend to hogsmeade - the surveillance ones, not defensive - and the forbidden forest has loads of named creatures, and is definitely under the wards.

The number of notifications for the headmaster and the number of alterations for the headmaster to make to the list would be huge. And have you heard of the plot for watch dogs 2? Trying to make a set of rules that can classify people is complicated when only including humans, and also intrusive. A spell that will scan new faces and determine if they are a threat or need to be reported would require either legilimency or require gathering loads of data on a person, because the amount of reasons why a person would be a threat is huge.

And any such spell would not be safe from alteration themselves.

Last but not least, I doubt dumbles himself is capable of making such a spell, given he's good at transfiguration, not charms.

Also, many of the concepts needed to build a system like that are hard for people to put together even in the modern day and age, and only emerged after a LOT of innovation.

I didnt consider other people to help dumbledore because those people are security risks themselves, be it because they can be compromised by voldy's grandmaster-level legilimency, death, or plain not being as sophisticated and reliable in their analysis of a person as dumbles would be.
