Even if he wasn't literally intentionally baiting him, he still took the object that Voldemort was willing to break into Gringotts to get and put it in Hogwarts. That's basically baiting him, you don't set traps and defenses unless you think they might be needed. You can't really argue that.

Well, we've never seen him show wards that do the same thing, we've never seen /any/ other magic that does what the map does for that matter, and we've got some evidence that he does not. He didn't know about Peter, despite the fact that he came up on the map. He didn't know about Sirius breaking in until after the fact. He didn't know about Barty impersonating Moody.
