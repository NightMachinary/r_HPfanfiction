I guess I'm not really seeing your point here, especially since it seems to be unsubstantiated. I don't recall anything in canon suggesting that Dumbledore couldn't create something like the Marauders map (or that any student couldn't with, with a bit of effort). The question is - why would he, especially for a school he was headmaster of?
