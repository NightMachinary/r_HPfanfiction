I can't see any scenario in which you wouldn't be laughed at for such a demand, though. You have Moody's eye, which I'm sure can be applied to glasses, the homenum revelio spell, the trace, and a few other things that allow the tracking and revealing of other humans. Not to mention the spell they used is, seemingly, legal and can be cast by anyone with enough skill.
