Talent may not know age, but skill and overall competence generally does. Particularly when the older person is stated and presented as being more naturally talented anyway.

The map is just an example. Where are the amazing examples of magic that someone like Dumbledore should be capable of?

For example, he puts the philosopher's stone in Hogwarts. He /knows/ Voldemort is after it. Seems like he should be pretty motivated to put some effort into some good security and whatever he comes up with should blow the map out of the water.
