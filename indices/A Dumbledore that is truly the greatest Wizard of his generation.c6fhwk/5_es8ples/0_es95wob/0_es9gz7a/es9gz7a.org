Talent knows no age. Technically being an animagus is hard but they all did it anyway. Also the way the map is designed is sneaky.

It's not that I think that marauders are better at charms, its not just Dumbledore's forte. He has little interest in it. Like how Einstein may be a theoretical physicist he can invent a new type of refrigeration since someone got killed by an old version so he modified his but it is rare for him to actually invent household stuff, Dumbledore may be just as good but he has little reason to bother with it since it didn't interest him. He can do a fidelus charm and it is interestingand vital enough to learn.

Further more unless one knows the map's password it insults anyone who uses common detection spell on it. There is little reason for one to suspect there is something more to the map since it was owned by a group of mischievous friends. it is not a stretch to think they just made it insult someone. He had no reason to tinker with it, it's a cool charm but it won't interest him since it's not his Forte. You don't use curse breaker level detection in student property just because it insults you. Portraits can insult you directly and it is a step advance to a insulting paper.

The marauders being animagus might get his attention, but technically someone had to tell the three that an animagus registers as fully animal in animal form and will not be harmed by werewolf. that tidbit is obscure enough that I can guess who left that info lying around.
