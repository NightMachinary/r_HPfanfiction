I think the map is incredibly valuable, it would stop quirrel, crouch. If he put an alarm on it for some death eaters names he would know exactly when Draco started his invasion (wouldnt have mattered in the books, but what if they decided to attack at like 2pm when there are classes going?).

Also if the death eaters ever breached hogwarts in a battle, it would be a complete game changer, just throw shit at them when they cant know youre there, but you do(some grenade/flashbang like stuff, maybe the weasley darkness powder). Knowing where the enemy is crucial, especially when they could be invisible.

I think that he should have made the map after year 1, if not earlier. Remember: its not only good against what already happened, it would be great in pretty much any situation where voldemort tries anything at hogwarts.

The way it was in the books, Voldemort could realistically tell his death eaters to just go in through the room of requirement, find a student, polyjuice themselves, then go to the great hall during lunch and use fiendfyre. That is a very obvious plan that dumbledore should have taken precautions against, especially when he knew that hogwarts is breachable (crouch, sirius, imperius).
