I have a half-formed headcanon that the Marauders simply found the map as a leftover from when Hogwarts was built (four founders, four Marauders, [[https://cutpasteprint.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/coincidence.gif][coincidence?]]), and they simply modified it to contain their names and personalities instead.

I like to imagine Hermione finding this out and being outraged that an Original Founder's Object was basically graffiti'd like this.
