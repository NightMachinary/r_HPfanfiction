Animagus is fucking useless. The only time it was use in Battle against Deatheater is NEVER HAPPEN BEFORE.

Map will help Dumbledore in his mission, assist defeat of Voldermort, protect Hogwarts yada yada yada, but he never realize it's capability, and when I mean "he" I mean JK Rowling just like how JK Rowling just ditch the Time Turner, never appearing in the future book let alone mentioning it once.

He already shown his ability as the greatest Wizard of all time by wrecking Voldermort in 1v1, but he still a human with flaw who gotten himself disarm by a fucking student in his most vulnerable moment.
