1. One of many things I like about linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) are its chapters 68, (and 75!, but that's different point), 76, 82, and 83, whole story of the East African War. It is a bit problematic in the context of the whole story (because it is too big, it infringes on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][the unity of the story]]), but it is a great story just on itself. Of course, the problem JKR never fully resolved is that she didn't follow venerable rule of “Show, don't tell” in the case of Albus Dumbledore. Everybody is talking about him, how is the greatest wizard of all times, but nobody has ever seen him to anything superwizardry since he defeated Grindelwald (and that's a bit long time ago). Climax of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries is the only moment when we see him going full force (and by far the biggest wizarding duel in whole series), but it is too brief and it is only one case.
2. Do we know how he felt about being called this? Wasn't he as reluctant towards his fame as Harry is to be The-Boy-Who-Lived? I really like Dumbledore in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) with all his reluctance and a bit of disdain towards the general public for putting him on a pedestal so much, and his inability to resist it.
