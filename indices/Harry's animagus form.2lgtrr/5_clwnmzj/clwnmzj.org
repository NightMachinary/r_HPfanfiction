In the story i haven't written yet, i have Harry as an Octopus. Abandoned on the streets and learning to pickpocket, he has an affinity for the creatures that can squeeze through the tightest of spaces to hide or escape, and the long, dextrous tentacles/arms work well with his sticky-fingered youth.
