At least it's not a Phoenix, probably the most popular form given to Harry.

I think much of it is imitation, as many reasonably popular (by reviews) stories use this idea (RossWrock's /Harry Potter and the Power of Time/, jbern's /Bungle in the Jungle/, MissAnnThropic's /Vox Corporis/, LignumVitae86's /Harry Potter and the Path to Greatness/ are +three+ *not three* examples off the top of my head). Also, unless one chooses to make his form that of a magical animal (which isn't seen in canon) or a bird of some sort, there's a limit to what forms he might do that would be superior to his human body. Great cat, wolf, gorilla, bear, snake... That's pretty much it.

Edit: Lol.
