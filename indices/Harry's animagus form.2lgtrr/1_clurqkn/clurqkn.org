I tend to dislike stories where Harry is an animagus. It's fine in an AU where he's raised by his parents or Sirius, but in all other cases, he has shown no inclination towards transfiguration nor a want to do it. Worse is when it's some super-rare magical being. Nearly as bad is when he has the same form as either James or Sirius (because Harry is /not/ like them). A black panther makes no sense for Harry - it doesn't represent him very well (seriously: he is not a predator)... but it could be much worse.
