I've read a handful where he was a wolf.

I don't think it's necessarily a lack of creativity or anything, we just don't know enough about why certain animals are people's animagus form (or patronus), so people either go for dramatic or strength, while matching whatever personality they're trying to give their Harry.

The "Living with Danger" series is actually pretty good about having many varied animagus forms, though I won't say what because one of the mini plotlines is the kids figuring them out.
