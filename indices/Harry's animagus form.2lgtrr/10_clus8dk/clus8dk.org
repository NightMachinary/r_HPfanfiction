I mean, if you think about it a panther fits rather well no?

Sure you get the black hair/fur but in terms of personality it sort of fits.

Panther's are solitary and territorial but don't go looking for fights just like wolves.

Think of Harry, mostly solitary especially during his early years at the Dursley's and is territorial when it comes to things he cares about, friends/people he perceives as family.

Maybe I'm reading too much into it but if a form is determined by personality panthers at least fit a little bit.
