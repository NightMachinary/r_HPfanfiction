Two Neville/Bear stories:

The most recent one I remember is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707895/7/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-Bureaucracy-of-Failure][Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure]] (second story in the series, I've linked to the chapter that he first appears as a bear). The story is a cross-over with WH40K. Harry doesn't have an animagus in this story.

The other one that sticks in mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/7/Partners][Partners]] by muggledad. (I've linked to the chapter that they first become animagi). HP/DG. This story actually has Harry becoming a Bengal Tiger.
