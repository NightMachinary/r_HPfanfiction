That's not his animagus form in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]], and more often than not the stories I read he is some sort of super magical never before seen dragon, or phoenix, or some other super powered form that has zero use apart from making Harry special. I do like its use in TLIL though, and I would recommend the fic to everyone.
