With my [in-progress] fic, he's likely to be a Kneazle with a sleek black figure.

It was going to be a Merlin [a small falcon] for my sheer amusement, though when my Harry developed broom-less flight abilities I had to re-write.

Kneazles are apparently good at sensing moods in fanon/canon so I figured my Super!Harry could do with some cross-over of that in his non-animagus life.
