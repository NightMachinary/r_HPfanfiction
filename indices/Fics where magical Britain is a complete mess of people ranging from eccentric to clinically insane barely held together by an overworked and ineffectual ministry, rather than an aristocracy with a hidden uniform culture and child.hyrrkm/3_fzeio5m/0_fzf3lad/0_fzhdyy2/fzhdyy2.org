I'm divided in the matter between thinking that a bunch of children could realistically do a much better work than the Fudge administration and believing that the adult politics would potentially let children in the game merely for the entertainment value (kids playing politics could be cute, like when you are doing an important research for uni while petting your cat, really, it doesn't make it faster -probably the exact opposite- but it helps me a lot in relaxing while doing all the boring work).
