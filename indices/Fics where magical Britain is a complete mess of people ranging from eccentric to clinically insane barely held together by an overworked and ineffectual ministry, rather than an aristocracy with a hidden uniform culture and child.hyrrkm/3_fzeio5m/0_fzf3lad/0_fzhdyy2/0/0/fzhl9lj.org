If you want a current real-life parallel, look at Boris Johnson who refused to take the covid issue seriously until he himself got sick from it. Despite all his flaws, he is a well educated man and quite an apt politician (because let's be realistic... not everyone is cut out to become the Prime Minister of a country). Yet sometimes people choose to ignore a threat in order to maintain the comfort of peaceful times. Such was Fudge and, honestly, at least in my case, I don't know how I would have reacted in that situation. Sure, one might say "But Dumbledore knows his shit... how can you not trust him?". Well in the last book Dumbledore is revealed to not have been entirely flawless and despite the image of the old all-wise mentor that is projected to us through Harry's eyes, he is still a human (a very wise one) with flaws and defects.
