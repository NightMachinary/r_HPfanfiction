  Barty was bound and stunned and Fudge had him killed as soon as he could without letting anyone know, that's not acting well, that's a blatant cover-up.
#+end_quote

That's never even implied. The Dementor went loose and, as is its nature, punished someone who had escaped Azkaban with a kiss.

  He had several eyewitnesses telling Sirius Black was innocent AND that there was another guy, the real mass murderer, free, he didn't do ANYTHING to investigate, he just tried to cover up.
#+end_quote

He also had a more credible eye-witness who said Sirius bewitched the three pre-teens claiming he was innocent. Also Dumbledore did not interfere.

  Fudge is the worst kind of politician, petty, incompetent, dumb, gullible, and malicious. He has NO redeeming qualities, the only good thing he did for Harry was waiving his guardian authorization to go to Hogsmeade, to try and gain his favour.
#+end_quote

I agree with most parts except the fact that his willingness to waive Harry's guardian authorization to go to Hogsmeade was a good thing. That's very irresponsible when you know a supposed criminal is on the loose aiming to kill that person.

  Umbridge by the book and movie was clearly NOT trying to appear as a gentle or good person, it's noted several times her voice is false, her eyes are full of hatred, she's bigoted. Everyone knew that. Fudge knew that, he sent her there to quell what he was a coup d' etat, Fudge gave her full authority to terrorize children and did his best to stop the staff trying to mitigate it.
#+end_quote

Umbridge is an evil woman but she knew how to play the political games better than most other characters because otherwise she would never have gotten so high up. She knew how to suck up the superiors but treated those she deemed as inferiors like shit. The Hogwarts staff and students are seen by her as inferiors but she does make a small attempt at being the charismatic politician at first.

#+begin_quote
  He never cared about the student's safety, he sent Dementors near children
#+end_quote

There's no argument against that, but Fudge also blindly seemed to trust the Dementors.

#+begin_quote
  he arrested Hagrid on a whim.
#+end_quote

Hagrid was, at the time, already associated with the crime.

#+begin_quote
  Harry didn't say he was being tortured, because he was being a stupid teenager with trust issues, I know people who would've walked up to her and killed her if she had tortured their children. The thing was, again, plot, no one knew about the Quills because the children were being coerced to not tell.
#+end_quote

I never really understood why people on this website got so worked up over the Quill detention. Only 25 years ago children in Eastern Europe would be punished by having them sit bared knee on wheat grains and many times children were punished through beatings throughout education's history. The wizarding world is fairly medieval and Molly speaks quite lightly about the scars Arthur got from beatings just because he got caught strolling with her one night. Not to mention the ease with which Filch brings up the idea of chaining misbehaving children upside down or the fact that only two years later a bunch of Death Eaters would have kids practice the Cruciatus Curse on their classmates serving detention. It was cruel and Harry was stupid to not speak up out of some pride, but I don't see what Fudge has to do with this.

  And then she organized the Hitler Youth and fucked things up more. Sometimes I imagine that if I was in the DA and someone blew the wall and when I looked I saw all those crazy racists, I would've just started shooting, because there was no way she wasn't going to torture me.
#+end_quote

Not sure what does have to do with Fudge either.

Don't get me wrong Fudge is exactly as you describe him. The only point I'm making is that a bunch of teenager would have not been better than him.
