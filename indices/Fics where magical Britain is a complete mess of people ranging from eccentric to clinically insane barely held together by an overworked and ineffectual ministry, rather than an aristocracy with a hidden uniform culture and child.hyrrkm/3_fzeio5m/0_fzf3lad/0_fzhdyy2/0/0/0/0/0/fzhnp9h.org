  With regards to Sirius and Barty, from the information he had (and not the one we had), I think he acted correctly.
#+end_quote

No, he didn't, he did NOT act to find out HOW he had escaped, he instead summarily executed Barty to cover up the fact the guy escaped at all.

He gave zero shits about 'acting accordingly' all he did was try to maintain his image.

Barty was bound and stunned and Fudge had him killed as soon as he could without letting anyone know, that's not acting well, that's a blatant cover-up.

He had several eyewitnesses telling Sirius Black was innocent AND that there was another guy, the real mass murderer, free, he didn't do ANYTHING to investigate, he just tried to cover up.

Fudge is the worst kind of politician, petty, incompetent, dumb, gullible, and malicious. He has NO redeeming qualities, the only good thing he did for Harry was waiving his guardian authorization to go to Hogsmeade, to try and gain his favour.

He is almost a caricature of how I think JKR sees most politicians.

Umbridge by the book and movie was clearly NOT trying to appear as a gentle or good person, it's noted several times her voice is false, her eyes are full of hatred, she's bigoted. Everyone knew that. Fudge knew that, he sent her there to quell what he was a coup d' etat, Fudge gave her full authority to terrorize children and did his best to stop the staff trying to mitigate it.

He never cared about the student's safety, he sent Dementors near children, he arrested Hagrid on a whim.

Harry didn't say he was being tortured, because he was being a stupid teenager with trust issues, I know people who would've walked up to her and killed her if she had tortured their children. The thing was, again, plot, no one knew about the Quills because the children were being coerced to not tell.

And then she organized the Hitler Youth and fucked things up more. Sometimes I imagine that if I was in the DA and someone blew the wall and when I looked I saw all those crazy racists, I would've just started shooting, because there was no way she wasn't going to torture me.
