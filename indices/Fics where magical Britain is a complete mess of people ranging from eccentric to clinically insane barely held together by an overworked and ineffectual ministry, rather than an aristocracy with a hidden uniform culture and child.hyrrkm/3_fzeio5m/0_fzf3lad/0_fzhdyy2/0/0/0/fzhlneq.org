The difference is that Fudge wasn't a very good politician at all, he was a convenient placeholder, every time he has to do political stuff he is shown to be blunt and incompetent, with no ability to choose good subordinates(Dolores), the only reason it works is because of corruption and plot.

Look at how he dealt with Barty, with Sirius, and then with Voldemort, look at the way he spoke and acted regarding Harry, any time things didn't go as planned he would start getting mad and resorting to stupid tactics that should never have worked.

Harry's trial is an example that either shows the entire court is corrupt or Rowling decided to forego consistency to cause drama.

Honestly, it's up to a point I honestly thought Fudge was just a Voldemort supporter and was just pretending to not believe.
