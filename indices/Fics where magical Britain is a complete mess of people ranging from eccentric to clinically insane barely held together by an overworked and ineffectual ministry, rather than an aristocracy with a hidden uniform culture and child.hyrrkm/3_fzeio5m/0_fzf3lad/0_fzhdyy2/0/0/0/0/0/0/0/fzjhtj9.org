  That's never even implied. The Dementor went loose
#+end_quote

Not implied? The /single/ Dementor brought in went /loose/, this guy brought one Dementor to a school and left it unsupervised? Want to know why it's a cover up, Fudge never gets worried about /how./

It's because she was making children self-mutilate over a false pretense, she was basically conditioning them to self punish. It was psychological as well as physical, getting a few lashes with a belt or kneeling on corn has nothing on scarring yourself repeatedly.

Honestly, I think those fics were one of the students snaps and kill her is not that far off.

  Umbridge is an evil woman but she knew how to play the political games better than most other characters because otherwise she would never have gotten so high up.

She didn't, the only reason she had any success was that she shared the same prejudices of those who were in power, she only got away with so much because she had a lot of political power and all the other staff were behaving like a bunch of spineless idiots.

I've known people from debate groups or those activities were they pretend to be a government who are more organized, competent and charismatic than Fudge.

I am pretty sure an aristocrat trained from the cradle by a competent tutor could outsmart Fudge. The problem may have been Malfoy.

Age doesn't matter depending on the circumstances.
