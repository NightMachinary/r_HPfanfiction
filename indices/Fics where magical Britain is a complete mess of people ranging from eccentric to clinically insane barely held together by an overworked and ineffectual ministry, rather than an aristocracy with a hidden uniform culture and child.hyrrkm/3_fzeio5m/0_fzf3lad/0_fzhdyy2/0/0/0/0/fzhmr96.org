I see your point but then you have to also remember that the book is written from Harry's perspective. With regards to Harry's hearing, he's a corrupt and quite gullible guy... for what we know Malfoy could have just bribed him in order to mess Harry's chances of getting acquitted... and while not explicitly stated in the books, I get the feeling he was the head or had massive influence over the Wizengamot, which in the end decided anyways that Harry was not guilty.

With regards to Sirius and Barty, from the information he had (and not the one we had), I think he acted correctly. In the first case, to all the world Sirius was known as a dangerous criminal who had accomplished what was thought impossible so it was only fair to start a manhunt against him. In the second case, Barty was supposed to be dead and buried in the yard of Azkaban so as an official you will bring protection against a wizard who could defy such circumstances. Whether Fudge knew how bad of an effect the Dementors had over other people that's up for debate, but he most certainly trusted them as loyal subjects to the Ministry.

With regards to Umbridge... well, Umbridge was a very ambitious woman according to her entry on Pottermore. She probably knew very well how to play Fudge, as well as the political games. Actually that's even stated by her when she's about to torture Harry ("What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him"). I'm pretty sure that when you're in a position of power you might find yourself surrounded by such 'snakes'. It's only a matter of whether you're good enough to see through them or not. Pretty sure a lot of adults would fail at that if they lack in people skills, let alone a bunch of teenagers. The only reason Harry saw through her was because she was very against him right from the hearing.
