I definitely headcanon most Dark Wizards like this. 90% of 'em don't give a flying fuck about world domination - /way/ too much work - they just wanna be left alone in their dark dank basement lairs to play with forbidden magic and do human experimentation without all that 'Health and Safety' bollocks. Basically Doc Brown meets Victor Frankenstein with a dash of Doctor Horrible. :D
