That makes an uncomfortable amount of sense. We'd have:

Lovegoods, who aren't /really/ conspiracy theorists but cater to that demographic and over time find themselves almost believing some of the conspiracies. Xenophilius and Pandora are actually hippies that smoked too much Mandrake leaf back in the 70s. Luna, of course, doesn't realize that the Quibbler isn't reality.

Malfoys, who are those very well-to-do upper-middle class people that genuinely believe that poor people are poor because they don't work hard enough and conveniently don't realize that the laws that the Malfoys help pass don't allow for much upward mobility.

Diggorys, who are amiable soccer-mom types that are generally good and helpful people but can't stop talking about how their child is amazing and better than yours and go nuts during Cedric's youth Quidditch games.

The Potters are libertarians in the model of Ron Swanson. They have some very problematic views but they work very hard and are extremely generous to friends and family. They are also against the Ministry getting too involved and so they make sure to distract it as much as possible.

The Princes are mad scientists of the most explosive variety and many of them meet early deaths or are cast out from society due to their experiments, which are morally ambiguous at best.

The Dumbledores are notoriously eccentric Welsh wizards and witches that are known to have a few screws loose. They are well-respected because they tend to be socially intelligent and good at manipulating people to ignore their eccentricities, but they don't actually get a lot of their goals accomplished. Albus is the sanest of the lot, so he is reasonably effective.

The Finnigans are anarchists but are /really/ bad at it. They are easily distracted by the affairs of their friends and the Muggles. They also create some extremely destructive spells and potions, but most of them never get used because they immediately start coming up with /another/ destructive spell or potion. They like the idea of anarchy more than actual anarchy, but mostly they just want to blow things up. Think Adam Savage crossed with Fred and George Weasley, with a healthy bit of Green Arrow. They all think that they are Zaheer, however.

The Weasleys are completely mad country folk that accept pretty much everyone into their group. They never have any money but they always manage to feed everyone. Most of their life revolves around weekly potlucks and brunches, playing their own brand of very physical Quidditch, and complaining that they can't get rich despite the fact that they blow their money on whatever catches their interest at the time.
