The economy functions based in the rule of heads or tails, when someone is born they toss a coin, if it fails in head the person is rich and will be able to afford anything no matter the price, they basically have infinite money, if it falls in tails the person can only buy a set amount of things (decided by dice) by month and it have to be of low-quality (the exception being in Knockturn where instead you get to buy things with “evilnessing points” gained by any action that affects negatively other person, ranging from a momma joke to acts of unspeakable evil). Magic could potentially take care of most necessities for a relatively comfortable life-style, so not much use in buying/selling it. The habit of storing gold in a bank has actually more to do with how pretty Wizards find it rather than any economic reason.

The Goblins are the utterly terrified hostages of wizards, having to live their life's by their crazy and unstable overlords whims to avoid being annihilated. They rejoice in getting away with the small rebellion of being rude (which honestly mostly pass over the Wizards heads) because they know that their life's depend on how amused Wizards are with them. The whole Gringotts business was something the wizards forced on the Goblins because they though it would be funny to see a specie made to be suitable only for battle having to deal with a purely bureaucratic job. The “rebellions” were half the Goblin's desperate bids for freedom and half the nut-job of the week forcing the Goblins in a position that they find the most amusing.

Formalized education has as it's only reason give the parents some blessed months free of children while giving them something to do so they wouldn't try to experiment by themselves and accidentally (or on porpoise) destroy the planet.
