I love the idea, and would be happy to read it, but for someone trying to write a realistic fic (as realistic as wizards can be...) it doesn't work. The reason the pureblood etiquette shit is so common is because it is similar to the social systems that Europe used for a few millenia. 'Proper', well off aristocrats lording over serfs/proletatiat.

It's hard to do anything but a crackfic in a bonkers, off-the-wall society. How does the economy function? What role would goblins play in that madness? Why have formalized education?

Still, please do write it. I would 100% read the hell out of it!
