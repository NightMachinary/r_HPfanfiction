I was always under the impression that Arthur Weasly, being the head of his department, even if it is an obscure department, makes plenty. It's just that a single income isn't enough to care for seven children and send them to a private magic boarding school. It could be that their education is a service provided by the ministry as a way of ensuring new talent and magic gets put back into the ministry but i like the idea that, while some provisions are given to muggleborn families and the like, most pureblood families are well off enough to send their children to Hogwarts. The idea of a poor pureblood family is considered disgraceful so why would they be supported? I don't know, just a thought.
