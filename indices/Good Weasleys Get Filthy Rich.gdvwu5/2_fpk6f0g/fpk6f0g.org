Going by canon, after the war, the Weasleys become very influential within the Ministry. Hermione (Weasley by marriage), Angelina (again, George's wife) and Percy are all senior officials within the ministry. Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, with work from George and Ron, is supposed to have become immensely popular, which implies that the family does get loaded. Ginny becomes a successful Quidditch player which I suppose would include sponsorships, kit deals and everything. I suppose the Death Eaters' and sympathizers like Umbridge's estates are raided and a lot of people end up getting reparations. So, canon Weasleys post-battle are rich and influential.

I haven't read much fanfic, but there is this one dude called Northumbrian who's written stories about Ginny's Quidditch career and George and Ron's efforts in diversifying WWW. So you can check those out. they can be found easily
