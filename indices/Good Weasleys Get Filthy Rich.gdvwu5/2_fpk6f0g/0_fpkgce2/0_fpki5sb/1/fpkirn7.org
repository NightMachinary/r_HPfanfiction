Exactly! It depends on what time they become rich!

Is it before or after their quirks have developed? Rich or not, I get the impression that Arthur would be interested in Muggle Artifacts.

It's unlikely that Molly would want a house elf. For all intents and purposes, she seems to be a very proud and dedicated housewife.

If there's anyone who would be pampered, I think it would be Ginny not Ron.

There are so many ways this could go. I prefer the wholesome ways though.
