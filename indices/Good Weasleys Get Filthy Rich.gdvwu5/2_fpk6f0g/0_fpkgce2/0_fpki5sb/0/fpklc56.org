  If the Weasleys were rich, wouldn't they have a house-elf?
#+end_quote

I think Rich Weasleys would have a House Elf. I think their his a line in canon (probably CoS) where Ron says to Harry that his mom would like to have an elf to help her, but they are really expensive. Of course, said Elf would be treated very differently compared to one like Dobby, and would probably be an "help" more than anything else (I don't think Molly would stop doing any household chore, especially cooking even with an elf).

  Would rich Arthur Weasley still retain his eccentricities and fondness for tinkering with Muggle stuff?
#+end_quote

Since it's more of a passion than anything else, probably. In the case of Arthur, I think that the only "big" difference between a rich one and canon one (outside of think like new robes) would be his job. Would a rich Arthur still work in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department, or would he just leave his job (to have even more time to study muggle stuff)?

  Would a Ron who's been pampered and looked after, and generally been brought up as a rich child do stuff like rescuing Harry from the Dursleys? Would the flying car even get made?
#+end_quote

You could even wonder if a Rich Ron would even become friend with Harry? Though I think that, unless really OOC and arrogant/ bullying like Malfoy, they would still become friend.\\
I also think that a Rich Ron would still be worried if Harry never answered his letter, and the twins would still jump at the chance to launch a rescue mission. But since the Weasley are rich, you have the choice between "Ron sends the Elf check on Harry and deal with the problem easily" or "Young kid send a rescue mission and fly his father' car to Privet Drive". I personally prefer the second option, especially since a Rich Arthur may not have modified a Ford Anglia but something a bit more expensive, like a Aaston Martin maybe?
