It feels like a rich Ron would be taught to ask a house elf for help whenever a task seemed beyond his capabilities. They would have done this just to ensure him and his siblings don't perform too much underage magic. If Ron was brought up in this manner, they wouldn't have flown the car to Hogwarts at all. It just seems to me that rich people don't take matters into their own hands unless absolutely necessary.
