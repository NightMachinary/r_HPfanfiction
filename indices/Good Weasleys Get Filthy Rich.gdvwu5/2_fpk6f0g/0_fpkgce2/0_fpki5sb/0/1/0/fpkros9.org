To be honest, my preference for the 2nd option came more from my desire to see Ron and the Twins drive a flying Aaston Martin than any plot logic.

Though, as often with fanfics, it's possible to find a justification for why he could have done it someone really want to. You could say that Arthur and Molly still remembered their poor years so they still gave some chores for the kids to do to "forge their character". Or they taught them to not bother the house Elf unless they have to because they don't want their children to "overwork poor [Elf_Name]". Or maybe Ron and the Twins didn't think secretely steal their father car and fly half of England to rescue one of their friend was beyond their capabilities (Gryffindors).
