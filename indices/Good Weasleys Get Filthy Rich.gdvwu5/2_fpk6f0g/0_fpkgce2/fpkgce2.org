Thanks for the fic recommendation. Yeah, they do become influential, but I'm more interested in how the wealth affects canon.

Just take for instance, how things would have been very different if Ron had a new wand when facing Lockhart in the Chamber of Secrets.

Percy would have probably never taken in scanners as a rat, when there's money to buy any pet of his choice.

Girls would have probably been all over Ron as he searched for a date during the Yule Ball. This could in fact affect the canon pairing.

Maybe Bill and Charlie won't have gone into such dangerous occupations, if there was money.

So many possibilities.
