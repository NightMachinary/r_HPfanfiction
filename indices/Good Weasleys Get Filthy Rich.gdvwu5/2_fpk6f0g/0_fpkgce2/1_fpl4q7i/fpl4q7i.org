There's still Ron's personality to consider, so the only thing I think would change in regards to the ball is he might have some gold diggers after him.

As for their careers, I believe Charlie gave up a chance at a very lucrative quidditch career for his actual job, so I think he just loves dragons and would be doing it regardless.
