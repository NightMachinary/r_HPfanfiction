This is a side affect in the fic I'm currently working on. I'm not super deep into it yet, but essentially an encounter Charlie has leads to some big changes. The story primarily follows Ron and what would happen if he got a better work ethic and some self confidence.

I don't think I'd say filthy rich, but they become more influential and affluent early on.
