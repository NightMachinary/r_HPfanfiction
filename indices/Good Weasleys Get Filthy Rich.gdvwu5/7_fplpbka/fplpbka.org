What if I'm the past like way way distant past the Weasleys were wealthy like Malfoy level tops. Then something happens like maybe they had some heirloom (I'm thinking something like Scrooge Mcducks's number one dime) that is tied to their wealth and it is either stolen or lost by a Weasley ancestor. Cue modern times. Maybe Bill finds it in his curse breaking, Maybe it's Arthur on a raid, but whatever is is the Weasleys get the item back but because it has been missing for centuries and was tied to their fortune they get all the money they would have had all those years ago at once and with interest. Cue the Richest Wizards in the world
