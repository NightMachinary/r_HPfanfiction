Ok I like this I think if they were rich then I could see Arthur being high up in the ministry ( but not unemployed ) and bring trusted by the minister more Molly either not working until Percy has atleast passed his OWLS are not working at all. Percy wouldn't have abandoned his family but he would still be have the place in the ministers office. However, Fred and George will stay running the joke shop and maybe Fred wouldn't of died, who knows? Then Ron would of gone into being high up in the ministry like Harry and Hermione straight away so the joke shop would still be successful and Ginny would be a Quidditch star still. Also unlike the Malfoys they would be a welcoming pure blood line not one that looks down on others. But I think Malfoy would be trusted by the minister more but they would get ready for Voldemort to strike not knowing that Lucious one of the most trusted people of all is a death eater and Umbridge would be there checking that Dumbldore isn't giving Draco a hard time but she would also be a better teacher towards the other houses and not start the swuad she progress 's to make.
