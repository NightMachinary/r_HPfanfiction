Bill Weasleys has the air of someone who would love parties or Molly, for a chance to cook a lot of food.

This could force Slughorn to come out of the woodwork. Slughorn, attempting to cozy up with the wealthy Weasleys.

This is what I think could happen. They throw parties overshadowing the Malfoys in wealth, opulence and power.

Lucius Malfoy decides to bring the Weasleys down by using the diary.

In my head, he gets caught by Slughorn or Dumbledore or both of them at the same time.

That's just one possibility.

Here's another.

They get rich, so Bill or Arthur goes out in warding the house, if I go via fanon route, this will include wards against any animagus. This could lead to Sirius released earlier.

I'm thinking all this could happen say in-between the eleven years before Harry goes to Hogwarts. So maybe, when Harry goes to Hogwarts, his fame is overshadowed by the wealthy Weasleys.

Maybe Harry Potter can just be Harry.
