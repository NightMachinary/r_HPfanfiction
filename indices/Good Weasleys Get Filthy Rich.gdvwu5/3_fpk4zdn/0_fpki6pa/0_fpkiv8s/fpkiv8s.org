I like them being called the “Wealthy Weasley's” Couldn't you see Rita Skeeter doing an article: “The Wealthy Weasleys are at it again. In order to celebrate little brother Ron getting his Hogwarts letter, big brother Charlie flew in 12 Dragons to provide entertainment for party guest.” Ok now I want them to be like the Beverly Hillbillies. Also love the ideas about how the stories go
