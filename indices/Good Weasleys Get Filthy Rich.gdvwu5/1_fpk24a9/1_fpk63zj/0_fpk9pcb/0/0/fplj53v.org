I need this as a crack fic. Harry, Hermione, and Ron figure out they're surrounded by idiots and frauds. Harry realizes first and convinces Ron who just shrugs like “makes sense, mate.” And they both convince Hermione the books aren't telling the whole truth. The stone is a Weasley family secret “we don't tell people about the enchanted car in the shed, mom's secret stew recipe, and the gold making stone that hit Ginny in the forehead as a kid.”
