The Goblins will go to war. And you're looking at the entirety of Magical Britain's economy sinking because the value of gold suddenly became too low. Galleons would become worthless and the people would riot. Heck, Voldemort himself would riot about this (Oh, wait a minute...).

The riots would spill into Muggle Britain and the non-magical British Government would have to step in to maintain order and next thing you know Her Majesty's Treasury, The Bank of England and the Goblin Nation (through Gringotts) would rehaul the entire currency and economic system and the next thing you know, the Magical Britain is working with Pounds.

P.S. I'm one hundred percent sure there's a lot more economics involved over here, but for now, just accept otnfor what it is.
