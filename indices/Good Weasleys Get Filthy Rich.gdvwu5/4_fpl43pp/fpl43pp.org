I recall part of a post Hogwarts fic that had ron getting filthy rich as an aside. It wasn't the focus of it, and iirc, only harry really was in the story.

It basically had Harry and Ron running a scam on the death eaters after the war. Having Ron catch up to malfoy or one of the other rich assholes, then accepting a hefty bribe to let them go, with them believing he'll carry through because of his family being so far. Then, shortly thereafter, harry coming in and capturing them, collecting the bounties on their heads in the process.

And them so running a side business, getting the death eaters families to pay them to break them out of prison. Setting them up in safe houses, then hitting them with some kind of magic to get the dumbasses to leave said safehouses and busting them again. Running said scam on the same people over and over again until they were broke.

With people only suspecting the truth when Ron moves in the entire extended weasley clan into the former malfoy manor.

The whole process having two end goals, first to get filthy stinking rich, and second, to deprive the dark families of their money in order to make it a lot harder for another Voldemort to rise.

With ron eventually retiring and harry becoming an international bounty hunter because he'd become addicted to the action.

Pretty sure that's in the first few chapters of Tsu Doh Nim's HP/Star Wars crossover, actually. From Harry's background before winding up in the republic.
