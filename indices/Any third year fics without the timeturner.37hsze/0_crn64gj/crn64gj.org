Rowling went back and kind-of-but-not-really fixed them in Pottermore by saying they have a 5 hour limit and you can really fuck things up if you mess with the wrong events. Also they were all destroyed in book 5.

But it's used well in PoA, so I doubt people have tried writing the entire book without it. Some multi-year fics don't need to use the time-turner because they already saved Sirius through other means, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.
