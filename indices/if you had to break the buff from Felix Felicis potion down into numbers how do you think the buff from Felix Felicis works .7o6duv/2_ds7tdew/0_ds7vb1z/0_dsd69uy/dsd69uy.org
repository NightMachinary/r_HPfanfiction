That feels slightly flawed to me - after all, Felix Felicis doesn't make you an omnipotent god, just lucky. Maybe if there was the default roll of +25 to -25 and then each effect rolled their own number to change that?

Malaclaw would be a -1 to -50, giving it a chance to completely heck over luck without guaranteeing it, Felix would be +1 to +50.
