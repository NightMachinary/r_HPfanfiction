The author was still active on fanfiction.net until about 6 months ago and added on a few notes to the end of part 1, but unfortunately it does seem to be abandoned :( Which is a shame because it seems like a great story. I read the series a few months ago and remembered a few days ago about it and decided to share it on here. I agree the second is better (and that's saying a lot considering the first was really good as well) it is somehow even more complex then the first story.
