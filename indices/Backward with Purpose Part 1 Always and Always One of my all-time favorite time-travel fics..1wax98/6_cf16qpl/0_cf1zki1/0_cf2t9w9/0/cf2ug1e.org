I can think of a dozen ways to solve this problem that doesn't revolve around letting a 60 foot basilisk loose in a castle of children. I mean seriously: just take Dumbledore down there and let a rooster crow a few times. BAM! basilisk dead, the end. You can always preserve its poison anyway if you really need it.

They don't know what no one will die this time! Last time it was a ridiculously lucky break that all victims just happened to be watching it indirectly and no one died. How can they possible know it will happen again this time around? I bet they won't feel so smart if Hermione really gets killed this time.

And what is his big plan this time? To have another sword fight with a basilisk?

Besides, if they so desperately want events in the first and second year to be exactly the same, then why did they bother redoing them at all? they could just skip straight to third year and stop Peter Pettigrew then. The only difference is that Percy is slightly less of a jerk. Yeah, that's worth unleashing a basilisk over!
