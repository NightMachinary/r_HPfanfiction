I just finished re-reading this story, and have realized that this criticism is even more unwarranted than I had initially thought. Throughout that offending section (which is only one part of a much longer story) it is explained that Dumbledore, with his full access to the Hogwarts wards and knowledge of what was going on, was able to ensure that the student body was kept away from the basalisk while it was free. Only two students were petrified, because they managed to resist Dumbledore's repelling charm. During the next appearance of the snake, Dumbledore discusses the much stronger wards that he is using to contain the beast. The logic of this section is completely in line with the story as a whole.
