I suppose it might simply because I've read a lot of fics and hold higher standards.

For me, the majority of fanfiction is grammatically poor swill, with the plots corresponding.

Then you have the fluffy one-shots that are well written. Those are entertaining, but unless they're exceptional, I wouldn't recommend them either because they don't have much substance.

The lengthy fics of substance with passable grammar are where I judge fics. I set my standards here when it comes to determining means and outliers. Why? This is what is actually readable (excepting the one-shots of course). Here, average is a length fic of substance with passable grammar, plot, and premise. I judge a fic based on the aforementioned quality, understanding of canon (because it means they understand the effects of their deviation from canon), world-building, writing style, pacing and other factors.

I judge starfox5 as slightly below-average when it comes to these fics. Starfox5 is above authors like Robst or Zaxarus. Starfox5 writes stories with interesting premises, an excellent command of grammar if mediocre when it comes to style, and mediocre plots. They have a poor understanding of canon, veer frequently into muggle-wank, and change characters for the worse. Take divided and entwined. It has an actually premise. Muggleborns rebelling against an oppressive regime? Fudge being an interesting character? I was excited to read what seemed like a promising starfox5 story, unlike the horror that was Patron and its beginning or Ladythief.

But it ends up being bland. Little changes with characters for the most part. Pacing is atrocious. Things are repetitive. And the premise changes from an interesting one to "just kidding, the muggleborn kids don't actually rebel because it's more of a war of exceptionally trained kids against inept wizards". A little suspension of disbelief is fine. But for the group to become fully functional with little effort? A lot of subplots were just cheesy too. Tropey sociopath in the guerilla group that has to be dealt with? Adult wizards don't blink at being lead by Hermione? Hell, just the fact that Hermione is a leader is already OOC, and with no flaws to compensate. The rebels continue to win with the sam strategy. There's very little tension for the reader because we can all expect that the rebels will win.
