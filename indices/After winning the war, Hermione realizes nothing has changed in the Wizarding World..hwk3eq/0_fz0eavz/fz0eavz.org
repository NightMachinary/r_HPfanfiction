[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy]] - It feels weird recommending a starfox5 story, but this was surprisingly good (and unique for starfox5) and captures what you would like. The rest of their stories do also fit your prompt to an extent, but I do not recommend them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]] - The best story that fits your prompt. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rebel against the ministry.
