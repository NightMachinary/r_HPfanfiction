  He left HP at mercy of abusive relatives, prepared HP for sacrifice, and left Sirirus to rot in prison, and many other things. Isn't it funny that creatures that were considered dark such as Lupin, Fleur etc were shunned in magical Britain that was shaped by Dumbledore and his tea party despite them trying to come off as liberals.

I mean, you're entitled to your extreme opinion of Dumbledore, but let me try and clear a few things up - /physical/ abuse from the Dursleys is only ever /implied/ in the books, with the infamous "frying pan swipe" that people love shoving everywhere, and Vernon threatening to knock the stuffing out of Harry should he forget to keep up his cover story for Aunt Marge being the furthest extreme, barring Dudley's idiocy. Otherwise it's just a particular case of neglect, poor care and - from what it seems from Harry's perspective - limited emotional/psychological abuse.

The issue with the Dursleys is that it's never shown how /necessary/ it was for Harry to stay with them, and thus leaves it free for people to say it was all some evil scheme/incompetence. I like to think that the blood protection from Petunia actually /did something/, because otherwise you'd be completely right and Dumbledore would've had no real reason to leave Harry with obviously unfit carers.

On the dark creature front, though, Lupin and the other Werewolves /are absolutely/ dark creatures, and are just as oppressed everywhere in the wizarding world, by the sound of it at least. When members of their community /routinely/ attack innocent people, either killing them or turning them into Werewolves too - not to mention the fact that many seem to support Greyback and therefore Voldemort, according to Lupin - the prejudice is much easier to justify. And I don't know where you heard that Veela were treated as dark creatures in Britain, because I'm pretty sure that's not mentioned in the books.

The issue is that you seem to think that Dumbledore was in charge of the whole country for the years between Voldemort's first death and the events of the first book, but it's clearly stated that Dumbledore has no real influence in politics out of choice - he offers advice freely to people like Fudge, but doesn't /control/ the Ministry. As for his other positions, there's no actual canon description of their duties and the freedoms they entail, so saying that because he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot or the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW literally means /nothing/ in terms of his ability to, say, get an outwardly-guilty criminal like Sirius Black out of prison. You talk about Dumbledore's 'party' but we don't actually ever know how Magical Britain /works/, how it's /governed/, so really I don't think you can sit there and say he had a posse of supporters which he could've used to run the country.

All that said, I agree that the way HP is written doesn't lend itself easily to explaining Dumbledore's actions, and the difficulty in approaching his position is only made worse by the fact the first few books are clearly intended for children, and he avoids explaining important shit like the need for blood protection behind bland platitudes of "you'll know when you're older".

Otherwise, OP, I think it'd be pretty cool to see an Albus that either voluntarily performed or was coerced into an Unbreakable Vow to stay away from power. It would be interesting to see how he'd get around such a vow (depending on its wording of course) and try and save the world.
