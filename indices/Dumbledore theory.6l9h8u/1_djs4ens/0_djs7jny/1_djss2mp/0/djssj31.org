Let's just stop a second and go through all your fanon right there.

Blood wards being dark? According to whom? Which book? As far as I'm aware that's never mentioned in canon.

Lily raising the blood wards herself, and 'keying' them to Harry? FANON. Wards are never 'keyed' to anyone in the books ever, and I'm fairly sure that no-one raised the blood wards, it's instead treated as an effect of Lily's sacrifice to protect Harry, the original blood protection. He cannot be harmed thanks to Lily's love, and cannot be truly harmed where her blood resides, in this case, Petunia's house.

Why was Harry staying there? Because the Dursleys were Lily's only surviving family and would - likely - be his legal guardians? Dumbledore was the one who put Harry with them (and in a very unorthodox way), for sure, and it was for Harry's protection if the blood protection is even a thing (let's assume that it was), but in the muggle world Harry could just as easily ended up with Vernon and Petunia due to custody laws.

Every statement you make about Dumbledore's nebulous /political power/ is an assumption that isn't backed up by evidence from the books at all, and you're routinely confusing fanon with canon which is making your arguments even more incoherent. Please stop and think about it for a second.

Also, if the ICW is anything like the EU or the UN, then Dumbledore's got fuck-all power there. Do you see Jean-Claude Juncker or Ban Ki-Moon running about changing the world? Nope, they just make speeches and write strongly-worded letters and that's about it.
