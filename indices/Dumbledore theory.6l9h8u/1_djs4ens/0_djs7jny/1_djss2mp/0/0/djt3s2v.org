"Blood Wards" is a terrible term created in Fanon . But it fits to how things were implied in canon.

The only protection Harry Potter could get from that House would be if that protection was blood based since blood was the only thing that linked Harry Potter to his aunt's house.

Canon highlighted that protection that Harry had was due to blood. After resurrection of Voldemort using a ritual that was based around blood of Harry Potter Voldemort could /touch/ Harry Potter.

*Lily's love:* This is a silly plot device. I mean Lily can't be the only mother who threw herself between her child and a murderer. This was a children't book and children are more fascinated when things take emotional turn. They don't ask questions. Quite a convenient plot device. Dumbledore sold that bullshit to Harry too. And he bought it because he was a kid. A kid who was thirsty for love.

That Keyed part to blood wards around Petunia's house was actually what your line of thinking suggested. I don't believe on that shit. I think that was bogus. It is you who are suggesting that Harry Potter had to stay at his aunt's house because somehow Lily's love for Harry Potter created something around the house of a sister who loathed magic that protected Harry. And since blood was the only common ground between them this protection had to be based on blood. And hence the ironic 'blood wards keyed to Harry Potter' thing I said.

Personally I don't believe this kind of protection existed. I believe Lily did some ritual that gave Harry some kind of protection. My other opinion was that Harry was that powerful anyway but I dropped it after Voldemort experimentally /touched/ Harry Potter after resurrection.

Potter and Black weren't light family. James Potter was friends with darkest creature in magical world along with Sirius Black. Sirius Black plotted murder of a fellow student. This rag tag group bullied students and used nasty and harmful spells on people. Lily was a child who started out magical world as friends with a wizard who breathed dark magic like it was oxygen.

So I don't think they were Light family by any extension. The only light thing they did was join Dumbledores tea party, and it was mostly out of necessity.

Is blood magic a dark magic? Canon is silent. It's silent on most of the things because it's 3rd Person limited. Anything out of sight or hearing range of HP wasn't supposed to be explained. We saw the world through lens of HP. And HP was a damaged and abused boy who was barely surviving each year. He didn't waste time on theories about magic.
