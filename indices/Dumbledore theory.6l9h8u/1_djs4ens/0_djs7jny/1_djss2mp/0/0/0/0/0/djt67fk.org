The exact circumstances of Lily's sacrifice are, assumably, unique. Voldemort is the first and only dark wizard with so many horcruxes, I think, and that must've come into play for Harry's survival and the success of Lily's sacrifice.

As far as I'm aware, Voldemort despises all part-humans, but keeps them about for convenience. Werewolves are ferocious killers, Giants can control the tide of a battle, etc. Also the Veela (I'm fairly sure) aren't ever referred to as dark creatures in Britain or not given rights (although I'm sure Umbridge would've changed that). The way you're talking makes it sound like Voldemort somehow had good aims. I assure you, this is not the case. He says so himself, that there is no good or evil, only power. He despises pretty much all other life other than his own, which he guards viciously. He kills indiscriminately and for fun, and I don't believe that he wanted to show the purebloods what-for, and get them to unwittingly support a half-blood. In canon, Voldemort appears to be an ardent believer in their philosophy and the superiority of blood, to the point that he buries his past out of shame. You seem to have ignored Voldemort's /real/ agenda: Become immortal, take over the world, get rid of every Hogwarts house except Slytherin, kill all the mudbloods, and generally ruin everything.

Essentially it comes down to you believing things like the blood protection are BS, and me disagreeing, and neither of us being able to convince the other, so we should probably stop. I'm done arguing.
