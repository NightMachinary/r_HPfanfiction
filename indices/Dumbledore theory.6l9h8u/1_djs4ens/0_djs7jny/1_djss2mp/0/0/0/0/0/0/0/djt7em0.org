So you /do/ think Voldemort was a good guy, whose racist, blood-driven new world order would've /helped/ people, even when Umbridge, who he /allowed/ to half-run his Ministry when he took over, was worse to nonhumans than the previous administration?

I'm washing my hands of this. I understand Dumbledore-bashers, I understand all of that, but the second you start implying that Voldemort, basically /wizard Hitler/ isn't the bad guy in these stories, despite killing Amelia Bones, Lily and James, Snape, and a whole bunch of other people you seem to have forgotten about when I said he kills indiscriminately, /because he does/, then there's fuck-all point talking to you.
