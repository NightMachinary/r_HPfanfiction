  So you do think Voldemort was a good guy,

I think Harry's view was distorted and biased.

  whose racist
#+end_quote

Racist? In real life race doesn't hinder or improve performance. Thus it's wrong to judge people on their race. Magical world was divided on their opinion about BLOOD. And Blood seems to be a difining factor in that world. It had magical properties. It can give protection. It can help you resurrect once more. It can create new bodies. It can be used in rituals that can curse you.

  Umbridge, who he allowed to half-run his Ministry when he took over, was worse to non-humans the previous administration?
#+end_quote

That's a plot hole, no? Dark creatures were part of Voldemort's army. Dark creatures were pushed out of official posts in era of people who hated anything dark. Isn't DADA part of curriculum in a school that's run by greatest wizard who fought against dark lords and dark creatures?

Either JK Rowling screwed with Umbridge or Umbridge wasn't part of Voldemort's army.

  I'm washing my hands of this. I understand Dumbledore-bashers, I understand all of that, but the second you start implying that Voldemort.....
#+end_quote

I'm implying that world isn't black and white. Good and Evil aren't the only realities. People aren't dark and evil just for evil's sake. People have ambitions and methods that might come off as questionable. Voldermot's version that Harry Potter had in his mind is evil. No doubt. But is Voldemort really what we see him through lens of a manipulated and biased child that was molded to shoulder a war at 11 years of age?

  despite killing Amelia Bones, Lily and James, Snape, and a whole bunch of other people
#+end_quote

People die when they participate in wars. Didn't 'good' people kill 'bad' people? Even JK Rowling had some sense to have 'good' people kill too instead of writing stories where every 'good' people won by using ticking spells. Though she ended it with Chosen one killing Darkest Lord with a disarming spell.
