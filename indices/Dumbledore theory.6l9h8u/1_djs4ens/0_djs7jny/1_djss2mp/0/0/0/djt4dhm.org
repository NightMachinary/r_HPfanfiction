You can call Lily's love a silly plot device, but it's canon - unless Rowling lied to everyone, which you're perfectly capable of believing if that's your jam.

I don't believe in "wards", and I didn't intend for you to approach it with 'keying' or whatever, so sorry for being misleading, if my language led you down that route. The blood protection is in Harry's blood, it needs no wards or external constructs, and he cannot be harmed where his mother's blood resides. It needs literally no more explanation than that. If you were being - as you say - ironic, the lack of any notation as such makes it difficult to discern. We're talking through text, after all, so I can't tell if you're being ironic or sarcastic.

Sirius wanted to scare Snape, I think, daring him to go and see what Lupin got up to - but the potential for murder exists in nearly all children if they're not raised right so I there's no way I can be sure he didn't want him dead. This is me making an assumption that Sirius wasn't a total bastard.

Joining Dumbledore out of necessity? You can /assume/ that, sure, but I don't think they'd not join the only person who was actually standing up to Voldemort. What even /is/ a Light family? Again, more fanon definitions and ideas. Everyone is shades of grey, in general, so yes, the Marauders bullied, Snape loved dark magic and hated mudbloods, and Lily was apparently pretty damn smart. That doesn't mean that the ones that joined Dumbledore did so out of desperation. Maybe, I dunno, they did it because it was /right/?

And by making that statement on blood magic, you've defeated your own earlier statement - we absolutely don't know if it's dark or not, so why then say that the blood protection is "borderline dark" if /you/ know that that's just an assumption?
