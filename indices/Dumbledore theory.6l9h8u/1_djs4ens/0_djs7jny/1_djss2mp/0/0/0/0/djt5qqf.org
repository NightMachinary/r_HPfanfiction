Lily was not the only mother who died protecting her son. None of those children survived Killing Curse. So love wasn't the thing that protected him. Canon is that Dumbledore told Harry Potter this his mothers love saved him. Is it true? Canon doesn't tell. Because canon isn't third person omniscient. Canon tells us things that Harry hears, sees or believes.

Forgive these terms but they are developed after long periods of use. Dark Lord, death eaters, dark creatures, dark families using dark artifacts, spells and rituals are part of canon. Fanon made term Light for those who avoid these things. Light family would be a family that avoids dark spells, rituals or artifacts. Kind of like families who live strictly by stuff they learned in DADA classes.

I don't think Potter family was 'dark free', if that's the term better suited to explain my position. Books (and movies) implied that Harry's grandma was a Black, who wasn't cast off from her family.

JK Rowling wrote this for children with Hero Vs Villain trope. That world was painted Black and White. Everything that was Black was Villain, inhumane, violent, murderer and torturer. While White was paragon of Justice, liberal and good.

Whole issue with wizarding world was that there were two groups: (1) One group didn't like it when outsiders came to their world and started changing stuff. (Kind of like how people will react if Muslims start demanidn Shriah in Muslim world or how US forces people to impose democracy). (2) Other group didn't want to allow Guns.

End result? They fought wars. One side had political clout while other had low numbers. It escalated quickly and they were at each other throats. Dark Lord seems like pretty childish name born out of idiotic Hero Vs Villain trope.

Voldemort's agenda was pretty simple: Dark creatures (werewolves, giants, veela and others) had no rights in Dumbledore's Britain. Voldemort wanted to give them rights. He was a damaged child ignored by muggle and magical worlds. He created a world where pure-bloods bowed down to a half-blood.

Blood seems very important in magical world. If used in ritual one can erect protections that can divert killing curses and same blood can be used to create a newer stronger body that can bypass blood protection. In a world like that I think half-blood and pure-blood makes a reasonable term.
