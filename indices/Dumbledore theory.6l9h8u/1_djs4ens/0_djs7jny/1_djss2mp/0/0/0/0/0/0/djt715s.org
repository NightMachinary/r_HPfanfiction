  You seem to have ignored Voldemort's real agenda: Become immortal, take over the world, get rid of every house except Slytherin, kill all the mudbloods, and generally ruin everything.

His aim? Or what Harry Potter thought his aim was? His only philosophy was "There is no good or evil, only power and those who are too weak to seek it".

He dropped his fathers name because he found out that his father dumped his Mom which created a series of events that led to isolation, torture and abuse during childhood. He was a damaged child, who was isolated and ignored during childhood.

Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had similar childhood in that regard (JK tried to make it so). Then came the Hero Vs Villain stuff where Lord Voldemort became an evil war lord and Harry became a Saviour.

Who cares what his motives are as long as dark creatures get breathing space? Every living thin is selfish. Living things are designed that way (I am an atheist and believe that evolution is a provable scientific theory. This design thing means that it's their nature). If his motives ensured jobs for dark creatures at the end of the day why hate him? It's certainly better than what ministry was doing. Lupin had to leave his job because Britain didn't allow dark creatures to work in official capacity.

He kills indiscriminately? The only kid (and their families) we know for certain that he killed, or tried to, were Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. And it was due to prophecy.

Kill everyone except pure-blood? His greatest asset was a half blood. There were very few pure-blood families but his rogue group was quite large at last battle. Pure-blood were in it because of blood supremacy. And TBH JK Rowling did create a world in which blood had magical powers. For example: Lily's blood protect, Harry's blood necessary for ritual etc. Blood seems like a thing that can make difference.

I disagree that Lily's love created thing that manifested as blood protection. I will gladly accept if you say Lily did some ritual that created it. Lily's love and sacrifice creating such thing seem like stupid when you consider that she can't be the only mother who died for her children.
