HP is written in 3rd Person limited PoV. It follows HP and his views throughout series. We see Magic world through his lens. Psychological abuse is still an abuse and I am sure living in cupboard is not in anyway normal? May be some families train their kids by stuffing them in cupboards for extensive periods and hence desensitization in some people but normal people don't do that. They get jailed for such abuse.

Necessary how? The only thing that's mentioned too many times is 'blood wards', which is borderline dark but I won't go into that argument yet, which is really silly. Why will Lily resurrect blood wards at Petunia's house keyed to Harry Potter when they were hiding under fidelius charm?

This story is your typical prophecy child trope with abuse the shit out of hero but he still loves everyone cliche. Parents dead? Yes. Relatives abusive? Yes. Have to save the world? Yes. IS the only person that can save? Yes.

Why was HP staying in abusive environment? Was it necessary for hero complex? I can see the pattern here.

Dumbledore's nfluence. Once again. This story is 3rd Person PoV so we don't get to see anything outside of knowledge or understanding of Harry Potter whose world view was molded under psychological and physical abuse. We see glimpse of stuff he could do. He got away with child abuse, played with ministry and avoided imprisonment at the charges of treason against government and still wasn't labeled "Wanted". He was chairman of their their International organization.

Let's understand: World knew that Dumbledore had hidden Harry Potter and nobody raised issue that why a person who shouldn't have a say in how or where Harry Potter should be raised kept quite and let him do his thing.
