I think that from the reader's perspective, though, Harry is pretty much sane. The hero-ing for a lot of stuff can easily just be a narrative decision, but it's certainly an interesting perspective to have his willingness to shoulder such responsibilities be due to his upbringing.

I personally think that the abuse at the hands of the Dursleys should've had a larger effect on Harry than we see. You're right, people end up /damaged/ by shit like this, even mild neglect is enough to really affect some people. By including an abusive upbringing but also making Harry 'fairly' normal, Rowling devalues its inclusion in the first place.

But I'm never gonna believe that it was an evil scheme from Dumbledore, considering how little the two actually interacted prior to Harry's sixth year. However, if that's what you want to believe, then that's your right.
