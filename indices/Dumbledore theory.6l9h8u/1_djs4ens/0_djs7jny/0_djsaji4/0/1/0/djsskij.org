I didn't say that. I'm saying that /physical/ abuse in the form of beatings and such doesn't happen to Harry from Vernon and Petunia. Neglect? Yes. Psychological abuse? Yes. Emotional abuse? Yes. They're appalling guardians for - as you've said - the poor-neglected-chosen-one-trope reason, but the whole beatings and physical abuse stuff that people spout is all inferences and assumptions, or misconceptions from fanfiction being transplanted into canon.

I understand perfectly what abuse is, I'm contesting the use of blanket terminology to describe what more closely resembles severe child neglect, it's own sub-division of abuse. Clarification in things like this are important, particularly because some fanfiction authors seem to fetishise the abusive side of the Dursleys to the most extreme levels.

Also, don't make this personal.
