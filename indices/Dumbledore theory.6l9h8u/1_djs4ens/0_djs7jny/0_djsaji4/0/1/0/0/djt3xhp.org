I am more worried about people keeping Harry sane after all that abuse. That's so unnatural. Abused kids are never normal. Their psychology is always damaged. Like in canon where Harry is a dumb boy with strong Hero complex who jumped into everything like it was his responsibility to do everything.

He was quite malleable and really dependent on his Headmaster. I think that was a work well done.
