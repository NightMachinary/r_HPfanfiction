Oh I'm perfectly aware of the fact that it was often common for kids to thrust each others' heads into toilet bowls as a means of bullying.

Waterboarding is a form of water torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Despite the missing cloth part, it's pretty similar no? I'm not gonna argue about this, so if our opinions differ, then so be it.
