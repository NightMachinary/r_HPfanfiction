Although there's obviously no way to convince you over the internet, I can categorically state that no abuse took place in my home as a child, though I do understand what you mean.

Honestly Rowling didn't try that hard to portray it as abusive, or at least examine the effects of it. Harry, despite all of his hardship, grows up fairly normal and well-adjusted (apart from teenage anger), and his situation with the Dursleys isn't actually ever made relevant to the major plot of the series. There are instances where it's important - the events leading up to Dobby's arrival in Harry's room and the aftermath in Chamber of Secrets, or Vernon's reaction to when Harry accidentally blows up Aunt Marge - but on the whole, Harry's treatment at their hands is largely ignored by the text, glossed over or casually mentioned with no further developments, so I'll have to disagree with you there.

l never once said it wasn't harmful - regardless of how alright Harry might be - the actions the Dursleys took have the potential to massively damage children. I'm trying to illustrate that physical abuse from Vernon and Petunia as often depicted in fanfiction is only alluded to, rather than outright stated. Neglect and other kinds of abuse openly happen in the books, I don't deny that, nor do I say that it isn't harmful. I'm trying to get people to clarify, since - as I've said in another comment here - some fanfiction authors fetishise physical abuse and describe it graphically for no other reason than cheap shock value, or - god forbid - they actually get off on it.
