I'll state now that I've never been abused, and would /never/ abuse a child - I don't think it's normal, or whatever you're referring to.

I don't think I'd actually do very well at raising children, because I have little patience and in my experience children have the potential to be the cruelest beings on this planet, and as a result I don't plan on having any sprogs.

This has gotten a little out of hand, likely due to the way I worded the 'waterboarding' rebuttal. Allow me to clarify. It's absolutely cruel, but what I was trying to say is that for when the HP books were written, and where they're set, this kind of bullying was unfortunately quite commonplace, and not treated with the same kind of abhorrence that it is today. It's a sad state of affairs, but applying today's standards on bullying to what Dudley describes and comparing it to /waterboarding/, a kind of torture /condemned by most modern governments and the UN/ - except the good ol' US-of-A, of course - is in my opinion too extreme a comparison.

But regardless, I think you're missing my point. The Dursleys /do/ abuse Harry - psychologically, emotionally, and through serious neglect. All of their actions here constitute a crime that would see Harry taken into child protection for sure. The point is is that /physical/ abuse against Harry by Vernon and Petunia - beatings and the like - I'm almost certain never happen in the books. They can be inferred or assumed, but never proved.

As for Dudley, he's a cunt, and a bully for certain, but - speaking from experience here - bullies only have as much power as you allow them power. In an ideal world, you should never have to stand up for yourself against bullies because people would behave decently to each other. Unfortunately, children will /always/ find ways to be awful to each other, and then the only option is to fight back/run away/take away their fun. Bullying is about humiliation over /actual/ harm in most cases, and I stood up to potential bullies when I was in school the /first/ time they tried something against me, and they didn't try twice.
