  Let's say I'm wrong, and most of those titles mean nothing. He was still Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. That sounds like a very high up position. He could have at least used that position to give Sirius a trial(which Sirius never got).

/All/ of that is assumption and conjecture. There isn't a single piece of evidence to suggest that that position would give Dumbledore the power to give Sirius a trial, even assuming he wanted to - because I'm fairly sure he assumed Sirius' guilt like everyone else. You're just assuming that those positions gave him political power, which I've said before are never gotten into in to canon and therefore /can't/ be used as actual evidence. You're welcome to assume but because none of it is ever confirmed it's inadmissible as evidence of Dumbledore's political power.

As for the Dursleys, I can't defend their behaviour or really make light of it - only say that Petunia and Vernon never /actually/ succeed in hitting Harry by the sound of it. There's the swipe, the threatening, etc, but most of their actual abuse is neglect and being grounded without proper access to food and stuff. They're obviously terrible guardians, but like I said before in my original comment, I like to think that Harry staying with them is actually /necessary/, that the blood protection over Petunia's house actually works, because then it's harder to just say Dumbledore was incompetent/evil. Otherwise, as I said before, there'd be fuck-all point in Harry staying there at all if nothing constructive was gotten out of it, other than the fact that the Dursleys might actually be his legal guardians as Lily's surviving relations.

Again, the issue with the Dursleys' behaviour is the way it's written in the early books. The "casual" way the pan-swipe is referred to and how you use it to say it's therefore likely a regular occurrence would certainly be true in any adult novel, but the fact is that the early Harry Potter books are oriented towards children and that it's equally likely the casual way in which it's mentioned is because Rowling didn't want to go into /graphic depictions of child abuse/ in a novel for under-10s. It's in fact perfectly possible that they don't even know that Dudley hits Harry outside of the house - they might not care if they found out - but for example, in the later books they appear not to notice that Dudley is a delinquent, who steals from children and breaks windows with stones, even when it's really obvious. They're not perceptive when it comes to their son's behaviour.

  That is probably close to waterboarding.

Oh, stop it. It's really not. In larger, less well-performing English state schools - I'm going to assume that this is somehow a surprise to you - it was often common for kids to thrust each others' heads into toilet bowls as a means of bullying. It's not so much any more, with greater policing from teachers and stuff on physical bullying, plus the convenience of cyber bullying, but in the nineties it definitely would still be popular, just like fights, stealing, calling names and all the other usual shit. It is /nowhere/ even close to waterboarding, and isn't often done with the intention to drown or torture the participant, more focused on humiliation - like most bullying - than anything else. Think about when the books were written and what was commonplace in English schools at the time, and you'll start to understand why I think how I think.

Dudley's awful, but honestly he's not much worse than most idiotic kids at that time.
