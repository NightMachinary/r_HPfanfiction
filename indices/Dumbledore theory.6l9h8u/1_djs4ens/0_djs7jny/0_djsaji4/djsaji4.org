Dumbledore had plenty political power. He was The Headmaster of Hogwarts Grand Sorcerer Supreme Mugwump Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot

Plenty of titles that supposedly carry great deal of respect, and assumably political power.

Let's say I'm wrong, and most of those titles mean nothing. He was still Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. That sounds like a very high up position. He could have at least used that position to give Sirius a trial(which Sirius never got).

Let's go to the abuse bit. The famous frying pan:

#+begin_quote
  Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan
#+end_quote

Its mentioned way to casually for it not to be a regular occurrence.

Another part from the books.

#+begin_quote
  Well, I've got news for you, boy. . . . I'm locking you up. . . . You're never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself out --- they'll expel you!” And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.

this implies that the only reason they didnt lock him up all the time was because they thought he would use magic to free himself.He's certainly starving at that point. His hunger is extreme enough for it to be painful:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, [...]"
#+end_quote

Also Harry was regularly beaten by Dudley and his Gang. They Called it "Harry Hunting"

Several Quotes from the Book:

#+begin_quote
  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

Dudley's Violence bit. One of many more to be found.

#+begin_quote
  unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry
#+end_quote

His parents are ok with Dudley beating Harry.

#+begin_quote
  “They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”
#+end_quote

That is probably close to waterboarding.

#+begin_quote
  After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick,
#+end_quote

That probably hurt a lot. I went through the first two chapters involving Harry and that was probably not all there is to be found.
