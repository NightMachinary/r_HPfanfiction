He collected elder wand, and cloak after his fight. He made his teen idealistic party after his sister's death. You don't reach top of food chain without getting your hands dirty.

I don't think he regretted her murder enough. Remember HP series is third person limited with HP PoV. Whatever we read was how HP saw or understood stuff which might be true, false or deception.

He left HP at mercy of abusive relatives, prepared HP for sacrifice, and left Sirirus to rot in prison, and many other things.

Isn't it funny that creatures that were considered dark such as Lupin, Fleur etc were shunned in magical Britain that was shaped by Dumbledore and his tea party despite them trying to come off as liberals.

It's not his fault thoguh. HP was written for children and children do love Hero Vs Villain stuff where villains are so stupid that they go by names such as Dark Lord and Death Eaters. You can't be more obvious retard than tat except may be call yourself Killer666 and carry a severed head of a virgin muggleborn everywhere you go.
