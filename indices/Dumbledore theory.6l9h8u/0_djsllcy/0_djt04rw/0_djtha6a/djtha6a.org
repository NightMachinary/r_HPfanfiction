Exactly what I did when I read the theory originally.

  Also, I posted this in /HPfanfiction rather than /HarryPotter for a reason.

Because the theory requires headcanon, and that largely doesn't fly on HP, at least in terms of actual theories.

  Specifically that this can fit with many fanfic interpretations of the character even if it doesn't fit the canon one...

I don't understand that at all. Your theory is on Dumbledore, not a specific fanfics Dumbledore, therefore I'm treating it as a canon theory.
