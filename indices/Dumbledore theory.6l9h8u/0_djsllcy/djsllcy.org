  him swear an Unbreakable Oath to make him not seek power
#+end_quote

Unbreakable Oaths require three people to be put in place. You cannot swear an arbitrary Oath to yourself as far as we know.

  wording made Dumbledore a terrible war-leader
#+end_quote

Really? How do you know he was a terrible war leader? As far as we saw, Voldemort was more worried about the order than Aurors. Voldemort even went as far as saying that he couldn't win the war unless Dumbledore was assasinated, he practically admitted that he couldn't win a duel with Dumbledore in order to kill him.

  and he found loopholes that allowed him to hold the government positions he does
#+end_quote

He doesn't really hold much power in the government, seeing as how his position can be easily swayed by the Ministry's liberal oligarchy quite easily.

#+begin_quote
  and that's why Aberforth never forgave him
#+end_quote

I honestly don't understand the train of thought, what does one have to do with the other? Abeforth didn't forgive Albus because Albus never admitted fault for Arianna's death, he was too proud and he always circumvented the fact that he had gotten her killed. Sure, he shows remorse, but does he ever really take the blame? Does he ever allow himself to let go of the mask and be honest? No, he hides behind it, even on the Platform with Harry. Canon Dumbledore irks me. He's a man that is haunted by demons from hundreds of years ago, and the demons seem to only touch him when he needs them the least.
