Are there any parings you think you would be interested in, or do you want a general find that focuses on Harry?

There are quite a few popular tropes out there one of which is Slytherin Harry. I personally liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] (5th year is continued on the author's new account): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513]]

This is fairly canon compliant in the first couple years, but things really start to pick up afterwards.

I don't know if you would be interested in fem!Harry (I definitely was not before reading this fic) but Harry's character is significantly different from canon, so she's essentially an original character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense Series]] features a fem!Harry who aspires to be a potions mistress at all costs. Hogwarts only lets in purebloods in this new society, so she switches places with her cousin Archie Black and pretends to be him. I think it has really cool world building and Tom Riddle is quite an interesting character here.
