I would not read this if you're looking for a good story, especially if you're new to fanfic. As I've said before:

  De-rec, for the original. It is simply not good. That's expected, as it was apparently the author's first story, but on a level higher than spelling and grammar the quality is severely lacking. Characterization is out of whack, events are tenuously strung together like a bunch of Christmas lights haphazardly flung over the front porch, and the prose is ... well, it tries to be a clear window into events, no accessories, no dross. And that style can be done very well---Brandon Sanderson is an example of an author who's famous for it. But this isn't that. The POV shoots around like an amateur filmmaker who just discovered angles exist, and it is not pretty. The writer of this fic had a vision for what they wanted, and their skill just wasn't up to seeing it realized.

  I have not read the remastered version, which is why my de-rec is only for the original. I can't say if the author improved on the flawed elements. However, given that these flaws are pretty core to the plot of the story, the fact that the author stated all the plot elements are left unchanged is not a good sign.
