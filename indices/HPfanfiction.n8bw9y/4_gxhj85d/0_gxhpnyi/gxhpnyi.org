Hey [[/u/weiland123][u/weiland123]] just a disclaimer, HPMOR is a highly divisive fic, some (like me) absolutely love it to the point that it sparked an entirely new genre of fic called "rationalist fanfiction" and others (like my sister in law) absolutely hated and could not even bring themselves to go more than a few chapters. If you don't like it that's ok and it just means that it isn't your style. There is however a genre called crack which I assume is so named because either the characters, or the author must have been on crack at the time of writing and afaik everyone enjoys some crack sometimes. The gold standard for this is linkffn( seventh horcrux by emerald ashes)
