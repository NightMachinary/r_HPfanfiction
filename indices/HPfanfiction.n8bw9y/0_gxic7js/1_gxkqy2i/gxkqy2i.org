Seconded; canon-compliant post-war stories are a good place to start. Northumbrian's work is probably my favourite out of these suggestions.

I'll also throw in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4495536/1/Chapter-37]]), which is a chapter that one author felt was missing from the end of Deathly Hallows, and linkffn(The First Day by little0bird) if you want to read a rockier (re)start to Harry and Ginny's relationship.
