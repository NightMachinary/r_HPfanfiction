Unless you hate canon pairings, I always strongly recommend reading canon compliant fics first, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] depicts Year 6 from Ginny's POV. It's very well written and also my entry fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] is an excellent Year 7 fic from Ginny's POV and shows the horror at Hogwarts during that year. Its author [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] is active here and has written [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum/works?fandom_id=136512][many great canon compliant fics]].

Author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has written a massive postwar series of 85+ fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], set in 2009 and depicting Harry and Ginny's work/life, is likely his best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]] is a little self promotion. I wrote this one shot for the occasion of Battle of Hogwarts' 20th anniversary.
