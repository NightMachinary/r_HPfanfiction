LeQuin is always a good choice. Bobmin too (may their isekai adventure never ends.) And of course RobSt and Old Crow. Rorschach's Blot is to endorse. broomstickflyer is ok too. They are all on ffn. Stargon5 is generally a good choice. Heck there are many great writers and stories out there. U have just start somewhere.
