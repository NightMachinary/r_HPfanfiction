That could actually be funny as hell. Percy is in a very Percy-like way being unwittingly obtuse about his sorting while the teachers try their hardest to make him understand that ‘no, you were /not/ sorted in Gryffindor mister Weasley' all the while his parents are confused since he is swearing that he is in Gryffindor while the teachers say otherwise (I think they would be inclined to at least seriously consider Percy's story since he isn't the lying sort) and Snape is absolutely /not/ helping since he keeps behaving as of Percy was in Gryffindor from the beginning. I can see things coming to a head right before Harry's first year when the teachers just collectively throw their arms up in frustration and officially change Percy's house... only for the new first years to take it as a precedent and tacitly permission to change house any time they want driving the professors crazy by changing houses for ‘a better view',, ‘get away from memories of a failed relationship', ‘keep an eye on a student who owns me money'... Hell, it could even drive then to scrap the house system altogether.
