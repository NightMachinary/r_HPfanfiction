Well, Pettigrew reversed that memory charm through torture so they probably weren't that concerned with her long-term prognosis.

I'm convinced, too, that BC, Sr., got his memory charm wrong. I think that instead of being too strong, it was too broad. He wasn't precises enough in his casting and that's why she was so forgetful. He memory-charmed too many things away.
