Don't hate me for stating [[http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/The_Standard_Book_of_Spells,_Grade_2][fact]], so clearly it is. Fact is that it is taught, and the fact is also that it is disturbing as fuck. But overlooked as fuck. I think that out of all fanfic tropes. Obliviate hasn't been given it's proper due. Like, we get adult characters running around the place throwing it left right and center. But we should also have the kids throwing it around as well.
