Depends on your POV - in some works of (science) fiction death of personality is a replacement for the death-penalty because it gives society a productive member and is less gruesome and wasteful (one excample would be Babylon 5, where telepaths can erase peoples minds and do so when ordered to by law), not to mention that the personality can be brought back if new evidence shows that someone was innocent!

I happen to agree with you OP, that's why I never understand why people can brush aside that Hermione (who often claims a seat on the proverbial high horse of superior morals) erased her parents memories (hell, she was unsure if she could recover them later if I remember this right!)...Damned, Hermione you are playing god here and I would understand it if your parents wouldn't ever want to talk to you again after you restore their minds!
