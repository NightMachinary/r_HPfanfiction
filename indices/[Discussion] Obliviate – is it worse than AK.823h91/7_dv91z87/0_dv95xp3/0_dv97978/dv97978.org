Nah, Dumbledore might have trusted Snape. But I would bet money on the fact that Snape genuinely wanted Dumbledore dead. Maybe he didn't despise him fully in the end. But it doesn't mean he didn't have enough in there to use it.

An honest mercy killing to me? Hermione was just lit on fire, burned down to bone in some places. While in terrible agony she asks Harry to kill her.

He would do it, but can you see him using the AK?

Like... casting a Patronus you can be pretty drained of happy. But you only need just enough to use it properly.

...

Well there's Obliviation as a choice, say you got Crucio cast on you for an hour. You survive, maybe take a chunk of that suffering away. It probably wouldn't save Neville's parents because that looks more like brain damage from their nervous system misfiring. But maybe help Harry sleep better after some Tom Torture?

Or an actual Imperus victim even, you could leave them with the knowledge of what they've done if they wanted.

Maybe remove visceral memory of say, being caught then strangling their squib son or something during a Death Eater attack because of mind control.

Not everyone is Harry Potter levels of willpower in their bank to resist mental effects.

There is the obvious maintaining Stature of Secrecy. Imagine if they had to do so without the memory charm?

They'd be forced to either kidnap witnesses, or make sure they are labeled insane, or even torture to make them so afraid to ever speak about magic.

I think Michael said it best. "You forget a thousand things every day. Make sure this is one of them."

Just look at X-Men, people don't really like when a section of people are just straight up better than you.

Sure it's kind if a dick move to take away memory, but the alternatives for the average person are terrible. What use it is to know of magic if you aren't part of the world? And can't talk about it with anyone?

"Crocodiles ridges and bumps that make them intimidating are actually so that when they swim through the water they don't make ripples." This knowledge is useful if you encounter a crocodile, or are near water in Australia.

But otherwise doesn't affect your life. Especially if your life has nothing to do with crocodiles.

So if I erased it, sure knowing about it before hand you'd be offended at the loss. But really what use what it that the Magical World exists?

Now this doesn't mean I'm advocating muggle people who get raped by witches or wizards are better off not knowing. I'm saying remove the magic, and put away or kill the perpetrator.

Because the lingering effects without cause could lead to mental breaks. And I've always hated cruelty.

But knowing they were raped by a person with magical powers who could teleport, and nothing they do could ever stop them? That magic let then use you as a puppet and forced feeling upon you til they got bored of you?

I don't think that knowledge that magic exists helps the victims then. Just leaves then even more paranoid than an already traumatized person. Wild claims of magic just dismissed by their family and friends as hallucinations from trauma.
