Hmm the fully trained Healer is a very interesting train of thought. As I've always seen it as AK as truly desiring the death of someone without any hesitation.

That would in fact be an amazing tool, though you could probably cast some sort of sleeping spell and just slow the heart gently. Most fiction don't really delve into medical magic techniques. I think the Dykstra shuffle is the only one I can remember? Maybe there's more in something I haven't read.

Though a Professional Healer wearing goggles with a solemn face... and then casting Bombarda Maxima is a hilarious image.

...

I had in fact totally forgotten that Obliviation is available that early on. While terrible, the fact that it aids in getting away with your scenario doesn't make it the cause.

The same can and is accomplished plenty easy without memory charms in the normal world.

You still have to be terrible enough to be willing to commit the act, which to me is the real issue. Not that they have an easier time covering it up.

The best way (well besides wiping out all knowledge) to make sure it isn't abused is to create ways to defend against it. Maybe that orb thing Neville has, give it charmed to detect Obliviation and check every week or so.

Like that nail polish that detects date rape drugs in drinks. You can't stop people from trying in bars at this point try as society might, but we're getting closer.

Not fool proof but every bit helps right?

...

Also keeping knowledge restricted won't stop people from abusing it. Polyjuice Potion could be used to abuse malleable victims by turning then into whoever you actually wanted to abuse.

Young boys into sexy teenage girls, I remember vaguely some scene in a fic where Harry sleeps with the Patil twins and it ends up being the Creevey Brothers who have been stalking him.

While kinda funny and portrayed as such, it really highlights how easy it would be once you had your hands on Polyjuice.

Maybe teenage girls take Potter for a spin since they want some chosen one in their diet. I always wondered about Romilda...

But Hermione not only knew about it (even if the recipe was in the restricted section) she was able to brew it in second year. I'm not saying it was easy, but even if Obliviation was a seventh year spell and in the restricted section. Deviant, hormonal, and cruel teenagers would find and use it.
