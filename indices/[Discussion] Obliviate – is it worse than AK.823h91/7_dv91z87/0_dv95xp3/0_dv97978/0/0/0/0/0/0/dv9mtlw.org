True, but since the Obliviation charm exists. Creating some kind of detection puts the inevitability of punishment back to normal. Instead of the free pass if protections don't exist at all.

If I assume those protections don't exist in some manner then I also have to assume Hermione was probably abused once the war was closer to the forefront just for being associated with Harry.

Obliviation isn't committing murder to me, like the cop from HP and the Natural 20. But assuming Obliviation is that easily abused and has no lingering effects makes me wonder why Tom isn't ruler of England, or that Slughorn had a memory to give back to implicate him.

Sad answer is it's probably just a plot hole.

Though that sounds like a hilarious conversation between Harry and Voldemort, "So... did it just not occur to you to hide your tracks better?"

Obliviation, like Centaurs in a forest is just one of those things no one really thought to tell Rowling about.

...

Seems like we've reach a solid conclusion,

Obliviation is a terribly easy to abuse spell. If it truly is a perfect memory wipe, with no evidence if done the right way. It could be used as a tool for much more Evil than the AK. It is in itself not more powerful but much more dangerous.

Everything below here is just more tangent off into nonsense. Just typed out to vent frustration and curiosity.

...

I think about off screen stuff alot.

Like in HP and most fiction stemming from it Good and Evil are tangible things. In the same way Good and Evil exist in DnD.

People who commit atrocities like rape, torture, and murder are literally affected by it in their tangible soul. So by doing good things people can literally redeem the soul. Karma exists bitch!

But Light and Dark imply something completely different. But exist in the same way Unicorn and Phoenix, or Threstals exist.

That Magic makes emotion into something with physical presence.

...

Or how differently Auror forensics must be with the existence of Polyjuice, sure it lasts an hour but with a flask how many doses are required per hour? Do fingerprints change after the fact? What about self transfiguration?

Since Hogwarts is basically a reference point and collection of knowledge, how often are grad students allowed to visit?

How active are wizard farmers for food? Or do they simply use muggle farms?
