Ahh my apologies I was unclear, I didn't mean it wasn't easier to get away with abuse in the magical world as opposed to the mundane.

I meant the same people who would use the memory charm to cover their tracks. Would do the same even if the memory charm didn't exist, or were born without magic.

The abuse would still happen, but with the charm they can erase their tracks nearly perfectly.

...

That was why I brought up better ways to defend against it some analogue to the nail polish.

If it can be reversed, it is not removing memory just making you forget it is there. Which is an important distinction.

An altered Rememberal could be used. The red smoke for stuff you should remember, there must be some limit on how recently you've forgotten something or it would be red all the time. Black smoke for recent memory charms detected then.

Slap a bunch of orbs on door knobs to commonly used rooms or something, and you've got an alert that something has happened in the last 24 hours.

Maybe the Charms classrooms? Since a charms master would most likely be able to remove it.
