How?

Obliviate removes memories of a rape or any other sexual (or humiliating) violence. Other spells easily heal physical damage and remove the evidence. If a victim doesn't remember the rape and there's no other evidences there's nothing to report.

Polyjuice Potion can be abused too. But works just an hour and requires some actor skills from an imposer. Can be compared with using drugs in order to make a victim to be agreeable. Horrible, but not to the same extent.
