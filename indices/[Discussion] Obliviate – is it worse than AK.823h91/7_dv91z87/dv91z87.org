From a personal standpoint no it is not as bad, potential for abuse doesn't make a thing bad on it's own.

An argument from fear

A dog could bite. If a dog bites it is bad. So all dogs are bad

Obliviation could be abused. If abuse happens it is bad. Obliviation is bad.

Not to say your points aren't valid, any character who uses Obliviation without some sort of strict training is clearly comitting reckless magical endangerment. But more like playing with a knife not committing a heinous crime in and of itself.

Most magic is portrayed like that. A knife can cut up some vegetables for dinner, it can kill someone, and you can use it to skin someone alive.

But the AK is bad because it can only be used to kill, I highly doubt you could use AK as some sort of mercy killing tool like unplugging a terminally ill patient. Since it's labeled "dark" and most dark magic is assumed to require a desire to harm or some other negative emotion.

The Santi had my favorite take on Dark Magic, you used a spell with an emotion like hatred and that not only enhanced the effects of the spell it made them have lingering effects and harder to remove.

It was a stronger spell, but it requires a certain mindset. And that is why dark magic was bad, not because of the effect but because it implied something about the mindset of the user.

...

From a rape, obliviate, repeat standpoint, hmm I suppose if I wrote it used as such... the lingering effects would clue you in on the fact that something has happened. The the feeling you get around the person who committed the act would definitely clue you in.

Going back to my dog example, if you were mauled by a dog as a 4 year old. You probably don't actually remember the incident. But you could fear dogs for the rest of your life, that small jolt in your spine whenever you don't have a chance to prepare yourself.

So perhaps it is my view on memory that makes it seem less terrible in my eyes. If Obliviate was so powerful that it could reset someone so easily, then I'd say it was much worse.

...

I could think of much much worse uses for spells and potions. For example Cheering charm or Imperius but not in the way you think. I could cast it softly, the same way you could vary light Lumos gives you.

Every time I see a person I like, I cast it just a bit. So that they feel euphoria and happiness every time they see me.

Get them literally addicted to my presence, instead of using a love potion that needs to be reapplied like Ms. Riddle. Just condition them to feel a certain way around me. And without using commands, they'd never notice I was using it on them.
