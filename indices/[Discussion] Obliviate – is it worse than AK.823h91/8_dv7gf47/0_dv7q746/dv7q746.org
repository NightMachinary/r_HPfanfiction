This is the conclusion that I'd come to. The soul remembers, but Obliviation severs the brain's connection to the memories.

It has to be more complicated than that, or Obliviation would be impossible to undo, though--not that there's any canon evidence that it can be undone.

Word of God is that Hermione altered her parents' memories, which is a different spell to erasing them.
