The real question is, of course, if the soul is truly affected by an Obliviation or if it retains it's healthy state in the afterlife if no damage was done to it by the person themselve.

I personally don't think the concept of the soul in Harry Potter is so easily damaged. It takes much to channel it, breaking it is the worst of the worst of magic, and having it devoured the highest form of punishment in the wizarding world.

So assuming the soul stays intact in the afterlife, the Obliviate is less morally deplorable than the Avada Kedavra. The one removes your personality from the mortal plane, but still grants you a life as someone else (or a heavily modified version of yourself). The Avada Kedavra takes your life from you and never even gives you the chance to explore mortal life.

If, however, the Obliviate damages the soul and therefore the person for all eternity, then the Avada Kedavra is definitely less bad then a strong Obliviate.

Entirely depends on how you want to interpret all this.
