I think you're struggling to reconcile a real-world physicalist/materialist understanding of identity with the HP system. This is doomed to failure. The HP system is unapologetically dualist. A person's identity, their essential self, has nothing (or little) to do with their brain or their memories. It is (one supposes) their soul.

As for how that essential character manifests, it does so in the decisions you make, your habits, the things you like doing, the people who you like to associate with, your moral compass, etc.
