This. It's notable that Lockhart still likes to sign things after obliviation. It removes your memories but it doesn't change who you are, which in HP is a much more fundamental thing than your mind.

Still a pretty devastating injury if someone removes a significant part of your memories, but no, not equivalent to death.

Despite banging on about the importance of choice, JKR actually set up an extremely deterministic system which has been described as Calvinist, in that certain people are "the chosen'. Some people are just fundamentally good and others are fundamentally bad. It's a part of a soul-deep personality.

So Harry remains fundamentally good regardless of what he goes through and regardless of how many times he uses torture curses. Meanwhile Voldemort only has the choice to redeem himself in theory. In actual fact his nature is such that he would never make that choice.

The way JKR thinks about these things was revealed on her old website:

  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). *Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself*; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, *of course*, he refused to feel remorse.

That's rather telling. In the HP world the capacity for goodness is a tangible quality which can be transfered magically. Some people have it and others... don't.

To tie this all back into the obliviation point, the way JKR clearly sees people in the HP universe (and maybe real life...) is that they have a fundamental character which is disconnected from their experiences and memories, their physical condition, etc. It is just who they are. People have free will so they have the ability to choose to act contrary to their character, but "of course" people don't actually do that. People act according to who they are.
