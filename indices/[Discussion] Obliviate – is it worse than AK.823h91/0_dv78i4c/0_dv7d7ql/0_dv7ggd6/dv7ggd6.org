My headcanon is that Lockhart and company will be totally okay in the Afterlife. See, I think Obliviate only erases the memory from the physical brain, but not from the soul; the soul has a perfect recall of everything, which can only be accessed upon death, or, if you want to use it on Earth, thanks to a Pensieve. This is also how it is possible to "unlock" memories that had been Obliviated, and why it's so dangerous: it requires tampering with the very soul of the patient.
