  In my opinion "Obliviate" is an ultimate crime against a human being, because it messes with the core thing that makes us who we are -- our memories

Except, well, we know from canon that souls exist. Therefore, it is highly likely that the Wizarding World considers the soul as the core of a being and therefore would be far more cavalier than Muggles when it comes to the "sanctity/importance" of memory to the notion of self.

Now that that is out of the way, there is evidence that Memory Charms are either reversible, or able to be cast in a way that is reversible. For example, consider the Grangers. That kind of memory alteration is, to me at least, a clear example of a reversible or removable Memory Charm. Though of course we have to consider the opposing case: Bertha Jorkins. Bertha, as you probably remember, went cuckoo for cocoa puffs when the Memory Charm upon her was broken. Of course, that may be a difference between reversing/removing a charm and breaking one.

Frankly, my headcanon is that the Memory Charm is a legally restricted charm, restricted to Obliviators in service to the Ministry who spend their time modifying the memories of Muggles who have witnessed magic. Unauthorized use would most likely be considered assault and/or battery.

Separate from all my above ramblings: Lockhart is a poor example, as if Lockhart wasn't used Ron's utterly fucked up wand, the spell would never have backfired and permanently left him as an adult with an infantile mind.
