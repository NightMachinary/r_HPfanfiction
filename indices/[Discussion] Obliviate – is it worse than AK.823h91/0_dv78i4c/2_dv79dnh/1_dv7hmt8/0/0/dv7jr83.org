Dumbledore's sister was beaten up so badly she lost all control over magic afterwards - which resulted in her killing her own mother.

In Fantastic Beasts we see the Muggle-Patron abuse everything that comes close to magic.

In the books, Snape's father is abusive and so are Harry's aunt and uncle, who call him a freak.

Maybe Muggles in the story are unrealistic, but it sure seems that every time they are given a slither of power over wizards, they seem hell-bent on destroying them.

Is losing a few minutes of their day such a bad tradeoff?
