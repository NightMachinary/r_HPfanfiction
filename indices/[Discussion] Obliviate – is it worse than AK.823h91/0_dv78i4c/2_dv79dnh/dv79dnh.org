Wizarding World treats non magical people a little better than pets. I wouldn't use it as a moral compass.

Example with Grangers is a good one.

Hermione temporary "killed" personalities of her parents and created an absolute others -- Wilkins. If Hermione died in the war, what memories would her parents souls have? Would they remember their daughter and life as Grangers in their afterlife? If they would, what is about clash between their old and new personalities?

I used example with Lockhart just to show that memory charms may cause permanent damage and destroy personality.
