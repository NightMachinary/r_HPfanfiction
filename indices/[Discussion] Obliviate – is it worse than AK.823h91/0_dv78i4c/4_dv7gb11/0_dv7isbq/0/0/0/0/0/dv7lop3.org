I gotta give [[/u/Quoba]] this much:

If we assume that Hermione did not even attempt to persuade her parents to leave the country without the use of magic, then the Obliviation seems an extremely callous a method. After all, if she tells them "Leave Britain, the wizards - me included - are about to go to war and I'd feel better if you're far, far away from that." and her parents would refuse, the Obliviation is still an option.

I've seen quite a few headcanons around this issue. I personally assume that Hermione did try, but ultimately failed to get through to her parents. Hermione can be rather brutal and vindictive, but she never is so towards the people she deeply cares about. Just judging from her character I would think Obliviation is a last resort for her.
