Hermione is empathetic? Like how she "rejected" Harry after he attacked and injured Malfoy just because she was jealous and wanted to say 'I told you so'? Or maybe like how she practically ordered Harry to come to an interview with Rita Skeeter during his first date with Skeeter? While mainly Harry's fault, it was because of her lack of empathy that she ruined his first date with his first crush. Aah. But maybe you're talking you how she didn't send any letter to Harry before the fifth year just because Dumbledore asked her to. I mean, her friend is depressed and really need your help, but why do it if you can lick your professor's ass?

Hermione doesn't care about anyone emotion if she thinks she is right. She only care about doing what she thinks is right.
