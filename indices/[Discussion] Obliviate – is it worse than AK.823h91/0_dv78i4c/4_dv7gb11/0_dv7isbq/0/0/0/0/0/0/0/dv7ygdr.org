I never tackled leaving the country at all, but rather the difference between a scenario in which this obliviation would be a last resort, and a scenario in which it would have been a callous walking on an easy path.

Because it's not just "sparing them worry and grief". On the other side of that double edged sword stands an /extreme/ breaking of trust. To delete a core part of their entire being - their daughter - from their memory and lifes, is unimaginably brutal. At first there would be no hole. The Grangers would live their life in Australia, happy and child-less. Where the true problems arise is when they get their memories back. How could they trust their daughter ever again? What tells them that she even is their daughter? If she can erase the one memory, why shouldn't she be able to create the other? Are they even the Grangers, or does this /witch/ only want them to forget they were who all these papers say they were? How can you trust this being of so unimaginable powers that, if what she says is true, has used those powers once to make you forget /your own daughter/.

This action of Hermione's carries so much consequence with it, that I always came to the conclusion it would have been a last resort for her, in order to keep her stubborn parents alive. Because I'm sure that Hermione would think through the consequences and arive at the same "How could they ever trust me again?" questions. I'm sure that had they been willing to stay out of this and flee, any worry and grief would have been preferable to the insurmountable rift between Hermione and her parents after they regained their memories.
