I think it's important what you use memory charms for, and how far you go. Removing a few minutes' worth of memories is, for example, far better to protect the Statue of Secrecy than killing the muggle witness. (Or the wizard witness of a crime or conspiracy.)

Reconstructing a person's personality to change them into what's effectively another person is more difficult to judge, but then again - if the alternative is killing someone, or letting them murder someone, I'd judge that as certainly not worse than an AK.
