No, the chance to be happy on earth again. If you kill someone, they will never have the chance to be happy again, /and/ everything they gained is lost.

When you completely erase the memory of someone, they still have the chance of happiness /and/ some assets remain (for example: Lockhard in canon is shown to be happy and still had some of his assets left, like fans)
