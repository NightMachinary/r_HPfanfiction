  Ah yes, third year. The year that has the least to do with Voldemort yet so much happens. Too bad for Hogwarts they have a reckless Slytherin who is getting tired of taking baby steps. Slow and steady may win the race, but there's nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts. What's the worst that could happen? Besides, if Hogwarts won't actively give Harry a normal year, he'll make one for himself.
