To be fair, he lived in a cave surviving off of rats to ensure he was on hand for Harry just in case, so 2 months in dog form doesn't seem too crazy. And I'm sure he'd get chances to spend some time in human form when the Dursley's are out of the house or him and Harry are locked in Harry's room. Though I agree that him seeing the Dursley treat Harry portly would be problematic.
