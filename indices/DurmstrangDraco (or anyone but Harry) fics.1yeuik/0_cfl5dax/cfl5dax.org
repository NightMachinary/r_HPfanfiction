The only good Durmstrang fics I know of have Harry attending the school, so you probably aren't interested in them. (In case you care, they're The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], which is discontinued, though several additional chapters are to be found in the Work By Author section of DLP; also, E. C. Scrubb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]], WIP.)
