On one hand, I'm not so picky with pairings. As long as Harry and Hermione (and Ginny) are NOT shipped with Death Eater scums, I'm ok. However, I do not mind them in context of extreme AUs and time travels. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), a Harry/Bellatrix fic, is one of my top favorites.

On the other hand, I'm getting very picky since I no longer read:

- Canon rehashes, especially in time travels and “Harry raised by X” fics
- Blatant shipping fics, especially those that need to bash others
- Voldemort and Death Eater apologies, although I don't mind reading Voldemort centric fics that don't try to justify his actions.
- Anytime Hadrian or Ice Princess is mentioned
- WBWL fics, with a couple exceptions
- Fics that manufacture lots of angst and drama
