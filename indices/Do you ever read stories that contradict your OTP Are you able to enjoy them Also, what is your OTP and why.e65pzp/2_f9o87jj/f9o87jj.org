I really enjoy Harry/Luna or Neville/Luna, Neville/Luna was my OTP for the longest of times.

And I know slash tends to get kind of ignored around here, but I really do enjoy Remus/Sirius an awful lot.

I'm fine with a lot of pairings, from het/slash/femslash to even cross gen, though I'm rather iffy on Hermione/Harry, or Hermione/Draco. Those tend to have Hermione as perfect, and Ron as a complete idiot and jerk, I'm fine with you pairing Hermione off with someone else, but at least have Ron be a good person about it. And if it's Draco, Draco has to be redeemed in order for the story to work for me, I don't care much for Dark Hermione stories.
