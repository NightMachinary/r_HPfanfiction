For me Luna has a sixth sense when it comes to people, she knows the right thing to get Harry out of his moods, she knew it was Harry when he was under Polyjuice Potion or was it something else? When he went to Bill's wedding, helped him identify the Thestrals, et cetra.

I'd imagine that she'd be able to support Neville, as well, and Neville would support her, even if he didn't fully believe her theorizes or creatures.

Luna is a really fascinating character and one of my personal favorites, I think she's a character who, in the right situation, could get along with almost every character, or maybe not every, but a good amount.
