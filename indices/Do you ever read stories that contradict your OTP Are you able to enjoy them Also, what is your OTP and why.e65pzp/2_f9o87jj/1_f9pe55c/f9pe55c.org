I have a huge problem with Neville/Luna, Mostly that the movie made it canon when Neville/Hannah is actually canon... Also, I can't really see them working well together. I think Neville is way too down to earth and would a) feel uncomfortable with her or b) make her feel unaccepted. But I found myself surprised to ship Tom/Luna for a while after reading "Luna Lovegood and the dark lord's diary", so anything is possible.

I imagine a scene of Neville bringing Luna home to meet Augusta would be epic!
