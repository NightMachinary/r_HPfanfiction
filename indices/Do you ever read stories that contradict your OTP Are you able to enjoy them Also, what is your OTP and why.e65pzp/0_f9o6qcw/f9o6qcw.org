I'm not too discriminating about pairings any more. Maybe I've been in the past, but years of not finding enough gen stories in this fandom have cured me of using too stringent a filter. Now I read about many different pairings and it's almost never the romance that makes me put a bad story down.

That said, there are some pairings I'm having a hard time understanding. Since I also dislike their most frequent recommendations, it's been a while since I've read any of them. For clarification, that's mostly Harry/Draco, Harry/Lucius or Harry/fanatical-Death-Eater-Azkaban-escapee.
