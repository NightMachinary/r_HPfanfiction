I see why people ship Harry/Hermione, but I have always maintained that I'm super glad that it didn't happen. Most books and movies find it impossible for opposite genders to be friends, it was refreshing even as a child. But, I will read well-written HP/HG. I also don't really ship, but will gladly read, Ginny/Blaise or Ron/Pansy. My favorite unpopular ships are Viktor/Hermione, Snarry (downvote me idc), and Fred/Hermione.
