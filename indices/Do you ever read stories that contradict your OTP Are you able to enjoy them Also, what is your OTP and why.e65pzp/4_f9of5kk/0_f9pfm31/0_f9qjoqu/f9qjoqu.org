The most common one people throw around is Protection from Nargles, linkffn(7352166). It's fluffy, and fun, but unfortunately the sequel's unfinished. It stands on its own quite well though.

A more recent on is Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary, linkffn(12407442). It's quite humorous, with only short chapters, but it does actually have a plot. Luna's character is well captured.

There are a few other decent stories with Luna in them, but Luna is not particularly like her canon self in most of them. For example, Help of a Seer, linkffn(7548963), or Runemaster, linkffn(5077573).

Finally, there's the Firebird Trilogy, which is a dark AU in which every character acts slightly differently from their canon selves, because of how the AU works. Luna isn't a prominent character in the first book, but she's a main character in the other two. I think that Luna is characterised brilliantly for how her canon character would have acted within the AU that they're in. This is my personal favourite of the ones I've included in this list, because it's so interesting to read a completely new take on the whole series. However, it's notoriously hard to get into it (took me a few tries). I hope that if you try it out, you like it. The first book: linkffn(8629685).
