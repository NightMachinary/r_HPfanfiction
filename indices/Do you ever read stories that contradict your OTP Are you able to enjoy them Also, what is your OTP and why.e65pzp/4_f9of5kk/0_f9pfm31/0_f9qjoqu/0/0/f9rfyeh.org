  A more recent on is Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary. It's quite humorous, with only short chapters, but it does actually have a plot. Luna's character is well captured.

Loved it! It actually made me ship Tom/Luna for a while. I still need to reread it, it was in progress when I read it.

Runemaster was also nice.

  Finally, there's the Firebird Trilogy, which is a dark AU in which every character acts slightly differently from their canon selves, because of how the AU works. Luna isn't a prominent character in the first book, but she's a main character in the other two. I think that Luna is characterised brilliantly for how her canon character would have acted within the AU that they're in. This is my personal favourite of the ones I've included in this list, because it's so interesting to read a completely new take on the whole series. However, it's notoriously hard to get into it (took me a few tries). I hope that if you try it out, you like it.

It's an amazing fic and I loved (and suffered from) every minute of it!

With so many great recommendations, I'll be sure to read all you've put here.
