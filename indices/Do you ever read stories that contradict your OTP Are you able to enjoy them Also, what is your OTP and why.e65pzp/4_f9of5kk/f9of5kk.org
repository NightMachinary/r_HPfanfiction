My favourite is Harry/Luna, which has always felt like it would work in an odd sort of way. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a well written Luna, and even in the cases where she's well written, she's usually not paired with Harry.

So yes, I will read things that contradict it, because otherwise I wouldn't be left with much to read. I do tend to avoid Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, because neither feel particularly right for me, but I don't mind Harry/Ginny if it's well written. I used to like Harry/Hermione but it's been ruined by too many bad indy!Harry fics. I also don't like any of the main characters from canon being paired with Draco or other death eaters, because that is just objectively wrong.

I do quite like the idea of Neville/Luna, but I see it a surprisingly small amount of the time. I guess I'd probably be open to most Luna fics if she's written well.
