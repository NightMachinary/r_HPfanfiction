There are 2 pairings I like; NTHP and LESS. Of those, only the latter is actually an OTP, the former is merely a pairing I happen to like. This is actually what my flair is referencing.

I have no issues reading SS/!LE (unless it's SSHP or similar). I do, however, generally avoid LE/!SS fics. Why? No idea really -- I simply have a hard time enjoying it. While I do have objective reasons for disliking Jily, it doesn't explain my habit of also avoiding, say, Remily (a pairing I actually find reasonable).
