This is going to be really controversial, but here goes nothing. Firstly I absolutely refuse to combine characters' names and come up with silly sounding, nonsensical words. A slash does a perfectly fine job. Secondly, I'm not a big fan of having only one “true ship”. We are after all talking about fictional characters. And fanfiction. And I simply don't have that much energy or passion to invest in the lives of made-up people.

At first, it was Harry/ Ginny when I read the books and hadn't gotten into fan fiction yet. After I started reading fanfiction it became Harry/ Hermione. Lately, it's been Harry/ Fleur. That's the short of it.

Why Harry/ Ginny? Why not? It is canon after all. And who am I to disagree with [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod][the word of God]], after all? I am simply astounded by the amount of hatred for Ron and Ginny in fanfiction. There is nothing /that/ wrong with Ginny. IMO her biggest "sin" is dropping "off-screen" (or is it "off-page"?) for the majority of The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire and only briefly appearing in The Order of the Phoenix. And to be fair I still think that what Harry was feeling in The Half-Blood Prince was lust and not love. But those things can be easily fixed with Ginny having more screen time, developing a friendship first and someone sitting down and explaining to Harry the difference between love and lust.

Harry/ Hermione. This one just feels right. Also, the easiest one to write. I think both of those are due to the fact that Hermione is the female that gets the most screen time, is the most developed female character and is close to age to Harry. The downside is that a lot, and I do mean *a lot,* of Harry/ Hermione authors, seem to feel some innate need to hate Ron and/ or Ginny which can be a turn off at times.

Harry/ Fleur. My reasons for liking this are entirely "boyish" so to speak. Harry has had a shit life. There's no going around this or sugar-coating it. Getting it on with the French hottie is the least an author can do for putting him through everything from torture to war and death. Also, Fleur doesn't get a lot of screen time in canon so that leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Plus she's older (if only by three years) and there is something inherently sexy about an older, more mature and experienced woman seducing a shy young boy. (When the boy is at least 16, preferably 17 of course.) One setback to the pairing is that Fleur is often overpowered or too perfect. She's always beautiful (and should be) and smart (she was a Triwizard champion after all.) But she's often depicted as rich and having an influential father. That just stretches the suspense of disbelief a bit far. I'd be very interested in reading about a Fleur who is still very beautiful and smart, but poor and basically has no influence in the French government.
