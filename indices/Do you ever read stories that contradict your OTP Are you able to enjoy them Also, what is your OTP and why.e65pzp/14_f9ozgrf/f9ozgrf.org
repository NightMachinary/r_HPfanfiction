Yes, I read stories that contradict my OTP, and yes I'm able to enjoy them. However, I have another list of Anti-OTPs (People that don't belong together imo) that I avoid like the plague and don't read those.

My OTP is Drarry. I like Dark fics, I like seeing Dark Harry, I like Harry paired with any Slytherin. As long as the story makes sense and the writing is good. Tons of bad Drarry out there IMO but people like what they like.
