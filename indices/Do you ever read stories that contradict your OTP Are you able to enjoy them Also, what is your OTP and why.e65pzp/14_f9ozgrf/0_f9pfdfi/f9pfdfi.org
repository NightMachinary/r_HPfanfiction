Did you ever read the sacrifices arc? (Saving Connor, etc...)

I don't really like reading slash (as the main pairing, I just find it hard to relate), but I really enjoyed that one!

There was also the one where Tom Riddle somehow jumped to the 90's and started the death eaters with Hermione and co. There was a side of drarry and it was adorable. Maybe Pygmalion?
