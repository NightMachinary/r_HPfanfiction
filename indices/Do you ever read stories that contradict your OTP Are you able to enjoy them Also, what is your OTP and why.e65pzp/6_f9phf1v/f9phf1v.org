I am Hinny trash. I like it when ships stick to canon and frankly, it's all thanks to the fic my flair references, Meaning of One. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] (Yes, I rec this every chance I get, sue me.)

I do like Drarry on occasion, but only if it's done well, and whenever I see Harmony (which I do all too often,) I have to picture the movie versions of the characters to get any enjoyment out of it. Ginny with any guy other than Harry, I can't stand.
