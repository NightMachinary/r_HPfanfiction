Yeah. I like canon ships and 99% of the stuff I read is canon compliant only, but every now and then I will give something else a try and can enjoy it - they're usually one shots or short stories though, and I definitely have NOTPs that I wouldn't ever really enjoy.

Like, I love Harry/Ginny, but enjoy reading a little bit of Ron/Harry now and then. I prefer when stories don't spend time explaining away the canon ships or bashing them and just assume they never happened.
