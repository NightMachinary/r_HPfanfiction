I've never felt that Hermione matches Harry with canon personalities. Unpopular opinion, but Ron/Hermione actually works. I can't really explain why Harry/Hermione feels so wrong, or why Ron/Hermione works for me, but there you have it. I don't particularly like most Harry/Ginny though, because Ginny feels a bit 2 dimensional in the books, and most fanfiction. When an author manages to write a fully fleshed out Ginny, with her flaws and her good points, I can read Harry/Ginny.

But Harry/Hermione just... feels wrong.
