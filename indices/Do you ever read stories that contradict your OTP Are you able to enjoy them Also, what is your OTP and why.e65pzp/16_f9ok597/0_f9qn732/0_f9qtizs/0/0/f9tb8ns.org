Depends on how you look at it I guess, reading g canon I think it's clear hermione at least held a torch for harry,

Some perceive their close and understanding relationship as obvious brother/sister in nature, but I feel Ron's and hermiones is much more sibling like how they're always at each throats, but still caring g and protective like ron is with ginny.

To me at least the canon relationships are stilted and forced,
