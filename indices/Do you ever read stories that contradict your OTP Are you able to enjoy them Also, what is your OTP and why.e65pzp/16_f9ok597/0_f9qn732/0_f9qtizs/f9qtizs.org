Frankly it's the only pairing that makes sense unless you completely change one of their characters/personalities.

Or pairing them with an oc.

Or vanilla pairings, but it was done so poorly that just leaves a poor taste in my mouth.

But I'll give you that a lot of h/hr is mostly just complaining about canon, and wish fulfillment.
