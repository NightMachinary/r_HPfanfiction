Just because you've got an undetectable extension charm doesn't mean you still wouldn't be dirty. It can't replace toilet paper. Perhaps you could add a cleaning charm to them, but then that would defeat the purpose of the extension charm. And just why would you want to walk around carrying pounds of piss and shit? Hygiene and risk of infection aside, I can't imagine that'd smell good.
