If I recall correctly, it's a hidden dimensonal gate that opens into the orange crate of a wealthy fruit seller. There are a few amusing scenes in the later books - one where the gang is dumped into the ocean, and Nakor finds that all the oranges have been ruined (must have been a really bad day for the dude on the other end). Another is when they have to travel to a different level of the multiverse, such that all their magic works differently... and Nakor /still pulls oranges out of the bag/. The rest of the mages have a bluescreen moment, whereupon Nakor reveals that he merely had placed a few oranges in an ordinary sack and brought it with him. There are also a few times where they abuse the oranges to feed themselves instead of starving to death. You gotta wonder how much the profit margins of the merchant are being affected.

Could be an interesting concept for somebody to use in a Horcrux Hunt rewrite - have Hermione enchant a similar opject. You could even do a Very Potter Musical gag where it opens into a grocery store and the only thing Ron and Harry can pull out are Red Vines.
