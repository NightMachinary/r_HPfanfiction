As i said "Many places that had the fidilius charm got ransacked in many different forms". That wasn't me stating it was because of the dark mark, i even stated "via accident" referencing the hermione situation. I stated that to explain why the fidelius charm doesn't always work. You could say the same for shell cottage the instant draco becomes aware of it (because, of course, at that point in the novels he's a death eater whether we like it or not).

Edit: i feel at this point I've accidentally hijacked the post, so im done with the convo. If you want to debate more dm me, otherwise help this poor soul find what they were looking for.
