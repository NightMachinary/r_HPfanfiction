Many places that had the fidilius charm got ransacked in many different forms (think yaxley & grimmauld place via accident). The dark mark is like the physical form of the taboo. If you have it, he can summon you to him, or you can accidently summon him to you. Imagine draco trying to help, going to sleep, next thing he knows the whole place burns down daddy lovegood style because he accidently put his arm under the pillow (Tbh that could be a plot on its own). I guess it could work if you got rid of the whole basis behind the mark, but it wouldn't be realistic.
