You could place featherlight and expansion charms on the fuel tanks, both of those exist in canon. Although if you are willing to throw magic at the problem, disillusioning the bombers would be the better choice. But either of those would involve Grindelwald, and canon says that Britain was almost untouched by the conflict with him. You could obviously diverge from that, but then you have to resolve that somehow.

The other issue is interception (assuming no magical stealth). Operating from Northern France or the Low Countries, any incoming raid would have to cross a lot of Britain to get to Hogwarts, which gives the RAF plenty of opportunity to shoot the incoming bombers down. And either the fighters hold formation and are practically useless, or they can be drawn away at some point, which again leaves the inbound strike undefended. Or you come from Norway, which means crossing Scapa Flow, which at that point is probably the biggest concentration of AA guns on the planet.
