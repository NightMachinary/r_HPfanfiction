For the aircraft at least increasing fuel efficiency could be easily explained away with some kind of magical enchantment to make the aircraft, the fuel, or both, lighter. I believe such a spell is even in canon already though maybe not used just mentioned.

Though I do agree the author at least would need to plan out carefully the capabilities of both sides in a fic focused on war, lest things rapidly become really absurd and inconsistent with various sides having to hold the idiot ball to not ruin the plot. The audience wouldn't necessarily need that knowledge given to them, especially not right away, and maybe not ever depending on if say in a first person story the character(s) would never learn that information.

Also I'd argue that magic not changing the world more is mostly Rowling not letting it rather than it not making sense for those changes to be there. Even still there is way more than Kings Cross, we got hidden dragon preserves and who knows what else magically hidden away.
