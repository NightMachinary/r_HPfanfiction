#+begin_quote
  Mark and Se√°n have ended their YouTube careers. That leaves their Egos with one option to keep themselves from fading as the fans start to forget them: Leave their dimensional plane, and live in the humans'. But the Outside is new and unknown to the Egos, with rules and laws they have a hard time understanding.  Warning that this series will contain Major Character Death, Graphic Depictions of Violence, Strong Language, Manipulation in the form of Gaslighting and development of Stockholm Syndrome, Major Character Injury, Mob Mentalities, and more. All chapters are tagged with proper warnings (ones without warnings are older and need updated), and if you want a tag added, please inform the author! They will be added immediately, and the author encourages readers to say something if one is forgotten.
