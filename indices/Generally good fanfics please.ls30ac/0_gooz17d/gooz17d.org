Not really much to go on, but I'll reccommend a few.

The Denarian Renegade and its sequels are a crossover with the Dresden Files, but you don't need any knowledge of the series to understand it. It has a darker harry who is a bit of a dick but he does get better over time. He picks up a coin that is a vessel for a fallen angel and he becomes a Denarian, able to use Hellfire and such. It is a very well-written fic (for fanfiction) and I would reccommend it if his character doesn't ruin it for you.

Wastelands of Time and its sequel are epic fanfictions that are extremely well-written and I can't reccomend them enough.

Honour Thy Blood is a good fanfic about Harry being saved and trained by his great-uncle. I liked it when I read it.
