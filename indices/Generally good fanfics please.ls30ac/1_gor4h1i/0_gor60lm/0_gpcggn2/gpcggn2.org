Okay so here are some of my recent reads which I quite enjoyed. I'll just link a bunch of different ones and you can take your pick. These are all complete, I got a bunch of WIPs too but I spare you the pain of having to wait for updates by linking finished fics here for now. I tried to skip the best known ones but there a some you might've already read

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440]]) While this one isn't slash I really rec it if you haven't read it. Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle. I didn't think it would work as well as it did.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045]]) wolfstar, Great series, great characterization and all in all there is so much raw emotion, hurt and love and in the end there is a Happy end. Well the beginning of what could be a happy end. Bit graphic at times though if that puts you off
