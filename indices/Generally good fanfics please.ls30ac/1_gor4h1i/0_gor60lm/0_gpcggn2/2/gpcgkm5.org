#+begin_quote
  When Sirius runs away in 1976, Regulus starts writing him letters he never intends to send. They're simply a way to talk about all the things he can't say out loud to anyone - a chronicle of his descent into the Death Eaters, and the eventual realisation that he made all the wrong choices. In 1997, Harry is searching for the Locket-Horcrux at Grimmauld Place. Instead, he finds a stack of yellowed parchment that not only tells a tale that's more captivating than it has any right to, but might also hold the key to information on the remaining Horcruxes. Regulus Black installed a failsafe. Though neither Regulus, nor Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Sirius expected the result of the ritual to be quite this literal. With an Ex-Death Eater who was assumed to be dead in their midst, the Horcrux-hunt goes a bit differently. Regulus is mostly conflicted if his unexpected second chance is really worth all the trouble his company keeps putting him in.   Spoiler: It is. He just likes to complain.

  Dora allows it, because she thinks it's sex. That's what Remus tells her, tells himself, tries to tell Sirius. It's physical, and only that, something the wolf needs and needs to take but not something Remus needs, oh no. Remus suspects that deep down ― or possibly not even that deep ― Dora knows that it's more, knows that Sirius is under Remus's skin and inside his bones in a way that one fuck a month can't even begin to sate. But if she has more to say on the matter, she has yet to say it. Remus knows enough about repression to guess that silence doesn't really mean there isn't something to say, and the weight of that feels heavy enough to bury him.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
