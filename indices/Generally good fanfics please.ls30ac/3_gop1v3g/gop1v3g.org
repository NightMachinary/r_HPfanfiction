Purely based on spelling, grammar, and complex plot, I'd have to point out Methods of Rationality. It's pretty divisive, though; personally I found it funny and quite thought-provoking, but plenty of people don't enjoy it because of Harry's arrogance and the author's strong opinions on utilitarian ethics. I do recommend reading the first ten chapters or so and deciding for yourself; linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR) is a good starting point.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series is definitely long, and has a very creative plot, though only the first four books are complete yet. The author has made Harry clever and powerful for her age, but still entirely capable of making eleven-year-old mistakes and getting into trouble way over her head. It draws on elements of canon HP and the Song of the Lioness, without just repeating either one; it is its own story. Also features lots of great deadpan humour, and positive depictions of all four Houses - which doesn't stop each year from having high stakes. There are hints of future romance, but no pairing for Harry yet.
