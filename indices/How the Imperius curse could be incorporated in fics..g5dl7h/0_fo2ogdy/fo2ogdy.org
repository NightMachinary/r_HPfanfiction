I really like the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] (on its face it is Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter story, but it is a way different from anything you read in the post-war world), and it has very creative way of using the Imperius curse and make it sufficiently disgusting (no, don't worry, no sexploitation).
