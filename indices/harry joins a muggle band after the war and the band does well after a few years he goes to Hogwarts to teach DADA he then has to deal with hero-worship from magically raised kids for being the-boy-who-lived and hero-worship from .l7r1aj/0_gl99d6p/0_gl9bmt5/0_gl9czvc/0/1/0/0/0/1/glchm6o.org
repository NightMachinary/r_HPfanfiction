Alternatively: “Dolores Petunia Bellatrix Potter you were named after the more despicable being I ever had the misfortune of interacting with, my abusive aunt who regularly bashed my head with a flying pan in-between snooping on the life of everyone else because her own was was about as interesting as watching white paint drying and the crazy and sadistic bitch who killed my godfather and tortured an uncountable number of innocents on the service of my arch-nemesis... you really can only go up from there, it doesn't matter how bad you fuck up or how many lives you destroy you will always be considered a downright angel when compared to your namesakes, no matter how bad you end up being you will always win because at the very least you will never manage to be worse than them.

This is the best gift I could ever give you, setting the expectations so low you will /always/ exceed them, just ask your brother Voldemort Severus Vernon Potter, and while you are doing that could you ask him to answer my letter? For some reason he seems to have stopped after sending me one cursing me to hell and back by accident, tell him that I didn't take it personally and understand perfectly that he just addressed the letter wrongly, he doesn't need to be so embarrassed.”
