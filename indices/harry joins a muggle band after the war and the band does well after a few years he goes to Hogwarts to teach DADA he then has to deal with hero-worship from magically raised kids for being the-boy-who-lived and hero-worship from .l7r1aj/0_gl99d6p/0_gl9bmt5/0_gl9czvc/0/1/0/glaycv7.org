Like I said Harry names his kids after several people who were not exactly great people. There's Snape who was an asshole to everyone around him, Dumbledore who believes in breaking a lot of eggs to make an omelet (seriously there's so much shit he does that's like wtf that raising a child like a pig for slaughter is just the tip of the iceberg), Sirius who nearly murdered a classmate using his friend, and James who I could talk about for hours in regards to what a piece of shit he was. Hell even Lily has done some questionable things, specifically in regards to her friendship with Snape
