Ruby Iris Potter was named for Rubeus Hagrid and to tribute the floral naming theme of Harry's Mum's family. Iris is also the Ancient Greek goddess of rainbows - a symbol of hope.

Ruby spent far too much time being babysat by George Weasley, leading to an entrepreneurial streak a mile-wide and a healthy dislike for authority; she enjoys pointing out that neither of her parents are in a place to tell her otherwise. No-one was more horrified than her when she became a Hufflepuff perfect.

Ruby views selling photos of her Dad as hitting two birds with one stone: Generating seed capital for future ventures and ensuring nobody hassles her socially awkward Dad for autographs.
