"Is that Just Harry?"

"Just Harry? That's /the/ Harry Potter!"

"Well he looks just like /the/ Just Harry! I always thought the scar was make-up..."

Harry resisted the temptation to sit down and bang his head against the desk. It was the same every year. With every new cohort of first years he had at least two weeks of /this./ There was more interest in Just Harry this year. Someone must have put out a greatest hits CD recently, he'd have to ask Justin about that...

Just one album, they'd said. Just one. Small, indie - niche. No-one will buy it. But noooo, Just Harry had to go multiplatinum and smash all sales records. Harry had gone into the Muggle world to avoid publicity, not court it! Writing songs was what he did instead of therapy after the war, and Harry was surprised to find that singing them made him feel better too. Then he wanted to make them sound better, and one thing lead to another and suddenly he was learning three different instruments, (yes he counted the cow bell)! Then Hermione found his tapes one day and sent some off "for independent review."

"Independent review" happened to be a friend of a friend of her mother's who owned an independent record label in Nottingham. "Hedwig" left her in tears, "Goodbye Privet Drive (Hello Open Skies)" made her dance, and "Luna(cy)" had her sitting back on wide-eyed wonder and asking herself if she still had any weed left. The phone call Harry got didn't make it seem like he had much of a choice, Just Harry was getting an album.

He liked it, at first. He was being recognised for something he had worked /hard/ at, not for something he didn't remember or killing someone. He was Just Harry - enigmatic, reclusive and "a bright spot of sincere colour after the studied irony of Cool Britannia."

The shows got bigger and he went from one album to seven in three years. He didn't know what made him walk away: The burnout or the fact he couldn't go /anywhere/ anymore without being recognised. At least the Wizarding World was small enough that people got bored of him of he stuck to one place long enough. Here? Not so much. Even a trip to the shop resulted in screaming and autographs.

So he announced his sudden retirement and went back to the Magical World. There was a little bit of fuss when he started teaching Defence at Hogwarts, and a bigger one when he and Ginny (finally) got married - but by and large he was free to be just Harry: Dorky Dad, cool teacher and that guy who saved the world a few times. But every September...

"Oh my God! Just Harry's a wizard!"

"Do you think he'd sign my Mum's copy of Diary? I could owl her."

"Diary? Everyone knows Self is the best album!"

"Self! Snake is where it's at!"

"What are you talking about? That's Harry Potter, the Saviour!"

"My Mum went to a ball with him once..."

Harry turned around to face the music and give his usual speech, when there was a knock at the open door.

"Sorry Dad," a fifth year Hufflepuff said without sounding apologetic at all. "I have /all/ these signed pictures of you for only 6 sickles a pop, I don't suppose anyone in this class is interested?"

Harry's laughing daughter was swamped by first years holding sickles out in their fists.

"Ruby Iris Potter! You /scalp/! Get out of my classroom!"

"You create demand, I provide supply. That's good business." Ruby cheerfully ignored him as she smiled at a first year Ravenclaw.
