Finally, a fic which incorporates *music* in the fandom in some way at least! I mean... The only time i feel touched by something close to magic is when I'm creating music. /+I would gladly read a well-written fic in which the main character is an aspiring musician, as a muggleborn student in Hogwarts.+/
