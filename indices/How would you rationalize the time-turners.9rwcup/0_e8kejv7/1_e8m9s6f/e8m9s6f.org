  As for villains using them, well I would reject JKR's statement that time turners can change history and go with the implied explanation in Book 3 that they create a closed time loop, so they aren't as useful as they sound.

They are still super useful though: They give you huge amounts of time to figure something out. They allow you to go somewhere and witness events that you just discovered after the fact. The potential for spying is enormous. Aurors should definitely use them to solve crimes.
