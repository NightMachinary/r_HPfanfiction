This is one of the reasons I don't use time turners in my story. But now that I think about it, I think there's an explanation.

Consider JKR's statement that Hermione had the /only/ time turner ever brought into Hogwarts. And yet, other students besides Hermione have successfully taken 12 classes before--Percy for sure. Also consider that the core class teachers all have to teach 12 classes. They can't be using time turners. People would definitely notice that.

And finally, Hermione doesn't just have class conflicts. She has /specific/ conflicts. Divination, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies are all at the same time. If there is only one section of each of those classes, /no one/ would be able to take them together, even if they aren't taking all the classes. If there is more than one section, it's possible that Hermione can't switch sections because she's taking so many classes, and any combination creates conflicts.

I think the solution is that it's not normal to need a time turner to take all the classes. There was a specific scheduling conflict that year that made it impossible for Hermione to do without one. And we have a good candidate: Remus. Exactly when werewolves transform is inconsistent in canon, but he wouldn't want any classes at night because he'd miss even more teaching time, and it would be more noticeable. And in Scotland in December, sunrise is at 9 am, and sunset is at 3:30 pm.

So Remus's classes are all pushed to the middle of the day, and since Defence is a required class, the electives get pushed to the edges, where they overlap just enough that Hermione can't make all of them fit in a normal schedule.

As for villains using them, well I would reject JKR's statement that time turners can change history and go with the implied explanation in Book 3 that they create a closed time loop, so they aren't as useful as they sound.
