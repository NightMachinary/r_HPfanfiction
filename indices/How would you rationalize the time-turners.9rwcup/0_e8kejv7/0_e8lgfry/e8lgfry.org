That's very clever, that Remus idea. However:

#+begin_quote
  Consider JKR's statement that Hermione had the only time turner ever brought into Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

This is one I'm just going to ignore. I don't normally do this but I love the idea that the Wizarding World is routinely so crazy as to issue time-machines to kids too much.

And didn't you ignore it yourself in /A Little Child Shall Lead Them/? I seem to recall Barty being mentioned as using one too.

#+begin_quote
  well I would reject JKR's statement that time turners can change history and go with the implied explanation in Book 3 that they create a closed time loop,
#+end_quote

That's two different types of Time-Turners, though. The standardized Time-Turners issued by the Unspeakables are engineered to create only time loops as a "safety procedure"; it's experimental, wild, more dangerous time-travel that can change the past.
