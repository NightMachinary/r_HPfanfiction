Time-Turners are /not/ artificially meant to make self-consistent time loops. They merely "stabilize" a hour-reversal charm and limit it to 5 hours.

From Pottermore ([[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner]]):

#+begin_quote
  Even the use of the very limited amount of Time-Turners at the Ministry's disposal is hedged around with hundreds of laws. While not as potentially dangerous as skipping five centuries, the re-use of a single hour can still have dramatic consequences and the Ministry of Magic seeks the strictest guarantees if it permits the use of these rare and powerful objects.

To ensure self-consistent time loops the Time-Turners would have to enforce a strictly unchangeable timeline, denying the free will of the time traveler, which would make all those "hundreds of laws" quite useless. No point in telling people not to do certain things while time traveling when they have no control anyways.

Also, causal loops suck.
