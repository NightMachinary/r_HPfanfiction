It's not directly stated that the way they "stabilized" the Charm is through forcing time loops, but I'm arguing that it's the most reasonable extrapolation from the facts that:

- we're told that Time-Turners "stabilize" the Hour-Reversal Charm somehow;
- other, non-Unspeakable-"stabilized" forms of time travel like the Eloise Mintumble experiment and Nott's Time-Turner from /Cursed Child/ don't have time loops but instead cause wild changes to the timeline;
- Time-Turners cause time loops.

That a bunch of additional rules are needed /on top of/ the time-loop-causing is simply a testament to how dangerous and complex time-travel is in the /Harry Potter/ universe.
