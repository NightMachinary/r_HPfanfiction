#+begin_quote
  other, non-Unspeakable-"stabilized" forms of time travel like the Eloise Mintumble experiment and Nott's Time-Turner from /Cursed Child/ don't have time loops but instead cause wild changes to the timeline;
#+end_quote

They cause such wild changes because they go back more than 5 hours. The Unspeakables consider 5 hours the maximum amount of time to go back without risking serious damage to yourself or time.

​

I assume that with "time loop" you mean that whatever you do when traveling back in time with a time turner is exactly that which already happened before traveling back, enforced through the magic of the time turner. If that is not what you mean then please elaborate on what exactly you mean, otherwise please re-read my previous comment.
