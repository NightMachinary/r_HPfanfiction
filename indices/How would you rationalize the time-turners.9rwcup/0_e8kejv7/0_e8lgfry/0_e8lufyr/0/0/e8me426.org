Let's assume for a moment that the original timeline is indeed completely fixed (i.e. it can't be changed, whatever you do when traveling back in time already happened exactly like that). When you travel back in time, you have to conform exactly to what already happened. If that is the case then whatever you do is already predestined, you literally cannot "deliberately go out and meet yourself in the past", therefore you can't cause a paradox. If you /can/ cause a paradox then you need freedom to do things differently, at which point there is only one "original" timeline but infinitely many possibilities for what you do and the probability that what you do conforms to the one original timeline is zero. Assuming that when you travel back, you either exactly conform to the original timeline or you cause a paradox, then all time travel will always cause a paradox.

I can see only one way the time travel description in Canon works: When you travel back in time and change things so they are differently from before traveling back, reality is rewritten to include these changes and your memories get changed accordingly. This is how Harry remembers seeing himself cast the Patronus even though at that point in his personal timeline that event had not happened yet.

There is also the time travel description from HPMOR (yes, I know) which if I recall correctly makes it so that changes due to time travel happen the moment the time traveler commits to traveling back and doing these changes. For example, in HPMOR Harry is locked in a room and commits to later traveling back and causing his own rescue and then promptly gets rescued. Afterwards he has to actually go through with his commitment or he would probably cause a paradox. While I like this time travel definition, it does not work for Canon since the Patronus was cast before Harry committed to his time travel.
