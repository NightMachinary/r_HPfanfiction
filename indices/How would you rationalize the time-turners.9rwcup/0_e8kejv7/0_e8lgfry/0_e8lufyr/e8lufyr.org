  That's two different types of Time-Turners, though. The standardized Time-Turners issued by the Unspeakables are engineered to create only time loops as a "safety procedure"; it's experimental, wild, more dangerous time-travel that can change the past.

They are limited to 5 hours because the Department of Mysteries has decided that's the maximum amount without a significant risk to Time etc.

Dumbledore and Hermione both warn against what can happen when using a Time Turner which implies that they both at least believe that the past (if only the last 5 hours of it) can be changed.
