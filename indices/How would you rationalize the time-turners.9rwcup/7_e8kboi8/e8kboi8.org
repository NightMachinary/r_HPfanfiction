To be completely honest, it's entirely plausible that students are granted Time Turners more often than we realize. They may not even restrict them as much as we assume.

Imagine it - people like Hermione are granted Time Turners for what we imagine are very trivial reasons ("I just /have/ to take all these courses at my school for teenagers!"). There's nothing irresponsible about that desire at all, but you'd imagine it would be /very/ irresponsible to grant that desire with a fucking 4th-dimension altering device, no?

Maybe not.

After all, they can give it to whoever they want, really. It doesn't actually change the timeline, and people who fuck around with it get "unborn".
