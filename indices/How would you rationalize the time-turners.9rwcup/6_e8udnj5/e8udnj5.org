Having a time turner for academic purposes may be a special privilege the Ministry gives for one specific reason: the user is going back a very short time, and isn't altering the past/present in any way, merely adding to their own experience. Hermione isn't going back to change anything, just to learn more, basically adding an hour or so to her day each day. Time turners seem to function like a magical version of free periods or extra credit lessons for the academically gifted students, and the fact that the Ministry is the one giving them out, I suspect they function like government/military scholarships, with the expectation that the student will repay the Ministry help by working with them after graduation.

As to whether Tom had access to one as a student, if they existed back then, I'd say yeah, but would he really be stupid enough to alter reality too much? He was interested in living forever, which a time tuner can't help with except help him research or access forbidden materials, and really how much could he do with Dumbledore keeping a close eye on him. It would be useful for him later in life, but again, the sheer amount of planning involved in going back in time and altering enough to help him rise to power would be a waste when he could do it without the time turner and less potential problems.
