Time Turners are dangerous, but not dangerous enough to not entrust them to trustworthy students like Hermione. Because a timeturner doesn't "re-do" anything. Its mere existence creates timeloops which makes it seem to 3D creatures like humans, as if things happen twice when they are the ones looping time. To bystanders it only happens once. Timelooping is also not a deletion of time, its just a step back for the universe in order to make the step twice. So you can't timeturn your birth away, for example.

I also believe that timeturners are used more often than we see in the HP universe. Ministry personell, Heads of Departments, Aurors and down to students the faculty of Hogwarts deems capable of managing the workload of /every/ selective *plus* them having scheduling issues (which may actually have happened for the first time with Hermione, who knows?).

But the catch is that timeturners aren't very helpful with critical situations. For a first, of course, there is the time limitation (I'm ignoring the Cursed Child bullshit here, obviously). Second, I always imagine Destiny and Fate to be real forces in the HP universe. Like Love or Hate have weight in this universe, some things are just meant to be and no matter how often you timeturn to change it, /you won't/. For example, I have written a small snippet in the past in which Dumbledore tries to timeturn back to prevent the Potters from dying. Him being incapable of saving them, no matter what he did, had him confirm that this was indeed the "marking of his equal" the prophecy talked about. It was a fixture in time, unchangeable by timeloops.

On the other side I also had my fun with them in the past. For example, I stated that the universe had some sort of "Occams Razor" for time being fooled around with. Once a bystander was incapable of denying seeing 2 Hermiones, for example, the universe would just decide that there are now 2 Hermiones to save itself from temporal collapse in the rare case a timeloop is broken. I still have a little story-start lying on my harddrive in which Hermione time-clones herself.
