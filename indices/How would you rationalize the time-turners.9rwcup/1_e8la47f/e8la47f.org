Firstly, I see them as a relatively new invention, that has barely seen any testing outside the DoM when Hermione got hold of one. My theory is that Hermione was "beta-testing" it, and her use was somewhat similar to how they expected it to be used in the ministry: increasing employee availability during busier times of day without having to hire people who'd sit around doing nothing most of the time. Hermione was picked because she was the only one who signed up for all classes that year, and Dumbledore, who's got friends in the DoM, got wind of it.

I suppose it's easy to ignore Percy's OWL results as early installment weirdness, but I expect that he didn't attend all the classes he ended up taking the OWL exam for.
