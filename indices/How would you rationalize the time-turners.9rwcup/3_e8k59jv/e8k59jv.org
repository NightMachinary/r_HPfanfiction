  Was Tom Riddle a genius prodigy given a similar option?
#+end_quote

Tom Riddle may have been a prodigy, but he certainly wouldn't have taken Muggle Studies, and I highly doubt that he took Divination, or he would have been more sensible about the Prophecy. Remember, the Time-Turner was only needed because Hermione had decided to take /all/ the electives.

  Where are the older students who know about time-turners?
#+end_quote

Well, it's believed by many that Barty Jr. had one, and possibly Percy as well.

  Or does he not know that there exists locket like devices which literally bend space time to make things happen?
#+end_quote

Messing with time is /dangerous/ --- there's a reason only an /extremely/ trustworthy student like Hermione got the option. It was seriously putting the timeline in jeopardy to abuse it to save Harry and Sirius, and actually trying to change the past nearly caused a time-crash when Unspeakables experimented on it.

Hence, it is /extremely ill-advised/ to use Time-Turners for combat. Especially since it might entice your enemies to obtain their own Time-Turners and fight back.

Paradoxes and other faulty time-manipulation can erase people from existence (it's called being "unborn"), and thus would be one of the few threats to Voldemort's existence while his Horcruxes were intact (Dementors being the other). I think he'd steer well clear of time-travel, and, in the event of managing to conquer Wizarding Britain, he probably would have destroyed all Time-Turners. +Except one to use as a Horcrux.+

  What about other countries? Do Americans have time-turners?
#+end_quote

Probably not, since the British Unspeakables developed them. But they developed them using a variation of the existing, more dangerous Hour-Reversal Charm, so foreign wizards might still be able to time-travel that way, or build their own, more or less different time-machines.
