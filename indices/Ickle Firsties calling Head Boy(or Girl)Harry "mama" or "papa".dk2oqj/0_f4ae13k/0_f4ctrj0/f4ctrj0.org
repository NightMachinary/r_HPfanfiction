I guess it could be something the twins start. They call Harry and Hermione the 'dad' and 'mom' of Gryffindor and convince the first years that it's just a thing and they should roll with it.

A prank that gets out of hand and lasts past 5th year all the way until the end of their 7th year and it creates a new precedent with a new 'dad' and 'mom' being elected after they graduate.
