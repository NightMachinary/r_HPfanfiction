German and Russian aristocracy used to be very friendly with each other. For examples:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great][Catherine the Great]] was a German princess.
- The last Czar of Russia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia][Nicholas II]], was primarily of German and Danish descent. He and Kaiser Wilhelm II were all first cousins of the King George V of the United Kingdom.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Kira_Kirillovna_of_Russia][Grand Duchess Kira]] was a Russian princess who married Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, in 1938, right when Nazis were in power and about to start WW2. The couple remained untouched by the Nazis until their involvement in the July 20, 1944 assassination plot against Hitler was uncovered. They were arrested in late 1944 and spent a few months in Dachau Concentration Camp.
