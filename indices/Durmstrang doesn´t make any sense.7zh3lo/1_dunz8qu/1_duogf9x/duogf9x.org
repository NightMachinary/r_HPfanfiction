To be fair, European nobility was generally quite interconnected. Quite a few foreign nobles came from minor German houses or cadet lines. The current Dutch family is of Nassau and the Palatine branch of the Wittelsbach line ruled Sweden for quite some time.

Of course, there were also the more significant ones like Habsburg or Hannover, but those are rather well known.
