  so there is no way that Sturm und Drang was the inspiration for the name...

I always saw it as a play on words for the reader, but not an in-world inspiration. Like Remus Lupin both meaning wolf (not to mention Fenrir is the wolf-son of Loki in Norse Mythology), Dolores Umbridge meaning basically Pain & Annoyance ( /dolorous/ means causing pain or sorrow, umbrage means offense or displeasure), and stuff like that.
