Hrm. Are we talking about an "I am good at writing things. Anyone have a nice seed of an idea to write into something?" or an "I goofed and broke the story. Any ideas on how to fix my plot holes?"

TBH, even in the latter case, there's nothing /wrong/ with asking for help.... especially since a reasonable number of us readers are also authors.

For that matter, there's also the "I see multiple futures from this point, and am indifferent between them. I want to have reader participation, so choose!"
