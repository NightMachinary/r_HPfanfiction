I think a lot of writers have a good idea of the beginning and end and main developments in the middle. However, they might find that the middle part is still a bit sparse. This is when many people would ask readers for ideas to populate it, I think. By collecting suggestions from readers, they would be able to thicken the story with sideplots, or add complications into their main plot - producing a more interesting story overall.

i.e. many people know where they're going with the story, but they're asking readers to suggest a more scenic route to get there.

So yeah, I think asking for help is a great idea.
