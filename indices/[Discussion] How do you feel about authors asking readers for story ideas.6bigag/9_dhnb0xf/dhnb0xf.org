If it's minor I don't think it's indicative of poor storytelling. Stories develop in ways the author doesn't expect sometimes and asking for further ideas for a small plotline is fair (I've seen authors ask about minor character relationships which is not as egregious as asking about larger plotlines).

I think it's also perfectly reasonable to ask for ideas for humour or crack stories in particular as they have less constraints as plotted stories. Asking the audience for a funny joke or something they want the character to do is a great way of engaging with the audience.
