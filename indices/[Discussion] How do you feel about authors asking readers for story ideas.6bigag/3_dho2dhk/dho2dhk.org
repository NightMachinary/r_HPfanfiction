I don't have a problem with writers asking for input or ideas, but as with everything else it has to be within reason. Depending on quality of the writing and if I like the story I am happy to provide feedback / suggestions. Lot of stories are written "organically" one chapter at the time and immediately posted. So story will often end up different than writer imagined in the beginning. However I would draw a line between writers who have a planned out plot outline and know in general where their story is going and those that just write stuff without any direction.

Strangely enough sometimes (though rarely) it's the latter kind of stories that end up being most fun and interesting and unpredictable.
