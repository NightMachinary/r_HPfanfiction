This should never, ever be done, unless the idea is so vague as "a new fic in the Harry Potter fandom."

First of all, it makes the author look rather dense and unimaginative (yes, I know the same argument is often applied to fanfic in general. But the buck has to stop somewhere). A great part of writing is the use of imagination, and an author is not displaying that when he or she has to resort to asking readers for ideas. To me, it comes across as review whoring.

Second of all, there is no way you are going to be able to include every plot idea readers suggest. Any new plot or subplot is difficult to write into a story which you already have most planned out. In addition, the fans whose ideas are not included may take badly to it.

Lastly - and most importantly - we have the dubious morality and 'legality' of it. We on this sub write fanfiction, which is and of itself legally dubious, and exists only by the grace of certain kind authors. When you use someone else's ideas in your writing, you leave yourself open to future retaliation. I've seen enormous dramas unfold because someone claimed, "oh, you stole my idea." Even if you have proof that the reader tactility granted you permission to use their idea, what if they later change their minds? How would moderators on fanfiction websites deal with it? However it worked out, it would be an enormous headache for the author. The potential for problems with it is too great.
