I'm writing a HP/Naruto xover and I recently asked my readers about Naruto's team after he graduates the academy. (he gets better at ninjutsu and stuff so it doesn't make sense for him to end up in the same team) the thing is that the story takes place two years before that and the current arc ends about one year before Naruto graduates. this because i'm already planing the sequel got some good ideas that I would have never considered.

So i think as long as you have and ending planed asking for ideas from the reader can help refine your storyline for the better

plus I got more reviews in that chapter than the other ones, twice as much :P
