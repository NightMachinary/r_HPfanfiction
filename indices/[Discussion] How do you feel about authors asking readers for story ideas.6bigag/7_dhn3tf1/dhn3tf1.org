Story ideas for whole stories, likely one-shots, are fine by me. The same about cases where something went wrong and the author is asking for ideas on how to fix it because they don't want to be forced to rewrite however much stuff they would otherwise have to.

Making the readers decide what happens in the story because the author doesn't know where to take it, on the other hand ... well, /rarely/ I can see that as not bad, but a lot of the time it is not a good sign.
