I've gotten a lot of good ideas from people, even when I don't ask them for story ideas. The only things I've recently asked about were...

1) regarding who should be the Hogwarts Champion in the Triwizard Tournament (Cedric, or someone else just to be different -- ended up with a poll in which the winner was totally unexpected, so that was neat!),

2) Hermione's parents names.(Another poll)

3) and ideas for original Tournament tasks, so I wouldn't be repetitive.

Those seem like okay things to ask for. Other stuff that really affects the plot and could affect the original plans an author makes, that isn't stuff to ask for ideas about.

To be completely honest, I do find asking for story ideas a hell of a lot better than reviewers asking ME to write something for them. I do not do that!
