I'm actually reading a story right now in which the author asks for ideas to further the story. In the first author's note, the author said that he/she (not sure which gender) had already written six or so chapters, but nothing afterwards; therefore, he/she wanted ideas in the form of reviews.

To me, it just seems sloppy and poor planning (even though I do find the story - the first six or so chapters okay, though nothing amazing).

I think the main problem I have with authors on FanFiction is that they try to focus on two different genres (i.e. romance and action), yet they can't find a balance between them, and instead, focus on one or the other, while blatantly ignoring its pair. This is the case with the story I'm on right now (with the author asking for ideas of where to take the story): It's trained solely on action, yet the romance is quite dull and nonexistent.

Perhaps with a fair bit of planning, this could have been avoided, but what if the readership wants more action, or more romance? Then you'll have a divergence of ideas of where the future of the story is headed, and thus, the whole thing will end up in a big mess with readers not happy.

As a FanFiction author myself, I try to have a beginning and end, with a premise that works within the two points and go from there.
