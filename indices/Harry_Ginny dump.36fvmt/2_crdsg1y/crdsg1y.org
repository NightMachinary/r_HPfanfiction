Got to love Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent, which is book one of a long, completed trilogy (sorry, can't find the link right now but google should have it pretty easily). The trilogy as a whole is called the "Triangle Prophecy" series.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] is amazing. There is a sequel about other characters, but I never did read that one. I just loved nearly everything about the original though: the characters were done so well, and the action too, but mostly it was mind-blowing to read a fanfic that drew such an emotional response from me without resorting to grimdark territory. Far and away the best time travel fic around.

I'll try to think of some more and edit later. There was one that involved Harry and company sharing a masked vigilante identity, killing death eaters. It was a one word title, but I can't seem to recall that word. It had a Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny (both with good intentions) sort of thing going on. That one also rocked.
