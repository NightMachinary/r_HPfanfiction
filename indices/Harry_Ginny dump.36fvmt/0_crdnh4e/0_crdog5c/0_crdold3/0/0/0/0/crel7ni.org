  All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it -- how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him -- nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling.

Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.

  ‘Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.

  ‘Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.
