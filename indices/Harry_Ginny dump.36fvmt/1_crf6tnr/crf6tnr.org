There are loads of others (after all, every story back in the day was either HG or HHr), but most haven't aged all that well. The first two are still awesome though, while the third is funny in parts.

Most stories are plot oriented rather than romance oriented. 1-6, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 and 20 are especially recommended. 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 16 and 17 are complete, while the rest are WIP or abandoned. 6 seemed especially promising, but was abandoned very early. 10, 18, 19 and 20 are only minor HG.
