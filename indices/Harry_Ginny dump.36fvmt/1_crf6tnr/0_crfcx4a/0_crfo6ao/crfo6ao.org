After the end's greatest strength is its writing quality. Even after so many years it probably remains the best written fix in the fandom. The characterizations of the main characters are excellent, no other fanatic comes close to capturing Ron's "Ron-ness" the way this fic does: his dialogue may well have been written by Jkr herself. And Draco Malfoy is just the perfect antagonist here: the story doesn't make him extra evil, and his motivations are easy to understand, and that mixture of arrogance, cowardice and cunningness is so very Draco. The main plot is engaging, and when the time comes to deliver -- the Quidditch match, Sirius storming Azkaban, Draco's blackmail and the last stand against the dementors -- the fic delivers in spades.

There are some parts I didn't like -- I wasn't all that fond of the main romance, and Ginny's characterization was jarring at times, but I loved the story overall.
