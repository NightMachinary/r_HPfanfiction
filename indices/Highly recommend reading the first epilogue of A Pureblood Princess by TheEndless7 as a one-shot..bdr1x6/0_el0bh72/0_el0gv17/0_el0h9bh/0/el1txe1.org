What nonsense are you spouting? It's fanfiction! Everyone gets married and lives happily ever after with a bunch of Daaaawww kiddos and puppies. Ron/Hermione Draco/Pansy Astoria/Theodore Neville/Hannah Ginny/Neville Bill/Fleur Fred/George

wait what do you mean that Harry killed Draco and Ginny? That doesn't seem right.....Well oh well. It's not like lying to someone for fifteen years of their life would lead to any negative feelings or repercussions.
