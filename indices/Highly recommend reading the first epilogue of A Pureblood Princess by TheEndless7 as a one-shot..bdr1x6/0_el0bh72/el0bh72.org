I often read that as a standalone story myself.

One thing that's important to point out from the start. People sometimes criticise some of TE7's stories for not having much magic in them. Those criticisms are usually invalid but that epilogue really does have almost zero (visible) magic in it - for a very good reason. I won't spoil it by saying why, but felt I should point it out.

Epilogue 2 goes between the main story and Epilogue 1, and Epilogue 3 occurs during Epilogue 1. Just to keep things confusing.
