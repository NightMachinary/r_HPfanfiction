I mean, the big example is Harry Potter, Squatter, where he's basically adopted by Hestia and Artemis from the Percy Jackson Greek Pantheon. I was able to follow along with pretty much everything aside from some of the 'past events references' that the PJ wikis didn't seem to cover. I've never read any of the books or seen any of the movies, but I have a pretty decent knowledge of Greek Mythology, so I don't know fully if that's a useful statement to you or not.
