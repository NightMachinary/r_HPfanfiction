That makes me wonder if levelling up/stat boosts could be handled in an actual game by a sort of Limit Break system.

As in, the usual stuff that fills a limit-break/overdrive/whatever it's called bar, are also needed to accumulate any meaningful EXP from an encounter. Using up a lot of health/mana/stamina, basically. Final Fantasy II did that, sorta, if you lost enough HP in a battle then your HP would increase, and so forth.
