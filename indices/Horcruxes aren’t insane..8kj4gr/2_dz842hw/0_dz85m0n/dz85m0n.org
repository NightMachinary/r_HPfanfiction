Yeah, canon Voldemort never was much more than a plot device for Harry to do all his Harry-stuff. One reason I like fanfiction is that the Voldemorts are often so much better. From the hilarious Voldemort of the Seventh Horcrux to Emily of LdS to Professor Quirrell of HPMoR, there's a bewildering, very diverse, array of very good Voldemorts.
