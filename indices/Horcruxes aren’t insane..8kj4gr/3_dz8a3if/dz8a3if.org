The insane part of his Horcrux creation is in other aspects of it than the underlying survival instinct.

- You need to commit cold-blooded murder to create one. The "cold-blooded" part of it certifies at least a modicum of psychopathy on his part. Snuffing out a life just like that, this total lack of empathy, /that/ is insane.

- His choice of horcrux was tremendously impractical and entirely steered by his megalomaniac desires. High value artefacts and his pet snake? Why not take a pebble and drop it into the Atlantic Ocean? You obviously don't need a horcrux present to resurrect yourself, so why not keep them somewhere so far away from any living soul that finding them is practically impossible? He wasn't rational about it. It almost seems like he /wanted/ people to find them by guessing on the clues like a psychopathic serial killer wants to be found.

He was legitimately evil by pretty much every moral code out there. He had no redeeming qualities in his later life. During his teenage years you could maybe just call him a deeply disturbed boy, lashing out at the world. But in his later life, when he aimed to conquer and destroy, he was 100% just /"crazy big bad guy who is bad because bad bad bad"/.
