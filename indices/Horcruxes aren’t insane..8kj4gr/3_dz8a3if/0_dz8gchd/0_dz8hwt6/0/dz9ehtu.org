If you're already going to kill someone, and you could very easily use that death to become immortal, then it's just good sense to use that death. Waste not, want not. It'd be like eating carrots and throwing out the carrot greens when your pet rabbit's right there needing food. Except the carrots are people and you're murdering them.

The incremental evil of making a horcrux, beyond just murdering someone, just doesn't seem to be there. The characters in the text seem to view it as a much bigger evil, but nobody articulates why.
