Mostly Zuko. The others you mentioned can be used as examples as well. Any AtLA character really. But since I'm talking about Zuko, I'll explain him.

I mainly use Zuko as an example because when we where introduced to his character we immediately would dislike him because he is the ‘bad guy' trying to attack a peaceful village and take the main protagonist. In the first episode we judged Zuko for how he looks and how he acts without much context other than “Fire Nation is bad so he's bad too, oh, how he acts add facts to this conclusion. And he follows them persistently and ends up setting places on fire. More facts.”

However, as we learned more about Zuko's character we began to root for him. One example was Zuko's Agni Kai with Zhao. Even though it was established that Zuko was an antagonist, we began to become sympathetic towards him since we learned that Zhao is even worst. We began to notice more admirable qualities. Especially with Iroh as his conscious.

Since that was overshadowed by other events that adds towards his bad guy persona, it is not till we actually learned about Zuko's backstory which really open our eyes. The reason that Zuko was a portrayed as a ‘bad guy' draws from his motivation of wanting to go home and simply be accepted by his family. Those motivations give context towards his actions made him truly complex. The reason why Zuko did all the immoral acts generic for a antagonist is drawn from him wanting his father's approval. Thus reveal that motivation is the source of why he became an antagonist towards Aang from the start.
