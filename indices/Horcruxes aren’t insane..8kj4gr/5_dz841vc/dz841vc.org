I find this incredibly true as I grew older. When I first read the HP books (Avatar the Last Airbender can also be a good example), I always had this perception that people can be â€˜evil' just because they can. However, it shifted when I started to try to see it from a their point of view. Yes, there are some that can be evil just because they can, but I find that the majority draws their motivation from something deeper. Sometimes tragic childhoods or something that pushes them over the line. Other times because they come from unfortunate circumstances. There are plenty more situations, but those are some of they big ones I could think of. They don't justify the truly bad decisions they put others through. They simply show that circumstances can push anyone to do truly immoral acts.
