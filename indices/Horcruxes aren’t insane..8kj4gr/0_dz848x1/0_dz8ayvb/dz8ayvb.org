JKR originally wrote crime fiction before the Harry Potter series. Which is why she returned to it under her pen name Galbraith afterwards. But I think because of this, Voldemort basically covers a checklist of psychopathic tendencies. I remember when trying to create my own Voldemort for my fic that I compared him to such a list, and he checks all the boxes, even including the killing of small animals (although arguably this was a calculated move against Billy Stubbs rather than for the sake of killing the rabbit).
