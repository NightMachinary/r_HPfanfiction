I just figured that he's an actual psycopath.

Straight from the wiki article on psychopathy:

- Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness.

- Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints.

- Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, defiance of authority.
