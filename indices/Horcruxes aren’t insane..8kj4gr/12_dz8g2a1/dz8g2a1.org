Well, the thing is most of the things you mentioned as examples so far have all sacrificed some physical or mental construct like money, or their rights. Sure, it's extreme but you didn't really hurt somebody else (to some extent) or mess yourself up, did you? Horcruxes involve not only murdering another human being but also tearing apart your own soul. It's, well, blasphemous. It's considered taboo in the Magical world to even consider making a Horcrux and tearing a part of your soul away. To willingly do it six times is just unheard of! Not only that, but the making of a horcrux is also for selfish reasons: to make sure you can't die. In a way, you sacrifice somebody else's life and a piece of your own humanity just to extend your own life. And Voldemort does it six times (willingly).
