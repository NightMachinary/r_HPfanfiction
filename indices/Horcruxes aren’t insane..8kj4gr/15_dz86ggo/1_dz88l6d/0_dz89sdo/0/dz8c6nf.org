I read that more as a matter of Snape's own motivations and remorse mattering. Whereas if you're using a person and you are just going for an easy target for efficiency it might still work. It's a bit of a question over whether the morality of an action depends on why you do it, or upon what you do. Intent seems a powerful factor in Harry Potter magic.
