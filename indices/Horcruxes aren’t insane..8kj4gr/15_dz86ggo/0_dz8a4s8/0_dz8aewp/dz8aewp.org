I don't think that I do! Who hasn't read the newspaper and looked at like, a child abuser or animal abuser and though that person doesn't really deserve to live? If you're a wizard, it would be super-easy to kill them, it's as easy as saying two words, and the reward is, like, eternal life. I think that a lot of wizards who already regard muggles as a lower life form would do it without a thought.
