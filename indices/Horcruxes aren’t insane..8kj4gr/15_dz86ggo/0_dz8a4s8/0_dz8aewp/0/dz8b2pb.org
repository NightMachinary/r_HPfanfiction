But righteous murder doesn't lead to a horcrux. Killing in the name of justice doesn't count. Killing in the name of mercy doesn't count. You have to kill an innocent life - take someone entirely undeserving of death and kill them in cold blood.

And killing child and animal abusers is as easy as pulling a trigger; as easy as letting a blade slit their throat. Killing isn't complicated. The mechanics of it are incredibly easy, really. Take a big stone and let it drop on their heads.

The problem with killing is that people are capable of extreme levels of empathy. To think someone deserves death and to actually kill them are action which are /worlds/ apart from each other. Why do you think soldiers need to go through a drill? Humans are incapable of /just killing/. There are plenty of stories of soldiers from the Napoleonic wars to the first world war in which they screamed, roared and threatened the other soldiers, shot wildly in the air, but when they had the other guy in the crosshairs and looked them in the eyes, they just /stopped/. They couldn't kill them, even though they were the enemy. The drill is there to make killing an instinctive reaction to enemy contact - and plenty of soldiers suffer the consequences of it when back home, when civilians surround them. Untrained, non-fanatic and psychologically sound humans - /most of us/ - are practically incapable of cold-blooded murder. That is a truth. Every great army on the planet has studies underlining this, because they had to deal with this to make effective soldiers out of otherwise normal human beings.
