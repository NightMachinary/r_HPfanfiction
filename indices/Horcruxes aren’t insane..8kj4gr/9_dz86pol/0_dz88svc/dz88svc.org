Or possibly from spending years as a wraith, it never sounds very comfortable.

Prior to that, baby killing isn't actually that crazy. If the Arthurian mythos is like Malory in this universe (and there are indications it might be) then Arthur literally could have stopped the fall of Logres if he had gone and killed Mordred as a baby in person, instead of putting him out to sea in a rubbish boat with a load of other babies. Alternatively he could just not have killed babies, but it is fairly plausible that Voldemort is trying to learn from history.
