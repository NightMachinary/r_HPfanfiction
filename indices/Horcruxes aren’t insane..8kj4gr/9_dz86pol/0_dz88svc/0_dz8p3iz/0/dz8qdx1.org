Very true, I am afraid I decided to summarise for the sake of simplicity and avoiding typing too much on a phone. Point is Voldemort might actually have this as a historical example so that he thinks: this has happened before, I am not making that mistake, I will take care of it personally. In an amusing way Voldemort is the once and future king to his followers.
