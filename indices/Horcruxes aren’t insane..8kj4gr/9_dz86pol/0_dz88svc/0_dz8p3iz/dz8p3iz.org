There are three versions for that story:

1) Arthur has all the children born that day rounded up and put on a rickety boat that sank. Mordred survived, and swore vengeance.

2) Arthur has all the children born that day brought to his castle and raised as squires. Mordred was the only one who didn't love him.

3) Arthur is convinced not to go with option 1 by Merlin, but a particularly inept member of his court only heard the first part, and went through with it.
