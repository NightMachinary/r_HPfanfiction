That depends. If you view the soul as self (You don't have a soul. You /are/ a soul. You have a body.) then splitting the soul to make a horcrux is a form of suicide. Two identities exist, but neither are the original self that was torn apart to create a horcrux. So from that point, they're not a sane choice.

Of course, if you're still rooted in the idea of the body as self and the soul as an animating adjunct, then it would seem sane. Is that what you mean by materialist?
