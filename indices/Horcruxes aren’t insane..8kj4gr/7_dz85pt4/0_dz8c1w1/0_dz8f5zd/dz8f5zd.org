That's a pretty complex question - a materialist in the HP universe could plausibly come to several different answers.

Of course, in the real world, all the evidence points to the physical brain doing the thinking (including subjective experience - qualia). In the HP universe it's a bit more complicated - do ghosts and portraits "think", and is it a "soul" that does the thinking? Do dementors act on some real, magical entity called the soul, or is "eating the soul" just a fanciful/superstitious way of referring to massive, irreparable brain damage?

There are a number of possibilities:

- Pure dualism - You are your soul, the soul does the thinking and has subjective experience. It can exist without the body and can "go on" to an afterlife. (Whether the afterlife exists is actually a separate question - existence of souls does not /necessitate/ the existence of an afterlife.) What "splitting the soul" does is also a separate question - the diary (seemingly) had subjective experience, and Nagini may have, but did the locket/cup/etc? If horcruxes do have qualia, does the original qualia disappear, does it necessarily stay in the original body and the horcrux's qualia is new, or is it a SOMA-like copying where you don't know which one will be "you"?

- Souls exist but are simple magical entities, and do not think or have much to do with identity, but can magically anchor a person to life (with possible applications in healing as well as dark magic).

- Pure materialism - "souls" are nothing more than superstition, ghosts and paintings are just magical apparitions/constructs, horcruxes root or backup a person's brain in some complex way, and of /course/ anything that seems like an afterlife or a "limbo" - Harry's King's Cross - is pure hallucination. This perspective is pretty dodgy in the HPverse, but might attract cynics and muggle-raised wizards.

Canon intentionally shies away from giving conclusive answers to any of these questions, but seems to be gesturing very strongly towards pure dualism. Voldemort would /probably/ be inclined towards pure materialism, but even as a pure dualist, it's possible for him to believe horcruxes are useful.
