Agreed with the others that he's canonically an unhinged psychopath - but your points on horcruxes are spot-on. From a materialist (i.e. non-Cartesian-Dualist) point of view, horcruxes are the right* decision. Is the HP canon dualist (and in particular, does an afterlife exist that souls can travel to)? Canon presents a bunch of things - ghosts, the resurrection stone, the veil, dementors - that kinda-sorta could go either way. Certainly, for someone very paranoid and afraid of death, who might not know about the veil or resurrection stone (which doesn't even work that well), the evidence wouldn't seem very conclusive.

*^{"right decision" from a purely self-interested, strategic POV. Obviously, in a materialist universe, ensuring your own immortality using the murder of others is /ethically/ horrendous.}
