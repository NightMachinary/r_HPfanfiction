Horcruxes do not have a fully developed theory behind them, that's what makes them so fascinating to play with in fanfiction.

Same goes for Voldemort, he is the poster boy villain, I mean he even loses his good looks because he is oh-so-evil, LOL, that's a Disney fairytale right there.

Good thing we have fanfiction.
