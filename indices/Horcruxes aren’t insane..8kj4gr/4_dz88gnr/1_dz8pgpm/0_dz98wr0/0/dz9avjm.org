OP seems to be doing otherwise, though. They talk about how Voldemort's evil-ness and insanity aren't just a plot contrivance, and how there are actual motivations and reason to his character. But the canon interpretation would disagree with that, he's just evil for the sake of evil and any reasons for that are not worth talking about.
