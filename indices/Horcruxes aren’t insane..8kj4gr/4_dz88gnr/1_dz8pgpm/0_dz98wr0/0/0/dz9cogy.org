I think the two aren't mutually exclusive.

OP is trying to merge the canon interpretation of the Soul - a known and valued factor - with that of the IRL interpretation - complete lack of knowledge. This is actually accurate, and partly why I think Voldemort is deserving of his title as the worst dark wizard of the century; He does not share the wizarding viewpoint of the soul and its value. However, in learning and performing magic that involves the soul, he would have learned of its definite existence and thus its inherent, if subjective, value. He would have learned of the Dementors and the result of their Kiss, leaving a body soulless and yet still alive. He would have /known/ that a soul matters in at least one respect.

Thus, from a wizarding viewpoint, it /is/ insane to create a Horcrux. It is an extremely significant act to tear off a piece of your soul and seal it away. Almost everyone would have satisfied their fear of death with just one horcrux. Yet Voldemort did this not once, but multiple times, an act not even the creator of the Horcrux attempted. I do think that by this point Voldemort was clinically insane, his phobia so overwhelming that it drove him off the edge and damaged him beyond repair. The only way to remove a horcrux from existence, aside from complete destruction, is personal and sincere remorse. By his sixth Horcrux, Voldemort was completely incapable of that. He was no longer a human and was instead evil for evil's sake.
