Voldemort isn't insane because he made a horcrux. Horrible, evil, terrible person, yes - but not insane. He's insane because he made /six/ horcruxes. We don't know what a horcrux does to your soul aside from preventing it from passing on. No one really does. Even the creator of the Horcrux, who by all accounts was an extremely evil man and would be a role model to Voldemort, only made one. The soul is not a trivial thing. It is the very core of who you are - take it away and you're an empty husk. Carving it up like a piece of meat /can not/ be a good thing in any way, shape, or form. I would be completely unsurprised if doing so damaged him mentally and emotionally well beyond the possibility of repair.
