Mind you, I got this from Wikipedia when I Googled "religions that believe in souls." (And in the process found out about other religions)

Anyway, "Soul or psyche (Greek: "psychÄ“", of "psychein", "to breathe") are the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc."

Using this definition, it all boils down to the person deciding if the things listed above are important to him or her, if the benefits will be worth the cost.
