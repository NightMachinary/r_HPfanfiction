While, I believe that OPs point is a valid one, I also believe that Voldemort just craves power because it is offering him gratification and probably is filling some void (inability to love or something like that). But in the end that's what he wanted: full control over the other people including their thoughts, overcoming human weaknesses such as death, making his name so feared that people would not even dare pronounce it... he wanted to become a god and I think that's pretty much it. And it's not such a stretch of thought to believe that such people exist. The book "The 48 Laws of Power" is full of historical examples of real people that thought like him.

Besides Voldemort is supposed to be the opposite of Harry. Tom Riddle comes into the magical world as a nobody and is desperate for attention. Harry Potter comes into the magical world as a celebrity but does not want the fame. Voldemort gains his followers by seducing them with the idea of a world where they will be superior and then enslaving them through the dark mark, whereas Harry gains his support from people he wins over with friendship and treating them as equals. Voldemort kills others to overcome death and meets a worse fate, while Harry accepts death to save others thus returning to life.
