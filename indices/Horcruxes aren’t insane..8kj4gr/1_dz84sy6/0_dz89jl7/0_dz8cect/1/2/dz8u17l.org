There seem to have been a number of people who have made one horcrux. Read up about them, check that they didn't suffer ill-effects. If not make one horcrux. Step two, seek out other forms of immortality enhancement, preferably including a few reputable ones and use them. Have as many and varied fail-safes as possible.

However, in each case he should try to have an accomplice, someone fanatically loyal (Bellatrix would work) who can try the method first and who has been bound to silence. Observe them for signs that the methods have detrimental effects. If not pursue those methods. Preferably try to be cautious so that you don't use up the follower. Then, if you really feel the need test out the effects of multiple horcruxes on an individual and decide whether you want to endure those effects. Then consider whether you want to destroy this follower if you think they know too much (preferably you may have removed a few key pieces of information from them periodically).

If you feel uncomfortable about trusting a follower coerce a prisoner.

In any case experiment before acting and have a good excuse as to why you're immortal.

Unless you absolutely have to wage a war to take power, don't (not if your primary objective is living forever), it just incentivises people to kill you.

Edit: I thought this was a reply to a different comment, but it mostly stands. Also though, if you are waging a war make sure you have a spare identity or twenty to that you can vanish if you really need to.

Work in the Department of Mysteries and get a time-turner if possible (Voldemort must surely be able to pass their vetting process).

Make sure that horcruxes work. The problem with them is that you can't test if they work on your own.
