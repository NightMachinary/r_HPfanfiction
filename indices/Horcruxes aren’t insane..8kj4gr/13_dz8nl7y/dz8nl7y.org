He murdered people specifically to rip a part of his soul off and shove it into an object. Because he was afraid to die.

At the very least he has an irrational fear of death. I find it completely okay to call him bat-poo insane... especially if you believe in a soul in the first place (and whatever you believe they were talking about, their magic, their soul, their astral self) then he was tearing apart the thing that made him .. him..

I don't think you can tear your soul into several pieces without going insane. Whether or not he was insane before he started is of little consequence considering he was still in High School when he began.

I like a little nuance, I like a bad guy that is the hero of their own story. I like when the bad guy has a point and you grudgingly see why he does what he does. In Fanfiction I am hoping for more from Voldemort most of the time than we got in cannon.
