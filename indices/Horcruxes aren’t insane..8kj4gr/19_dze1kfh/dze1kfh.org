I agree - hell, I would probably make one if they existed and were known to work (I'd just kill some criminal or abuser for it and thus I'd even make the world a better place!)...death is just such a waste (of good people, if we could kill low lives and violent criminals in order to make good people immortal? You bet I would be totally for it!) and I agree with everybody working to "conquer" it (from people like Aubrey de Grey to guys who want to upload us to computers etc.)
