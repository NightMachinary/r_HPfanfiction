I mean, building a wall is a little bit different from murdering someone in cold blood. Plus, apparently the rest of the procedure for making a horcrux is Bad News.

I don't think anyone is calling Tom Riddle evil just for being scared of death. Horcruxes are only "logical" if you have no empathy for other people and place no value on their lives - which is what makes people call Tom Riddle evil.

I will say that of course it's more interesting to read a Tom Riddle that's more than just "crazy bad guy that's bad because bad". But it's possible to write one and also keep in mind that horcruxes are...well, not good.
