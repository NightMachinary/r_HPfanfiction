Here are some HG/SS stories I've saved, they're a variety of flavors, the summaries are vague, and I don't even remember what half of them are about, but I know I wouldn't have saved them if I didn't think they were good:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10962196/1/Mistress-of-the-Stacks][Mistress of the Stacks]]: An archaic danger is rampaging through the Hogwarts Library, and it's up to Headmaster Snape and Mistress Granger to solve the mystery in the stacks. But can they overcome their contentious history to fix the problem, or is history doomed to repeat itself? An expanded version written for Irishredlass as a part of the 2014 LJ SSHG Giftfest. Rated M for violence & adult situations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2922053/1/][Dark Angel]]: It all started with the cloaked figure in the window. From there Hermione learns there is no black and white in a war...only shades of grey and a dark angel that comes to her rescue...or does he?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4083094/1/][Requiem of a Dream]]: The war is over, though Hermione Granger's life is no less complicated or dangerous.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/The-Apprentice-and-the-Necromancer][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]]: Snape lives and marries Hermione.---MLC with a twist turns into AU-sequel of DH with new dangers, old secrets, and much more.---Virtual penny dreadful.
