Broken Mind Fractured Soul (sensiblytainted) has Mentor Snape, fighting Voldemort, and Draco/Harry friendship that develops further. It's a series that's technically complete, but the author is recently working on a next gen sequel.

When A Lioness Fights (kayly silverstorm) is Snape/Hermione. Spy fic, I rather enjoyed it, but Hermione is rather out of character until the full reasoning behind it gets explained in the story.

Not Myself (terion) has mentor/father Snape, it's a pretty decent and long AU that I enjoyed, well developed original characters, and there's friendship with Draco eventually. Complete series, sequels significantly shorter than original story.

The Last Spy (sylphides) is another Snape/Hermione spy type fic. I seem to really enjoy those Lol. Builds on a lot of characters we don't see much in canon, uses the Order in an interesting way, good original characters, and interesting uses of magic.

All if these are on fanfiction.net and things I've read or reread in the last few weeks.

Edit: heavy on possible triggers in the first one, featuring various forms of abuse of varying degrees of horrible, that get dealt with.
