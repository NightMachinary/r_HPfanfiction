Not sure if the magical world is large enough to run universities. There's only about 4000 in Europe so the entire magical population of the continent would just barely be large enough for one small magical university which wouldn't be practical due to language barriers. One-on-one apprenticeships probably make more sense when you don't have enough people interested your topic to fill a lecture hall. Doing muggle university is probably not possible.
