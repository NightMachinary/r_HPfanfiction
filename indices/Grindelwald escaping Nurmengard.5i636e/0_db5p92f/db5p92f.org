Well, I've a plot idea for a crack(y) fic starring Grindelwald. I'm planning to write it one of those days:

Red - Returned, Extremely Dangerous

Contrary to what others might have thought, he had long ago accepted his fate. For his unforgivable sins, he deserved to die in prison, despised by everyone. The things he had done, in his rage, in his hubris... it had taken him a long time to accept that he had been wrong, and even longer to come to terms with his guilt, but he had done it. Too late, far too late, but he had managed. He hadn't been able to do much but think. Think and remember.

And, all things considered, things could have been worse. His cell was not large, and certainly not comfortable - he had designed the prison for his own enemies, after all - but it was tolerable. Not that he deserved it, but his friend had been more merciful than he had deserved.

But his last, best friend was now dead. Murdered. The guards had told him. Not to taunt him, no - that sort of thing had stopped decades ago. Simply to tell him, so he'd not expect a visit. And, maybe, so he'd finally let himself die, and this shameful chapter of history could be closed.

Yet he wouldn't. Couldn't. With his friend gone, too many were left defenseless. Helpless. At the mercy of an enemy who might be worse than he had ever been. There was no one to replace his friend, no one to continue the fight, no one to stand for the cause they once had shared.

No one but him.

He knew the prison, better than anyone. He knew its weaknesses, and its guards. He had been working on a way to escape, right after he had been imprisoned. And he had continued to work on this, even after he had accepted his fate - both since there was not much else to do than plan and think, and because to stay in prison while he might escape proved, to himself, that he had changed. Had become the man he should have been, and stayed, long ago.

The man who might yet save his friend's country, and maybe atone a tiny bit for his own sins. He wouldn't be alone, he knew that. There were some of his old allies left. They hadn't found everyone. And others still remembered him fondly. Old, like him, but still dangerous. They might be misguided, had been misled, just as he had lost his way, but they would still follow him, if he called them. When he called them.

He stood up from where he had been sitting on his cot, and faced the door to his cell. He had no wand, but that was no bar to magic. Not for someone who had studied magic as he had. And had had decades to hone his skill. For a moment, he hesitated. He could still stop. Wait until he died in this cell and were reunited with his friend. He shook his head. How could he face him, knowing he could have saved his friends, but had chosen not to? Had chosen to do nothing?

It was time to do what was right, not what was easy.

It took a dozen spells to force the door open. It took just half that number to subdue the guards. And after he had picked up their wands, just one spell to blow the gates open, and leave the prison.

After decades, Gellert Grindelwald was free again. And this time, he would make Albus proud!

--------------

Notes: This is a reformed Gellert Grindelwald, breaking out of prison to continue Albus's work. Sadly, after decades in prison, with just Albus as his - rare - contact, he is more than a bit out of touch with the outside world, and has vastly underestimated the effect of his escape on Magical Europe. While Magical France is frantically mobilising its forces to defend against the invasion they expect, and Magical Prussia is torn between resurgent Grindelwald-ism and a desire to stop the madman before he plunges the continent into another war, and just about all other nearby countries are shaking in their boots, Gellert happily gathers his old Storm Wizards and other allies, and trots off to save Britain from Voldemort - whether they want to be saved or not. After all, who better than to continue Albus's fight than his oldest friend? His true love? And who better than to defeat a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one who gathered them under his banner once before? True, things went out of hand, but he has changed!

--------------

Two Snippets which probably won't make it into the story:

"Mister Potter! I've come to save Britain from Voldemort, and I certainly wouldn't be saving anything by sending children to war! No, you just stay safe while we cleanse Britain of those stains on Albus's legacy. Err... only those who do not surrender, of course."

"Nat√ºrlich!" bellowed a dozen of wizards and witches clad in black leather coats standing behind him, though Harry could see a few of them whisper to each other afterwards, and then one excused himself and hurried out of the room.

Before he could say anything though Hermione stood up, and to Harry's horror, she wore what he had dubbed her "crusader face".

"Mister Grindelwald, you cannot exclude us! Dumbledore personally selected us three for this task! There's a prophecy involved as well!"

The most feared Dark Lord of Europe blinked. "He did?"

"Yes. He even addressed us in his will."

"Oh. In that case, welcome to the Storm Wizards! Hans!"

"Hier, Kommandant Grindelwald!"

"You have three new recruits. Train them so they may fulfill Albus's last orders!"

"Jawohl!"

Hermione beamed while Ron slapped his forehead. Harry had a bad feeling about this.

Meanwhile, the other Storm Wizard who had left had returned, and more whispering followed. Harry saw a female Storm Wizard hand the man a Skele-Gro Potion before he left again.

--------------

"I'm not supporting Grindelwald blindly, Harry! Did you know that he was the first influential wizard to promote equality for muggleborns?"

"You told us so several times," Harry muttered under his breath.

"And leather coats are far more practical for fighting than robes. Sturdier too. Plus, they do look stylish!"

Harry couldn't argue that.

"And they make Malfoy wet himself."

He couldn't argue that either.

"And for jumping into things... we're just following Dumbledore's plan. You trust him, don't you?"

"Dumbledore didn't plan to take over Diagon Alley and lay siege to Gringotts!"

"Well, he wouldn't have known his friend would return. But with the Storm Wizards available, we have to adjust some of his plans."

"And looting Flourish and Blotts is also following Dumbledore's plans?"

"Don't be silly! That location was perfect for the command post. I simply evacuated the books so they'd not be damaged in the fighting."

"That's your fault, mate," Ron cut in. "If you had supported me, the command post would have been in 'Quidditch Supplies', and we'd have new brooms.

"Ron! Don't you care that we're wearing the uniform of the personal guard of the worst Dark Lord in history?" Harry stared at his best friend.

"He vowed to avenge Dumbledore's death by bringing Snape to justice, and he promised we get to watch!"

Well... Grindelwald obviously had changed for the better, Harry decided.
