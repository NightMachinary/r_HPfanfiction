I really like you premise of a Grindelweld escaping Nurmegend and trying to fulfill Dumbledore's last wishes. It would be nice to see a redemption fic amongst all the dark fics in the potter fandom we have.

Still it is even more interesting to see you incorporate those two snippets into the fic. The first one seems to be another way to help Harry improve his magic, learn from a different mentor and give Grindelweld a chance to make up for his mistakes in the past misguiding people. It would certainly make for a more proactive Year 7, where we get to see a more ferocious conflict and an organised resistance towards the Death Eaters and sets the stage for a more climatic battle at the end.

The second fic could lead for a more independent Hermione. It has been written that while Ron and Hermione do quite a bit to help out Harry over the books, it isn't really reciprocated by Harry, even if Harry has bigger burdens on his shoulders, Hermione could be energised by Grindelwald's pro-muggleborn teachings and Harry might have to figure out how to support her quest
