Damn, I cannot find it now. There was one where post War during the celebration of victory (perhaps, including Order of Merlin awards) there was a huge explosion/assassination attempt which killed the Minister Shackelbolt, Hermione, and Ron, and changed Harry into a woman. She then use acquired anonymity to basically fall into obscurity and taking care for the farm. But I cannot find it now.
