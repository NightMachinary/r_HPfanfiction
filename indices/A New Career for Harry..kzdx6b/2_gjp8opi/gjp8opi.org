The Dark Lord Indifidious (real name Albert) stared through his binoculars again.

"What is he doing?" He wondered aloud.

"Raising chickens... My lord." His chief mercenary Timothy the Unyielding (Timothy the pimply to the lads) replied.

"Yes, I can see that." The Dark Lord replied, scratching at an itchy spot on his robes. " But why?"

"I mean, he's muggle raised, right? Maybe he hankers for some KFC?"

"What in the name of the Dark Gods is a KFC?" The Dark Lord Indifidious asked.

"T's a place that sells fried chicken Milord". Timothy replied.

"Do they use fiendfyre in the cooking process?" Indifidious asked.

"Nah Milord, Olive Oil at most if you're wanting it all fancy like."

"Fascinating." The Dark Lord replied. "Let's retreat Timothy."

"As you wish Al-milord, sorry." Timothy coughed. " But why?"

"Because the man who conquered is engaged in fowl business Timothy. Best to leave him to it."

"That was an awful pun Milord."

"That's alright Timothy. Perks of being a Dark Lord."

"Is it?"

"That and some cookies. Let's go get some."

"Alright! You're the best Milord!"
