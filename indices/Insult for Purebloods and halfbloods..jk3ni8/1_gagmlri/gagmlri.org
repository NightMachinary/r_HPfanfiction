I've seen "mongrel" and "mutt" used for half-bloods but the perpetrators were still the blood purists.

Maybe muggleborns should call the purebloods 'sandwitches' because of the Muggle joke "you're so inbred that you're basically a sandwich'. No pureblood would really get it but they would still find it offensive because of the association between sand and mud and the play on word 'witch'.
