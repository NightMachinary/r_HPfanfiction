I mean, if they're British Muggleborns coming up with these, it'd probably either get really inventive or really basic swearwords that are just said in a really harsh tone. We have an odd relationship with insults and other derogatory terms - a joyously said "Hey Cunts!" is a perfectly acceptable way to greet your close, beloved friends here. And "You wanker" could be admiring or hateful depending on the tone you say it in.

If you wanted to insult a Pureblood like Malfoy, we'd probably end up with something basic like 'tosser' or 'posh twat' - just the classic cross-class insults. Don't know how we'd insult the poorer purebloods though. Chav wouldn't really fit and I can't remember any other singularly denigrating terms like that.

One genuine insult I remember quite vividly from sixth form was "You cousin-fucking Womble", the former of which could work quite well for the Purebloods as an incest-reference and the latter as an insinuation that they don't build anything themselves, only scavenge and modify the creativity of others. Whether it's true or not, the users of it who'd get challenged could just point to the Ministry entrances, the Knight Bus, the Hogwarts Express, etc. So, you could call Purebloods 'Wombles'.

If you're looking for a denigrating term for Purebloods that Muggleborns might make, we probably wouldn't be as basic or direct as 'Inbreds'. Put it this way, there's a slang term for gypsies and other itinerant groups 'Pikey'. This originated as a shortening of turnpike, which is a type of road that you'd have to pay a toll on. The term would be blatantly insulting, but derived from something indirect. Think Rhyming Slang or Six Degrees of Separation. Reference the thing that references the quality you're trying to insult. Sandwitches would probably fit that kind of pattern there.
