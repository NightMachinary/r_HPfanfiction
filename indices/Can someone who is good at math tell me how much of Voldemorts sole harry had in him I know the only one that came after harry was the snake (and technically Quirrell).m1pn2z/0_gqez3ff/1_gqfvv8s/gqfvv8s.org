I mean, it's not even clear whether it makes sense to think of fragments of the soul as being a "fraction" of the soul. Even if you are committed to thinking of it mathematically (which I am not), there are alternatives.

E.g. the set of natural numbers is infinite; the set of odd numbers is a sub-set of the set of natural numbers but also infinite. The mathematical relationship between a soul fragment and the whole soul could be like the relationship between odd numbers and the natural numbers.
