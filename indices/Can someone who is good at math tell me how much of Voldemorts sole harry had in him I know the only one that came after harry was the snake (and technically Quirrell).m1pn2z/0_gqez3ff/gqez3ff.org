I assume you mean soul rather than sole, and I don't think anyone can tell you that, no matter how good at math they are. As far as I know, the books never actually guarantee that exactly half a wizard's currently remaining soul gets placed in each horcrux object. If it's random, Harry could have ended up with over 99% of the original soul or a tiny fraction of a percent of it. If it's decided by the caster, then if I were Voldemort, I'd put the smallest piece I could into all my horcruxes because that leaves me the freedom to make more if I have to.
