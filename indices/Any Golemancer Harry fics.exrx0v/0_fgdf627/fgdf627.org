Seconded. I read one recently(ish) that felt like a crossover with Warmachine maybe? Harry had been banished to another dimension where he became a child soldier with these steampunk magic golems. Eventually he and his golems were sent back, and absolutely decimated Death Eaters. I believe it was abandoned though. I'll look through my follows/favourites and see if I saved it, but I want more.
