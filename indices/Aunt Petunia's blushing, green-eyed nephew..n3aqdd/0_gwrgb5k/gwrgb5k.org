I would check it out just for the chance of Doctor Doom getting involved.

"Igor Karkaroff was tried and found wanting. I, Doom, am now the headmaster of that quaint little school!"

"Doom does not care that Crouch went mad and disappeared. All Doom cares about is finding out why his son is disguising himself as an old friend of mine."

"A parasitic remnant dates interfere in a contest Doom is involved in??? Their Doom shall be assured. Doombots, conquer this land and bring me this so-called Dark Lord! It seems we have a volunteer."

"Doom is now caretaker of this small community. Tribute shall be offered and taxes paid to the Latverian embassy. Doom has more important matters to deal with than some provincials incapable of challenging even the weakest of heroes. Doom expects you to elect a competent caretaker for yourselves, lest Doom be forced to appoint another."
