[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][Unsphere the stars]] by cocoa artist is one of the absolute most engrossing and interesting fanfics I've ever read. It expands on the magical world, magical theory, Hermione's complexity, Dumbledore critique but not bashing, treatment of Muggles, older wizarding families before the rise of Voldemort, and turns so many things on their head. That being said, the ship is Hermione/Tom Riddle and a time traveling plot which originally made me almost skip it entirely but I'm honest that it completely took me by surprised at how rich and careful the story was. You'll speed through the 57 chapters!
