Certainly, if you haven't read, these are musts:

- go through [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]] starting with “Tales of the Battle” and continue (older stories are good as well, but the author is best in his post-War ones), and

- stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter).
