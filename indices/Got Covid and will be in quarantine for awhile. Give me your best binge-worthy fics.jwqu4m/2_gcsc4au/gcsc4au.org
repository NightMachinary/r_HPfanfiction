First of all, I wish you a quick recovery. I had it myself earlier this year and it was actually what got me back into the fandom. While I was sick, I read NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series which I really recommend since, while it's written in the same spirit as the original series, the magic is way more different and the characters are also quite likable (maybe not "the Golden Trio" level likable, but then again I didn't grow up with the ones from this series). It's seven books so should keep you busy enough. I'll post the link for the first one in case you're interested.
