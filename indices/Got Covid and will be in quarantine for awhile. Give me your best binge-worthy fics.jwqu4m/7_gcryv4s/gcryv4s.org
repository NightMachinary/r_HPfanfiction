I hope you're well and get better! Covid's sadly making everything crappy at the moment.

This fanfiction is one I quite liked when binge reading Harry/Fleur fics and the first thing that came to mind when reading your post.

Story: A Cadmean Victory [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957]]

It's, of course, a Harry/Fleur fic, though it includes it's own branch of magic and delves quite deeply within it ,which I found interesting. One of the few fics I've read that actually explains how Harry survived Voldemort. Well without the whole love thing.
