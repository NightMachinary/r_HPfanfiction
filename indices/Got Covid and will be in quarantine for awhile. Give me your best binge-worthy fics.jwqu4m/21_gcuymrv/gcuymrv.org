When Luna makes a terrible mistake and ends up in a time she never imagined she'd been in, what will happen before she gets back? And what will she do when she realizes that Tom Riddle is in her year? Rated M for language, violence, sexual content. *This story is in the process of an edit for more canon compliance & (hopefully) better writing. 12/32 chapters edited.* Sequel now up.
