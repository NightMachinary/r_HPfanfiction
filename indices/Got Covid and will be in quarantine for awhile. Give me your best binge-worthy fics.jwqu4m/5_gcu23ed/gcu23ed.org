Long fics coming right up!

linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) -- Sirius stays in Britain instead of fleeing the country after PoA and starts making moves to clear his name and get custody of Harry. Features lots of politicking and Black family drama.

linkffn(Heroes Assemble) -- Avengers crossover, Harry is in New York when the Chitauri attack and ends up joining the squad. Follows through most if not all of the MCU. (Haven't actually watched any of them myself but it seems to hit most of the key points.) Notable among Avengers crossovers (IMO) for retaining contact with the magical world instead of being a man unto himself.

linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes; Annals of Arithmancy) -- Hermione is a math prodigy and tests into Arithmancy in first year. Things snowball from there. Hermione-centric, obviously, with a large focus on spell and ritual creation with some hand-waved roots in actual mathematics such as linear equations and fractals.

linkffn(Long Live the Queen by Offsides) -- Harry petitions the Queen for help as a last-ditch effort for help with the Ministry's attempts to steamroll him at the beginning of OotP. She is not pleased when she learns of the state of the magical world. (EDIT: Bot picked up the wrong fic for this the first time around.)

linkffn(Harry Potter: The Lone Traveller; Stories of the Lone Traveler; Further Adventures of the Lone Traveler; Lone Traveler, God and Wizard) -- a /long as fuck/ series where Harry, following a botched attempt to set up a time travel fix-it scenario, ends up drifting between various universes (both HP and not) where his intervention leads to improving whatever situation he lands in. A couple of caveats: The writing quality is okay at best, the narration tends to come across as rather preachy at times (it's /very/ big on free will, and capital-G God becomes involved), and it tends to gloss over large chunks of conversation by saying what was discussed instead of actually writing dialogue. But if you're just after something long to binge on, it will suit, and it's largely episodic in format so you can easily drop it for the day and pick up later no problem. Also comes with a number of side stories that extend on scenarios already written in the main series. (EDIT: The bot only picked up on the first one in the series here, so I want to note that the rest are all by a different author, dunuelos, who picked it up.)
