Alright here's my list:

- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] by lettered). A Post-Canon Draco/Harry fic. In a potions accident, Harry is suddenly de-aged to his ten-year-old self, and with no memories of magic and Hogwarts. Draco has to deal with the consequences. 153,881 Words.
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1023625][In Care Of]] by Fang's Fawn). A Canon-Divergence Hurt/Comfort fic. In the summer before his sixth year, Snape gets into an accident in his animagus form of a bat and is nursed back to health by an unaware Harry. The Dursley's make that difficult, and Snape gets to see how spoilt Harry really is. 45,319 Words.
- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran. A Harry/Ginny Soul-Bond fic. This fic is without a doubt my favourite fanfic of not just Harry Potter, but all time. It's not technically complete, but it currently leaves off at the end of Harry and Ginny's second year, and it's a good enough ending point. The fic itself is your classic Soul-Bond story with added magic powers along with it, but its execution of telling a compelling story is just brilliant. I have physical copies of this fic for a /reason./ 629,386 Words.
- [[https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker. A Canon-Divergence Hurt/Comfort fic. Harry's life with the Dursleys' was bad, that goes without saying, but what this fic does is take a look at the possible ramifications this may have had on a developing child. While the Dursleys' treatment of Harry is not any worse than canon, the results, certainly are. If you want a cry, bing this. Don't worry, it's a happy ending at the end of it all. 316,056 Words.
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21064049][The Last Black]] by Toboe1087). A Harry Potter/My Hero Academia Crossover. Voldemort is defeated, but Harry still has to go through the aftermath of it. Including going through the Black fortune that he inherited from Sirius. There's a problem though, Harry needs the signature of the last Black alive, who just happens to be Aizawa Shouta. 93,848 Words.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] by Paimpont). A Canon-Divergent Mystery fic. Harry notices one day that the person who was before him in the Sorting in his first year, isn't at Hogwarts. He asks around, and for some reason, no one seems to remember her. What happened to Sally-Anne Perks? 36,835 Words.
- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/365648][To Recollect the Future]] by oliversnape). A Peggy-Sue Found Family fic. As Harry wakes up in the Forbidden Forest after being hit with Voldemort's Killing Curse, he finds himself in his eleven-year-old body along with Severus Snape. Harry and Severus work together to destroy the horcruxes and hopefully not kill each other in the process. 71,511 Words.
- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds The Image]] by RubbishRobots). A Doctor Who Crossover. Before Harry went to Hogwarts, Harry had an encounter with a statue of an angel that would only move when you weren't looking at it. The same statue shows up as his boggart years later, only the boggart for some reason, doesn't transform into something different when Harry leaves. You don't need to know anything about Doctor Who to enjoy this fic. 40,036 Words.
