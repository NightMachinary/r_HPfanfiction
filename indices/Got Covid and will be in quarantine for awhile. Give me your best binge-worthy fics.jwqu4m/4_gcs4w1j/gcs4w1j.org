First of all, I hope you make a full and speedy recovery.

"All According to Plan" and it's sequels are a fun a long read about a time and demenision traveling young Bellatrix who is dedicated a chaos god. The series has lots of good world building and the MC Bellatrix gets up to some rather absurd things, dragging some canon characters along for the ride. There are two complete stories in the series thus far and a third that while incomplete is already 470k words. Fair warning the authors describe themselves as "wordy bitches" and there are points where it gets a bit much.
