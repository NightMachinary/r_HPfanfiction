Although it's not cheerful in many ways (though the foregone conclusion is somewhat happy), I can't help but recommend the fanfiction classic that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] - it's Chamber of Secrets but told through Ginny's diary entries (it's been tried since by other authors but never bested). It's a slow start but it gradually descends into that's slightly uncomfortable to read but in a good way, and that will leave you hooked. Worth your time if you haven't read it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] is another one worth reading. It's got a sort of melancholy vibe to it with an open ending - the mystery is solved and understood with some lovely Dumbledore-ian wisdom but not truly ‘happy' in my opinion. Still with reading though - it's a mystery of a student that seems to have gone missing between first and fifth year with no explanation given in canon. When I've previously recommended this, someone else described it as a good fic for curling up with a hot drink while reading, and I think that's a fair summary.

Finally, on the lighter end of the spectrum, there's the wonderful [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][Pranking The Tournament]] - a decent funny read. It starts with a simple premise, namely “which school was Harry entered under into the Triwizard Tournament” and sees Harry go full Marauder in a brilliant way. Featuring gender-bending Harry, funny moments and a hilarious running gag where Harry pretends to try and seduce Draco Malfoy (it makes sense in context, trust me), it's well worth a read for anyone who wants a laugh.
