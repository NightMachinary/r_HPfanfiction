Hero's Assemble is a good story, I would've recommended that one over Post-Apocalyptic if I remembered at the time. I can totally agree with the sentiment of being amused by seeing someone with the same taste in stories.

And yeah, Post-Apocalyptic is a very strong power fantasy story, but I ended up enjoying the story for its character interactions and world-building. But I can see why people don't like it.
