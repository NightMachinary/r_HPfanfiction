[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]]- linkffn(2318355) - This is a classic story. My all time favorite because of how unique of a world that is created. Plenty of humor and fun references. The author has many other classic stories as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][Quoth the Raven, Nevermore]] - linkffn(6652537) - Here is another very unique and enjoyable story between Harry and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe]] - linkffn(13326497) - Avengers crossover that is pretty well done and has plenty of good moments between characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12772385/1/FILFY-teacher][FILFY teacher]] - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD crossover. No knowledge about the previous series is really needed. This story is not complete, but it is under regular updates. However, it is probably one of the largest fics I know currently being just under 1 million words. Lots of happy, rewarding moments, interesting characters, interesting world-building, this fic has it all.

And yeah a small but hopefully interesting list.
