Recommending Worm with a caveat---If you feel like the story is just running on Rule of Drama, and this bothers you... It probably won't improve as you go on. There were only a few cases where I thought “this is obviously just to make things worse for Taylor and/or the world in general,” and then it turned out that there was a decent explanation for it. Most of the time, if the author sees an opportunity to make things worse but has to contradict something that happened a couple hundred thousand words ago, he'll contradict it.

That said, this was a web serial that was being written on the go, with no editor, so inconsistencies like that are to be expected.
