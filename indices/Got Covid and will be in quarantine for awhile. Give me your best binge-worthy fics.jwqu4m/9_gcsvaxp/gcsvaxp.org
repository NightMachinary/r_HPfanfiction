So I am currently reading linkffn(A third path to the future by Vimesenthusiast) which is almost 2 mil words HP and Marvel cross. Not even halfway yet but it's pretty good.

Also look into anything by the author Debstheslytherinsnapefan. She has a lot of stories with 200k+. She is a very active author but I should warn you that she is mainly a Slash author. Her story linkffn(A New Place to Stay by Debstheslytherinsnapefan) is a very nice and my favorite Severitus story, which I always recommend.
