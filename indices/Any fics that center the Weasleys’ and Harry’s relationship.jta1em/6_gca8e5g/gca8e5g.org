Being taken in by the Weasleys after the Dursleys' abuse escalates is an important part of Nightmares of Futures Past. It's incomplete, though, and FFN deleted it. You can find up to chapter 42 in various places, or chapter 43 in the PDF/ebook on GitHub.

Also, linksiye(Meaning of One by Sovran) is mostly about the Weasleys coming to terms with Harry and Ginny sharing each other's thoughts and memories. I really like how its characters are more than one-dimensional. Mrs Weasley struggles the most, yet her worry always springs from genuine love - even when she makes serious mistakes. Mr Weasley is more open, yet he's unhappy about it too, just taking a less confrontational approach. Harry and Ginny are pleased with what's happened to them, but they do get things wrong, like almost incinerating Draco because they didn't know their own strength. It's an intriguing read.
