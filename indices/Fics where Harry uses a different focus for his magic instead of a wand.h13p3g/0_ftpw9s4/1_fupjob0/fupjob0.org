You just put the story ID (in this case, 689909) from the URL and put it after either linkao3 (if it's on [[https://archiveofourown.org][archiveofourown.org]]) or linkffn (if it's on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]). You can also just out the story name instead of the ID and that should work, especially if you also use the Author name.
