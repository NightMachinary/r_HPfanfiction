  It's like the reason they write fics about it isn't because they want to add more to the story or to change details to make new ideas, but instead to show exactly how they think it should have gone.

That's really not the same as hate, and frankly there wouldn't be much fanfiction if people weren't trying to tweak the original to improve it (at least in their minds). There's a very, very limited scope for sticking rigidly to canon and doing nothing but adding little bits like decorations.

Are the "Percy Jackson" stories evidence that Rick Riordan hates Greek mythology? Not at all; if anything, they are a sign that he loves the source material. If he didn't, why would he spend so much time working with it?

The same is true of much of the AU fanfiction, whatever the fandom. Taking the source material and doing new things with it is a sign that the author likes it a lot, even if they disagree with some of what JKR did with it.

What's more, I would argue that it is only /flawed/ source material (self-contradictory, incomplete, vague, etc.) that is suited to such work. If it were all complete and perfect, there would be nothing anyone else could do with it - nothing to add, nothing to improve. JKR's works are flawed in many ways. Those flaws give us readers more to think about and debate. Those flaws inspire some of us to become writers to rework the material into new forms.
