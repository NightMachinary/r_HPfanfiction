I like the canon, but I have a dismal view of the British wizarding world. It needs a thorough cleansing in the style of French revolution. If Harry and Co can't fix it soon, the muggles will gain so much power in a few decades that when the statute of secrecy finally breaks down, the magicals will pay a horrendous price.
