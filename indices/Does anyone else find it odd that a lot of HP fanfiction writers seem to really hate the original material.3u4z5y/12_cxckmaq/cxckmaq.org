We nitpick the things we love.

If they hated HP, they simply wouldn't write about it.

If HP was perfect, they wouldn't know what to write.

But HP is a giant, open, complicated, weird world. It has a lot of "cracks." Those cracks are where fan fiction flourishes.

Note that cracks don't make it bad. They're just concepts that were undeveloped, or choices that weren't explored due to plot purposes.
