Oh yeah, I hate those too. Usually though, the ones with the sprawling profiles about why the canon pairings are bad and Dumbledore is worse than Hitlermort aren't the ones writing the fics worth reading. Your post seemed to extend that to just simply all authors who write wildly non-canon fics, which I had a problem with.
