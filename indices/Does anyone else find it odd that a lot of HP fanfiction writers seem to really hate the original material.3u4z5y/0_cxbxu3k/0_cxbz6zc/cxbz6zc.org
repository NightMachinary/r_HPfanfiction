Yeah, but as someone who reads fanfiction profiles a lot, I've seen a countless amount of authors spend so much time ranting about the tons of things they hate in the HPverse. It's not really surprising, considering all the bashing, but you start to wonder why they don't just go and write fanfiction for something that they enjoy overall.
