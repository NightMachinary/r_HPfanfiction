I'm kind of what you describe. Not as bad as what Pashow is talking about with the whole Hitlermort stuff, but I do genuinely dislike so much about the HP universe.

The reason why I write fanfic for it though, is because of my love for the idea, the concept. Not just the idea for the plot as a whole, but all the little things from minor characters to the different branches and disciplines in magic.

Essentially, I write HP fanfic because I feel HP could have objectively been so amazing, and it would hurt me more to not try write what I personally consider to be better, than to complain about it and do nothing.
