I don't really think that writing a fic that is almost unrecognizable from the source material necessarily indicates that the writers didn't like the source material.

I mean, if the implication is that someone like joe6991, who wrote linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) doesn't like the original material because his fic is essentially HP in name only (and it's freaking awesome) then I would think that he would just not have written it.

There's this strange trend I've noticed, where people seem to discard stories that veer too far away from canon. I come from the opposite camp--I read canon and loved it, and it inspired me, but I don't feel like reading it again. The more inventive and different a fic can be, while maintaining the essence of the characters and themes that I loved from the original, the better.
