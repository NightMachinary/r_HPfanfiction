I see what you mean - I stick rigidly to canon ad prefer to only read canon stories for the same reason. I want it to be recognisable, I like the familiarity. And I think when it ends up slipping into character bashing, it feels like a criticism of Rowling, which I know is not always the case, but it can feel that way.

That being said, I can see why people want to play with the world a bit more. The horrible cliches and repeated storylines in a lot of 'canon' fics probably result in some very bored readers, and fanfiction allows you to try out new ideas and concepts that might seem ridiculous. I know how frustrating it is to have an idea and not be able to write it, so it's no wonder people end up writing fics that only have a very slight resemblance to the original series.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
