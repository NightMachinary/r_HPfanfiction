Ah. JKR didn't think it was going to be a younger kids book, at least, not entirely - the plot for the end of the series was very obviously planned out (and very obviously /not/-kid-friendly). I think the first three books were extraneous -- that is to say, they were deliberately used to establish a loyal, young fan-base, and to elaborate on the world just enough to get people invested. You can tell, for instance, that a lot of the elements that would define her later books were only introduced following or during the fourth book. Harry's character arc (including the canon pairing) was only really determined by the fifth book onwards.

These are just the things I've noticed. That being said, your point is very valid in that she never elaborated more than possible. As episodic as it seems, it's more like there's one episode per book rather than one episode per chapter - consistency and scale are determined around that. So the books have never had a focus on the everyday or creating a new status quo (at least, not a status quo based on daily life).
