Yeah, this can be the reasoning of a lot of people. Sometimes it's valid, sometimes it's not. At least they're trying to "fix" it and not just saying LOL this sux. Better something than nothing, even if that something is crap.

Personally, I'm so glad JKR wrote what she did, as well as how she did it. The Potterverse is large and amazing and open-ended. But I also have a problem with how she wrote it, namely it being so open-ended. The more I reflect on it, and talk with other people, the more it seems like JKR did only what was necessary to advance the plot, and no more. She didn't try to world build more than necessary, she didn't try to flesh out the magic system into something more, well, systematic. I can understand why the there /are/ holes and problems; she didn't expect it to be so popular, and it was only meant to be a younger kids' book at most. But it still seems lacking in a lot of areas, no matter how great what she actually wrote was.

That's my problem with it, at least. She did a lot, but she could have done so much more. Maybe she didn't enjoy it enough? Who knows.
