I've had people ask me if I hate canon because I exclusively write AUs.

It's literally the /complete/ opposite. I /love/ the books. They taught me (or, well, reading them taught me, as bizarre as this is going to sound) to speak, read, and write three languages and shaped my love for fantasy. I don't think there's much I can add to them - I don't really think there's anything at all - within the confines of what happened there.

My AUs are not written to try to 'fix' canon, or to 'show exactly how I think it should have gone'. My AUs are just what happens when I look at a pivotal moment in the books and ask myself "Hey, I wonder what would happen if....?"
