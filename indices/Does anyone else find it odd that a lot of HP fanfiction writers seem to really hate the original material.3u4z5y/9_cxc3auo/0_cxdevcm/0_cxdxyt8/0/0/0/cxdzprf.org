Mostly, yes. But we should remember that the series is mostly from the point of view of teenagers. A certain amount of guidance is required for most teenagers, and when attempting to execute a plan that prevents Wizard Worse-than-Hitler from winning, a certain amount of manipulation is perfectly excusable. Does Dumbledore go too far? Probably. But more importantly, he goes too far for fairly good reasons - protecting innocence of Harry/etc., protecting the entire nation of Wizarding Britain, attempting to redeem Snape/Draco/etc.
