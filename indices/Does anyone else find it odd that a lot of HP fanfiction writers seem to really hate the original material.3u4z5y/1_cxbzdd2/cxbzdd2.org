This can be true, but it's not unique to HP. A lot of fanfiction writers for all fandoms are inspired by the thought of, "This was good and I like it, but here's what I think could be improved." It's not so much a hatred as criticism, a way to say, "Hey, nice idea! But look, what if we did this or that instead..." which personally I don't necessarily see as bad.
