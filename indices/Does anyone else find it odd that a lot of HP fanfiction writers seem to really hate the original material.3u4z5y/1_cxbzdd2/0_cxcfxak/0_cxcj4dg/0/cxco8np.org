True, there is that as well. But there are some things which I think are so good that I don't mind revisiting them. I've not ready many books that qualify, but I've seen quite a few films that do.

Moonrise Kingdom, Peter Pan, The Lion King, Titanic.

Those are just some of the movies I've seen more than 10 times on their own. Do you have any movies or books that fall into that category, or does your rule apply to all that you've seen or read?
