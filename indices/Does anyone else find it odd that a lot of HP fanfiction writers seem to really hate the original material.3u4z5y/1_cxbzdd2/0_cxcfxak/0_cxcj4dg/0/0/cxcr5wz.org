Oh, I definitely have favorites of my own, but I'll be honest here. I haven't read /anything/ other than fanfiction for the past year. No hardbacks, no paperbacks, nothing but fanfiction. I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. It's like having my own personal library on my favorite subject.

To answer though, How To Train Your Dragon the movie, and the Provost Guard trilogy by Tamora Pierce are two that I will watch and read over and over again with pleasure.
