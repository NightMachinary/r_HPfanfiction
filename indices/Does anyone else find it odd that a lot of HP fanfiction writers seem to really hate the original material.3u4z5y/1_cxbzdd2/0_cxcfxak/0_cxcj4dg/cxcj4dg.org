#+begin_quote
  I can re-read my favorite parts, sure, but as complete texts I can't stand the original books anymore. That sounds to me a lot like hatred.

This is true for me as well, but in my case it's not hatred, it's just that I'm a novelty junkie. Why reread something I already remember when there's /so much more/ out there that I've never read? I can't stand rereading canon because I'm just fidgeting and going "yeah, yeah, I know this already, get on with it."
