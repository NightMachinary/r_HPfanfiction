I don't know. Personally I think hatred and criticism are very much intertwined.

On the one hand, I consider myself to be a lover of HP fanfic, and I certainly enjoyed the HP films and books (though to a lesser extent) the first time round, I can't stand them anymore. I can re-read my favorite parts, sure, but as complete texts I can't stand the original books anymore. That sounds to me a lot like hatred.

But in the same breath I can see that they are objectively reasonably good. There are positive and negative aspects to how they were written, and a lot of what I look for in fanfiction is based on a desire to weed out the bad and improve upon it. This seems to me like criticism.

So... I can't really remember what my point was. But I both hate, love, and criticize the original HPverse.
