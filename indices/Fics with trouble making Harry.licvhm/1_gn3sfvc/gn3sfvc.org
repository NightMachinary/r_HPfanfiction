*/That Universe Over There/* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959/chapters/56911591]]) show not Harry being a trouble-maker but his younger, female counterpart/adoptive daughter Ivy (it's time/dimension travel) being a trouble-maker.

*/Potter Club/* linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11987060/1/Potter-Club]]) I guess that would also fit. Harry travel back in time (accidently I think) and since it would be very boring to repeat all of your education at Hogwarts when you already know everything, Harry decide to cause trouble by founding a pranking organisation named Potter Club.
