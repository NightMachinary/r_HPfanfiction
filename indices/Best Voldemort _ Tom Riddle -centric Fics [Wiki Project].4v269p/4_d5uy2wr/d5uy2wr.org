Twelve Dark Moons

Genre: Drama

Link: linkffn(3037156)

Status: Complete

Thoughts about it: The characterization of Luna, which is really hard to do is really on point (Except for some seer stuff). It was posted before the publication of DH so the ideas about Horcruxes are slightly wrong but it can be forgiven.
