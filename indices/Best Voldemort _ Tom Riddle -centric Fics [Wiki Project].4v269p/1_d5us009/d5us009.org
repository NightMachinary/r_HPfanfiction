*Yes, I am Harry's Brother*

*Genre:* Drama, Horror, Adventure, Action

*Link:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/][Here]]

*Status:* Complete.

*Thoughts About It:* It's LV/Tonks, but she doesn't know it. I don't think LV is in character, but his personality and ruthlessness is there. It's pretty good, all in all. Has a satisfying plot and ending.
