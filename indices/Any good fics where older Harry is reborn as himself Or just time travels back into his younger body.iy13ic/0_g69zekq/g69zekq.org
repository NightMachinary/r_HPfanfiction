  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  While returning to his past has been more of a challenge than Harry expected, he has still managed to find time to make sure his young friends are looked after. But Harry is beginning to realise that juggling his past and his future is more difficult than he expected, and controlling the timeline is more complicated than he thought.Sequel to Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
