you're expressing some of the reasons I find the concept interesting. Harry would temper Draco's bigotry because he's never had a friend who would stand up to him and challenge his way of thinking. But he'd be drawn to the fame that is Harry Freaking Potter. So I think we'd see a more quick turn against the darkness.

Also having harry so close to dark wizards would be crazy interesting.
