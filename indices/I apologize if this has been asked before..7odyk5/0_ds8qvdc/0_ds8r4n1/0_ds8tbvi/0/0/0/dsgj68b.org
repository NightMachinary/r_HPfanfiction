You remarry think someone of “lesser wizard if blood” could influence Draco? Harry is of mixed parentage but he has the celebrity to wear Draco down. Even in canon we see hints of his not being a complete piece of shit.

However Dethryl has written a rather complete work that I'm two books into and thoroughly enjoying.
