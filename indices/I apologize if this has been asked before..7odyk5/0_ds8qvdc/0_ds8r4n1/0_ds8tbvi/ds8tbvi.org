The problem with such a premise is that either it has a massive impact and the plot diverges from the stations of canon or it is just a canon rehash with Draco along. Draco might be able to substitute Ron's part in the trio but then you have a Harry, Hermione and Draco trio which is a recipe for disaster. Remeber that Draco called for racial purges at twelve. Just how would they get along? Either you have to replace Hermione as well or you have to remove the bigotry which makes Draco Draco.
