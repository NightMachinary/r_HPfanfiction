linkffn(7659033) The they shook hands series does that. Its in sixth year at the moment and updates quite slow. But to be clear, Harry and Draco both influence each other. And them becoming friends influences Harrys perception of a lot of things. For example Harry gets along with multiple people he hated in canon even when they have the same personalities because they treat him differently.
