Canon compliant is really broad! To me those fall into a couple different categories. You could have fics that continue off from where the seventh book ends, like fics that explore the world directly after Voldemort's fall. For that a lot of people recommend linkffn(the first day by little0bird). (A lot of that author's fics are canon compliant, actually.) Or you could read fics that do Potter/Weasley family dynamics since canon gives us all the kids' names and such. Or you could have "missing moments" fics, since in canon we only get the story from Harry's point of view. My favorite from this category explore what was happening at Hogwarts while Harry was away. I'd recommend linkffn(a call to arms by mydearprofessormcgonagall) and linkffn(not from others) for that. Background of other characters can totally fall into canon, like linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky). Are there any particular characters/scenarios you want to read about?
