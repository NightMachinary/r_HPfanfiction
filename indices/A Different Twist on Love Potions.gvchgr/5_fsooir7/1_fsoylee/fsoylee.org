  Merope Gaunt contradicts this when she clearly rapes Tom Riddle in canon. Repeatedly.

You say this like a rapist can't use viagra and people can't take roofies/other date-rape drugs for consensual recreational use.

Are you gonna call someone who takes Rohypnol for fun a rapist because it's a date-rape drug? No, that'd be silly, so the same could apply to love potions.
