This is a bit like concluding the purpose of rat poison is to murder family members from encountering one incident where this is true.

Now, I'm entirely willing to believe ideas like "Wizarding Britain is a complete dystopia" or "prolonged exposure to magic destroys one's moral compass" but I really have to ask what the intended purpose of love potions is even so. There are clearly standards of right and wrong in wizarding Britain (even if they might be orthogonal to ours) so how do love potions fit in with this?

Here's what I remember as being canon:

- they're marketed to girls in a joke shop (OTOH that joke shop produces all sorts of different kinds of products, not just jokes)
- they're seen as girly (that Mrs Weasley quote)
- Amortentia is talked about in school with specific attention being drawn to what the pupil smells in it (are they learning a basic detection method???)
- Slughorn expects that Harry should be able to whip up an antidote (implying graduated wizards ought to be able to cure themselves?)
- there are different power levels to love potions but even the strongest just create an intense infatuation (what do the weak ones do?)
- Merope uses a powerful one to trap Tom Riddle snr for months/years (and this is telegraphed as being wrong... although not as being wrong because it's rape)
- Merope stops using the potion for whatever reason and Dumbledore speculates that she might have imagined Riddle would stay after all (which, if there's a basis for that speculation, honestly makes them even worse than usually presented in fanfci)
- they can be hidden in chocolates (again, rather insidious)
- (if we count it as canon) Queenie's use of a love potion on her boyfriend is presented as being wrong but not an overly big deal (suggesting that within relationship use isn't seen in the same light as Merope's usage???)

And I think these bits are also canon:

- the aforementioned joke shop helps smuggle love potions into Hogwarts (potentially indicating that they're banned at Hogwarts and that they're seen as just another harmless joke)
- they get stronger after they expire (suggesting that there is an intended consumption period in much the same way eating a chicken you've left on a bench for 24 hours is a bad idea)

It seems to me that while we can't be sure what exactly love potions are meant to do and that people acknowledge Merope style dosing as a possibility, that it's pretty clear that their purpose is not magical roofies.

I think it's entirely likely that the main purpose of love potions is recreational between consenting partners... and that somewhat amoral characters like the Weasley twins as business owners (I mean, they sell Peruvian Darkness powder to anyone) /might/ be encouraging people to dose others unsuspectingly. I also like to imagine that love potions have a bit of a beer goggles or even a Love Potion Number 9 outcome... they're used by shy people on themselves with no intended target.

If all they are is magical roofies, I just can't see why they exist in canon when every use of them as a roofie is framed negatively (albeit not as rape). Especially in a society where the major known function of every aspect of wizarding government we meet is regulatory or organising sports events.
