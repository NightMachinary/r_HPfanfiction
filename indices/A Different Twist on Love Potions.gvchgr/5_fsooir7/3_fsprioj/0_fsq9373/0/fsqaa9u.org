The point is that there's nothing accidental about /this/ specific incident. When we see love potions used in the books, we see their use negatively. That's not a fan created interpretation but an engendered one. This creates the question, "Why are these allowed and sold to, it seems, anyone but Ginny by major characters, when they're presented as problematic?"

Your examples consist entirely of things Rowling did not or does not see as being problems. They're not at all equivalent.
