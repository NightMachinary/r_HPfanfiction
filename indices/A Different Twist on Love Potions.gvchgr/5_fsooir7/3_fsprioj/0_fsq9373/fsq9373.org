If you think that this is the biggest issue with the world building... We are talking about the woman who put the only magical school for Asia into Japan, a country with a deeply ingrained sense of racial superiority and a very troubled history with its neighbours, to put it mildly. Hell, her world building barely works for the Isles and the Iberian peninsula. France already comes with the issues of Alsace Lorraine and Savoy.

To accidentally write magical roofies in and then forget about it, well it wouldn't be surprising since her prologue already has Harry and Hagrid disappear for a day.
