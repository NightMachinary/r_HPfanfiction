I completely agree with you. But most people still think of her as a "poor weak woman". Just imagine if it was a man who would have done that to a woman? Gosh. Rowling's book wouldn't have made it past the editor's first read. The people in the comments defending this clearly shows they have something sick in their minds.

My biggest peeve with Rowling's writing in canon is that women can do no wrong. It's okay for hermione to physically assault ron but not for ron to call her a freaking nightmare which she honestly was at that age. Bloody ridiculous. Rant over.
