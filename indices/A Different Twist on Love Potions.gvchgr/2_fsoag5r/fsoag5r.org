This makes a lot of sense to me. The only two times I can remember love potions playing a role in the canon plot is with Ron being dosed; directly leading to the discovery of another assassination attempt on Dumbledore; and in the distant past, with Merope Gaunt using them to sire Tom Riddle Junior. The contrast between these two instances; one a blatant attempt to trick someone into romance, and the other long-term sexual and emotional abuse; and the fact that they're sold in stores in-universe begs the question of what their legal use is. The idea that struggling or arranged marriages can use it to improve their relationship seems logical and likely to me.
