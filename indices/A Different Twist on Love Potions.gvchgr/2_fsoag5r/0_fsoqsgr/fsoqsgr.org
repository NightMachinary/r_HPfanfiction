Is it not canon that Molly was familiar with love potions and brewed them? And why brew if not to use? Molly is held up as the exemplar of The Good Wife and Mother of the wizarding world, and even she seemed totally blase about love potions. It's been commented a zillion times that Rowling's Wizarding World seems 100% a-okay with rape as long as it's chemically-induced, but it seems a bit much to brush the issue off as just Ron getting dosed (played for laughs) and Riddle Sr. getting dosed (played for horror) as the end of the issue.
