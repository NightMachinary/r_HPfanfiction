Also, love potions can never create love according to the books. They do make you very gushy and affectionate and full of nerves and butterflies though, judging by Ron in HBP. Love, in my opinion, is the comfort, the care and the respect you get behind the attraction instead (although some would disagree). I think love potions could definitely recreate the infatuation stage and would love to see a spin on it!
