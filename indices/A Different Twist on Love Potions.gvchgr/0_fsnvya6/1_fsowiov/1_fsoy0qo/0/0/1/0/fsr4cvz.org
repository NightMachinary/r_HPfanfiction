At face value, sure - it does look problematic on JKR's part. But I think that the conclusion of victim of rape --> bad person really wasn't the whole of what she wrote - the story of Tom Riddle becoming evil is one of a brilliant child born to a loveless union, raised in an orphanage without love, and never being given love even once throughout his formative teenage years.

It's a tragic story, and reducing it all to the circumstance of his birth diminishes the effect of the rest of his equally awful life on his character. And in any case, the whole point of the story is that Harry had the same upbringing but found support - I think that symbolism is more powerful, personally.
