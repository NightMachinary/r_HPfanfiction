A headcanon of mine is that the reason love potions aren't really frowned upon in the Wizarding World is arranged marriages. There's 3 important parts to a perfect marriage: implicit complete trust, compatible chemistry and passion. A well-arranged match can fit the first 2, but you can't choose who you fall in love with -- that part is a crapshoot. I can see Wix self-medicate on love potions to remedy that part of it.

Now, let me be clear: I still consider love potions in general immoral. I'm merely giving my headcanon of why they aren't illegal in Wizarding Britain.
