Love potions you knowingly give to yourself are fine (as long as you aren't being coerced), love potions you slip to somebody else are 99.999% not fine. The only scenario I could see not being horrifically unethical for that is something weak and short-term, less "I love this person and will do anything for them" and more "oh hey, they're cute...".
