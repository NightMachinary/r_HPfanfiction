[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts Redux]]

there would be this one.. it is mostly Harry-Daphne focussed but there is a scene where Ginny takes a love potion to marry some one else than Harry cause she is still not over him.. it is not Draco though and as far as I could discern she was not forced into the marriage. It is only one scene though and not really explored further
