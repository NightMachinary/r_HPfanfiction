First of al, I'd like to say that my first reaction is to agree with you. However, there's an entire industry - from which this is nearly no different - which no one complains about, at least to my knowledge.

What about artists who draw paid commissions based off of existing characters? Isn't that nearly an identical problem?

I think what it comes down to is Fair Use. It'd be simple to argue that writing fanfiction falls under it, given that in most cases it's entirely transformative or parody. Making money from Fair Use is legal.

I'm not sure, exactly, what my final thoughts are on this, but I'd be open to the conversation.
