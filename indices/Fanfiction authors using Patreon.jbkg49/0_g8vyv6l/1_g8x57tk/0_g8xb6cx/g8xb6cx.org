The author would upload their fanfic along with their original content. They'd say something about the FF being a side project and they just wanted to show what else they're doing, but the OC is what subscribers are really paying for. They'll point to the fact that their FF is free on another site and all the subscribers get is access to a chapter or 2 early or something.

What worries me is that fan artists are all over Patreon and make money off that. In terms of copyright, is there really a difference? I dunno, I'm not a copyright lawyer, but the sale of fanart has always seemed like one of those things that gets ignored because it's not worth it. Possibly paid access to fanfic will be the same. Maybe not. Maybe Patreon will have to start shutting down fanfics, and they'll come down on fanart as well.
