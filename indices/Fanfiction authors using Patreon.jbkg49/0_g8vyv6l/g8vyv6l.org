Honestly, this kind of thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I think it's generally accepted that expecting people to pay for fanfiction is a no-no. This may not have resulted in much in the way of legal action, outside of some cases where people actually published their fanfiction in honest-to-goodness ink-and-paper format, but there's no real difference between a writer attempting to publish their fanfic on Amazon self publishing, and locking it behind a paywall on Patreon.

Except of course, for the time being at least, Cadmean Victory is not behind the paywall. It's publicly available, and if you do buy into the Patreon supporter levels, you're actually just getting access to the author's original works.

Really, though? The only real content on The Blank Canvas Patreon page is the rewrite of Cadmean Victory, and it has six subs already. It's pretty obviously a case of '/this/ isn't what you're paying for, nudge nudge, wink wink.'

If I went out and started posting all future story updates to Patreon alone (but completely 'free'!), but added some paid tiers to get exclusive, world-first access to random badger pictures I found on the internet, it would be pretty transparent that what is being paid for is /not/ really the badgers.

It seems to me like they think they've found a loop-hole, and honestly, they'll probably make some money from it. It's very unlikely that they'll see any legal ramifications, but if this kind of behaviour became commonplace, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the coy, 'oh, but I thought they were just paying for something /else/ on this page covered in buttons to give me money, I swear!' fall apart completely under legal scrutiny.

I know people like to feel like they're giving back to the writers that spend so much time creating stories, but in the long run I really do think it is likely to do more harm than good.

If you absolutely /must/ show your appreciation, I'd much rather you donated that money to your favoured charity. Send me a screen shot if you like. That would make me feel /much/ better than something like Patreon.
