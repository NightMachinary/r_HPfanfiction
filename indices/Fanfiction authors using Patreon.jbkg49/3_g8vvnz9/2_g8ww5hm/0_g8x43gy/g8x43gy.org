Of course Patreon is supportive of it! They make money by taking a % of what the Patreon owner gets (ie. they are also making money from fanfiction posted on their site). The last thing they want is to discourage anybody from giving them money. They cover themselves legally by saying "we'll take it down if the author objects" and moral issues are irrelevant to them.
