I don't mind it. I'd even consider contributing if I loved the fic. JK is set for life from Harry Potter. I have no moral qualms with supporting value added work from people who write original stories based off her characters.

Plus, I take issue with people in similar situations thinking this is somehow harming Warner Bros ip and copyright. It's not a sum zero game. Me being entertained by a fanfic and paying the author for writing it doesn't make me less likely to go buy canon HP stuff. In fact, I'd say the fanfiction content in Harry Potter is what has kept me coming back to the series, buying the books, watching the movies, etc... good fanfics are good for JK & WB's bottomline.
