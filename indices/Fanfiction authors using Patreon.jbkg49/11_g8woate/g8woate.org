Oh come on. It's not like they're actually buying the fanfic. They're just supporting someone creating content they appreciate.

I know one dude who created merchandise off his fanfic though. And (it was a Naruto fanfic) he started taking payments for a manga adaptation he made himself. This is completely different to someone who already posted the entire story for free.
