It's shitty practice but until they are paywalling fanfictions on their Patreons nothing really can be done.

There are a lot of fan fiction writers that are making thousand dollars a month there. I know lots of talented authors who are writing their own works and don't make even half of that amount.

It's the same with fan art really. You can find dozens of 3D creators that are making tens of thousands dollars a month by leeching out of the work of someone else and paywalling their works without shame. I think it can really happen in fan fiction too. Two or three years ago nobody would even thought about asking for money for writing fan fiction (at least I didn't notice at that time). Nowadays a lot of authors have their own Patreons.
