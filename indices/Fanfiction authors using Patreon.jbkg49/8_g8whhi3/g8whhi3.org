I know some writers who have like, koffee (I can't remember how it's spelled) or patreon because they're struggling moms or something, and their readers know they have like, hospital bills and stuff to pay, the stress of which pulls them away from their keyboard and writing, and these people just wanted to be able to give them a buck or two every month to help them out; but their fic is always freely available on ao3, tumblr and ffnet, and the most the â€˜patrons' got was some gossip; or previews; or maybe they got to read the latest chapter a day earlier; or maybe they were able to submit prompts or something, you know?

Those were truly generally small donations that people wanted to give, and they decided they needed that help and felt ethically comfortable accepting it; and you know, these people weren't just working on one long fic, but were those people who contributed a lot to the fandom as a community, not just writing fics.

But the problem I have a big issue with is when someone takes their fic off the free sites and puts it behind a pay wall. Like I'd almost prefer to just buy the story off of amazon for a once off payment of three dollars or whatever rather than be subscribed to a patreon, just so I can see updates.
