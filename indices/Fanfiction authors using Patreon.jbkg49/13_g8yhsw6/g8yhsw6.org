I agree that it is off putting, but probably not for the reason you'd think. I write on ffnet for a bunch of reasons (Shaydrall, if you're curious), but if I have a better version of my work I want people to see it /there./ You know, where the insanely huge reader base lives that actually reads my work each day. The hassle of going from the ffnet format in reading to what effectively becomes a blog post isn't really appealing, and even the idea of someone trying to take advantage of readers in any way is a huge turn off for practically everyone.

Editing your stuff is natural, but it just feels like he's hiding it? Is the scant few more hits to a Patreon page really worth what would effectively be tens of thousands of people not getting the chance to see your perfected work?
