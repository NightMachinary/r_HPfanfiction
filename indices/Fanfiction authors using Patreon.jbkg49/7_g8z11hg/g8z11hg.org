Putting any legality aside, so many of my daily entertainments come from similar things that I wouldn't really want to advocate for a world where people can't support someone for creating something fun for their use.

Reaction videos and fan arts are already heavily monetized and I won't feel right singling out fanfiction authors as the ones that can't get anything for their work. Especially since I consider them to be far more hard working and imaginative than reactors or fan artists.
