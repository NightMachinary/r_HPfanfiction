I just wanna say that there's content posted two months ago by him that's now under a paywall. 2 months. And his answer is to wait for the chapters to catch up. It's ridiculous and immoral. He I barely even defends it, saying he only cares about the people helping the community. Except there isn't really any community and it's just one guys ego trip as he charges money from people wanting to learn to write or just read the bloody story. I used to be a huge fan and loved the original story. But it's really soured me on him, especially as he just doesn't care about his fans, just about making money. It's against the spirit of fan fiction. Fan art is something I've never thought about so I won't comment, I'd just embarrass myself.

But his predatory, blackmailing and greedy practices are indefensible and keeping your work hostage is over the line. I'm not gonna wait two months and then read a couple of chapters, but he doesn't even care what people in my position think because we aren't putting money in his pocket. He's safe from copyright unless JKR comes after him and he doesn't care about the fans, leaving him totally able to act in a way against the whole ethos of fan fiction.

Christ. I've been a fan since before the original was finished and this honestly hurts, which makes me feel dumb cause I know he has no obligation to care but fanfics aren't supposed to be like the big corporations. He's supposed to care and doesn't.
